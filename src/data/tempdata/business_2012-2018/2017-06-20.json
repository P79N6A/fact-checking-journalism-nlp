      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s manufacturing industry could be poised for recovery, according to a new report, which says the sector is enjoying its largest improvement in employment conditions in a decade. It says Australian manufacturing jobs have swelled by 40,000 in the past 12 months \u2013 the second-largest number of new jobs created in any industry \u2013 and productivity has returned to near its previous peak. At the same time, a new poll has found a majority of voters reject the idea that manufacturing is an outdated industry that will inevitably continue to shrink in Australia. It found more than two-thirds of Australians reject the idea that government support for manufacturing is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. The report, Manufacturing: A Moment of Opportunity, has been prepared by the Centre for Future Work, part of the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute. It has been released to coincide with the National Manufacturing Summit: From Opportunity to Action, hosted by the two organisations at Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday. The report says several economic indicators suggest Australian manufacturing may be poised for recovery. It says since 2008, the manufacturing sector\u2019s real output has declined by 13% (compared to its pre-financial crisis peak), and employment by a similar proportion, but the industry appears to have stabilised, and it remains one of Australia\u2019s most important. In the past 12 months, trend employment data from the Bureau of Statistics show there has been an increase of 40,000 manufacturing jobs, surpassed only by public administration and safety jobs (80,000 new positions). The report says profit margins for Australian manufacturers were hammered during the GFC, with the soaring currency doing major damage to the sector, but since 2014, profits have begun to regain some of the lost ground. Quarterly gross operating profits reached nearly $8bn in the March quarter, the highest in several years, which may soon encourage future increases in capital spending and more hiring. The report says the value of Australian-made manufactures sold to international markets has also grown dramatically in recent years, from a low of $80bn in 2009 to a record high of more than $100bn in the past 12 months. Recent data also indicate the sector allocates almost 5% of its sector value-added to new R&amp;D expenditure, more than any other sector - including the scientific and professional services sectors. The report argues this presents an important political opening for leaders from all parties to recommit to manufacturing, and grant the sector greater priority in economic policy-making. \u201cThere is more economic space than at any time in recent years to expand investment, production, and employment in value-added manufacturing,\u201d the report says. \u201cAnd the public will support active measures that are consistent with this goal.\u201d The Australia Institute\u2019s Centre for Future Work also conducted a nationally representative poll of 1,408 people \u2013 between 26 April and 5 May \u2013 regarding their views about manufacturing in Australia. It found that despite low levels of understanding of the importance of manufacturing to Australia\u2019s economy at the moment, there is wide support for manufacturing across all age and voting groups. Manufacturing employs 915,000 people in Australia, making it the sixth-largest employer by industry in Australia, accounting for around 8% of all employment. But when asked to name the largest employer out of manufacturing (915,000 jobs), public administration, defence and the law (828,000 jobs), banking and financial services (433,600 jobs), wholesale trade (376,400 jobs), agriculture (293,100 jobs), and mining (240,800 jobs), only 10% of respondents correctly picked manufacturing. Most respondents (38%) thought public administration, defence and the law was the biggest employer, while more respondents chose mining (13%) and finance (11%) than the correct answer. \u201cThe importance of manufacturing jobs appears to be widely underappreciated among Australians, perhaps because of the steady stream of negative headlines that have dominated most news about the sector in recent years,\u201d the report says. However, there was widespread support for the view that manufacturing exports are important for Australia\u2019s economy, with 76% agreeing or strongly agreeing that success in global trade requires strong manufacturing exports, and 71% agreeing or strongly agreeing it was better to add value to natural resources through manufacturing than to export raw commodities. Earlier in the week the governor of the Reserve Bank called on workers to start demanding large pay rises from their bosses. Philip Lowe said Australia\u2019s economy was suffering a \u201ccrisis\u201d in wage growth, and workers ought to realise the relatively low unemployment rate meant they could start asking for a larger share of the nation\u2019s economic pie.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The closure of the UK\u2019s largest gas storage plant has prompted warnings that the country faces more volatile winter gas prices and is becoming too dependent on energy imports. British Gas\u2019s owner, Centrica, said it was permanently closing the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast because it had become unsafe and uneconomic to reopen the facility, which had been temporarily shut over safety fears. The loss comes on top of the diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which supplies a third of UK gas imports and has highlighted the UK\u2019s increasing reliance on hydrocarbon imports. Centrica said Rough, which opened in 1985 and could hold about nine days\u2019 gas supply, will cease to be a storage facility once its remaining gas reserves have been sold over the next four to five years. The company said tests of the wells at the facility showed it had come to the end of its design life. Rebuilding or refurbishing Rough would not be economical, the firm added, though the cost of closure is expected to be broadly neutral because of the value of the remaining gas. Experts said it was no surprise Centrica had decided to shutter the depot, because liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from Qatar had significantly reduced the economic rationale for this kind of facility. Analysts at Barclays said the closure would increase the volatility of winter gas prices, a view shared by other industry-watchers. Matt Osborne, a risk manager at energy consultancy Inenco, said: \u201cWe anticipate that the decision to close Rough will create uncertainty in terms of energy pricing. \u201cThough we haven\u2019t seen a material impact on prices yet \u2013 most probably because there is still a significant amount of recoverable gas in the field, which could last for years \u2013 the pressure could come in the winter months, especially if we experience very cold conditions.\u201d The fracking industry said the closure would increase the UK\u2019s reliance on Qatari LNG imports, which it said had proved to be politically risky, although there is no evidence yet that the diplomatic crisis engulfing the Gulf state, whose neighbours have severed diplomatic ties, has interrupted UK supplies. Ken Cronin, the chief executive of the onshore gas and oil industry trade body UKOOG, said: \u201cThe solution for the UK in the medium term cannot be to transport gas across oceans and continents. The UK needs to ensure that whatever gas replaces that from Rough comes from sources that can deliver the same high levels of environmental and regulatory standards.\u201d Gas has become increasingly important in the UK\u2019s power mix as coal plants close and renewables grow, and also provides heating for about 80% of UK homes. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has highly diverse and flexible sources of gas supply through domestic production and extensive import capability. We expect healthy margins this winter as we continue to upgrade the UK\u2019s energy infrastructure.\u201d On Tuesday, the government announced funding for two projects that could help wean the UK off its reliance on natural gas for heating. BEIS said \u00a325m would be made available to test using hydrogen to cut greenhouse gas emissions from heat. The money will fund research into whether existing gas pipes can be used for hydrogen, and what impact having a hydrogen boiler would have for consumers. A further \u00a310m is being invested in \u201csmart heating\u201d. Unlike gas, hydrogen produces no emissions when burned, although it is only considered a green fuel if produced with renewable power. The newly appointed energy minister, Claire Perry, said: \u201cThe UK government is committed to leading the world in delivering clean energy technology and today\u2019s investment shows that we are prepared to support innovation in this critical area.\u201d Ofgem cuts payments for small power producers The UK energy regulator has drastically cut \u00a3370m of payments for small power producers, in a blow to diesel generators and smaller gas plants. The decision by Ofgem sparked strong criticism, with claims the move would fail to achieve its aim of saving consumers about \u00a320 a year on their energy bills. Ofgem said it would reduce payments for small generators from 2018, in what observers said was a victory for lobbying by the big six energy companies \u2013 British Gas, EDF, E.ON, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE. The regulator argued that the payments for generators supplying power at peak times were distorting the market and set to get worse. \u201cOur role is to protect customers and make sure costs are kept as low as possible. That is why we are taking action by reducing this payment,\u201d said the Ofgem chief executive, Dermot Nolan. However, the Flexible Generation Group, which represents small generators, mostly gas plants, said the decision would inevitably push up costs to consumers by making prices spikier at times of high demand. Mark Draper, the group\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cThis decision poses a significant challenge to our growing industry and makes it even more difficult for new entrants into the energy market to compete with established players.\u201d He added the decision would reinforce the perception that big power producers wield \u201cundue influence\u201d with Ofgem.",

      "bodyText": "One idea doing the rounds in the City needs to be knocked on the head. It is the notion that the Serious Fraud Office should have let whatever sleeping dogs there might be lie in the Barclays case. This argument holds that, whatever went on with the bank and Qatar in 2008, the UK Treasury avoided having to fund another expensive banking bailout, to sit alongside those at Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB. Wasn\u2019t that a useful development? Wasn\u2019t Barclays, by avoiding part-nationalisation, better able to support the UK economy in the post-crisis years? Hasn\u2019t the world moved on? Isn\u2019t Barclays, nine years and three chief executives later, a very different organisation these days? This line of argument misses the point. The Serious Fraud Office wouldn\u2019t be doing its job as a prosecuting agency if it didn\u2019t follow the evidence as it sees it. If it thinks it has sufficient evidence to support charges of \u201cconspiracy to commit fraud and the provision of unlawful financial assistance contrary to the Companies Act 1985\u201d, it is duty-bound to bring it to court. Alternatively \u2013 in the case of the bank, as opposed to the four former executives \u2013 the SFO can pursue a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, and seek a judge\u2019s approval. It is unclear why a DPA did not materialise in this case, as it did at Rolls-Royce and Tesco in recent months. One can only note that David Green, director of the SFO, has said that companies should not regard DPAs, which were introduced three years ago, as the \u201cnew normal\u201d or a default option. He clearly meant it. But the broader point about the public interest in the SFO pursuing this case seems crystal clear. The fact that the financial crisis of 2008 can feel a long time ago is irrelevant. If Barclays achieved its great escape from nationalisation legally, then it did well. But if the SFO alleges criminality in the bank\u2019s Qatari dealings, the case must be prosecuted. Any other course would encourage the idea that banks and bankers can play by different rules from the rest of us. Mansion House pleas for a managed Brexit It\u2019s one thing for colleagues to have a dig at Boris Johnson, but it seems the foreign secretary is now also fair game for the governor of the Bank of England. \u201cBefore long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption,\u201d said Mark Carney. Nobody should be surprised: the Johnsonian cake-and-eat-it vision of Brexit is well and truly dead. Reality has dawned in the UK that negotiations with the EU27 will be difficult, complicated and will add an entirely unpredictable element to an economic outlook that is growing murkier as real incomes are squeezed. The good news in the twin Mansion House speeches was that chancellor Philip Hammond felt sufficiently emboldened to make his strongest plea yet for a managed approach to Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019ll almost certainly need an implementation period, outside the customs union itself, but with current customs border arrangements remaining in place, until new long-term arrangements are up and running,\u201d he said. That, let\u2019s hope, marks the moment that talk of leaving the EU without a deal also died. There simply isn\u2019t enough time for the UK to agree a comprehensive trade deal with the EU27 that could be implemented seamlessly in April 2019. The immediate focus must be on the transitional arrangements. The path to that limited goal probably won\u2019t be smooth or gentle either \u2013 but the sooner agreement is reached, the better. Carney makes case for UK euro clearing Carney, in a different passage in his speech, produced a startling statistic that, let\u2019s hope, is digested by a European commission that is still threatening to demand the right to shift an important part of the City\u2019s business to the EU. This is the sensitive field of clearing houses \u2013 the institutions that stand behind buyer and seller in a trade. When the trade is an euro-denominated instrument, such as an interest rate swap, the commission wants enhanced supervision or, if that proves unsatisfactory, the power to shift business to the EU. It should concentrate on better supervision if it\u2019s got any sense: it is easy to do and will cause little fuss. By contrast, fragmenting clearing looks hellishly expensive for everybody. In Japan, enforced onshore clearing adds 1 to 3 basis points to costs, said Carney, and 1 basis point in Europe would represent \u20ac22bn (\u00a319.5bn). That is serious money, to be paid ultimately by households and businesses.",

Here is how the major indices across Europe closed: FTSE 100: -0.7% at 7,473 FTSE 250: -0.5% at 19,772 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.6% at 12,815 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 5,294 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1% at 20,810 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1% at 10,746 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.7% at 389 Brent crude oil is down 2.2% at $45.86 a barrel. Over in the currency markets the pound is still sharply lower against the dollar and the euro, after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the UK economy was not yet ready for a rise in interest rates. Sterling is 0.9% down against the dollar at $1.2617, and at one point was as low as $1.2603, the lowest since 18 April. Against the euro then pound is down 0.7% at \u20ac1.1343. That\u2019s all for today folks. Thanks for reading the blog and for all your comments. Please join us again tomorrow. AM Unison\u2019s annual conference is underway in Brighton and the squeeze on living standards is on the agenda. The trade union, which represents more than 1.3 million workers who provide public services, is calling for an end to pay freezes and austerity. Here is what Dave Prentis, general secretary, had to say: We live in a kingdom dangerously divided into the haves and the have-nots. Some are living in misery and poverty \u2013 or even in extreme danger as we have seen last week. The catastrophe at Grenfell Tower was the epitome of a tale of two cities. People living in wealth and luxury side by side with those living in poverty. The Prime Minister appears to be unable to give the support people need or be the leader this country wants. This contrasts with the warmth and compassion shown by the public, and the bravery shown by the heroes of the emergency services. Public service champions \u2013 including nurses, hospital porters and council workers \u2013 are working together and supporting each other. We live in a country full of heroes. Jeremy Corbyn is the man capable of taking this country in the right direction. Some said he was unelectable but people saw hope and someone worth voting for. They\u2019ve seen a man who can be Prime Minister.It\u2019s time for a Labour government with our values and our manifesto. A manifesto against job cuts, police cuts and pay freezes that ends the senseless pain of austerity. This government\u2019s austerity pay policies have crushed public services under their heel. They have ground down public service employees. They\u2019re worried about their jobs, their families and can\u2019t go through another five years of poverty pay. Now is the time to shout enough is enough. This is the year to smash the pay cap. The Scottish National Party says Bank of England governor Mark Carney delivered a \u201cblunt Brexit reality check\u201d when he made his annual Mansion House speech this morning. Stewart Hosie MP: Today the governor of the Bank of England confirmed that Brexit is beginning to bite hard \u2013 and that our economy and people\u2019s wages are bearing the brunt. His speech paints an extremely depressing picture. It is fundamentally unfair, when Scotland voted expressly against this eventuality, that the Tories continue to drag us towards the hard Brexit cliff edge, putting jobs and growth at risk. The SNP has set out our position in clear terms \u2013 we want Scotland to maintain our place in the single market, to maintain our place in the customs union and will work hard to protect jobs and wages. The need for this approach has been underlined by Mark Carney\u2019s comments today \u2013 the Tories cannot continue to ignore Scotland\u2019s voice. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, has given his take on the latest market moves. Here in the UK... The FTSE 100 erased early forex-induced gains by the afternoon when energy sector shares slumped alongside the price of oil. Investors were also weighing up the implications of fraud charges against former Barclays executives. Broader stock markets have been weathering the three-week slide in the oil price on the assumption prices will stay within the price range seen over the past 12 months. The further we move below $50 per barrel, the more worrisome the bruising taken by oil prices gets for stocks. And over in the US: Stocks in the US turned lower in early trading. Another day of record highs might be scuppered by concern around the persistent downtrend in oil and other commodity prices. Apart from sending Amazon shares to new stratospheric levels, the deal to buy Whole Foods has been a negative force on the US stock market. US markets are slightly down in early trading: Dow Jones: -0.03% at 21,521 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,446 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 5,758 Oil prices have fallen to seven-month lows after news of increases in supply from several key producers. Brent crude is down sharply: Elsewhere in Europe, major markets are mixed. Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.04% at 12,894 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 5,320 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 20,909 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 10,799 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 391 The FTSE 250, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, is down 0.4% at 19,796. A weaker pound is often a plus for the FTSE 100 where companies tend to be internationally focused. It isn\u2019t the case at the moment however as a falling oil price in dragging down commodity stocks. Brent crude is down 2.6% at $45.68 a barrel. The FTSE 100 is currently down 16 points or 0.2% at 7,508. Here is the list of the index\u2019s biggest fallers: Labour MP Chuka Umunna has commented on Philip Hammond\u2019s Mansion House speech. Speaking as a supporter of Open Britain, the campaign against a so-called hard Brexit, Umunna said: The chancellor is absolutely right that nobody voted in the referendum to become poorer. That is why it is vital that the government negotiates a Brexit deal that puts jobs and our economy first. To do so, the government needs to recognise that it cannot continue to threaten a Brexit with no deal at all. And they should reopen the possibility of keeping Britain in the single market and customs union, which would be the best option for our economy. Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply after Bank of England governor Mark Carney argued against raising UK interest rates. In his delayed Mansion House speech, Carney argued that the UK economy is too weak to support higher borrowing costs, especially as Brexit is at a critical point. Carney told an audience in London that: From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment. In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. This has knocked almost a cent off the pound, to $1.2654 - close to a two-month low. City analysts say Carney has calmed speculation that interest rates could rise soon, after three policymakers voted for a hike last week. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s added to the pressure on sterling, by warning that it needn\u2019t wait for Brexit to be concluded before changing Britain\u2019s credit rating. Chancellor Philip Hammond also used the Mansion House speech to argue for UK businesses to be protected from Brexit damage, through a transition deal. The car industry has voiced its concerns too; saying that a \u2018cliff-edge\u2019 Brexit would be the worst option for the sector. And in other news, Tesco is facing customer complaints after a computer problem led to home delivery orders being cancelled. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says concerns over Brexit are weighing on the pound. That\u2019s on top of Mark Carney\u2019s speech arguing against raising UK interest rates anytime soon. Otunuga explains: Sterling was in trouble during Tuesday\u2019s trading session with prices tumbling to a weekly low at 1.266 after Mark Carney suggested that interest rates should be kept on hold amid Brexit uncertainty. It is becoming clear that the rising fears of Brexit negotiations negatively impacting economic growth continues to weigh heavily on sentiment while prolonged periods of uncertainty has ensured Pound weakness remains a recurrent theme. With both consumer spending and business investments dishing out mixed signals, and tepid wage growth still a cause for concern, \u201cnow is not yet the time to raise interest rates\u201d according to Mark Carney. The pound is falling further against the euro too, down almost one eurocent at \u20ac1.134. That\u2019s a one-week low, and close to the eight-month low of \u20ac1.1276 hit after June\u2019s UK general election. Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s have warned that it could downgrade the UK before the terms of the Brexit deal are known, putting even more pressure on the pound. S&amp;P sovereign ratings chief Moritz Kraemer told Reuters that S&amp;P needn\u2019t wait until the negotiations have been concluded in 2019. Asked if it would wait until the end of the Brexit negotiations to take another ratings action on Britain, Kraemer said: \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have to wait.\u201d \u201cWe will review the UK every six months... and if necessary more often... We will be watching the economic implications, the implications for the public finances, the constitutional implications like the whole Scotland situation...and things like the currency and if it will maintain its reserve status.\u201d S&amp;P slashed the UK\u2019s credit rating by two-notches to AA , from Triple A, after the Brexit vote last summer. It currently has a \u2018negative outlook\u2019 on the debt, suggesting another cut is possible. That has given currency traders another reason to sell the pound, which is still bruised by Mark Carney\u2019s comments this morning. This \u2018candlestick formation\u2019 shows how sterling has fallen to a one-week low of $1.266, down 0.5%, and is barely above the two-month low struck after the UK election results. Britain\u2019s carmakers have added their weight to calls for Britain to agree a transition deal after it leaves the EU. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned that a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d Brexit was the worst possible outcome for the automotive industry. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \u201cWe accept that we are leaving the European Union and we share the desire for that departure to be a success. But our biggest fear is that, in two years\u2019 time, we fall off a cliff edge \u2013 no deal, outside the single market and customs union and trading on inferior WTO terms. \u201cThis would undermine our competitiveness and our ability to attract the investment that is critical to future growth.\u201d The auto industry provides 12.0% of total UK export of goods, according to the SMMT, with 169,000 people employed directly in manufacturing, and over 800,000 in the wider industry. Here\u2019s the full story: Tesco is busy apologising to customers caught up in its home delivery problems. It says: We\u2019re currently experiencing an IT issue which is affecting some Grocery Home Shopping orders. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to fix this problem and apologise to customers for any inconvenience this may cause.\u201d Its social media team are handling a lot of criticism too: In other news....Tesco customers are reporting problems with the supermarket giant\u2019s home delivery service. Many are complaining on social media that their orders have been cancelled. According to a company spokesman, around 10% of orders have been affected. Tesco is blaming a \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d, and offering a \u00a310 voucher as compensation, according to the BBC. Here\u2019s a few of the customers affected: Here\u2019s Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, on Mark Carney and Philip Hammond\u2019s speeches this morning: For analysts who were awaiting Carney\u2019s response to the BoE policy meeting last week, this announcement has dampened expectations of a significant policy change in the near future, with the governor citing low wage growth and mixed signals on consumer spending as the reasons for his decision. There were some positives for investors from Hammond however, as he proposed arrangements for a transitionary period during the Brexit process and beyond which would see the customs union rules remain in place for the UK until new rules are implemented and other measures agreed that would protect the city and prevent disruption.\u201d Taken at face value, Mark Carney\u2019s insistence that interest rates would stay at rock bottom levels until the smoke had cleared from the Brexit talks was quite a rebuke to colleagues who voted for a rate rise only last week. The Bank of England governor was in combative mood as he listed the many reasons for keeping the base rate at 0.25%, not least the febrile atmosphere inside City trading rooms. Michael Saunders, Kristin Forbes and Ian McCafferty were the three members on the monetary policy committee to warn that rising inflation needed to be calmed by an increase in rates. You might think they would seem foolish now that a slap from the governor is visible on their livid cheeks. But it is more likely that the governor was quite content to see the huge amount of coverage in the news media for the MPC\u2019s dissenting minority. The slap, if we can call it that, was staged. Knowing that rates cannot rise without thousands of businesses going bust and millions of households getting into financial trouble, Carney is playing a game. With the economy struggling as Brexit talks begin, the dangers are apparent. For this reason he must talk tough to prevent consumers heaping more cheap credit on their already huge borrowing, thereby creating a dangerous lending bubble. At the same time he wants to keep the credit wheels turning to keep the economy from falling over. He can\u2019t do this alone. The committee needs to play its part. We must assume that Forbes\u2019s replacement, the London School of Economics professor Silvana Tenreyro, and whoever takes over from Charlotte Hogg, have been briefed. The drop in the pound has pushed up the value of multinational companies listed in London, as their overseas earnings are now more valuable. Global advertising giant WPP is leading the way, up 2.2%. Other gainers include luxury fashion chain Burberry (+1.5%) and consumer good titan Unilever (+1.2%). This has nudged the FTSE 100 up by 11 points to 7535, close to the alltime closing high of 7547. The \u2018intraday\u2019 high for the FTSE 100 is 7598. Carney\u2019s caution suggests that UK interest rates will remain at their current record low throughout 2017, and possibly until 2019, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. \u201cMark Carney\u2019s cautious stance fuels our belief that interest rates will not be rising any time soon, given a stuttering UK economy and uncertainties over its outlook.... \u201cWe maintain the view that the Bank of England will hold off from raising interest rates in 2017. A tightening in 2018 also looks highly questionable given the cloudy outlook Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Mark Carney has \u201cemphatically\u201d distanced himself from the three hawkish MPC members who voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% last week. So says Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada. He adds: Carney\u2019s reference to the \u201ccoming months\u201d implies that his vote for an unchanged policy stance is set to prevail at the August Inflation Report, and beyond whilst these uncertainties are resolved. Whilst there are still many members we haven\u2019t heard from since the election purdah period ended (Haldane comments will be published tomorrow), it is significant that the Governor has now shown that the range of views on the Committee is broad, with his own being distinctly different to those who voted for a hike last week. It\u2019s also worth remembering that the most hawkish MPC member, Kristin Forbes, steps down at the end of the month. Her replacement, Silvana Tenreyro, is expected to be more dovish. Mark Carney comments come just a week after UK inflation rate jumped to 2.9%, well over the Bank\u2019s 2% target, and much faster than wages. So if the Bank resists pressure to raise interest rates to curb inflation, workers may suffer falling real wages for even longer. Kathleen Brooks, currency expert at cityindex.co.uk, explains: This morning\u2019s comments are important because they suggest that the Bank of England will look through the period of high inflation, headline CPI is running at 2.9%, blaming the rise on the sharp drop in sterling last year. This could spell more woe for the UK consumer, if the BOE is not going to take action to bring down prices, this could keep the squeeze on pay packets for some time. She also suspects that the pound could keep falling: In the very short term we are looking at $1.2650 \u2013 the bottom of the range from the last 10-days - if we break below here it would be a short-term bearish development.\u201d Mark Carney has laid a \u201ca thick layer of dovishness\u201d over the City today, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He writes: Carney\u2019s warning that \u2018now is not the time\u2019 to tighten should hardly be a surprise, given his record of favouring looser monetary policy, but it does reiterate the MPC\u2019s preference for looking through the current high levels of inflation for the time being. However, inflationary pressure could still force the Bank\u2019s hand, he adds: There are plenty who think that the Bank\u2019s decision to cut last summer following the Brexit vote was folly and rising inflation offers a chance to correct that \u2018error\u2019. However the departure of arch-hawk Kristin Forbes leaves those calling for tightening in a greater minority than before This is from Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u2019s principal economist: Mark Carney\u2019s comments show that the Bank of England is not inching close to a rate hike, says Mike Bird of the WSJ: Allie Renison of the Institute of Directors is struck by Carney\u2019s call for a \u2018transitional deal\u2019 to help firms cope with Brexit. The Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon knows exactly who Carney was aiming for, with his comment about Brexit being a piece of cake: Apologies, there was a daft typo in that earlier entry about the pound. To be clear, the pound has fallen to $1.2675, a one-week low, down from $1.275 before Mark Carney\u2019s speech hit the wires. Sterling is also down 0.5% against the euro, to 87.9p from 87.4p. That means one pound buys \u20ac1.137, from \u20ac1.142 earlier this morning. Hope that\u2019s clear! Many thanks to all those who pointed it out. Carney concludes his speech by questioning whether Brexit will be a cakewalk - a mischievous nod to Brexiteers who argued that Britain can \u2018have its cake and eat it\u2019 after it leaves the EU. The governor says the success, or otherwise, of Brexit depends on whether the two sides can agree a \u2018transition\u2019 arrangement (something Philip Hammond also called for today). Carney says: \u201cDepending on whether and when any transition arrangement can be agreed, firms on either side of the channel may soon need to activate contingency plans. \u201cBefore long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption.\u201d Carney has a chilly warning for Britons -- Brexit is going to hurt the economy, and he can\u2019t stop that happening. However, the Bank can balance how this pain is shared; either through unemployment, or inflation, depending on how it sets interest rates. Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU. But it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises. Carney has also warned that Britain will suffer badly if the City of London faces higher barriers to trade: One million people across this country work in financial services. The industry contributes 7% of output and pays taxes that cover almost two thirds of the cost of the NHS. At a time when the UK is running a 5% current account deficit, financial services runs a 1.5% trade surplus with Europe alone. The entire service sector runs a 5% surplus with the world and employs 85% of UK workers. We could take these realities for granted. And it would be all too easy to give into protectionism. But as we learned in the 1930s, that road leads neither to equity nor prosperity. Raising barriers to trade disproportionately hurts the least well off through higher prices and fewer opportunities. Carney is also warning against the creeping tide of protectionism, saying that stronger trade is the key to boosting global growth. The governor says countries need to look outwards, not impose new barriers. The G20 faces a choice \u2013 between levelling down by putting more restrictions on goods trade, or levelling up by liberalising trade in services. Evidence from within countries suggests that there may be substantial scope to increase trade in services if barriers are removed. For example, in Canada \u2013 one of the few countries to track trade flows within its borders \u2013 services account for around 50% of all inter-provincial trade compared with only 25% of Canada\u2019s international exports. If Canada were able to replicate the pattern of trade within its borders with other countries then services exports would triple. Breaking: Sterling has fallen sharply to a one-week low as Mark Carney declares that Britain isn\u2019t ready for higher interest rates. The pound shed half a cent to $1.2675 against the US dollar, and is down against the euro too. The Bank of England governor is arguing that it would be wrong to raise borrowing costs now, before we know how the Brexit negotiations will play out. He also tells the audience at Mansion House this morning that wage growth is too weak to justify a rate hike. Carney acknowledges that his monetary policy committee are split on this issue (they voted 5-3 to leave rates on hold last week). But he is not ready to join the three hawks pushing for higher borrowing costs. Carney says: Different members of the MPC will understandably have different views about the outlook and therefore on the potential timing of any Bank Rate increase. But all expect that any changes would be limited in scope and gradual in pace. From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment. In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. Now Mark Carney is on his feet. The Bank of England governor begins his speech by touching on the tragic events of recent weeks, which have reminded us of the \u201cfine balance between hope and despair\u201d. He says: Despair at the murder of Jo Cox [one year ago last week]. Hope in her remarkable life of service \u2013 an inspiration that lives on in her family, friends, colleagues and many admirers. Despair at the terrorist attacks in Manchester, Borough Market and Finsbury Park. Despair at the tragedy of Grenfell Tower. Hope in the heroism, resiliency and the community of the responses. Hope when we recognise our common humanity. The best tribute this City and this Country can give to the memories of those lost is to renew our shared commitment \u2013 whatever our differences \u2013 to promote the common good. And that includes pursuing a Brexit, and building an economy, that works for all, he adds..... The key message from Philip Hammond today is that Britain can achieve a Brexit that works for the people. But it must have four strands: A comprehensive agreement on trade and services. A mutually beneficial transitional arrangement, avoiding disruption and dangerous cliff edges. Frictionless customs arrangements. An implementation period, when the UK will be outside the customs union, but customs rules will remain in place pending the new rules coming into force. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Liveblog is covering all the details too (in a frictionless, mutually beneficial arrangement....) Hammond fires a warning shot at those who want to take EU derivatives trading out of London. This will lead to a lower-quality, higher-priced financial services, he warns. As expected, Hammond says Britain will almost certainly need an implementation period after Brexit, so that customs border arrangements can continue. Ireland\u2019s land border must stay open and freeflowing too, he continues -- a very hot issue, as Theresa May continues to negotiate with Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP party. On trade, Hammond says Britain needs to be able to trade effectively with EU members after Brexit. And on migration, the chancellor reads from the (notorious) Conservative manifesto that Britain needs to keep recruiting the \u201cbrightest and the best from around the world\u201d. Britain has benefitted from globalisation, he continues, but it can\u2019t turn a blind eye to the hostility to it in parts of the developed world. Britain is tired of austerity after seven years of it, the chancellor continues - perhaps a nod that he will loosen the pursestrings in the autumn budget. But he is still committing to eliminating the budget deficit by the end of the next decade. He also promises to provide assurances to the European Investment Bank (EIB) to ensure that funds keep flowing to UK businesses after Brexit. Onto fiscal issues. Hammond says the Conservatives are committed to keeping taxes as low as possible, to encourage growth. He\u2019s also opposed to raising borrowing to fund current consumption, as that only passes the bill onto future generations. Stronger growth is the only sustainable way to deliver better public services and jobs, says Hammond. I thought we had won that argument, but the general election has shown that we must make a new case for \u201ca market economy and sound money\u201d says Hammond (a nod to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s better than expected performance). Hammond now turns to Brexit, saying that there is much work to do. But the UK has a solid foundation, he argues. It was one of the fastest growing G7 economies in 2016. He then takes a pop at his predecessor, adding that Britain has created millions of new jobs in the last few years \u201ceven if you only count George Osborne once\u201d. Philip Hammond is speaking now. He begins by thanking the City of London corporation for rescheduling today\u2019s event, after the appalling tragedy that was unfolding at Grenfell Tower. The chancellor says that Britain has suffered a series of shocking events in recent weeks - terror attacks at Manchester, London Bridge, Finsbury Park yesterday, and at Grenfell. Grenfell was an \u201cunimaginable tragedy\u201d, Hammond continues, and his thought are with all those affected by it. The immediate priority is to make sure that that the survivors have everything they need. But that\u2019s isn\u2019t all. We must also get to the bottom of the failure at Grenfell and take decisive action to make sure nothing like this happens again. You should be able to watch the Mansion House speeches on the TV news. Bloomberg are streaming it. Bloomberg expect Hammond to make the case for a softer Brexit that doesn\u2019t cause as much damage to the economy. The room at Mansion House is filling up nicely, to hear from Hammond and Carney. Helena Morrissey, head of personal investing at LGIM and a driving force to get more women into the boardroom, is there. So is conservative MPs Steve Barclay and Vicky Ford. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The great and the good of the City of London are heading to Mansion House this morning, to hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney and chancellor Philip Hammond. The two men, who between them handle the UK\u2019s fiscal and monetary levers, are expected to outline their plans to protect Britain\u2019s growth prospects in the face of Brexit. These speeches were originally scheduled for last Thursday night, before the City of London corporation cancelled the Mansion House event altogether following the Grenfell Tower disaster. It was hardly appropriate to have City grandees hobnobbing in black tie and quaffing expensive vintages. So instead, it has been rescheduled as a breakfast event this morning. This is the first time we\u2019ve heard from Carney since the Bank of England was dramatically split over interest rates last week. Three policymakers voted to hike borrowing costs, startling the City, while five voted for no-change. Hammond\u2019s speech will also be closely watched. He had been expected use last week\u2019s speech to argue against a Hard Brexit, and call on prime minister Theresa May to ensure Britain gets a significant \u201ctransition period\u201d after Brexit, to help businesses adapt. Over the weekend, the chancellor hinted that he might ease up on austerity following the Conservative Party\u2019s election bloody nose. As Reuters put it: Hammond had looked set to lose his job until May\u2019s election flop. He has now re-emerged as big business\u2019 leading proponent in government and might provide more details on Tuesday on how he thinks the two-year Brexit process should run. Hammond may also give more details of his budget plans after saying on Sunday that he was \u201cnot deaf\u201d to the weariness of voters to nearly a decade of spending cuts for many services and tight controls on public sector pay. Also coming up today... The other big news this morning is that the Serious Fraud Office has charged Barclays, and four former top executives, over its fundraising from Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. We should also get more details of Argentina\u2019s innovative plan to issue 100-year bonds, despite having defaulted on its debts more than once....

      "bodyText": "Four former Barclays executives could face lengthy jail sentences after the Serious Fraud Office charged them and the bank with fraud over the way Barclays raised billions of pounds from Qatar at the height of the financial crisis. The SFO charged former Barclays chief executive John Varley and three former colleagues \u2013 Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath \u2013 with offences after a five-year investigation into the events surrounding the \u00a311.8bn emergency fundraising conducted by the bank in 2008. This is the first time criminal action has been taken against any senior bankers for events dating to the 2008 financial crisis. At the time, Barclays raised billions of pounds from Qatar in a move that allowed the bank to avoid taking a taxpayer bailout. The SFO said the charges related to the two fundraisings the bank embarked on in June and October 2008 with two investment vehicles related to Qatar, including one used by the prime minister at the time, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, and a $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) loan advanced to Qatar in November 2008. The individuals and a bank representative are scheduled to appear at Westminster magistrates\u2019 court on 3 July. Jenkins and Boath said they would contest the charges; there has not been any comment from Varley and Kalaris. The charging decision has been postponed on a number of occasions, initially to the end of March, then the end of May and then to mid-June, and comes as the SFO faces abolition under plans set out in the Conservative election manifesto. \u201cThis is the most significant charging decision for the SFO in recent times, if not ever,\u201d said Sarah Wallace, a partner and head of regulatory and criminal investigations at law firm Irwin Mitchell. \u201cIn the past few years, Barclays faced an unprecedented number of investigations by worldwide regulators but this SFO criminal prosecution is the most serious. \u201cTaking on Barclays, one of the largest banks in the world, and its most senior officials who literally were at the very top, sends a very strong message that the SFO is now fearless in terms of the companies and individuals it pursues.\u201d The four and the bank are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to a fundraising in June 2008. If convicted these offences carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a fine for the bank. Varley, Jenkins and the bank are also charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to the fundraising that took place in October 2008. Technically this also carries a maximum 10-year jail term if convicted. Varley, Jenkins and the bank face a further charge of providing unlawful financial assistance through the loan, which carries a jail term of up to two years or a fine, or both. Barclays said it was considering its position in relation to these developments and awaiting further details of the charges. Jenkins, who left Barclays in 2009, was known as the executive who was paid \u00a340m in one year and credited with finding the Middle Eastern investors who poured billions into the bank at the height of the crisis. The Briton, who is now based in Malibu, California, said through his lawyer he would defend himself. \u201cAs one might expect in the challenging circumstances of 2008, Jenkins sought and received both internal and external legal advice on each and every topic covered by the SFO\u2019s accusations,\u201d Brad Kaufman of law firm Greenberg Traurig said. Varley was chief executive of Barclays until the end of 2010. Kalaris, a London-based US citizen, ran the wealth management arm of Barclays. They did not immediately comment, although Varley resigned as a director of mining group Rio Tinto just after the charges were revealed. He had been on the board of the group for six years. In a statement, the Rio Tinto chairman, Jan du Plessis, said: \u201cThe board holds him in the highest regard and will miss his valuable insight.\u201d Boath is the former head of the bank\u2019s European financial institutions group and has brought an employment tribunal claim against Barclays alleging he was unfairly dismissed when the SFO shared the transcript of his interview with the bank. He said: \u201cThe SFO\u2019s decision to charge me is based on a false understanding of my role and the facts. I was not a decision-maker and had no control over what the bank did in 2008.\u201d Boath said he had cooperated with the SFO and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. \u201cThe evidence I have supplied is very clear, there is no case for me to answer. I will contest these charges vigorously,\u201d he said. The bank said the charges related to two advisory services agreements entered into with Qatar Holding, an investment vehicle for the Gulf state, in June and October 2008. Barclays said on Tuesday that the US justice department and Securities and Exchange Commission had also been conducting investigations relating to these agreements, and that the FCA had investigated. The FCA said: \u201cWe are pleased that this matter, which led to the stay of our own case, is now in the public domain. We welcome a fair and transparent hearing on the basis of the charges set out today by the SFO. We work closely with the SFO across a range of matters, in pursuit of our distinct objectives.\u201d There is also a civil case in relation to the events of 2008 brought by Amanda Staveley, an adviser to Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, who put more than \u00a33bn into the October 2008 financing. Staveley has brought a civil action claiming fees for her PCP advisory vehicle.",

At the time, Barclays raised billions of pounds from Qatar in a move that allowed the bank to avoid taking a taxpayer bailout.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The SFO said the charges related to the two fundraisings the bank embarked on in June and October 2008 with two investment vehicles related to Qatar, including one used by the prime minister at the time, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, and a $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) loan advanced to Qatar in November 2008. </p> <p>The individuals and a bank representative are scheduled to appear at Westminster magistrates\u2019 court on 3 July. Jenkins and Boath said they would contest the charges; there has not been any comment from Varley and Kalaris.</p> <p>The charging decision has been postponed on a number of occasions, initially to the end of March, then the end of May and then to mid-June, and comes as the SFO faces abolition under plans set out in the Conservative election manifesto. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis is the most significant charging decision for the SFO in recent times, if not ever,\u201d said Sarah Wallace, a partner and head of regulatory and criminal investigations at law firm Irwin Mitchell. \u201cIn the past few years, Barclays faced an unprecedented number of investigations by worldwide regulators but this SFO criminal prosecution is the most serious.</p> <p>\u201cTaking on Barclays, one of the largest banks in the world, and its most senior officials who literally were at the very top, sends a very strong message that the SFO is now fearless in terms of the companies and individuals it pursues.\u201d</p> <p>The four and the bank are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to a fundraising in June 2008. If convicted these offences carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a fine for the bank. </p> <p>Varley, Jenkins and the bank are also charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to the fundraising that took place in October 2008. Technically this also carries a maximum 10-year jail term if convicted. Varley, Jenkins and the bank face a further charge of providing unlawful financial assistance through the loan, which carries a jail term of up to two years or a fine, or both.</p> <p>Barclays said it was considering its position in relation to these developments and awaiting further details of the charges. </p> <p>Jenkins, who left Barclays in 2009, was known as the executive who was paid \u00a340m in one year and credited with finding the Middle Eastern investors who poured billions into the bank at the height of the crisis. The Briton, who is now based in Malibu, California, said through his lawyer he would defend himself. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/barclays-four-charged-bankers-sfo-john-varley\">Barclays: who are the four charged bankers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs one might expect in the challenging circumstances of 2008, Jenkins sought and received both internal and external legal advice on each and every topic covered by the SFO\u2019s accusations,\u201d Brad Kaufman of law firm Greenberg Traurig said.</p> <p>Varley was chief executive of Barclays until the end of 2010. Kalaris, a London-based US citizen, ran the wealth management arm of Barclays.

      "bodyText": "Barclays bank and four of its former senior staff have been charged by the Serious Fraud Office with conspiracy to commit fraud and the provision of unlawful financial assistance, in the biggest case since the credit crunch. The former bankers include Barclays\u2019 former chief executive John Varley. The move comes after a five-year investigation into the bank\u2019s \u00a311.8bn emergency fundraising at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, when it raised billions of pounds from Qatar. John Varley John Varley, 61, is viewed as the archetypal patrician British banker. He was the first bank boss to apologise during the financial crisis, and was proud of steering Barclays through the crisis without need for a government bailout. Having graduated from Oxford with a first class degree in history, Varley started out as a solicitor before joining Barclays in 1982 to help set up its investment banking operation. He spent his entire working life at the bank and married Carolyn, the daughter of Sir Richard Thorn Pease, a member of the Quaker family behind the eponymous bank that became part of Barclays in 1902. A City gent, who habitually wears high-waisted trousers and red braces, Varley became Barclays\u2019 finance director in 2000 and chief executive in 2004. He lost out to Royal Bank of Scotland in a battle to buy Dutch lender ABN Amro \u2013 which turned out to be toxic \u2013 but snapped up the US assets of the collapsed Lehman Brothers. He then sold Barclays\u2019 asset management arm and oversaw two share issues to raise capital from the royal families of Qatar and Abu Dhabi. After handing over to Bob Diamond in 2011, Varley retired to Hampshire, but still sits on the board of US fund manager BlackRock, and is chairman of Marie Curie Cancer Care. He was also a director of global mining group Rio Tinto until the fraud charges were announced, when he quit with immediate effect. Roger Jenkins Roger Jenkins, 61, was once Britain\u2019s highest-paid banker earning up to \u00a340m a year. The former Barclays head of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East was credited with finding the investors who helped the bank escape a taxpayer bailout. He joined as a graduate trainee in 1978 and was the driving force behind Barclays\u2019 controversial tax advisory business, which was subsequently wound down. Educated at Edinburgh Academy, Jenkins went on to study economics at Heriot-Watt university in Edinburgh and in his youth was a sprinter who represented Scotland in the Commonwealth Games. Jenkins lives in Malibu, California, with his wife Diana, a fundraising entrepreneur and socialite. After leaving Barclays in 2009, he set up his own advisory firm in Dublin, Elkstone Capital, which closed in 2011. He then joined Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual as a managing partner. Thomas Kalaris In January, the former head of Barclays\u2019 wealth division, 61, recruited several bankers from his old firm for his new wealth advisory firm Saranac Partners. He started the business last summer, with backing from Aberdeen Asset Management and a number of big-name bankers. The former JP Morgan bond trader joined Barclays in 1996 and was a loyal lieutenant of Bob Diamond, who took over from John Varley as Barclays chief executive. Diamond resigned after the Libor-rigging scandal in 2012. The American banker, who was educated in Pennsylvania and Chicago, ran Barclays\u2019s wealth management division between 2009 and 2013. He quickly built the amount of wealth under management, catapulting the division into the global top league, but the unit\u2019s culture in the US was criticised in an independent report in 2013. He was one of the highest-paid bankers at Barclays, earning \u00a37.8m in 2010. Richard Boath Richard Boath, 58, who worked for Barclays for 15 years and was head of the bank\u2019s European financial institutions group until last year, has since brought a claim to an employment tribunal. He claimed he was unfairly dismissed after the SFO shared with his employer a 900-page transcript of interviews he gave to criminal investigators probing the bank. Boath said on Tuesday: \u201cThe SFO\u2019s decision to charge me is based on a false understanding of my role and the facts. I have cooperated fully with the SFO and FCA throughout their investigations. The evidence I have supplied is very clear: there is no case for me to answer. I will contest these charges vigorously.\u201d His LinkedIn profile lists him as a self-employed consultant. He holds a BA in management science from the University of Manchester.",

      "bodyText": "Carmakers have called on ministers to keep the UK in the EU single market and customs union for at least five years or risk permanent damage to the industry. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders told the government on Tuesday it was time to be pragmatic and honest about what could be achieved and secure an interim agreement in Brexit negotiations. Otherwise Britain could face a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d in 20 months that would be the \u201cworst foreseeable outcome for the sector\u201d and possibly mean tariffs. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \u201cWe accept that we are leaving the European Union and we share the desire for that departure to be a success. But our biggest fear is that, in two years\u2019 time, we fall off a cliff edge \u2013 no deal, outside the single market and customs union and trading on inferior WTO terms. \u201cThis would undermine our competitiveness and our ability to attract the investment that is critical to future growth.\u201d The UK and EU automotive sectors are highly integrated, and Hawes warned that a bespoke deal \u2013 which would need to cover rules on tariff and non-tariff barriers, and regulatory and labour issues \u2013 could not be completed within five years. Almost 60% of the cars made in the UK are sold in Europe, and many components travel back and forth across the Channel to various plants during the manufacturing process. The SMMT estimates that tariffs would drive up the cost of a British car by \u00a31,500. Hawes said Brexit was the biggest challenge the car industry had faced in a generation, and warned that an untidy exit from the customs union would damage the industry permanently. \u201cWe must have the no-tariff, frictionless trade upon which the industry depends,\u201d he said. Although Hawes did not expect any immediate closure of key plants, he said the risk was \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d as uncertainty led to diminishing investment and the dwindling of the supply chain in the UK. The SMMT announced a record turnover of \u00a377.5bn for 2016, its seventh consecutive year of growth, underlining the importance of the sector. The group\u2019s intervention came as a study released by the Automotive Council suggested that cars manufactured in Britain were becoming more British, with an uplift in the proportion of parts from domestic suppliers. Nearly half (44%) of all components come from the UK, up from 41% in 2015. While the council said the figures marked a significant move in the right direction, the proportion could still be problematic for some export agreements. Hawes added: \u201cThe needle is shifting more towards British content, but we are a long way from the 50-60% shelf for most free trade agreements. We need to have arrangements where EU content counts as UK and vice versa \u2013 that should also allow us to take advantage of free trade arrangements with the 30-40 other countries that the EU has.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British industry has received a boost from a \u00a3900m train order that once looked destined for Germany but is instead going to the Bombardier plant in Derby, safeguarding about 2,500 skilled jobs. A fleet of 90 commuter trains for the South Western franchise will be built at the country\u2019s oldest train manufacturing site, one of only two left in the UK. FirstGroup, which will take over the franchise with Hong Kong-based MTR in August, said the new trains would have 46% more seats at peak commuter times on the suburban routes to London Waterloo. They can run at 100mph, should be more energy efficient and help reduce journey times. The British-built trains will replace German-made rolling stock ordered by the outgoing franchise holder, Stagecoach. It had used Siemens\u2019 trains for the franchise since privatisation and had placed an order for more of its Desiro trains, in what appeared to be another defeat for Bombardier in a long-running battle with the German industrial group. However, First announced on winning the franchise that it would return those trains after two years for a new fleet, which has now been ordered from Bombardier. The order is the largest yet for Bombardier\u2019s Aventra trains, at 750 carriages, and is a boost to the Derby plant, whose future recently appeared in jeopardy. Similar models are being built for Crossrail\u2019s Elizabeth line and parts of the London Overground, as well as the East Anglia franchise. Passengers will also benefit from free wifi, at-seat charging points, real-time information screens, air conditioning, and wider gangways and doors for quicker boarding. The trains will be rolled out from mid-2019 and will all be in service by December 2020. The change of direction for South Western highlights a transformation in the rolling-stock market, with new, more efficient trains becoming cheaper to fund than leasing older ones from the banks that own them. UK pension funds have largely put up the capital for the South Western order, which will be leased by Rock Rail. First MTR will take over the franchise from Stagecoach on 20 August, during a period of major disruption on South Western, with fewer trains running during the upgrade of its London Waterloo terminus. The transport minister Paul Maynard said: \u201cThis multimillion-pound investment in a new fleet of British-built trains is excellent news for South West passengers and the British economy. \u201cThis investment reflects our commitment, and that of train operators, to put passengers at the heart of everything we do, and will improve journeys and target congestion.\u201d Richard Hunter, Bombardier\u2019s UK managing director, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to have won this important contract. It demonstrates further confidence placed in this market-leading rolling stock, designed and built in Britain. \u201cThis order is a fantastic endorsement of our skilled workforce and the quality of the products we design, engineer and manufacture here in the UK. It will ensure a stable, long-term workload for our staff in Derby.\u201d The long-term presence of Bombardier in Derby had been placed in doubt in recent years when it missed out on major contracts in the British rail industry. The decision in 2011 to award the \u00a33bn Thameslink trains contract to Siemens, soon after the Department for Transport had selected Japanese firm Hitachi to build inter-city express trains, led to an outcry from unions and warnings that the firm was considering its future. David Bailey, a professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: \u201cHistorically Derby is the centre of rail manufacturing: it has a big skills base, and it\u2019s a big part of the local economy. This is very good news.\u201d Under Bombardier\u2019s contract it will also support the maintenance of the new trains at the South Western depot in Wimbledon, south-west London, over the next seven years. The trains will run on the franchise\u2019s Windsor, Reading and west London suburban routes. Steve Montgomery, the managing director of First Rail, which will operate the franchise alongside MTR, said: \u201cWe have exciting plans for the South Western rail franchise and these new trains are an important step on the way to delivering an improved journey experience for our passengers. \u201cWe know from listening to passengers and stakeholders that alongside improved performance, what they want to see is additional seats and we will deliver this via these state-of-the-art trains.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that the start of Brexit negotiations will damage the economy mean that interest rates should remain at their record-low level, the governor of the Bank of England has said. Mark Carney said he would want to see how businesses, financial markets and consumers reacted to the reality of the UK\u2019s looming departure from the EU before changing his view. The governor, who attracted criticism from Conservative MPs for the recession warnings he issued before last summer\u2019s referendum, said the Brexit talks would have a significant bearing on whether the UK\u2019s historically high balance of payments deficit would become more sustainable. In his delayed speech to the City of London\u2019s elite at Mansion House, Carney explained why he was one of five of eight members voting for no change in borrowing costs. \u201cFrom my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment [to higher rates]. \u201cIn the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations.\u201d Carney said financial markets had started to adjust to the post-Brexit world. \u201cDepending on whether and when any transition arrangement can be agreed, firms on either side of the channel may soon need to activate contingency plans\u201d, he said. \u201cBefore long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption.\u201d Carney said in a global economy marked by a clear divide between surplus and deficit countries, the UK\u2019s current account was deeply in the red. \u201cOn the positive side, the deficit is funded in domestic currency and financial reforms have increased the resilience of the UK system, thereby making larger imbalances more sustainable. But the UK\u2019s deficit has also been associated with markedly weak investment and latterly with rapid consumer credit growth. This is not an imbalance that is, as yet, funding its eventual resolution. \u201cMoreover, despite the large depreciation around the referendum, the extent to which the UK\u2019s deficit has moved closer to sustainability remains an open question, one whose answer depends crucially on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. \u201cMost fundamentally, the UK relies on the kindness of strangers at a time when risks to trade, investment, and financial fragmentation have increased.\u201d",

But the UK\u2019s deficit has also been associated with markedly weak investment and latterly with rapid consumer credit growth. This is not an imbalance that is, as yet, funding its eventual resolution.<br></p> <p>\u201cMoreover, despite the large depreciation around the referendum, the extent to which the UK\u2019s deficit has moved closer to sustainability remains an open question, one whose answer depends crucially on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. </p> <p>\u201cMost fundamentally, the UK relies on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\">kindness of strangers</a> at a time when risks to trade, investment, and financial fragmentation have increased.\u201d </p>",

Ethical banking, Co-op Bank-style, would be at risk of death, or uncertain resolution at the hands of the Bank of England, if the hedge funds that own the bonds were not willing to find the extra \u00a3750m of funding. Nobody, it appears, wanted to buy the bank after a four-month hunt for a purchaser, so the bondholders are having to dig deep, just as they did in 2014. The hedge funds are not swapping their high-yielding bonds into shares out of the goodness of their hearts, of course. That would be more than odd: it would be bizarre. Instead, the deal in the offing is a gamble born from necessity. By playing for time and allowing more of the poisonous commercial property loans to wash out of the system, the financiers are hoping to get shot of the Co-op Bank on more favourable terms at some point over the horizon. The hedge funds\u2019 returns to date are impossible to calculate, not least because the cast has changed over the years. For example, those that originally paid 50p in the pound for bonds paying an 11% rate of interest haven\u2019t done too badly, even if they now have to convert into shares. But the remarkable aspect of the post-2014 financial adventure is that the Co-op Bank\u2019s brand hasn\u2019t obviously been damaged. The number of current account holders has fallen from 1.5 million to 1.4 million since 2014 but that does not represent a mass desertion. Beneath headline losses of \u00a32.6bn since the crisis, there lurks a profitable retail bank awaiting the balm of higher interest rates. One can understand why the hedge funds are staying in. Many were also sceptical that the Co-op Bank could protect its ethical constitution once the Co-op Group \u2013 the business that owns the food shops, funeral service and insurance unit \u2013 had been diluted down to a 20% holding. But, actually, the arrangement seems to have worked. The set-up remains quirky. The Co-op Bank, despite its name, was never a mutual (it was just owned by a mutual) but it can apparently continue to use the suggestive name even if the Co-op Group is now diluted down a few percentage points. If the customers don\u2019t mind, little harm is done. Indeed, we should be grateful to the rescuers if the Co-op Bank emerges one day as a \u201cchallenger\u201d bank capable of standing on its own feet. In a banking jungle lacking biodiversity, it\u2019s definitely different. Lloyds shouldn\u2019t have raised HBOS hopes Strictly speaking, Lloyds Banking Group never said that all the victims of the HBOS Reading fraud would be offered compensation by the end of June. The bank merely \u201canticipated\u201d that this would be the case. It also wrote itself a get-out clause stating the length of time would depend on individual circumstances and the pace at which customers themselves would wish to proceed. All the same, Lloyds is guilty of raising unrealistic expectations. As matters stand with a fortnight to go, only one out of 64 victims has received and accepted an offer. A further set \u2013 the number is said to be in single digits \u2013 has received an offer but not yet responded formally. Even if Lloyds were now to go into overdrive, the chances of it meeting the end-June semi-deadline are virtually nil. The independent reviewer of the cases, Prof Russel Griggs, has done the right thing by saying customers can have as long as they wish to provide evidence, consult their lawyers and so on. It would be absurd if Griggs felt any pressure from Lloyds to hurry up. But you have wonder why the bank ever thought it sensible to put an end-June timescale in the public domain. It looked impossible to meet when it was announced in late April, and so it has proved. Lloyds, even when it is belatedly issuing apologies and offering money to victims, has managed to reinforce the impression that it\u2019s overly anxious to get the sorry HBOS Reading affair out of the headlines. SSE chief\u2019s pay hike is a shocker In an undistinguished field, SSE is one of the more transparent and progressively minded energy companies. But they can all be relied upon to trip themselves up on remuneration. Last year\u2019s 72% pay rise to \u00a32.9m for chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies, announced late on Friday, looks appalling. No doubt, it all flows arithmetically from the usual short-, medium- and long-term performance measures. But, in the fight with politicians over price caps for customers, the 72% increase is a 100% own goal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Business group the CBI has warned the UK economy will shift down a gear as Brexit talks get under way and households are squeezed by rising prices. However, the cautious outlook was accompanied by an increase in the CBI\u2019s growth forecasts for this year and next, due to a stronger than expected performance in 2016 when the economy defied expectations to grow strongly in the wake of the vote. The employers\u2019 body is now forecasting the UK economy will expand by 1.6% this year and 1.4% in 2018, up from its predictions in November for 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. That would still mark a slowdown from 1.8% growth in 2016. The group, which repeatedly warned against the economic consequences of a vote to leave, said economic growth would be subdued over the next two years. \u201cThe UK economy has proved hardy in recent times, with firms up and down the UK getting on with what they do best by investing and creating jobs. Growth should be steady, if restrained, over the next couple of years as the pace of the economy shifts down a gear,\u201d said Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general. Fairbairn warned the strain on households was likely to continue as the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote pushed up the cost of imports and stoked inflation. But the pound\u2019s weakness was likely to help exporters by making their goods and services more competitive in overseas markets. \u201cWhile the country\u2019s exporters should emerge as a real catalyst of growth, rising inflation and stubbornly low wage growth mean that people are already starting to feel the pinch. Tighter purse strings mean slower household spending growth and uncertainty is likely to weigh on the minds of those making major investment decisions.\u201d The forecast followed official figures showing GDP growth slowed sharply to 0.2% in the opening quarter of 2017 after relatively strong expansion of 0.7% in the final quarter of 2016. \u201cEven accounting for weaker growth at the start of 2017, the momentum from last year gives us more of a lift as we move ahead, and this explains our higher annual growth forecast relative to November,\u201d said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist. \u201cBut very little has changed in our view of the nature of the outlook. Growth will be slower in the years ahead as living standards are hit by rising inflation; and after some initial strength, uncertainty will weigh on business investment.\u201d Early economic indicators following the Brexit vote confounded gloomy forecasts for a sharp slowdown. But a year on from the referendum and as exit talks with other EU governments begin, the effects of a weak pound and uncertainty over future trading agreements are being felt. Inflation has risen to its highest rate in four years, retail sales have slowed, businesses have reported that consumers are cutting back and the housing market appears to have lost momentum. Pay growth has weakened and fallen behind inflation, meaning workers are worse off in real terms. The CBI said its latest forecast was for average quarterly GDP growth of 0.3% from the second half of this year \u2013 unchanged from its November outlook. That is half the average pace of growth from 2013 to 2016. It expects wage growth to remain below inflation in 2017 and broadly match it in 2018. Consequently, household spending is forecast to slow markedly. Business investment was expected to hold up over the near term, with CBI surveys pointing to an improvement in investment intentions since the referendum. \u201cBut with uncertainty still holding back larger spending projects, we expect investment to wane over the course of 2018,\u201d the outlook added. The forecasts were compiled before the general election, which resulted in Theresa May losing her parliamentary majority. Some economists have said that has weakened May\u2019s hand in Brexit talks. Fairbairn said the CBI and other lobby groups were pushing the government to give the business community a stronger say and more formal role in talks about future trade deals for the UK outside the EU. She said imitating countries such as Australia and Canada, where business groups are formally consulted in trade negotiations, would be a major benefit to Britain. \u201cThey have confidential and formal structures and we have been calling for exactly that here. I think that we\u2019re seeing real signs of progress,\u201d Fairbairn said.",

Growth will be slower in the years ahead as living standards are hit by rising inflation; and after some initial strength, uncertainty will weigh on business investment.\u201d</p> <p>Early economic indicators following the Brexit vote confounded gloomy forecasts for a sharp slowdown. But a year on from the referendum and as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/brexit-negotiations-eight-key-points-you-need-to-know\">exit talks with other EU governments begin</a>, the effects of a weak pound and uncertainty over future trading agreements are being felt.<br></p> <p>Inflation has risen to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/13/uk-inflation-rises-faster-than-expected-four-year-high\">highest rate in four years</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/15/uk-retail-sales-brexit-inflation-prices-pay-consumer-spending\">retail sales have slowed</a>, businesses have reported that consumers are cutting back and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jun/01/uk-house-prices-fall-for-third-month-in-a-row\">housing market appears to have lost momentum</a>. Pay growth has weakened and fallen behind inflation, meaning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/14/pay-squeeze-wages-growth-inflation-ons-unemployment-rate\">workers are worse off in real terms</a>.</p> <p>The CBI said its latest forecast was for average quarterly GDP growth of 0.3% from the second half of this year \u2013 unchanged from its November outlook. That is half the average pace of growth from 2013 to 2016. </p> <p>It expects wage growth to remain below inflation in 2017 and broadly match it in 2018. Consequently, household spending is forecast to slow markedly. </p> <p>Business investment was expected to hold up over the near term, with CBI surveys pointing to an improvement in investment intentions since the referendum. \u201cBut with uncertainty still holding back larger spending projects, we expect investment to wane over the course of 2018,\u201d the outlook added.</p> <p>The forecasts were compiled before the general election, which resulted in Theresa May losing her parliamentary majority. Some economists have said that has weakened May\u2019s hand in Brexit talks.<br></p> <p>Fairbairn said the CBI and other lobby groups were pushing the government to give the business community a stronger say and more formal role in talks about future trade deals for the UK outside the EU. She said imitating countries such as Australia and Canada, where business groups are formally consulted in trade negotiations, would be a major benefit to Britain.</p> <p>\u201cThey have confidential and formal structures and we have been calling for exactly that here. I think that we\u2019re seeing real signs of progress,\u201d Fairbairn said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A \u00a32.3tn windfall for those lucky enough to own their own homes during the property boom of the 1990s and early 2000s has opened up a deep and widening inequality gap between the generations, a thinktank has warned. Rising house prices that have enriched older generations have priced the young out of home ownership, said the Resolution Foundation, adding that the pattern whereby each generation was wealthier than the previous one had broken down. In a new report, the thinktank noted that the baby boomers born in the 20 years after the second world war were the big beneficiaries of rapidly rising house prices, but had amassed most of the wealth through no skill of their own. Wealth disparities would have \u201cworrying consequences\u201d for the living standards of younger generations, it added. Laura Gardiner, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s pre-crash property boom created a huge, unearned and largely tax-free \u00a32.3tn housing wealth windfall for those old enough and lucky enough to be home owners at the time. But while the property bubble hugely benefited many of Britain\u2019s baby boomers, it has also driven generational wealth progress into reverse by pricing younger people out of home ownership. \u201cProperty, pension and financial wealth can provide security and opportunities for families, as well as a decent income in retirement. The failure of younger generations to accumulate wealth in the way that earlier generations have been able to is therefore a huge living standards concern for us all.\u201d The report found that 82% of housing wealth increases between 1993 and 2012-14 were due to the property boom, which saw the average price of a residential property in the UK rise threefold, rather than through any active behaviour \u2013 such as buying, moving house or paying off mortgages. At the boom\u2019s zenith in 2003, one in six of all working property-owning adults were earning more from the rising value of their homes than from their jobs. Those born in the 1940s and 50s were the main beneficiaries of the great housing wealth windfall, since they were most likely to be homeowners at the start of the property boom, with each generation born after the mid-1950s less wealthy than the previous one. A typical adult in the second-youngest baby boomer cohort born from 1956 \u201360 had 7% less wealth at age 55 than the cohort at the same age five years previously. Between 1993 and 2012-14, the average property wealth gain for those born in the 1950s was \u00a380,000. This was more than double the \u00a335,000 windfall for those born in the 1970s, because the smaller percentage of those who managed to become homeowners benefited only from the later years of the housing boom. The report found that a typical adult born from 1981 to 1985 had half as much total net wealth at age 30 than a typical adult at the same age five years before them. The report also found that baby boomers had benefited from a second wealth windfall because they were much more likely to be the beneficiaries of defined benefit pension schemes than young generations. Fewer than one in 10 workers born in the 1980s are active members of defined benefit pension schemes, compared with nearly two-fifths of those born in the 1960s when they were at the same age. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cToo often our public debates ignore the huge and very unequally shared wealth of our nation. We need to better understand the scale and causes of 21st-century wealth gaps \u2013 not only between rich and poor, but between different generations \u2013 if we are to ensure we fairly address the challenges Britain faces in the years ahead. We can start by recognising that today\u2019s young are not accumulating wealth at anything like the rate of older generations. This isn\u2019t because they save less, but because of the bad luck of being born too late, and our collective failure on big policy areas from housing to pensions. It\u2019s time we all took responsibility for putting that right.\u201d The thinktank said the government needed to take into account the \u201cunrepeatable\u201d property and pensions windfalls as it made plans to deal with the pressures on the public finances as the baby boomer generation retires.",
