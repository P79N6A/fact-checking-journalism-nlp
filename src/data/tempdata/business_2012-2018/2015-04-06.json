      "bodyText": "The soaring value of the pound has battered Britain\u2019s manufacturing exports, leaving the economy reliant on the consumer-driven services sector for growth, the CBI has warned. The business lobby group said the UK economy looked likely to gather momentum over the coming months after a steady performance so far this year, but said the strong pound had triggered a slide in export orders. Over the past two years, sterling has risen by 15% against a basket of currencies, especially the sharply depreciated euro, increasing the cost of exports to Britain\u2019s biggest overseas market. Katja Hall, the CBI\u2019s deputy director general, said businesses were alarmed by Brussels\u2019 failure to end the Greek debt crisis, which has raised tensions inside the eurozone and dampened hopes of a sustained recovery across the 19-nation currency bloc. \u201cThe main risk to the UK economy comes from the eurozone, with continuing wrangling over Greece\u2019s bailout package stoking uncertainty,\u201d she said. \u201cPlus, many businesses will also have to contend with a stronger pound weighing down on already weak export growth.\u201d After months of wrangling since the radical left Syriza government was elected in January, Athens has failed to resolve its differences with Brussels and its other major lenders, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank. The lurch from one set of crisis talks to another combined last week with renewed weakness in the US economy, where surprisingly weak jobs figures appeared to set back the date when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. The IMF is expected next week to reaffirm its view that global economic growth will slow this year, with falling demand in China adding to the negative outlook. Nevertheless, the forecast of healthy UK growth will allay concerns in the Treasury that a cooling housing market and uncertainty over the outcome of the general election would slow growth. After two years of recovery, the UK is likely to continue to grow faster than most of its G7 competitors. CBI forecasters said the survey suggested GDP grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, slightly faster than the 0.6% in the last quarter of 2014. Firms were also hopeful of a better second quarter. The poll of 764 businesses showed a positive balance of 18% between firms reporting that performance was up compared with those saying it was down in the three months to March. But a more detailed look at the figures showed businesses were reliant on UK consumers, who have benefited in recent months from lower petrol prices boosting disposable income. The survey showed that distribution businesses \u2013 which include retail, wholesale and motor traders \u2013 strengthened as did consumer services, such as hotels, bars and restaurants, plus travel and leisure firms. Weaker growth was seen in manufacturing as well as business and professional services \u2013 including accountancy, legal and marketing firms \u2013 which felt the strain of tougher competition. Manufacturing and services expected to see a pick-up ahead, with the overall balance of expectations for growth over the next three months at a positive 25%. However, this was a \u201csignificant scaling back\u201d of sentiment compared with this time last year, the CBI said. It blamed the high pound for denting business confidence in the outlook for exports, which the chancellor, George Osborne, has previously targeted in a drive to double exports to \u00a31tn by 2020. According to official figures, UK exports to the EU\u2019s 28 nations fell 3% to \u00a311bn in January compared with the previous month. That represented an 11.5% fall from January 2014. Howard Archer, chief European economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the mixed signals from the economy would force the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold when its policymakers meet on Thursday. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee has kept base rates at 0.5% for six years and is not expected to consider raising them until at least the beginning of next year. Archer said export industries would be concerned by the overall strength of the pound, especially against the euro. \u201cLatest survey evidence on foreign orders is mixed. On the positive side, the manufacturing purchasing managers reported a marked pick-up in foreign orders in March to be at a seven-month high. \u201cIn contrast, the export orders balance of the CBI\u2019s industrial trends survey relapsed to a 26-month low of -26% in March after rising to a six-month high of -8% in February from -20% in January, thereby moving below its long-term average of -20.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Reserve Bank is walking a precarious tight-rope with interest rates. The economy is weak and cutting interest rates would seem to be a good way to boost economic activity. But with interest rates already at record lows and housing prices and housing debt already at record highs, further cuts may only serve to create a housing bubble that is in danger of bursting and destroying our economy with it. All suggestions are that the Reserve Bank will cut rates again. The market is so sure that rates will be cut that it is actually pricing in 2 cuts \u2013 all the way down to 1.75% by October. This belief has actually become stronger since the Reserve Bank left rates on hold on 3 March: There\u2019s always a bit of warning though when looking at market predictions. One of my favourite graphs compares the market\u2019s expectation of interest rates last year with this year. 12 months ago, the market was anticipating that by August 2015 interest rates would be at 3%, now they think they\u2019ll be half that: So the market can get it wrong, but whereas last year the mistake was to assume the economy would improve, this time the economy would have to improve for it to be wrong \u2013 and the signs don\u2019t suggest that is going to happen. In March, the department of employment\u2019s leading indicator of employment (which takes into account job advertisements, consumer sentiment, and industry outlook such as the purchasing managers\u2019 index for manufacturing output in China) fell for the 6th month in row: So the economy is not exactly going gangbusters and yet the dilemma for the RBA is the worry that the housing market is already too hot. Thus the problem is that while a further cut (or two) of interest rates might help the economy, it will also further blow up a housing bubble. The RBA has indicated it is also worried about this. In its latest Financial Stability Review released a couple of weeks ago, it devoted a separate section to \u201cResponses to risks in the housing and mortgage markets.\u201d The section noted that last December the Australian Prudential and Regulation Authority (APRA) informed banks and authorised lending institutions that assessments of prospective loans \u201cshould include an interest rate buffer of at least two percentage points above the standard variable rate... with a floor assessment rate of at least 7%\u201d. This is to ensure that people who take out a loan at the current rate of around 5.6% could still afford it if rates rose 2 percentage points. Give it was only three years ago that mortgage rates were that high, it\u2019s not an unreasonable assumption. The APRA also suggested that banks be mindful of \u201cstrong growth in lending to property investors\u201d. It suggested that investor credit growth \u201cmaterially above a threshold of 10% will be an important risk indicator\u201d that could lead to THE APRA considering \u201cfurther action\u201d. In the latest RBA data, the investor credit growth in the past 12 months hit 10.1%: That growth, while well below the 25% plus growth that occurred during the 1990s and early 2000s, is still sizeable enough within an otherwise weak economy to suggest that property values are growing at a bubble rate \u2013 faster than the underlying economic conditions would suggest they should be. Such has been the growth in investor activity in the housing market that now, for the first time ever, the value of investor housing loans is greater than that of new loans for owner-occupiers: And the surge in such loans since November 2011 \u2013 when the RBA began cutting interest rates \u2013 looks unlikely to be able to be sustained. There are signs that the ever-growing rise in house prices may be about to come to an end when you look at the growth in the number and value of owner-occupier home loans since November 2011: For around 18 months, the number and value of the loans grew at around the same rate. But from July 2013 onwards, the value began to outstrip the actual growth of number of loans. And since February last year, the number of mortgages has been decreasing. There were 5% fewer owner-occupier mortgages taken out in January 2015 than there were 12 months earlier. Given the growth in number of mortgages and their value is generally in sync, it\u2019s not surprising that in the past 12 months the value of owner-occupier mortgages grew by just 0.3% \u2013 the lowest since May 2012. So it would appear owner-occupiers are already struggling to keep up with the growth in investor housing driven market. The RBA noted that strong investor demand can \u201camplify the housing price cycle\u201d and cause prices to rise faster than they would otherwise, and that this \u201cincreases the risk that prices later fall significantly.\u201d One concern the RBA has is that the low interest rates and fast rising housing prices will lead to an over-supply in certain areas, and this will inevitably lead to a (perhaps dramatic) fall in prices. It noted this risk was greatest in \u201cinner-city Melbourne, where the level of high-rise apartment construction has been elevated for a number of years\u201d. But even if housing price rises in the past year appear to have come off the boil slightly, there are worries about the record level of housing debt: Total housing debt in 2014 reached a record high 140.3% of disposable income, and owner-occupier housing debt hit 92.2% \u2013 also a record. And while the growth of housing debt is nowhere near the absurd levels of the early 2000s, in the past two years the ratio of debt has risen on average by 4.2 percentage points \u2013 well above the average annual rise of 2.2 percentage points observed over the near quarter of a century from 1977 to 2000. And whereas the growth in the ratio of total housing debt rose last year, for owner-occupiers it slowed. It\u2019s tough to believe house prices can keep going up while the rest of the economy stays weak. And owner-occupiers already seem to be easing back on their home buying. But further cuts to rates in an effort to boost the economy will keep investors buying and keep prices going up. Unless there is also economic growth, the conditions for a property price bubble will become even stronger.",

And owner-occupiers already seem to be easing back on their home buying.</p> <p>But further cuts to rates in an effort to boost the economy will keep investors buying and keep prices going up. Unless there is also economic growth, the conditions for a property price bubble will become even stronger. </p>",
