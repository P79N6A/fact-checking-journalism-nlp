      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for us for tonight. Here\u2019s our news story about the Federal Reserve rate rise: US Federal Reserve raises interest rates to 1% in bid to hold off inflation The US Federal Reserve has sought to head off rising inflation with a third interest rate rise since the 2008 financial crash and the second in three months, taking the base rate from 0.75% to 1%. The central bank set aside concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on consumer spending to confirm analyst projections that it is prepared to increase rates several times this year to keep a lid on inflation as it rises above its 2% target level. The Fed\u2019s chair, Janet Yellen, said a wide range of indicators showed the US economy was in rude health, allowing its interest rate setting committee to push rates back towards historically normal levels. Policymakers voted nine to one to raise rates. Speaking after the decision, Yellen said she had met Donald Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, \u201ca couple of times\u201d but had only been \u201cintroduced\u201d to the president himself. \u201cI fully expect to have a strong relationship with secretary Mnuchin,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had good discussions about the economy, about regulatory objectives, the work of the FSOC [Financial Stability Oversight Council] global economic developments, and I look forward to continuing to work with him.\u201d She said she had had a very brief meeting with Trump \u201cand appreciated that as well\u201d..... Here\u2019s the full story: Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Caution was the order of the day as the Fed took another step towards normalising monetary policy. So says our economics editor Larry Elliott, who writes: The key messages from Janet Yellen on Wednesday were that rates will continue to rise but at a cautious pace. She stressed that the central bank expected the economy to grow at a rate that would warrant gradual increases in interest rates. That will be taken as a hint that there will be two more rises during the course of 2017. The Fed has now raised interest rates three times in the past 15 months. Clearly, the period of ultra-low borrowing costs is at an end. The so-called normalisation of rates is under way. But it is also obvious that the Fed sees the new normal as being quite different to the old normal. In the mid-2000s, Alan Greenspan\u2019s Fed raised interest rates 17 times in gradual quarter-point jumps until they topped 5%. This time, the Fed sees rates peaking at a much lower level \u2013 about 3% \u2013 and as things stand they won\u2019t get there until 2019. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics says the Federal Reserve has achieved a \u2018dovish tightening\u2019 of monetary policy with today\u2019s rate rise. Having test-driven a more hawkish communication strategy in the markets in the run-up to this month\u2019s rate hike, the Fed\u2019s unchanged gradualist stance and Chair Yellen\u2019s measured tone about the Fed\u2019s pursuit of a neutral policy stance have calmed investor nerves. The Fed\u2019s hand is clearly guided by greater confidence in guiding the economy towards its dual inflation and full employment mandate, rather than a desire to start a bonfire in bond markets. The Fed has only made modest changes to its forecasts today, points out Chris Weston of IG: We have seen a slight upgrade to its view on business investment, which seems fair and while the Fed see inflation \u201cmoving\u201d to target they stipulated that the committee will carefully monitor actual inflation developments relative to its \u201csymmetric inflation goal\u201d. One could argue this seems even a touch dovish, as it effectively signals that the Fed feel there are risks of inflation moving above its target of 2%. They are indirectly urging market participants to focus far more heavily on core inflation or PCE, given the volatility and unpredictability of energy and food prices. Capital Economics say: As everyone expected following the recent blitz by officials to prepare the markets, the Fed raised the fed funds target by another 25bp today, to between 0.75% and 1.00%, but officials left their interest rate projections largely unchanged. As a result, this hike won\u2019t prompt markets to revise up expectations of how fast monetary policy will be tightened over the next few years. Manuel Ortiz-Olave, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, is struck by the fact that today\u2019s vote wasn\u2019t unanimous: \u201cWhile the Fed hiked interest rates, Kashkari voted against, showing not all FOMC members agree it\u2019s the right time to normalise monetary policy. This contradicts the recent bullish market consensus. \u201cMarkets are reassessing the future path of interest rate hikes, which is putting downward pressure on the dollar. The market had started to price in a total of four hikes this year, assuming the Fed was ready to begin an aggressive path of monetary tightening, but that is clearly no longer the case. Anna Stupnytska, Global Economist at Fidelity International, believes the Fed may miss its target of three hikes in 2017: \u201cIn all, the Fed looks unlikely to \u2018take away the punchbowl\u2019 from global growth any time soon. Our base case is only one more hike this year. This is because we are likely reaching a cyclical peak soon, and the likelihood of a China slowdown weighing on global inflation, markets and growth is fairly high.\u201d The US dollar has suffered its biggest one-day drop since January. That underlines that the Federal Reserve was less hawkish than some investors expected today. DING DING: The closing bell has rung on Wall Street, with the main indices all up after the Fed rate decision. Energy stocks led the rally, while financial stocks dipped a little Shares may be up today, but Goldman Sachs is worried that the rally may be over. Earlier today the bank\u2019s strategists lowered their three-month outlook for global stocks to neutral, while staying overweight cash and underweight bonds. More here: Goldman Turns Cautious on Stocks as Fed Threatens to Upset Calm The US stock market is continuing to climb. The Dow is now up 127 points, or 0.6%, at 20,966, with less than 20 minutes until the closing bell. The US dollar continued to slide against other major currencies as Janet Yellen held her press conference. Traders are concluding that the Fed is still only planning to tighten monetary policy gradually - given policymakers expect two more hikes this year, and three in 2018. Yellen\u2019s comments about how the Fed is comfortable about allowing inflation to overshoot its target (see here) are also seen as dovish. The British pound has jumped by 1.25 cents to $1.228, a two week high. The dollar is also trading at a two-week low against the Japanese yen, down over 1% today. And the euro has hit a five week high, gaining around 1 cent to $1.07. Last question: Q: Some people think it\u2019s too early to raise interest rates, because wage growth has been too low. I would like to see wages increase, and think there is scope for them to increase further, Yellen replies. But, the Fed\u2019s goal is to achieve maximum employment and low, stable inflation. That\u2019why it hiked the Fed funds rate to 1% today. She also points out that slow productivity growth has been holding down wage rises. Asked about regulatory issues, Yellen replies that the Fed has a \u201crelatively light\u201d regulatory agenda at present. There\u2019s nothing we need to get out right now, she adds. Yellen is asked about the possibility of a border tax. She says it\u2019s \u201cvery uncertain\u201d how the dollar would be affected by such a move. Q: The Fed\u2019s statement today says that your inflation target is symmetric - so how high would you be happy to see inflation rise? Two percent inflation is not a ceiling, it\u2019s a target, Yellen replies. There will be times when it will be above that target. If inflation appears to be persistently over target, though, the Fed would have to take action. Q: What message are you trying to send to US consumers with this interest rate hike? Great question, Yellen replies, before declaring: The simply message is that the economy is doing well She adds that the Fed has confidence in the economy, and its resilience to shocks. The labor market is strengthening - although obviously not everyone is feeling the benefits. Yellen is asked about calls for a new Glass-Steagall Act (to prohibit commercial banks getting involved in risky investment banking). \u201cI don\u2019t know what a 21st century Glass-Steagall would look like,\u201d Yellen replies wryly. But she doesn\u2019t think that the repeal of Glass-Steagall (during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency) was a major factor causing the financial crisis. Q: The latest GDP figures weren\u2019t very impressive, unemployment hasn\u2019t changed much, and consumer spending isn\u2019t roaring - so why do you feel forced to raise interest rates today? Yellen replies that GDP is quite a \u2018noisy\u2019 indicator. Other economic data suggests the economy continues to strengthen. Q: So what if the economy doesn\u2019t strengthen? Might you raise rates less rapidly than you expect? Policy isn\u2019t preset, Yellen replies, and it depends on the data*. The Fed will act in a way that encourages further job creation while bringing the real interest rate back towards its neutral level. * - unless it\u2019s \u2018noisy\u2019, I guess.... Q: Are you worried about the consequences if Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts and spending increases aren\u2019t enacted? Yellen says there is an obvious, notable shift in sentiment - but there\u2019s no sign that this has translated into higher spending. The Fed is watching closely in case this changes. On the global economy, Yellen says the situation has improved. But there are still uncertainties, which G20 finance ministers and central bankers will discuss at their meeting this weekend. Yellen is asked about the recent strong stock market rally. She says that the higher level of equities has helped to ease financial conditions. Frances Donald of Manulife Asset Management believes Yellen will be pleased to see the dollar falling. But John Kicklighter of DailyFX isn\u2019t convinced that the language changes in today\u2019s statement don\u2019t really matter. Q: What do you think the neutral real rate of borrowing costs is? Yellen says that lower productivity, and population increases, means that the neutral rate is lower than in the past. Q: Have you met with new Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin since he was appointed? And have you met Donald Trump? Yellen says she has met Mnuchin a couple of times, and fully expects to have a strong relationship with him. She\u2019s also had a \u201cvery brief meeting\u201d with the president, and appreciated that opportunity. Q: Has the Federal Reserve considered the implications of Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus plan? Yellen says they\u2019ve not discussed it, as there is \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d over the character and size of potential policy changes. Q: Why did you remove the word \u2018only\u2019 before the phrase \u2018gradual increases in interest rates\u201d in today\u2019s statement? It\u2019s a relatively small change, Yellen says. Our forecasts for the economy and the federal funds rate are virtually unchanged. Q: You warned that if the Fed were to waiting too long to raise rates, it could be forced into a \u201crapid\u201d increase in rates. What would this look like? Yellen says that she can\u2019t really say what a rapid rate of increases would be. But three rate hikes in a year is certainly \u2018gradual\u2019. Onto questions. Q: What conditions does the Fed want to see before it starts to normalise its balance sheet? (ie, selling some of the assets bought under its stimulus programme since the financial crisis). Yellen says the Fed favours using interest rates, rather than balance sheet adjustments, as their primary tool right now. She points out that the Fed could use its balance sheet if interest rates were cut back down to their lowest possible levels (the zero lower bound). And the Fed will want to be confident in the strength of the economy before starting to shrink the balance sheet. The economic outlook is \u2018highly uncertain\u2019, Yellen continues, adding that policy is not on a preset course. Monetary policy is still accommodative, after today\u2019s rate rises, Yellen says. She warns that if the Fed were to wait too long before normalising policy, it could be forced to raise borrowing costs more rapidly \u201csometime down the road\u201d, causing disruptions in the financial markets. And it\u2019s likely that the \u2018neutral\u2019 level of interest rates is lower than the historical average. Yellen sounds confident about the labor market, saying Fed policymakers \u201cexpect that job conditions with strengthen somewhat further.\u201d Yellen says that today\u2019s interest rate hike is in response to the ongoing recovery in the US economy, and improved conditions in the labor market. Our decision to make another gradual reduction...reflects the economy\u2019s continued progress toward its employment/price stability objectives, the Fed chair explains. Fed chair Janet Yellen is holding a press conference to explain today\u2019s decision. You can watch it live here: You might expect a currency to strengthen when its central bank raises interest rates. But not today. The dollar is now down almost 1 cent against the euro, at $1.068. And it\u2019s lost more than one cent against the pound, which is trading at $1.226. Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon UK , says Janet Yellen has delived what Wall Street expected: \u201cStrong economic and job data from the US has only increased calls on Yellen to hike interest rates, so it is no surprise to see the rise today. Investors will now keep a close eye on the forward look for indications on when the next UK rate rises are scheduled, and today\u2019s US increase adds momentum to the case for this. Significantly, the Federal Reserve has also stated that its inflation target is symmetric. In layman\u2019s terms, that means it is prepared to tolerate prices rising faster than its 2% target. That\u2019s a dovish signal (which explains why the dollar has fallen) Wall Street likes what it sees! The Dow Jones index has now jumped by 86 points to 20,929, a gain of 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500, and the tech-focused Nasdaq index, are both up. The dollar, though, is sinking. That\u2019s because the Fed hasn\u2019t taken a hawkish line and predicted more rate hikes in 2017 or 2018. Today\u2019s statement shows that the Fed still believes that the US economy continues to recover, and can cope with higher borrowing costs. It says that \u2018fixed investment\u2019 by US firms appears to have firmed; that indicates that companies are confident about growth prospects. It also expects inflation to stabilise around its 2% target in the medium term - a sign that it doesn\u2019t intent to hike rates aggressively. The Fed also says that the near-term risks to the US economy are \u2018roughly balanced\u2019. Here\u2019s a key section of the report: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in February indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months. Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment appears to have firmed somewhat. Here\u2019s the new Fed dot plot, showing where policymakers expect interest rates to be over the next few years. There are a few minor moves, but the bottom line is that the Fed still expects three rate hikes this year, and in 2018. The Federal Reserve still expects to raise interest rates three times this year (including today\u2019s move). The decision to raise US interest rates is not unanimous, though! Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, argued against a rate hike. He\u2019s been arguing that there isn\u2019t enough pressure on wages to justify a hike. The other nine policymakers outvoted Kashkari, though, and decided a rate hike was needed. Breaking! The Federal Reserve has voted to raise US interest rates at today\u2019s meeting. The Fed has responded to the latest solid economic data by hiking borrowing costs by a quarter of one percent. That moves the Federal Funds rate up to 0.75% to 1.0% (up from 0.5% to 0.75%) It\u2019s the first interest rate rise in 2017 (the last one was in December), and only the third since the financial crisis struck. This won\u2019t shock Wall Street, as most economists had predicted a hike today. But everyone is now racing to read the statement, and to prepare for Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference in 30 minutes time. More to follow! Not everyone is excited, though.... The excitement is building.... This was the scene on Wall Street a little while ago, as traders got ready for the Fed\u2019s decision on interest rates: With a rate hike widely expected, the real questions are: How dovish or hawkish will Fed chair Janet Yellen sound? Will the Fed change its prediction for three rate rises this year? Will Yellen comment on Donald Trump? Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says investors will look closely at the \u2018dot plot\u2019 produced by the Fed, showing how policymakers expect borrowing costs to rise. The Fed is a pussy-cat that would like to change its spots into something more like a leopard\u2019s. In practical terms, that means that this evening\u2019s FOMC announcement (6pm GMT, with a press conference half an hour later) is all about the Fed\u2019s projections rather than whether they raise rates or not. Anything other than a 25bp rate hike would be a huge surprise to the market Discounting that possibility on the grounds that the Fed is so (too) obsessed with managing market expectations ahead of policy moves, what we\u2019ll watch are the \u2018dots\u2019 showing FOMC\u2019s projections of where Fed Funds might go. Market pricing of Fed Funds through 2017-19 is at the bottom end of what the Fed currently projects. Our US economists think that the 2017/18 dots probably won\u2019t move but beyond that, an upward adjustment is possible to send a signal to the market that the FOMC is serious about normalising policy. While we wait for the Fed rate decision, this piece in the FT (\u00a3) entitled Brexit means the end of single market access for London is an interesting read. Christian Noyer, the former chairman of the Bank for International Settlements and former governor of the Banque de France, writes: Will London\u2019s financial institutions lose access to the single market after the UK leaves the EU? When one looks at the legal framework, underlying logic and, in particular, precedents from the European Economic Area, the answer is yes. \u201cBrexit means Brexit.\u201d There are three conditions for full access to the EU single market and \u201cpassporting rights\u201d for financial institutions. First, implementation of EU regulations under the control of the European Court of Justice; second, payment of a sizeable contribution to the EU budget; and third, the \u201cfour freedoms\u201d. A country refusing to meet these conditions cannot be part of the EU single market because it rejects the market\u2019s logic. It\u2019s as simple as that. Some observers, however, believe they can secure entry through the back door after exiting through the front. It is called \u201cfree access on the basis of regulatory equivalence\u201d. It is worth noting that, if this were truly possible, the foundations of the single market would be undermined, a key element of EU cohesion would be destroyed and the entire EEA concept would probably die. European stock markets have now closed. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.15% to 7368.64 The Dax in Frankfurt rose 0.18% to 12,009.87 The CAC in Paris rose 0.23% to 4,985.48 The Ibex in Madrid rose 0.79% to 9,983.20 The FTSE MiB in Milan rose 1.2% to 19,774.02 Renaultgate? Shares in the French carmaker fell today after a French newspaper report claimed its vehicles were equipped with software allowing them to cheat in pollution tests. Lib\u00e9ration said it had obtained an investigative document from the economy ministry, which indicated that two models \u2013 the Renault Captur and the Clio IV \u2013 spewed emissions more than 300% above the legal limit in real-life conditions. Renault described the article as \u201cunbalanced\u201d but declined to comment further, saying it had no access to the confidential investigation. As a consequence, Renault cannot confirm the veracity, completeness and reliability of the information published in the said article. Renault will prove its compliance with the regulations and reserves its explanations for the judges in charge of investigating this case. The company said its vehicles had met regulatory standards and stressed that \u201cthey are not equipped with cheating software affecting anti-pollution systems\u201d. French prosecutors said in January that they would look into possible cheating by Renault, after independent experts found high levels of diesel emissions at several carmakers, including Renault. Renault\u2019s premises were also raided, in the aftermath of the Volkswagen emissions scandal in September 2015. The German carmaker admitted to installing software in its vehicles to cheat US diesel emissions tests. Renault recalled 15,000 cars last year over excessive levels of harmful gases, but the company insisted there was no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing. In London, gains on the FTSE 100 are led by oil and mining firms, keeping the index close to its recent all-time high. But this could change after the Fed decision. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, said: Indeed, European and UK equities have been more resilient of late than their US counterparts, with some of this down to weaker domestic currencies. The risk for the likes of the FTSE and the Dax is therefore that a less hawkish Fed tonight could spike a rally for sterling and the euro, causing some of the most recent outperformance to reverse. Overall today has felt like a market that is in dire need of a catalyst, so traders will be hoping that Janet Yellen provides just that. On currency markets, the dollar slipped after the disappointing retail sales data \u2013 despite expectations of a rate hike from the Fed later today. There are question marks over the rate outlook further out, given the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s fiscal policy. The dollar index drifted 0.2% lower. The Fed\u2019s \u201cdot plots\u201d \u2013 its interest rate projections \u2013 currently suggest three rate hikes this year but there is concern that the Fed\u2019s language may sound more dovish than before. The pound earlier hit its highest level this week, of $1.2258, recovering from an eight-week low yesterday caused by fears of a drawn-out Brexit. Sterling is now trading at $1.2218, up 0.5%. The euro is also up against the dollar, trading 0.25% higher at $1.0628. Concerns about the outcome of the Dutch parliamentary elections today were offset by market speculation that the European Central Bank may soon unwind its stimulus programme. Markets are calm ahead of the eagerly awaited Fed decision, with European stock markets holding on to their gains. FTSE 100 in London up 0.2% Dax in Frankfurt up 0.2% CAC in Paris up 0.25% Ibex in Madrid up 0.9% FTSE MiB in Milan up 1% On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is 0.2% ahead while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq is flat. Brent crude has gained 1.3%, to $51.61 a barrel, after data showed US crude stocks fell last week following nine consecutive increases. The International Energy Agency said global inventories rose in January for the first time despite the Opec output cuts. But if the oil cartel sticks to its production curbs, the IEA predicted a deficit of 500,000 barrels a day for the first half of this year. Also, delays in processing tax refunds by the US government weighed on consumers\u2019 ability to spend in February. Compared with February last year, retail sales were up 5.7%. Inflation in the US hit a five-year high last month, rising to 2.7%, as we reported earlier. At the same time, retail sales weakened, as households bought fewer cars and cut back on discretionary spending, according to the latest data published today. Retail sales rose just 0.1% in February, the weakest reading since August, suggesting the economy lost some momentum in the first quarter. Analysts weren\u2019t concerned, though, noting that January\u2019s number was revised higher to a 0.6% rise from 0.4%. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: Overall, inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough. Nothing here to suggest the Fed shouldn\u2019t raise interest rates at the FOMC meeting that concludes later today. Jane Sydenham, investment director of Rathbones Investment Management, says that because a Fed rate hike at today\u2019s meeting has already been priced in, the impact on markets is likely to be small. After flag waving for more than a year, it would be surprising if Yellen didn\u2019t take the opportunity to raise rates today, especially in light of all the positive data. Facing such a known unknown, markets have almost certainly priced this in and the impact is likely to be minimal. What investors need to be more mindful of is that this may be just the first of three possible rate rises this calendar year, but other rises will be dependent on continuing strength in economic data and an inflation rate that remains at a manageable level. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at brokerage Xtrade, believes that tonight will mark the beginning of a series of Fed rate hikes, and the Bank of England could soon follow suit. The way the US economy is moving at the moment, we can see the Fed raising interest rates at least three, if not four, times this year. Although, if Donald Trump gets his way then it will almost certainly be the latter. Business in the US is arguably strong enough to dust off rates up to 2% this year, but Janet Yellen will be wary of moving too fast with plenty of political uncertainty still circling in Europe. As soon as the Fed moves today, the BoE may not be too far behind. Raising rates amidst the uncertainty of Brexit is of course risky, but with inflation soaring an April rate hike looks about right. Sam Fleming of the FT has written a preview of today\u2019s Fed meeting. Here\u2019s a flavour: It would now be a significant shock if the US central bank did not lift the target range for the federal funds rate by another quarter point from the current 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent. The chances of a move were seen by markets at around 95 per cent going into the meeting, according to a CME Group analysis of futures prices. So the issue for investors is judging whether the next move could come as soon as June and whether there is the possibility of four increases this year, rather than the three predicted in December. Either way, the Fed is still likely to characterise its rate-raising plans as \u201cgradual\u201d. Over in New York, shares are rising at the start of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are all showing modest gains, as investors get ready for the Federal Reserve meeting. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, says the rise in US inflation (see earlier post) means a rate rise is even more likely today: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show inflation climbed to a five-year high for the second consecutive month, reinforcing strong expectations of a Fed interest rate hike on Wednesday. \u201cUnder current levels of inflationary pressures, Janet Yellen has little choice but to pencil in a first rate when the Fed convenes later today. \u201cDespite uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s policies, it remains a question of how many hikes we will see this year, with investors fretting over the prospect of four.\u201d Just in: America\u2019s inflation rate has hit its highest level since March 2012, underlining why US interest rates are likely to rise later today. The US consumer prices index rose by 2.7% year-on-year in February, up from 2.5% in January. On a monthly basis, prices crept up by 0.1%. Nothing here to scare the Federal Reserve away from raising interest rates in five hours time, I suspect. And here\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott, on the worrying slowdown in wage growth: Average earnings in the three months to January were 2.3% higher than a year earlier: in the three months to December 2016 they rose at an annual rate of 2.6%. These figures speak volumes about the modern labour market and in particular how the balance of power has shifted in the past four decades. Even when jobs are relatively plentiful and inflation is picking up, workers are unwilling or unable to press for higher pay. The reasons for this transformation is obvious: deindustrialisation and the growth of employment in the non-unionised service sector; curbs on the power of trade unions; an increase in labour supply. In addition, the one area where trade union density remains high \u2013 the public sector \u2013 is subject to a 1% pay cap. More here: Here\u2019s Angela Monaghan\u2019s take on this morning\u2019s UK unemployment report: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to its joint lowest level since 1975 but wage growth also slowed in a sign of the fresh squeeze in living standards facing UK households. The jobless rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to January from 4.8% in the previous three months, matching the rate last seen in 2005. It was last lower in the three months to August 1975, when it was 4.6% according to the Office for National Statistics. Despite the fall, total pay including bonuses slowed sharply from 2.6% to 2.2%, the lowest since early 2016. Real pay growth \u2013 adjusted for inflation \u2013 was just 0.7%, the weakest in more than two years. The employment rate was unchanged at 74.6%, the highest since records began in 1971....

This follows a stream of protests from Conservative MPs, especially as the party had promised NOT to raise national insurance rates in its manifesto for the 2015 election Here\u2019s the key section from Hammond\u2019s letter announcing the change: Hammond is due to speak to MPs about this change of heart, around 2.30pm. Our Politics Live blog will be tracking it: Today\u2019s report also shows that the UK employment total rose by 92,000 in the last three months, to a new record high of 31.854m. Employment Minister Damian Hinds says it\u2019s a good sign: \u201cI\u2019m delighted by another set of record-breaking figures showing more people in work than ever before and unemployment falling to its lowest in 12 years. \u201cEmployment is up, wages are up and there are more people working full-time. This is good news for hard-working families across the UK as we continue to build a country that works for everyone. \u201cBut we have more to do, which is why we\u2019re pressing ahead with our welfare reforms to ensure that it always pays to be in work.\u201d The recovery in Britain\u2019s jobs sector in recent years has not been shared equally across the country. This chart, from the Resolution Foundation, shows how some parts of the country have enjoyed strong growth creation, while others are lagging. The drop in real wage growth, to just 0.8%, is \u201cterrible news\u201d, warns the Resolution Foundation. Laura Gardiner, their senior policy analyst, fears that Britain\u2019s \u201cshort-lived pay recovery\u201d could end soon. Weak pay rises and rising inflation mean that a fresh squeeze is due later this year, and has already begun for some workers, especially in the public sector. \u201cThe incredibly poor outlook for pay has pushed a return to pre-crash earnings back well into the next parliament, making the 2010s the weakest decade for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, is also concerned by the weak pay growth. He believes it will prevent the Bank of England raising interest rates this year. Regular pay growth was disappointing at just 2.3%, and with inflation rising, a squeeze on real household incomes is a major reason why we expect economic growth to slow this year. We expect the MPC to keep interest rates on hold until 2019 at the earliest.\u201d A couple more charts from today\u2019s report: The drop in average earnings (ex bonuses) to 2.3% per year in November-January means that real wage growth has dropped again. UK inflation was 1.2% in November, 1.6% in December, and a blistering 1.8% in January. So real wage growth was actually only around 0.8%. Inflation is likely to have jumped again in February (we find out next week) John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, fears that inflation could overtake wage growth this year: \u201cUK jobs growth was more robust than expected in the three months to January, rising by over 90,000 compared to the previous three months. The momentum of jobs growth actually looks somewhat stronger now than a few months ago, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.7%, its lowest level since 1975. For the moment, the jobs market remains in fine fettle. \u201cThere was less good news on average earnings growth, which fell back to just 2.2% in the three months to January. With consumer price inflation already up to 1.8% in January and set to rise further over the coming months, real earnings growth could be back in negative territory by the end of 2017. This is likely to dampen consumer spending, which could eventually feed through into slower jobs growth as well.\u201d Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says the UK labour market seems to be in good shape: \u201cThe UK\u2019s jobs market is going from strength to strength, with the number of people in work continuing to rise and unemployment also falling. But Thiru also expects unemployment to rise in the months ahead, while wage growth stalls: \u201cUK labour market conditions may cool over the next few years as the expected slowdown in growth and the rising burden of upfront business costs stifle firms\u2019 hiring intentions. That said, we expect that the UK unemployment rate will reach a peak of 5.3% next year, still some way below the historical average. \u201cHowever, average pay growth continues to slow, and it appears increasingly likely that inflation will outstrip earnings growth in the coming months, which will put further pressure on consumer\u2019s spending power. The number of self-employed people in the UK is rising faster than the number of employed workers, today\u2019s report shows. The ONS reports that in the last year: employees increased by 144,000 to 26.83 million (84.2% of all people in work) self-employed people increased by 148,000 to 4.80 million (15.1% of all people in work) Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at Lancaster University\u2019s Work Foundation, says the rise in \u2018gig economy\u2019 jobs (such as delivery drivers) is responsible: \u201cThe latest labour market statistics show a large rise in employment and a fall in unemployment (with the rate down to 4.7%). The big gain has come from full-time self-employment - a rise of some 94000 on the quarter - perpetuating the apparent ascendancy of the gig economy. Professor Johnes is also concerned that wage growth dropped again: to just 2.2% year on year. \u201cOver the last quarter of 2016 there was a large rise in employment in construction - some 36000 new jobs in this sector. The fall in unemployment is patchy across regions, with the latest regional data indicating increases in both London and the West Midlands. \u201cIncreases in total pay, however, continue to be moderate, with the three month average now growing at an annual rate of 2.2% (down from 2.6% last month). Specifically in construction, the rate of growth has collapsed, and this may be an early sign that the employment growth in that sector may not last.\u201d Technically, Britain\u2019s jobless rate is now at its joint lowest for 42 years. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.7% in 2005. It\u2019s not been lower since the heady days of 1975, the year Queen released Bohemian Rhapsody, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail hit the screens. Here\u2019s the key points from today\u2019s UK jobs report (which is online here) Breaking! Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to its joint lowest level since 1975, at 4.7% in the three months to January. That\u2019s down from 4.8% a month ago, according to today\u2019s report from The Office for National Statistics. It suggests that Britain\u2019s labour market hasn\u2019t been hit badly by the Brexit vote. But.... wage growth has slowed sharply. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, only rose by 2.3% year-on-year - down from 2.6% a month ago. That\u2019s even worse than expected, and means that real wage growth has taken another hit. Including bonuses, average earnings only rose by 2.2% - the weakest rise since April 2016. More details and reaction to follow! Here\u2019s a reminder of how real pay growth (wages minus inflation) has slowed in the last few months: Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at ayondo markets, believes European investors will be crossing their fingers and hoping that the liberal VVD party led by Mark Rutte wins the most seats in today\u2019s Dutch election. Hiscott says: \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Dutch elections could be yet another watershed moment for Europe, leading to further political fragmentation. With a country known for its liberal traditions, it\u2019s been surprising that Geert Wilders and his PVV party have managed to assert themselves so much, taking the lead at some point in the last few weeks. \u201cMost recently though the VVD - the People\u2019s Party for Freedom &amp; Democracy - has re-taken the lead and investors looking for stability in the financial markets will welcome this. The possibility of the PVV coming to power, with its anti-EU stance, could have had a dramatically effect on the EUR FX and Dutch equities markets, both largely negative. But as I flagged up earlier, the Dutch voting system - and its fragmented politics - means a coalition government is all-but certain. And with all the other main parties vowing not to work with Wilders, the blonde populist could be thwarted. Duncan Robinson of the FT has done a good preview: European stock markets are up across the board this morning. The FTSE 100 has gained 0.2% to 7,373 points - less than 20 points shy of its all-time high. That suggests investors aren\u2019t too anxious about the UK jobs report, or the US rate decision. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx suspects traders will be watching the Dutch election closely: There isn\u2019t a lot for the region to do today, so any political news out of the Netherlands might be its main driver of movement as Wednesday progresses. Analyst Jens Bastian points out that the Netherland\u2019s political drama has implications for the rest of Europe. It could slow down the process of handing more bailout money to Greece: (not that Greece and her creditors have reached an agreement on its bailout programme) The pound is having a good morning, jumping almost one cent against the US dollar to $1.223. Some traders are attributing the rise to a report in The Times today, which argues that the Bank of England should consider raising interest rates soon. The Times runs its own \u2018shadow monetary policy committee\u2019, which gives its own views on what the BoE ought to do. And three of its members believe rates need to rise now, back to 0.5%, to address the jump in inflation. Another three reckon rates should rise in April. Charles Goodhart, a former Bank ratesetter, argues that the Bank should send a signal when it announces this month\u2019s decision, tomorrow: \u201cThey should lay the ground in the accompanying minutes for a possible increase in interest rates at their next meeting.\u201d There\u2019s a chance that Britain\u2019s jobless rate could hit a new 11-year low of 4.7% today, down from last month\u2019s 4.8%. That\u2019s according to RBC Capital Markets, who also predict that wage growth will slow. Last month\u2019s strong report emphatically removed the skew of risks on the unemployment rate rising from 4.8% to 4.9%. Indeed, if anything, the skew of risks on this occasion is that it could actually drop to 4.7% but our central expectation is that unemployment holds at 4.8% for a fifth consecutive month. The 3m/3m employment level looks set to post a healthy gain too as the recently softness provides a relatively easy comparator for the latest data. The 37k 3m/3m gain last time should well at least be matched on this occasion. For average earnings we look for growth to ease to 2.4% 3m/y for both the including and excluding bonus measures from 2.6% 3m/y last time. This would be consistent with the message from the Bank of England Agents\u2019 recent survey on pay settlements which pointed towards growth slowing from 2.7% on average in 2016 to 2.2% for 2017 More than eight years after bailing Lloyds Banking Group out, the British government has taken another step towards the exit door. The UK has sold another slice of Lloyds shares, taking its stake below the 3% level. According to the Treasury, this means taxpayers have recovered over \u00a319.5bn of the \u00a320.3bn which they put into Lloyds, once share sales and dividends received are accounted for. Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Simon Kirby, says: \u201cLloyds\u2019 recent annual results show that we are in a good position to reduce our shareholding further and expect to recover all of the money taxpayers injected into the bank during the financial crisis.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Central bankers like to avoid surprising the markets. So with everyone expecting a US interest rate rise tonight, there\u2019s no reason for the Federal Reserve to worry about announcing its first hike of 2017. But it\u2019s not quite a simple as that. Investors across the globe want to know how rapidly the Fed will act this year - is it still expecting three rate hikes this year? Might we only see two, or should traders brace for as many as four? That means we could see market volatility when the Fed releases its statement, and when Janet Yellen faces the press. We have to wait a few hours for this excitement, though: 2pm EDT/6pm GMT: Fed interest rate decision 2.30pm EDT/6.30pm GMT: Press conference with Fed chair Janet Yellen But in the meantime, we\u2019re also getting a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s jobs market at 9.30am. Economists expect that the UK unemployment rate will remain at just 4.8% in the thee months to January, its lowest since the financial crisis. But the wages figures could show a slight slowdown, with average earnings (excluding bonuses) tipped to rise by 2.5% per year, down from 2.6% last month. That would be a worry, given inflation is picking up. Also coming up: It\u2019s election day in the Netherlands. Can far-right leader Geert Wilders notch up another win for the populists and beat mainstream rivals, such as PM Mark Rutte\u2019s VVD? Results are expected in the early hours of Thursday. No party is likely to win a majority meaning it could take weeks for a coalition to be agreed. European stock markets are expected to rise modestly in early trading.",

      "bodyText": "The news that Jones Bootmaker is on the brink of falling into administration is a reminder of just how tough life is on the high street. The 160-year-old shoe retailer may yet be rescued, but about 1,000 workers are unsure about their future employment. Profits for bricks-and-mortar shops are being squeezed by the rise of online shopping, an increase in staff costs brought on by the introduction of the national living wage, and fierce discounting of the price of their products, which is designed to attract shoppers but hurts profit margins. On top of this is business rates \u2013 a tax that takes no account of falling profit and is now more costly than corporation tax for many shops. However, there is hope for the high street shop. Look at Inditex, the owner of Zara. It has just published record annual sales and profits. It has done this by taking full advantage of the benefits of a physical shop \u2013 store managers are given the power to order the clothing for their shop so it is tailored to the local population, the clothing range is changed frequently, and many items are produced in Europe to ensure that shops can get new stock quickly and sell the latest fashion trends. Any new owner of Jones Bootmaker should make a call to Amancio Ortega, the founder of Inditex and Europe\u2019s richest man. Full employment? Maybe \u2013 but with no wage rise in sight The last time Britain\u2019s unemployment rate was lower than it is now was in the summer of 1975. For those whose memories don\u2019t stretch that far back it was the time of the UK\u2019s first referendum on EU membership, Harold Wilson was prime minister and inflation was at at postwar peak of more than 25%. The contrast with today\u2019s labour market is stark. Joblessness stands at 4.7%, a level that many economists would consider close to full employment, yet there is not the glimmer of the upward pressure on wages that was so evident in the mid-70s. Back then, increases in the cost of living were matched by demands for higher pay, which in turn led to higher inflation. Eventually, governments of both left and right resorted to statutory incomes policies as they sought to bring inflation down. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests that the UK now has a non-statutory incomes policy, enforced by employers rather than by Whitehall. Unemployment in the three months to January 2017 was 105,000 lower than in the previous quarter and employment was up by 92,000. Yet, wage pressure over the same period abated. Average earnings in the three months to January were 2.3% higher than a year earlier: in the three months to December 2016 they rose at an annual rate of 2.6%. These figures speak volumes about the modern labour market and in particular how the balance of power has shifted in the past four decades. Even when jobs are relatively plentiful and inflation is picking up, workers are unwilling or unable to press for higher pay. The reasons for this transformation is obvious: de-industrialisation and the growth of employment in the non-unionised service sector; curbs on the power of trade unions; an increase in labour supply. In addition, the one area where trade union density remains high \u2013 the public sector \u2013 is subject to a 1% pay cap. Here at least, statutory incomes policy lives on. While record levels of employment are welcome, the weakness of pay means that consumer spending is going to be squeezed hard over the coming months. Inflation is running at 1.8% and will soon overtake earnings growth. Most people will keep their jobs and they will still be able to afford their mortgages because the lack of any wage pressure means the Bank of England will keep interest rates ultra-low. But the feelgood factor will be noticeable by its absence. Lloyds: chancellor on the final straight The finishing line is in sight for the government in its efforts to sell off its stake in Lloyds Banking Group. The announcement that another one percentage point stake has been sold off reduces the taxpayer holding to 2.95%. At this rate, by early May, the government will have got shot of the entire holding, which once stood at 43%. It will not be the finale that the government had hoped for, without the flourish of a discounted offering for retail investors and with the admission a chunk of the shares were sold below the 73.6p break-even point. Still, it will be one item struck off the chancellor\u2019s to do list, in contrast to Royal Bank of Scotland, where the government stake still stands at 73% and a return to private ownership is nowhere in sight.",

Maybe \u2013 but with no wage rise in sight</h2> <p>The last time Britain\u2019s unemployment rate was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/15/uk-unemployment-rate-falls-joint-lowest-1975-wages-stall\">lower than it is now</a> was in the summer of 1975. For those whose memories don\u2019t stretch that far back it was the time of the UK\u2019s first referendum on EU membership, Harold Wilson was prime minister and inflation was at at postwar peak of more than 25%.</p> <p>The contrast with today\u2019s labour market is stark. Joblessness stands at 4.7%, a level that many economists would consider close to full employment, yet there is not the glimmer of the upward pressure on wages that was so evident in the mid-70s.</p> <p>Back then, increases in the cost of living were matched by demands for higher pay, which in turn led to higher inflation. Eventually, governments of both left and right resorted to statutory incomes policies as they sought to bring inflation down.</p> <p>The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests that the UK now has a non-statutory incomes policy, enforced by employers rather than by Whitehall. Unemployment in the three months to January 2017 was 105,000 lower than in the previous quarter and employment was up by 92,000.</p> <p>Yet, wage pressure over the same period abated. Average earnings in the three months to January were 2.3% higher than a year earlier: in the three months to December 2016 they rose at an annual rate of 2.6%.</p> <p>These figures speak volumes about the modern labour market and in particular how the balance of power has shifted in the past four decades. Even when jobs are relatively plentiful and inflation is picking up, workers are unwilling or unable to press for higher pay.</p> <p>The reasons for this transformation is obvious: de-industrialisation and the growth of employment in the non-unionised service sector; curbs on the power of trade unions; an increase in labour supply. In addition, the one area where trade union density remains high \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/15/public-sector-workers-cut-pay-resolution-foundation\">the public sector</a> \u2013 is subject to a 1% pay cap. Here at least, statutory incomes policy lives on.</p> <p>While record levels of employment are welcome, the weakness of pay means that consumer spending is going to be squeezed hard over the coming months. Inflation is running at 1.8% and will soon overtake earnings growth. Most people will keep their jobs and they will still be able to afford their mortgages because the lack of any wage pressure means the Bank of England will keep interest rates ultra-low. But the feelgood factor will be noticeable by its absence.</p> <h2>Lloyds: chancellor on the final straight </h2> <p>The finishing line is in sight for the government in its efforts to sell off its stake in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group\">Lloyds Banking Group</a>. The announcement that another one percentage point stake has been sold off reduces the taxpayer holding to 2.95%. At this rate, by early May, the government will have got shot of the entire holding, which once stood at 43%. It will not be the finale that the government had hoped for, without the flourish of a discounted offering for retail investors and with the admission a chunk of the shares were sold below the 73.6p break-even point.</p> <p>Still, it will be one item struck off the chancellor\u2019s to do list, in contrast to Royal Bank of Scotland, where the government stake still stands at 73% and a return to private ownership is nowhere in sight. </p>",

      "bodyText": "It could have been worse. That was Wall Street\u2019s initial response to the decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise borrowing costs in the world\u2019s biggest economy by a quarter of a point. For once, the market reaction was entirely rational. The increase in interest rates was expected and it would have been a real surprise had Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the US central bank decided against a move. Indeed, the strength of employment growth reported last week had led to speculation that the Fed might just be planning a half-point move. That would certainly have led to a sell-off in the stock market since it would have been a tacit admission that Yellen and the Fed were playing catch up. Some economists think that is indeed the case \u2013 and that just as in the early 2000s the Fed is doing too little too late. They point to inflation running at 2.7% and an unemployment rate of 4.7% as evidence that price pressures have already started to build. But the economic news has not all been upbeat. US growth was modest in the final three months of 2016 and the early evidence is that the first quarter of 2017 was no great shakes either. And while the unemployment rate is low, that is partly because millions of Americans have left the labour market altogether after giving up hope of ever finding work. The US is certainly not firing on all cylinders despite almost a decade of ultra-low interest rates and large dollops of money creation via the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programme. Hence the key messages from Yellen on Wednesday were that rates will continue to rise but at a cautious pace. She stressed that the central bank expected the economy to grow at a rate that would warrant gradual increases in interest rates. That will be taken as a hint that there will be two more rises during the course of 2017. The Fed has now raised interest rates three times in the past 15 months. Clearly, the period of ultra-low borrowing costs is at an end. The so-called normalisation of rates is under way. But it is also obvious that the Fed sees the new normal as being quite different to the old normal. In the mid-2000s, Alan Greenspan\u2019s Fed raised interest rates 17 times in gradual quarter-point jumps until they topped 5%. This time, the Fed sees rates peaking at a much lower level \u2013 about 3% \u2013 and as things stand they won\u2019t get there until 2019. In the short term, the steady increase in US interest rates will support an already strong dollar. One of the ironies of QE is that it was supposed to encourage investors to buy risky assets yet has led instead to a flight into safe havens such as the greenback and US bonds. The growing differential between US rates and those in Japan, the eurozone and the UK will lead to further support for the dollar unless the American economy shows signs of weakness. With Donald Trump planning tax cuts and spending increases, Wall Street currently sees that as unlikely. But Yellen is aware that Greenspan\u2019s softly-softly approach to raising rates ended with an almighty financial crisis and the biggest US slump since the 1930s. She is keen to avoid a repeat performance.",

      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve has sought to head off rising inflation with a third interest rate rise since the 2008 financial crash and the second in three months, taking the base rate from 0.75% to 1%. The central bank set aside concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on consumer spending to confirm analyst projections that it is prepared to increase rates several times this year to keep a lid on inflation as it rises above its 2% target level. The Fed\u2019s chair, Janet Yellen, said a wide range of indicators showed the US economy was in rude health, allowing its interest rate setting committee to push rates back towards historically normal levels. Policymakers voted nine to one to raise rates. Speaking after the decision, Yellen said she had met Donald Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, \u201ca couple of times\u201d but had only been \u201cintroduced\u201d to the president himself. \u201cI fully expect to have a strong relationship with secretary Mnuchin,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had good discussions about the economy, about regulatory objectives, the work of the FSOC [Financial Stability Oversight Council] global economic developments, and I look forward to continuing to work with him.\u201d She said she had had a very brief meeting with Trump \u201cand appreciated that as well\u201d. Earlier in the day the Department of Commerce said retail sales had inched up by 0.1% in February, and that they had been better than it had previously estimated in January. The Department of Labor said consumer prices were 2.7% higher in February than a year earlier. After excluding the costs of food and energy, inflation was 2.2%. A housing market index from the National Association of Home Builders also surged to its highest level since 2005. US stock markets moved up on the news, rising 90 points in the minutes after the decision, and US crude rose 2%. The increases were modest following Yellen\u2019s signals in December that interest rates were on an upward path. Investors were also caught out by Yellen\u2019s bullish comments in the wake of the announcement and by projections showing that 11 of her 17 policymaking colleagues saw borrowing costs rising another three times in 2017. Dennis de Jong, the managing director of the currency trader UFX.com, said: \u201cGiven the bloating effect Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has had on US inflation, it would have been more of a surprise had Fed Chair Janet Yellen not announced a rate hike at today\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. \u201cTrump\u2019s grand plans for American infrastructure spending have signalled an about-turn for US economic policy \u2013 after just one rate increase in ten years, we\u2019ve now seen two in the space of three months, and plenty more are expected for 2017. \u201cThis all spells bad news for US borrowers, who will likely have to foot a larger bill over the coming months. With at least three more hikes on the cards by the end of the year, today\u2019s news could hit many where it hurts the most \u2013 the pocket.\u201d Some economists argue that weak wages and productivity growth in the US will limit the Fed\u2019s rate increases to a handful before reaching a peak at around 2%. Gus Faucher, the deputy chief economist at the stockbroker PNC, said: \u201cI think the concern, in terms of why the Fed is raising rates now, is that inflation is picking up. The unemployment rate is 4.7% and that\u2019s putting upward pressure on prices.\u201d He told the Guardian economic forces were acting against a return to interest rate levels of 4-5% seen before the 2008 crash. \u201cWe have slower labor force growth because of the ageing of the baby boomers, [and thus] slower productivity growth in terms of output per worker,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has reduced the potential for long-run growth, it\u2019s reduced inflationary pressures, and I think rates in the future will be lower than they have been in the past.\u201d Faucher also said further interest rate rises could dent consumer spending, which has come to rely on cheap loans. \u201cI do think eventually that higher interest rates are going to have an impact on rates for car loans, so that may be a problem for automakers. It may be a problem for big-ticket durable items, home appliances, stuff like that.\u201d There is a ceiling on those effects, though, and Faucher doesn\u2019t think they will affect home loans. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much bleed over into mortgage rates; it\u2019s mostly the short-term borrowers,\u201d he said. Fed policymakers are known to be concerned that the tax cuts and extra government spending Trump has demanded could overheat the economy and lead to a deep recession. Should that happen, the Fed will want to have substantial interest rates in place.",

The unemployment rate is 4.7% and that\u2019s putting upward pressure on prices.\u201d</p> <p>He told the Guardian economic forces were acting against a return to interest rate levels of 4-5% seen before the 2008 crash.</p> <p>\u201cWe have slower labor force growth because of the ageing of the baby boomers, [and thus] slower productivity growth in terms of output per worker,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has reduced the potential for long-run growth, it\u2019s reduced inflationary pressures, and I think rates in the future will be lower than they have been in the past.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-15T17:05:38/embed.html\" data-alt=\"US retail sales\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-15T17:05:38/embed.html\">US retail sales</a> </figure>  <p>Faucher also said further interest rate rises could dent consumer spending, which has come to rely on cheap loans.</p> <p>\u201cI do think eventually that higher interest rates are going to have an impact on rates for car loans, so that may be a problem for automakers.

      "bodyText": "The multibillionaire behind the Zara retail chain has banked another \u00a31bn after the fashion group reported record sales and profits. Amancio Ortega, Europe\u2019s richest man, will receive \u20ac1.26bn (\u00a31.1bn) from Inditex, the Spanish company he started more than four decades ago, which owns Zara and many other brands.. Ortega, 80, is still the biggest shareholder in Galicia-based Inditex and will receive the cash as dividend payments after the company revealed record financial results for 2016. The world\u2019s fourth richest person and the wealthiest European, Ortega has a fortune estimated at $71.5bn (\u00a358bn), according to the Forbes World\u2019s Billionaires rankings. Only Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates ($86.bn), investor Warren Buffett ($78.3bn) and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos ($73.4bn) are wealthier. The world\u2019s largest clothing retailer said it would pay shareholders a dividend \u20ac0.68 per share, up 13.3% year on year, as a result of the group\u2019s record results. Ortega\u2019s shareholding will generate the \u00a31bn payout, and take the total earned by the billionaire from this single source to more than \u20ac6bn since 2010. The billonaire owns almost 60% of Inditex through two companies, Pontegadea Inversiones and Partler. He is fiercely private \u2013 rarely interviewed and hardly photographed \u2013 but he is a familiar face in La Coru\u00f1a, the Galician city in northern Spain and a short distance from Arteixo, where Inditex is headquartered. Ortega opened the first Zara store in A Coru\u00f1a in 1975. He was a local clothing manufacturer who had worked his way up from being a delivery boy at a shirtmakers and went on to build Inditex, now a global retailer. Inditex reported a 10% jump in same-store sales in 2016, after it invested \u20ac1.4bn in its warehouses, technology, new stores and online expansion. Sales grew in all markets, including the UK \u2013 where some rivals, such as Next and Marks &amp; Spencer, have found trade tough. Net profit also rose 10%, to \u20ac3.2bn, while total sales rose to more than \u20ac23bn. Pablo Isla, the chair and chief executive of Inditex, said: \u201cThese are a positive set of results against a backdrop of strong prior-year performance. This is a direct result of the commitment, spirit and ambition of all the professionals comprising the group, their dedication to the company, passion for fashion and focus on sustainability.\u201d The company, which also includes the Massimo Dutti and Pull &amp; Bear brands, opened 279 stores last year in 56 markets, taking its total number of shops to almost 7,300. There were 51 new Zara stores, bringing the worldwide total to more than 2,200. Inditex employs 162,450 people after creating about 9,600 jobs in 2016. It has invested heavily in its warehouses in its home country, to allow clothing to be packed and dispatched at a faster rate. The company said highlights in 2016 included the rollout of a Zara range designed to mark the release of the Rolling Stones\u2019 new album, Blue &amp; Lonesome, and the Join Life collection, made with sustainable fabrics. Zara Home launched its first perfume for men and women, as well as its first washing powder, fabric conditioner and ironing range. In the UK, Inditex refurbished its flagship Bershka store on Oxford Street in London and is currently expanding its Zara store in the capital\u2019s Westfield White City shopping centre. The group has announced plans to hand employees more than \u20ac535m in 2017, over and above their ordinary salaries. Richard Chamberlain, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the results for 2016 were reassuring. \u201cWe view Inditex as a long-term global multi-channel winner in apparel. We see potential for it to generate durable low- to mid-teens growth over time,\u201d he added. Zara\u2019s fast fashion is speedy route to big profits Zara\u2019s record sales over the past year will surprise no one in the fashion industry who\u2019s looked inside a store in the past 12 months. Like C\u00e9line or Johanna Ortiz but can\u2019t afford them? Zara had the same looks at just 5% of the designer price. Yet despite spending nothing on advertising, the 10% increase in sales suggests Zara has transcended fashion-forward, mid-range shops such as Mango and H&amp;M. It is now a status brand rather than just an affordable high street shop, with fans including the Duchess of Cambridge and street-style star Olivia Palermo. Long known for its knack for borrowing from the catwalk and repurposing for the high street in a more wearable way, Zara\u2019s success also relies on trial and error. Shop assistants report back customer reactions, from complaints about lack of stock to style details \u2013 such as whether a top would look better with a boat neck \u2013 to their managers, who then provide feedback to designers. Their extraordinarily high turnover of stock (which is kept to a minimum, helpful for maximising profit) means that customers know they need to buy immediately or items will sell out \u2013 the ranges change week to week. While the mark of a good high street store is to efficiently reflect what\u2019s on the catwalk, Zara tends to mimic the more \u201cyouthful\u201d trends. The wacky athleisure looks towards Vetements. The sculptured shirts (there are tens of styles) resemble Rosie Assoulin. While most high street stores produce one \u201cit\u201d item \u2013 such as Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s pink coat from 2013 \u2013 Zara produces many, such as last year\u2019s wide-legged tracksuit trousers or last month\u2019s green print dress designed in the spirit of Baum und Pferdgarten\u2019s long sold-out version. The new gender-neutral line is likely to take up the baton for March. But with stock changing each week, blink and you\u2019ll miss this one too. Morwenna Ferrier",

    "webTitle": "UK unemployment falls to joint lowest rate since 1975 but wages stall", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Workers suffered a fall in real pay for the first time in more than two years in January as inflation outpaced wage growth, underlining the fresh squeeze in living standards facing UK households. Total pay including bonuses was up 1.7% compared with January 2016, weaker than the 1.8% headline rate of inflation and the lowest rate of wage growth since February last year according to the Office for National Statistics. Pay prospects weakened despite a fall in Britain\u2019s unemployment rate to its joint lowest level since 1975. The jobless rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to January from 4.8% in the previous three months, matching the rate last seen in 2005. It was last lower in the three months to August 1975, when it was 4.6%. Martin Beck, a senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, a forecasting group, said the slowdown in pay growth was worrying. \u201cThe most concerning aspect was the further slowdown in wage growth. The January data already showed the first year-on-year decline in real wages since August 2014 and, given the likelihood that inflation will continue to climb through 2017, continued weakness in pay growth could threaten a squeeze on household finances. This, in turn, would risk a more severe slowdown in consumer spending growth than we currently anticipate.\u201d Household finances are expected to come under increasing pressure in 2017, as the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote increasingly feeds through to higher prices for consumer goods. Inflation is expected to rise to about 3% by the end of the year and household budgets are already under increased strain from a spike in supermarket prices. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said the prime minister must put a stop to the slide in living standards. \u201cWorkers are facing the double whammy of rising prices and slower pay growth. But Theresa May seems content to leave Britain drifting towards a new living standards crisis. Working people in Britain have seen their pay take a proper hammering in the last decade. It\u2019s long past time the government took action.\u201d Taking into account a longer period of time, total pay growth slowed sharply from 2.6% to 2.2% in the three months to January, the lowest since early 2016. Real pay growth \u2013 adjusted for inflation \u2013 was just 0.7%, the weakest in more than two years. Chris Hare, an economist at Investec, saida squeeze in real wages was under way and was likely to intensify as inflation picks up. \u201cThere are clear signs that households are beginning to suffer from a real income squeeze. Because household spending makes up around two-thirds of UK demand, this is the main reason why we see the economy slowing down over the course of this year.\u201d The employment rate was unchanged at 74.6%, the highest since records began in 1971. The number of people in work rose by 92,000 over the three months, to 31.85 million. There were 1.58 million unemployed people, 31,000 fewer than for August to October. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cWith the unemployment rate last lower in summer 1975 and the employment rate still at a record high, the labour market remains robust. But smaller wage increases and higher inflation mean the growth in real earnings has slowed sharply in recent months.\u201d The employment minister Damian Hinds welcomed the fall in unemployment, saying: \u201cEmployment is up, wages are up and there are more people working full time. This is good news for hardworking families across the UK as we continue to build a country that works for everyone.\u201d The latest official snapshot of the UK jobs market also confirmed that the number of people on zero-hours contracts hit a record high of 905,000 in the final three months of 2016. It was an increase of 101,000, or 13%, compared with the same period a year earlier. The ONS said people on zero-hours contracts, which do not guarantee a minimum number of work hours, were more likely to be young, female, part-time or in full-time education people in other employment. Such contracts are widely used by retailers, restaurants, leisure companies and hotels. About one in three people on a zero-hours contract want more work, compared with one in nine people in other employment.",

The January data already showed the first year-on-year decline in real wages since August 2014 and, given the likelihood that inflation will continue to climb through 2017, continued weakness in pay growth could threaten a squeeze on household finances. This, in turn, would risk a more severe slowdown in consumer spending growth than we currently anticipate.\u201d</p> <p>Household finances are expected to come under increasing pressure in 2017, as the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote increasingly feeds through to higher prices for consumer goods. Inflation is expected to rise to about 3% by the end of the year and household budgets are already under increased strain from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/07/food-inflation-doubles-uk-shoppers-feel-pinch\">a spike in supermarket prices</a>.</p> <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said the prime minister must put a stop to the slide in living standards.</p> <p>\u201cWorkers are facing the double whammy of rising prices and slower pay growth.

For those whose memories don\u2019t stretch that far back it was the time of the UK\u2019s first referendum on EU membership, Harold Wilson was prime minister and inflation was at at postwar peak of more than 25%. The contrast with today\u2019s labour market is stark. Joblessness stands at 4.7%, a level that many economists would consider close to full employment, yet there is not the glimmer of the upward pressure on wages that was so evident in the mid-70s. Back then, increases in the cost of living were matched by demands for higher pay, which in turn led to higher inflation. Eventually, governments of both left and right resorted to statutory incomes policies as they sought to bring inflation down. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests that the UK now has a non-statutory incomes policy, enforced by employers rather than by Whitehall. Unemployment in the three months to January 2017 was 105,000 lower than in the previous quarter and employment was up by 92,000. Yet, wage pressure over the same period abated. Average earnings in the three months to January were 2.3% higher than a year earlier: in the three months to December 2016 they rose at an annual rate of 2.6%. These figures speak volumes about the modern labour market and in particular how the balance of power has shifted in the past four decades. Even when jobs are relatively plentiful and inflation is picking up, workers are unwilling or unable to press for higher pay. The reasons for this transformation is obvious: deindustrialisation and the growth of employment in the non-unionised service sector; curbs on the power of trade unions; an increase in labour supply. In addition, the one area where trade union density remains high \u2013 the public sector \u2013 is subject to a 1% pay cap. Here at least, statutory incomes policy lives on. While record levels of employment are welcome, the weakness of pay means that consumer spending is going to be squeezed hard over the coming months. Inflation is running at 1.8% and will soon overtake earnings growth. Most people will keep their jobs and they will still be able to afford their mortgages because the lack of any wage pressure means the Bank of England will keep interest rates ultra low.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Unilever has urged the government to provide more help for Britain\u2019s largest companies when they are targeted by foreign takeovers. Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever \u2013 the maker of Marmite, Magnum ice cream and Dove soap \u2013 said there should be a level playing field for British companies so they could enjoy the stronger levels of protection that businesses received in other countries. Last month Unilever was the target of a \u00a3115bn takeover bid by Kraft Heinz, which was backed by Warren Buffet and private equity firm 3G. Kraft Heinz withdrew the offer after it was firmly rejected by Unilever, amid reports the UK government was concerned about the ramifications of a deal. However, Unilever believes UK takeover rules should be changed to provide more support for the company that is targeted by a foreign bid, for example enabling it to have more time to build a defence against the offer and encouraging directors to consider the interests of other stakeholders \u2013 such as employees \u2013 rather than just shareholders. At present directors claim it is their fiduciary duty to focus on the interests of shareholders when they receive a takeover bid. Polman told the Financial Times: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about protection. We are saying that when you have a situation like this, with a national champion, there should be a level playing field.\u201d Countries such as the US, France and the Netherlands have more safeguards in place to protect \u201cnational champions\u201d and block takeovers. In the Netherlands companies must consider a broader range of stakeholders when analysing a bid. The government is planning to publish draft proposals in the coming weeks that would outline how it would respond to foreign takeovers and bids for key infrastructure projects in the future. Theresa May has previously said the government should have more powers to block predatory bids for companies in important industries for the economy. The prime minister has indicated she would have blocked Kraft\u2019s takeover of Cadbury in 2010 and Pfizer\u2019s failed attempt to buy pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said last month: \u201cWe have taken the opportunity to look at our arrangements to make sure they are kept up to date. We have said we would do that in the context of mergers, particularly if it relates to critical infrastructure, as outlined by the Hinkley Point C decision [to build a new nuclear power station with funding from China]. So we will be setting out some proposals in the weeks ahead.\u201d At present the government can only block takeovers on the basis of national security, financial stability and media plurality. Existing takeover rules also mean Kraft Heinz is blocked from making another bid for Unilever for six months after scrapping its initial attempt. Nonetheless, Unilever has taken steps to protect itself from another takeover attempt by pledging to conduct a \u201ccomprehensive review of options\u201d to improve value for shareholders. After Kraft Heinz announced it was walking away from the potential deal, Unilever said in a statement: \u201cThe events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever. We expect the review to be completed by early April, after which we will communicate further.\u201d Unilever employs 7,500 people in the UK, including at its London headquarters and its research and development hub in Port Sunlight, Merseyside. The company, whose shares are listed in the UK and the Netherlands, is one of the biggest consumer goods groups in the world. Its brands range from foods such as Flora, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s and Knorr, to Doveskincare and Lynx deodorant, to cleaning products such as Domestos and Persil. Unilever\u2019s origins date back to 1885 when William and James Lever created Sunlight, the world\u2019s first branded and packaged soap for washing clothes. Unilever was formed in 1929 when Lever Brothers merged with Dutch company Margarine Unie. Polman became chief executive of Unilever in 2009. He was previously the finance director at Nestl\u00e9 and spent more than 20 years at Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Fairy washing-up liquid and Gillette, the shaving brand.",

It was astonishing that she could omit her brother\u2019s job at Barclays in a form asking about personal relationships that could be perceived as creating conflicts of interest. It is jaw-dropping that she could have written the Bank of England\u2019s code herself and yet failed to follow its precise instructions. But even senior people can make basic mistakes. Hogg has really been undone by what followed, specifically her highly contentious claim in her letter to MPs confessing to her \u201coversight\u201d. She wrote: \u201cI do not anticipate that an actual or potential conflict will arise in future.\u201d Really? The MPs ripped that boast apart in their damning report. They thought \u201cpotential, actual or perceived conflict could well arise\u201d and they are surely right. Hogg, in her new post, would have sat on the Prudential Regulation Committee that has day-to-day oversight of Barclays. Hogg could not possibly anticipate every issue that might crop up. Stuff happens, as she has just demonstrated. \u201cMs Hogg\u2019s conclusion in this respect was a serious error of judgment,\u201d the report stated. At that point, her resignation was inevitable. But there is a deeper question here. Why did the Bank think such \u201cpotential, actual or perceived\u201d conflicts did not matter or could be managed happily within existing codes? Why was it so breezy? Why did it think a verbal warning from governor Mark Carney \u2013 in effect, a gentle slap on the wrist \u2013 could suffice? Those bankers bleating about the creation of a \u201cHogg defence\u201d to excuse their own misjudgments were overstating matters, but the affair still raised awkward questions. Threadneedle Street cannot be seen to be imposing higher standards of compliance on regulated individuals than it is willing to accept for its own senior staff. By rights, the task of protecting the Bank\u2019s interests and reputation falls to the court. It is a reformed body these days, designed to look more like the board of a public company. It has an outside chair \u2013 Anthony Habgood, the former chairman of Whitbread \u2013 and a majority of non-executive directors. Yet the old complaint of cosiness has never been banished. Why didn\u2019t the non-executives on the court, after Hogg had revealed her error, conduct their own inquiry? Were they swayed by the obvious desire of Carney, a member of the court himself, to retain a trusted colleague? An internal review will follow to examine \u201cthe lessons from Ms Hogg\u2019s case\u201d. Quite right too, but let\u2019s reserve judgment until we\u2019ve seen the findings. An internal review that concludes that the episode was jolly unfortunate and could not have been foreseen will be of no use to anybody. Habgood is now on the spot, as he should be. Unilever chief challenges PM to act on takeovers The takeover rules should be strengthened to help national corporate champions defend themselves, Unilever chief executive Paul Polman has told the Financial Times. It is odd that he didn\u2019t raise this idea before Kraft turned up at Unilever\u2019s front door (and then quickly ran away) but never mind: the spirit of his remarks should be welcomed, even if the detail needs more work. If Kraft had succeeded in buying Unilever, it would have ripped out costs, made several thousand staff redundant and spent less time fretting in Polman-like style about corporate social responsibility. That may have served the interests of Kraft\u2019s shareholders \u2013 and, maybe, the short-termists on Unilever\u2019s register \u2013 but both constituencies are narrow. It is not obvious why shareholders\u2019 voices should be the only ones that are heard in takeover situations. Unilever has been around for 100 years and has 165,000 employees. You do not have to be a hard-line protectionist to think such a company, whose shareholders in any case have done OK over the years, deserves a better fate than being kicked around by a charmless operator like Kraft whose main weapon is its principal shareholders\u2019 willingness to run with enormous levels of debt. The tricky bit, though, is how to define a \u201cnational champion\u201d or how to create Polman\u2019s desired \u201clevel playing field\u201d. Unilever is Anglo-Dutch, so whose national champion is it? And why is he only talking about national champions? It\u2019s also hard to know if lengthening the takeover timetable, as Polman suggests, would help. So-called \u201cput up or shut up\u201d clauses were introduced after Cadbury succumbed to Kraft\u2019s bear hug in 2010. Most people think the reform works to the defending company\u2019s advantage, which was the intention. In the end, the only certain way to make a difference is to introduce some version of a public interest test. It would be wrong to set hurdles too high because meddling politicians can also be a menace. But it is reasonable to expect bidders, especially uninvited bidders, to explain how their plans are supposed to benefit employees and the rest of us. That process should involve more than uttering a few glib and vague remarks. Theresa May once seemed sympathetic to such thinking, though her ministers\u2019 remarks about changing the rules have concentrated on \u201ccritical national infrastructure\u201d. Polman\u2019s intervention is a challenge to the prime minster to explain why she can\u2019t go further. Well played \u2013 Kraft\u2019s \u00a3115bn non-bid was a brief affair but its significance should not be forgotten.",

Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company said her potential \u00a38.8m a year pay deal was lower than Witty\u2019s, which carried a maximum total of \u00a311.6m, because she was less experienced than her predecessor, who spent eight years as chief executive. GSK added that investors had asked the company to show restraint on executive pay. Walmsley will be the most powerful woman in the pharmaceutical industry when she takes the helm next month after her promotion from head of GSK\u2019s consumer healthcare business, whose products include Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers. Urs Rohner, the non-executive director who chairs GSK\u2019s remuneration committee, said: \u201cTaking into account the fact that this is Emma\u2019s first CEO role, reductions have been made to all elements of her remuneration package in comparison to Sir Andrew\u2019s current arrangements.

    "webTitle": "Single market exit: UK construction 'could lose 175,000 EU workers'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK construction industry could lose more than 175,000 EU workers \u2013 or 8% of the sector\u2019s workforce \u2013 if the country does not retain access to the European single market after Brexit, the government has been told. Such an outcome could put key infrastructure and construction projects at risk at a time when the sector was also facing other pressures, including the tax changes in the recent budget, said the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Its latest quarterly survey of the industry, conducted during the final three months of 2016, showed that 30% of construction professionals said hiring non-UK workers was important to the success of their business. The companies most affected are predominantly those working on big projects or based in the south-east. The government either has to secure continued access to the single market or put alternative plans in place for companies to easily employ non-EU workers as replacements, Rics said. Skilled construction workers have not been added to the UK shortage occupations list \u2013 an official list that will give some sectors priority during the visa application process. Jeremy Blackburn, head of UK policy at Rics, said: \u201cThese figures reveal that the UK construction industry is currently dependent on thousands of EU workers [around 176,500]. \u201cIt is in all our interests that we make a success of Brexit, but a loss of access to the single market has the potential to slowly bring the UK\u2019s \u00a3500bn infrastructure pipeline to a standstill. That means that unless access to the single market is secured or alternative plans are put in place, we won\u2019t be able to create the infrastructure needed to enable our cities to compete on a global stage. \u201cA lot of big projects may set up their own training centres but they will still need an international pool of labour. A simple first step would be to ensure that construction professions, such as quantity surveyors, feature on the shortage occupations list. Ballet dancers won\u2019t improve our infrastructure or solve the housing crisis yet their skills are currently viewed as essential, whereas construction professionals are not.\u201d Rics said more should be done to increase the number of skilled UK workers, through initiatives such as apprenticeships schemes. According to its quarterly report, 20% of those surveyed said such schemes were not effective. Rics said it recognised it had to do more to educate industry about the benefits of apprenticeships. Blackburn said: \u201cKey to [building a resilient construction industry] will be growing the domestic skills base. As the industry\u2019s professional body, we are working with government and industry to develop that skills base, building vital initiatives, such as degree apprenticeships, in our sector to drive the talent pipeline forward. \u201cThis survey reveals that more work needs to be done to promote the indisputable benefits of these schemes to industry, and Rics intends to take this forward as a priority.\u201d He added that the controversial rise in national insurance contributions for the self employed, which were announced in the budget, would also hit the sector, where about 40% of the workforce were in that category. He also pointed to a crackdown on VAT avoidance in the construction sector and tax changes to profits of overseas property developers: \u201cAll of that coming together will make for challenges for the sector.\u201d The construction industry has been recovering ground since the financial crisis, but there have been signs of a potential slowdown even before the Brexit process is triggered and the budget changes come into full effect. Government figures released last week showed that the sector made a sluggish start to the year, with output in January down 0.4% month on month. Meanwhile new orders for the final three months of the year fell 2.8% quarter on quarter. Savills estate agency recently predicted the uncertainty surrounding Brexit would lead to a slump in office construction activity, with up to half the planned developments in central London likely to be postponed or scrapped.",

      "body": "<p>The UK construction industry could lose more than 175,000 EU workers \u2013 or 8% of the sector\u2019s workforce \u2013 if the country does not retain access to the European single market after Brexit, the government has been told.</p> <p>Such an outcome could put key infrastructure and construction projects at risk at a time when the sector was also facing other pressures, including the tax changes in the recent budget, said the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics).</p> <p>Its latest quarterly survey of the industry, conducted during the final three months of 2016, showed that 30% of construction professionals said hiring non-UK workers was important to the success of their business. The companies most affected are predominantly those working on big projects or based in the south-east.</p> <p>The government either has to secure continued access to the single market or put alternative plans in place for companies to easily employ non-EU workers as replacements, Rics said. Skilled construction workers have not been added to the UK shortage occupations list \u2013 an official list that will give some sectors priority during the visa application process. </p> <p>Jeremy Blackburn, head of UK policy at Rics, said: \u201cThese figures reveal that the UK construction industry is currently dependent on thousands of EU workers [around 176,500].</p> <p>\u201cIt is in all our interests that we make a success of Brexit, but a loss of access to the single market has the potential to slowly bring the UK\u2019s \u00a3500bn infrastructure pipeline to a standstill. That means that unless access to the single market is secured or alternative plans are put in place, we won\u2019t be able to create the infrastructure needed to enable our cities to compete on a global stage.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of big projects may set up their own training centres but they will still need an international pool of labour. A simple first step would be to ensure that construction professions, such as quantity surveyors, feature on the shortage occupations list. Ballet dancers won\u2019t improve our infrastructure or solve the housing crisis yet their skills are currently viewed as essential, whereas construction professionals are not.\u201d</p> <p>Rics said more should be done to increase the number of skilled UK workers, through initiatives such as apprenticeships schemes.

      "bodyText": "Governments must be prepared to expand the size of the public sector and employ more people directly as part of pushing the Australian economy to full employment, according to the former Labor treasurer, Wayne Swan. Swan will use a speech in Adelaide on Wednesday to argue that full employment needs to be an active strategy for governments, not a passive one. Wednesday\u2019s intervention is part of efforts Swan is spearheading to generate community discussion about the concept of inclusive growth, and also challenge his party to develop a more overtly progressive policy platform for the next federal election to appeal to disaffected low and middle income voters currently being courted by Pauline Hanson and other protest parties. The former treasurer will use a speech he will deliver at Flinders University to argue governments need to embrace the use of fiscal policy \u201cto get to and stay at full employment\u201d. \u201cTo reverse the squeeze on middle incomes and to power economic growth, the case to boost public investment through the use of active fiscal policy is irrefutable,\u201d he will say. \u201cPushing the economy back to full employment would restore the bargaining power of workers and repair the broken link between labour productivity and wages. \u201cAnd when we talk about full employment we\u2019re talking about secure ongoing jobs.\u201d He says that means governments providing more than job training. \u201cGovernments must not only direct their emphasis on job training and reskilling initiatives but must also be willing to contemplate more ambitious programs of public investment and direct employment.\u201d The former Labor treasurer used a speech at the Australian Workers\u2019 Union national conference at the beginning of the month to argue the opposition needed to put rising inequality at the heart of its agenda for the next federal election \u2013 and also consider whether a \u201cBuffett rule\u201d should be part of the policy mix. Swan was the first figure from the Labor right faction to validate the debate, which thus far has been pursued by left faction figures. Neither the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, nor the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, are keen on the \u201cBuffett rule\u201d concept. Shorten recently told a town hall meeting in Canberra reforming negative gearing was a more effective redistributive mechanism than making wealthy people pay a minimum share of tax. This week\u2019s Guardian Essential Poll suggests, however, that the concept would be popular. The poll found a clear majority of voters would support a range of tax increases, including a Buffett rule. Swan insists the Labor party needs to give the \u201cBuffet rule\u201d serious consideration. He will acknowledge on Wednesday Shorten\u2019s analytical point on negative gearing, but argue Labor needs to do more. \u201cLabor\u2019s decision to scale back negative gearing for future investments and tackle capital gains concessions is a critical part of making our tax system fairer. \u201cThis is a good start but we do need a through discussion of a Buffet rule to give people confidence that wealthy individuals are paying their fair share. \u201cOn the corporate tax side we need strong action against transfer pricing and debt dumping and we need to fix the petroleum resources rent tax. \u201cBoth sets of measures would go a long way towards repairing our budget bottom line.\u201d",
