But it is reasonable to expect ministers to be alert to a crisis at its early stages and to avoid making a bad position worse. On both counts, the government has questions to answer. Back in January, David Cameron boasted that the UK\u2019s steel production was higher than in Labour\u2019s last term in office \u201cbecause we have a car industry that is growing, an aerospace industry that is growing, and construction is growing.\u201d Those words now read as blinkered disregard for pressures that were obvious at the time. It is not fresh news, for example, that the steel price has plunged and that China is dumping its excess production on world markets. Nor was the steel industry engaged in old-style special pleading. Its main request has been for the government to hurry up and implement a series of measures it had already agreed, including a compensation package for energy-intensive industries. UK Steel, the trade body, estimates that electricity prices in the UK were 82% higher than the EU average for extra-large consumers in the first half of this year, a gap that has doubled in two years.

Legal &amp; General fires warning over Hinkley Point white elephant When, after a final round of grandiose political rhetoric, we are invited this week to celebrate China\u2019s decision to push several billion quid in the direction of Hinkley Point, remember that George Osborne turned to Beijing to fund his nuclear experiment only because other investors decided long ago that the project carried the stench of financial folly.

Now look at chief executive Nigel Wilson\u2019s analysis of Hinkley Point: \u201cNuclear energy is low carbon, but the costs are too high. The \u00a325bn estimates ... make it look like an expensive white elephant. It will be slow to build, produce prohibitively expensive power at over \u00a3100 per megawatt hour to be subsidised over 30 years \u2013 plus nuclear fuel decommissioning costs which, according to the Whole of Government Accounts, cost the taxpayer \u00a380bn.\u201d In practice, even a slice of Hinkley Point might be too big for any UK private-sector investor. But you get the point: if even committed UK enthusiasts for long-term infrastructure think the project is a waste of financial resources, it very probably is. Asda switches off click and collect The first victim of Asda\u2019s latest \u201crenewal\u201d programme is the plan to open masses of click and collect pickup points, including at London tube stations.

Oranges and lemons, lettuce, peppers and tomatoes are among the popular fresh produce that will stay fresher for up to two days longer as a result of Tesco removing a food packaging stage within its supply chain. With supermarkets under growing pressure to reduce waste, Tesco has admitted that it wasted 55,400 tonnes of food from its stores last year \u2013 about 30,000 tonnes of which was edible. According to the government\u2019s waste advisory body Wrap (Waste and Resources Reduction Action Programme), 7m tonnes of food is thrown away each year by British households, at a cost to the average family with children of \u00a3700 and a national cost of \u00a312.5bn. As part of its ongoing programme to tackle food waste, Tesco looked at its supply chain to identify ways of working directly with producers to speed up the process by which freshly picked produce arrives in store. The latest technical advances in packing and storage meant it was possible to ship produce directly from European suppliers to its stores, cutting the amount of time spent in transit. \u201cFor millions of our customers this move will mean having up to an extra two days in which to enjoy some of the most popular fruit and vegetables\u201d, said Matt Simister, commercial director of food at Tesco. \u201cThe extra days of freshness will particularly benefit customers who are pressed for time and will mean they are less likely to throw away food.\u201d Dr Richard Swannell, director of sustainable food systems at Wrap said: \u201cOur \u2018Product Life\u2019 research identified a number of simple and safe ways to make changes throughout the supply chain to pass on more product life to shoppers. \u201cOur report estimates some 250,000 tonnes of food waste could be prevented by a one day increase in product life \u2013 food wasted by households and by the supply chain. Preventing this volume of waste means UK shoppers have a potential shared saving of up to \u00a3500 million a year.\u201d Tesco recently announced a partnership with Fareshare and FoodCloud to ensure surplus food in stores goes to people in need. It has also redesigned packaging to increase the shelf life of beef and lamb by five days. Meanwhile, Marks &amp; Spencer is to distribute thousands of tonnes of surplus food under a scheme that will use Neighbourly, a social networking app, to link its UK stores to local charities, including food banks.",

      "bodyText": "At the beginning of the year, David Cameron must have been feeling very pleased with himself over the state of the British steel industry. Before a debate on the topic in January, he proclaimed: \u201cUnder this government, steel production is up, whereas it was down under Labour. Under this government, employment in the steel industry is up, whereas it was down under Labour. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause we have a car industry that is growing, an aerospace industry that is growing, and construction is growing. We are getting Britain back to work.\u201d The prime minister would find it difficult to be so upbeat about the issue today. Britain\u2019s steel industry, hit by crippling energy costs on the one hand and cheap imports from China on the other, is on the ropes. Caparo Industries, the steel group built up by Labour peer Swraj Paul, on Monday became the latest victim of a crisis threatening to sweep away the entire industry in the UK. Caparo was formed in the 60s and went on to make its founder a fortune, but hasn\u2019t managed to survive the industry\u2019s current downturn. Caparo\u2019s announcement follows news of 1,200 likely job cuts at Tata Steel UK, which itself comes after the recent collapse of the Redcar steelworks on Teesside. SSI UK, which is owned by Thailand\u2019s Sahaviriya Steel Industries, went into liquidation with the loss of 2,200 jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the UK steel industry is facing its biggest crisis for decades,\u201d said Stephen Doughty, the Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, and member of the shadow business team. Doughty attended last week\u2019s emergency national steel summit in Rotherham, which brought together top executives from all of the main UK steel producers, including Tata, Celsa and Caparo, with unions and politicians including the business secretary, Sajid Javid. Javid promised to help competitiveness, though he is certainly not proferring an open cheque book. He said after the summit: \u201cThere is no straightforward solution to the complex global challenges facing the steel industry. But today was an important opportunity to bring the key players together, and we now have a framework of action. \u201cThe government is committed to working closely with industry on both short-term and long-term issues and to do everything we can to support both industry and the workers.\u201d Steelmakers argue the industry in the UK is faced with far higher energy costs than it can cope with and that the compensation packages promised in the March budget haven\u2019t come soon enough. Javid promised to put the energy-intensive package to compensate high energy users at the top of his agenda. Producers are hoping the government will address the issue of China dumping steel in the global market during President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit this week. \u201cWith a slowdown in its own domestic industrial demand but also reduced demand more generally in the world economy, many suspect that China is dumping vast quantities into the rest of world,\u201d says Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser at CEBR, an economic consultancy. \u201cThe cycle should be temporary but the price fall is devastating for many steel producers \u2013 such as the UK \u2013 and this can cause long-term damage and restarting plants may be difficult when market conditions improve.\u201d Doughty says he was heartened by last week\u2019s summit but now feels the time for talking is over. \u201cThe chancellor and the business secretary now need to put their money where their mouth is or we risk facing further tragedies like the one we have seen in Redcar and elsewhere, with infrastructure, supply chains and carbon production simply offshored with devastating consequences.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Asda has launched a revival plan to revamp big stores, cut prices and shelve the expansion of internet click and collect services after recording its worst sales performance in its 50-year history. Naming the plan \u201cproject renewal\u201d \u2013 in a nod to former boss Archie Norman\u2019s 1990s overhaul of the business that culminated in its takeover by US group Walmart \u2013 the supermarket said the 18-month drive would include making further cuts in everyday prices and accelerating improvements to 95 of its biggest branches while slowing expansion of smaller outlets in London. Asda also said it would halt plans to open more non-store \u201cclick and collect\u201d sites for internet shoppers to pick up goods. The group has 620 such sites, mainly at stores but also elsewhere, including 24 at London Underground stations and a pilot robot-operated \u201cpod\u201d in St Helens, Merseyside. Other changes to Asda\u2019s five-year strategy include putting ambitions for more standalone petrol stations on hold and closing an operation that deals directly with business customers. The group, which vies with Sainsbury\u2019s to be Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket, said its rethink was in part driven by the need to combat discount rivals, led by the German low-cost operators Aldi and Lidl. Asda and its main rivals Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Morrisons have been drawn into a ferocious price war while seeking to keep up with shoppers\u2019 move online, which makes little money. The chain had its worst quarterly period of trading in the three months to the end of June as it was hit by fierce competition and a market flooded with discount vouchers from rivals seeking to lure cost-conscious shoppers. Sales in established stores fell by 4.7% and Asda, which had survived the price war relatively unscathed for some time, became the worst performer of the big four grocers. It has also been affected by the stirrings of a revival at Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest grocer and a direct competitor at the cheaper end of the market. Andy Clarke, Asda\u2019s chief executive, said the chain\u2019s past success was based on well-run stores and low prices and the new plan would concentrate on that core aim while sidelining surplus operations. Asda said there would be 29 job cuts at head office as a result. Clarke said: \u201cOver the last two years, we have shown that we are ready to make necessary and early changes to match that ambition to the demands of our customers, especially at a time when the market is clearly undergoing permanent and rapid structural change. \u201cWe need to simplify what we do by prioritising the first line of our strategy \u2013 improving our core business and pausing activity in other areas so that we are not spread too thinly.\u201d Clarke said in August the business had been through the worst and was back on an upward trend. He said Walmart backed his resistance to being drawn into issuing unviable discount vouchers simply to get customers into stores. He had emphasised the need to offer more services for online customers. Click and collect has been one of the big growth areas in retail because it lets customers pick up their online purchases when convenient instead of waiting at home for a delivery van. Clarke has been placed under greater pressure after Asda hired Roger Burnley, Sainsbury\u2019s head of retail and operations, as chief operating officer, starting next year. Burnley will work as Clarke\u2019s right-hand man but he is tipped as a potential replacement for Clarke, who has been in the job since 2010. Walmart, historically the US\u2019s biggest retailer, issued a profit warning last week that highlighted competition from Amazon and other rivals as well as the cost of increasing wages after a campaign put it under pressure over low pay. Asda, like other UK supermarkets, faces paying higher wages to comply with the chancellor\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d which comes into effect from April next year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Caparo Industries, part of the business empire of the Labour peer Lord Paul, has called in administrators in the latest blow to Britain\u2019s steel industry. The steel products company, based in the West Midlands town of Oldbury, appointed PwC as joint administrator to 16 of its companies on Monday. Only three businesses within the group were unaffected by the move. PwC said that just over 1,700 employees across the affected businesses would be briefed on the implications of administration and would be paid as normal. The strength of sterling against the euro and poor trading in the steel industry are understood to be the main causes of its problems. The joint administrators said they would be working closely with the senior management team at the Caparo group to rapidly contact key customers and suppliers, with the objective of stabilising trading, while they assess opportunities to restructure or sell the businesses and their assets. Matt Hammond, lead administrator and partner at PwC, said: \u201cThe impact of steel prices and exchange rates has had an impact on some parts of the Caparo Industries group. However, there are businesses in the group that are not directly affected by steel prices, and likewise many where there is both strong customer demand and critical supplier support. \u201cOur focus for the next 36 hours is on briefing staff across the group and working closely with their management teams to ensure that every opportunity for these businesses is considered. We will be working with all parties to ensure the best outcome for all creditors of each business.\u201d Britain\u2019s steel industry is under pressure from cheap Chinese imports, high energy prices, slowing demand and the strength of the pound. The government held a summit in Rotherham on Friday to discuss the industry\u2019s future after the closure of the SSI plant in Redcar with the loss of 2,200 jobs. In a further sign of the strain on the sector, Tata Steel is cutting up to 1,200 jobs in Scunthorpe and at two plants in Scotland. Tata had already cut production at its sites in Newport, Port Talbot and Rotherham with the loss of about 1,000 jobs. The crisis in the steel sector threatens to cloud the state visit to the UK of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. UK Steel, the industry\u2019s trade group, has questioned how strongly the chancellor expressed concern about the dumping of cheap steel on his recent trade trip to China. Swraj Paul founded Caparo in 1968 after he moved to Britain from India and the business became the source of his fortune, estimated at \u00a32bn. Paul\u2019s business spans the UK, Europe, India and the US. Caparo Industries Plc is Caparo\u2019s UK arm and is run by a separate management team though Paul, who became a peer in 1996, is a big shareholder. Caparo was unavailable to comment. Angela Eagle, Labour shadow business secretary said: \u201cThis is a further blow to the steel industry, which is now on its knees, and my thoughts are with the employees of Caparo who are facing uncertainty over their future. \u201cThe industry needs urgent action from the government, however this government seems content to let the industry fail. \u201cRather than setting up more talking shops, the government should be taking action to tackle higher energy prices, they should be providing export and procurement support and be looking at what temporary measures could help the industry, including looking again at business rates. \u201cWith the Chinese president in the UK this week, I hope the government will raise the issue of anti-competitive dumping, which is driving down steel prices.\u201d Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steelworkers\u2019 union Community, said: \u201cThis news is a tragic reminder of the urgent need for government action to help our steel industry survive. Crippling energy costs and the dumping of cheap Chinese steel is threatening the very future of the UK\u2019s steel sector. \u201cWe will be working to support our members within Caparo at this difficult time and are seeking an urgent meeting with the company. \u201cThis is an industry-wide crisis. It is vitally important that Britain\u2019s steel companies hold their nerve and that government works with unions and the industry to build a sustainable future for UK manufacturing with steel at its heart.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Economists are increasingly convinced the European Central Bank will hold fire on expandingits quantitative easing programme at this week\u2019s meeting. ING Bank said: With markets gradually having doubts about a first rate hike in the US, market expectations about more ECB QE have increased recently. Indeed, the stronger euro might be one of the \u201cunwarranted tightening\u201d factors about which the ECB has always warned. In our view, however, the ECB will refrain from more QE, at least at the current juncture, and will rely on its often-used verbal intervention skills. Technical difficulties to step up QE and too many uncertainties about the future path of growth and inflation should motivate the ECB to postpone any decision on more QE. However, the past has shown several times that the ECB\u2019s ability to talk the talk without eventually having to walk the walk is rather limited. On that note, we\u2019re closing up the blog for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. US markets are falling in early trading following the disappointing results from Morgan Stanley. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost more than 60 points or nearly 0.4% while the S&amp;P 550 is down 0.35%. The Wall Street decline has taken the shine off European shares, with France\u2019s Cac now in negative territory, down 0.12%, although Germany\u2019s Dax is still 0.5% better, albeit off its best levels. The FTSE 100, which was already on the slide as commodity companies weighed on the market after the Chinese GDP data, is now down 30 points or 0.5%. Back with Greece, and the recapitalisation of the country\u2019s four major banks should be completed by the end of the year, according to Dani\u00e8le Nouy, chair of the supervisory board of the European Central Bank. In a speech to the European Parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee, she said: In early summer, the uncertainty surrounding the Greek programme was for us, just as for you, at the centre of our attention. For Greek banks, these developments implied a renewed very intense and stressful episode. We therefore monitored the developments very closely and took supervisory actions where needed. We were relieved that an agreement was reached at the Euro Summit in July. In the follow-up to the Summit, we are now conducting a comprehensive assessment of the four Greek significant institutions, to help determine the recapitalisation needs. The recapitalisation should be concluded by the end of the year. Thus it is important that the necessary funds will be available on time. The full speech is here. The latest reports from China show conflicting signs about the state of the world\u2019s second largest economy, writes Phillip Inman: China is on the road to recovery. Or maybe it isn\u2019t, at least not for some time, say the contradictory reports on the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The latest GDP figures, showing a growth rate in the third quarter of 6.9%, down from 7% in the second quarter, have done little to lay this particular debate to rest. Some analysts argue Beijing is stuck in a rut, unable to wean itself off the colossal volumes of investment needed to keep its industrial turbines turning. Others spy a rising middle class with a strong appetite for services. They argue China will soon be rebalancing away from smoke stack industries and employ millions more people in an expanded health service, transport system and financial services. What they all agree on is that official figures from Beijing\u2019s economic ministries should be treated with scepticism. Read more here: Here\u2019s a full report on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s deal with Weight Watchers: Meanwhile Weight Watchers shares have jumped around 40% in pre-market trading following the news that Oprah Winfrey will invest and join the board. That\u2019s a nice return already on her investment. More news from the US, and Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley has just reported a 42.4% fall in third quarter earnings to $939m. It was hit by turbulence in bond, currency and commodity markets following the concerns about the Chinese economy. Over in the US, Oprah Winfrey has linked up with Weight Watchers International, buying a 10% stake in the business - with an option for another 5% - and is joining the board. Winfrey said: \u201cI believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\u201d As Chinese president Xi Jinping begins his state visit to the UK, British people expect China to overtake Europe as our most valuable trading partner in 20 years. A poll by YouGov also shows Brits are enthusiastic about closer economic co-operation with the Chinese. Of those surveyed, 40% said our most valuable trading partner was Europe, with 23% choosing China. But in the next two decades this is expected to change, with 29% predicting China will be our top partner and 22% forecasting it will still be Europe. Nearly half - 43% - said the UK should be seeking closer trading links with China, with 31% saying it should continue the current level of economic co-operation and only 8% saying it should weaken ties. The majority - 54% - believed China would to continue into the next two decades with either much stronger economic growth than now (22%) or slightly stronger growth than now (32%). Only 14% predicted weaker growth. In addition, 37% expected China\u2019s growth to lift the UK\u2019s, while 26% said it wouldcome at the expense of western economies and 10% said it would not make any difference. But YouGov added: The British public seems to have a pragmatic approach to economic relations with China, but there is not much evidence of great affection for the country. Of the 12 biggest economies by GDP excluding the USA and those in Europe, China comes in at 8th in terms of net positive impressions (29% positive, 55% negative). Ireland has moved to cut back on one and two cent coins, with plans to launch a nationwide scheme to allow retailers to round bills to the nearest five cents - with the consent of shoppers. PA reports: Since the euro was introduced in 2001 Ireland has spent \u20ac37m issuing one and two cent coins - minting the coppers at three times the rate of the rest of the eurozone. But the initiative to reduce the need for coppers is voluntary and consumers will retain the right to pay the exact bill and request their exact change. The Central Bank insisted rounding would only apply to cash transactions and not to credit card, electronic or cheque payments and it would also only be used on the final cash total of a bill and not to individual goods. As examples it said final bills ending in one and two cents or six and seven cents would be rounded down to the nearest five and those ending in three and four cents or eight and nine cents would be rounded up. Other rules on the rounding scheme include that one and two cent coins remain legal tender. The nationwide initiative starts on October 28. It follows a successful trial in Wexford in 2013, which showed that 85% of consumers and 100% of retailers in Wexford who expressed an opinion wanted rounding rolled out nationally. Back to China, and the weak GDP figures show that the stimulus measures introduced by the country\u2019s central bank have had a limited effect, said Professor Kamel Mellahi at Warwick Business School. He said: If there is one thing to take away from the third quarter figures it is the limited short-term impact of financial and economic stimulus packages on the Chinese economy. The Chinese Government has introduced a number of measures to stimulate economic growth, but so far the needle hasn\u2019t moved much. Right now it\u2019s very important the Chinese Government is focused on the long-term economic fundamentals and resists the temptation to take unnecessary actions simply to meet short-term economic growth targets. One cannot, and should not, read too much into the third quarter growth figures. A growth of 6.9% is slightly below official government expectations but they are also marginally better than the 6.8% that most economists have predicted. Because it\u2019s the weakest growth since 2009, the figures are very symbolic but I don\u2019t think they tell us something substantially new about the state of the Chinese economy. The 0.2% fall in eurozone construction in August compared to July was due to civil enginering declining by 0.3% and building construction by 0.2%, according to statistics office Eurostat. In the wider European Union, construction output fell by 1.2% month on month. The year on year decline in the euro area was 6% and in the EU as a whole 5%. The full report is here: Production in construction down by 0.2% in euro area Eurozone construction output came in weaker in August, new figures have just revealed: More on the Chinese figures and their accuracy or otherwise. Real growth could be closer to 3% to 4% according to Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell. He said: Chinese headline GDP growth looks healthy at 6.9% but underlying metrics suggest the real growth rate could be nearer 3% \u2013 4%. If you look at growth in rail cargo traffic, electricity consumption and demand for loans, three metrics favoured by Prime Minister Li, the picture is not so healthy. Credit growth still looks promising but freight shipments and electricity demand growth look to be sagging, so the so-called Li Keqiang index does raise a few questions. Today\u2019s GDP figures are encouraging but investors with exposure to China should still expect some bumps and lumps along the way. One of the disadvantages of being a stock market index laden with commodity companies is that the sector often has a disproportionate influence on events. So it is today. With the weak Chinese data mining companies have come under pressure on concerns about slowing demand from the world\u2019s second largest economy. With the likes of Anglo American and Glencore down between 2% and 4%, this means the FTSE 100 has slipped back into negative territory, while other European markets are still moving higher. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Overall growth in China in the third quarter was a respectable 6.9%, while strength in consumer spending will allay some fears about a slowdown. However, the figures will do nothing to dispel the idea that this particular growth bonanza has come to an end. Big name mining stocks are in the red again this morning, with the sector at its lowest level in nearly two weeks. It looks increasingly like the bounce of early October was a false dawn, and barring some kind of sustained revival in risk appetite, perhaps via fresh monetary stimulus, the sector is heading lower once again. One of the main economic events this week is the latest meeting of the European Cental Bank, due to take place in Malta. Despite the weakness of the global economy and continued low inflation, the bank is widely expected to keep its quantitive easing programme unchanged but suggest it is ready to act further if necessary. Many economists believe an expansion of the programme - which involves \u20ac60bn of asset purchases a month and is due to run until at least September 2016 - could be unveiled in December. ECB board member Ewald Nowotny said it was too early to discuss changing the programme in one of a couple of interviews over the weekend and today. He said (quote from Reuters): In my view it\u2019s too early to talk about (adjusting the asset purchases) because we still have almost a year of the programme ahead of us. Economists at RBC Capital Markets said: [Nowotny] remarked that Fed policy was not a \u201cdecisive aspect\u201d in ECB decision-making, and that one should also not overestimate the impact of a slowdown in China. His more hawkish tone contrasts with the dovish tenor to his remarks from last week, where he acknowledged the clear weakness in domestic inflationary trends. Nowotny said in a separate interview that the ECB has to show it is in control of inflation but governments may need to loosen fiscal policies to boost growth. He said it was too early to determine long term inflation trends, with low oil and commodity prices at the moment having a strong influence. The service sector is now the biggest part of the Chinese economy: One of the shares pushing the German market higher is Deutsche Bank. It has jumped more than 3% after unveiling plans over the weekend to split its investment bank in two, and removing a number of top executives as part of an overhaul by chief executive John Cryan. Earlier this month the bank announced a record loss of \u20ac6bn in the third quarter. The full story is here: European markets are now making a better fist of it after an uncertain start, as traders take a more positive view of the Chinese data (it was disappointing but not as bad as expected). The FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.9% and France\u2019s Cac is up 0.8%. Over in Greece, and the country\u2019s creditors will be reviewing its finances and the progress of reforms to release the next tranche of the \u20ac2bn rescue package. The move follows the successful passing of measures through parliament early on Saturday, despite protests against the package. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Representatives of Greece\u2019s lenders \u2013 the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 are expected to return to Athens on Tuesday to start a review that, Greece hopes, will end successfully, paving the way for the launch of talks on debt relief. The auditors are to scour Greece\u2019s finances too, following the presentation of the draft budget. Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos is expected to request flexibility, arguing that the recession estimates in the draft budget \u2013 2.3% of gross domestic product this year and 1.3% next year \u2013 are overly pessimistic. His aim is to eliminate some of the more contentious austerity measures that Greece has suspended, such as plans for a 23% value added tax on private schools and higher taxes on rental income. As regards pension reform, another controversial issue, the government is keen to convince creditors to allow the inclusion of certain prior actions in a broader overhaul of the pension system, to come later. As regards the \u20ac2bn loan tranche, the Euro Working Group is to convene on Wednesday and may recommend the immediate release of the money or may ask Greece to legislate more actions from the first list of prior actions. The full report is here. Despite the weak Chinese numbers, Tim Condon at ING Bank believes the Chinese central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates any further. He said: The third quarter GDP data on its own implies a revision in our full-year forecast to 6.9% from 6.8%. However, our previous forecast was based on an acceleration in fourth quarter growth from reduced financial market turbulence and the impact of the stimulus implemented in response to the turbulence. We think the argument still applies and we are revising our full-year forecast to 7.0% (Bloomberg consensus 6.8%). We see the September economic data, including the money and credit data released last week, as enabling the PBOC to remain on hold. We are revising our forecast of one 25 basis point policy interest cut in the current quarter to no more cuts. We retain our forecast of one more cut in the reserve ratio requirement [the amount of cash that lenders must hold as reserves] in the current quarter to sterilize the impact of hot money outflows on interbank liquidity. One of the biggest UK fallers so far is pharmaceutical group Shire. Its shares are down 1.8% after the US Food and Drug Administration said late on Friday that it would not approve the company\u2019s new dry eye drug, lifitegrast, based on current data. Chief executive Flemming Ornskov said he was disappointed but still hoped to launch the treatment in 2016. If results from a new phase 3 trial due by the end of the year are positive, Shire planned to refile a submission to the FDA in the first quarter of 2016. Ornskov said: We are committed to working with FDA to expeditiously provide the evidence required to deliver a new prescription treatment option for the 29 million adults in the US living with the symptoms of this chronic and progressive disease. This is an area of unmet medical need for which there has been no new FDA-approved treatment in over a decade. The weak Chinese GDP data has seen European shares get off to an uncertain start for the week. The FTSE 100 is up 0.15% but Germany\u2019s Dax, France\u2019s Cac and Spain\u2019s Ibex have dipped 0.2%. In China itself, the Shanghai composite has ended down 0.1% at 3386.7 points. Oil prices have edged lower on renewed concerns about a lack of demand amid a supply glut, with Brent crude down 0.48% at $50.22 a barrel. On the corporate front, ITV has agreed to pay \u00a3100m for the television business of Northern Irish broadcaster UTV in a long expected deal. It means the long-gestating consolitation of the independent television network is getting into its final stages, with 13 of the 15 licences now in the hands of ITV. Analysts at Liberum: We see the deal as a strategic plus, especially if ITV can charge retransmission revenues for the main channel where we expect more newsflow before Christmas. We reiterate ITV as our top pick in media sector. More suggestions the official Chinese GDP figure may be an overestimation: The Chinese data comes as the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, begins his first official state visit to London. There are likely to be deals signed and co-operation agreements made, but the visit is controversial. It is likely to be marked by protests against human rights abuses, and concerns that the UK may be jeopardising national security by allowing Chinese state companies to invest in British nuclear power plants. And it comes amid increased wariness towards China by the US. More here: In Asia the Shanghai Composite is currently down 0.48%, while the Nikkei is 0.88% lower and the Hang Seng is down 0.54%. European markets are expected to make an uncertain start after the mixed messages from the Chinese data. Here are the opening forecasts from IG Index: Good morning and welcome to our our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. China is in the spotlight once more, with news of a slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter. The world\u2019s second largest economy grew by 6.9%, compared to 7% in the previous quarter, and the lowest rate since the 6.2% recorded in 2009 during the global recession. The figure was slightly better than the 6.7% expected by economists but is still likely to prompt concerns about the outlook. The government has cut interest rates five times since November, and further stimulus measures are expected in the wake of a continued slowdown. Our full report is here: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Last week\u2019s China trade balance numbers showed that while exports improved slightly, the sharp drop in imports suggested that internal demand remains constrained by the weakness in commodity prices, as well as lower domestic consumption, raising concerns that the Chinese government could well find it difficult to hit its 7% GDP target for this year. This morning\u2019s Chinese Q3 GDP was expected to reinforce these concerns, but came in rather conveniently slightly better than markets had been expecting at 6.9%, and above some of the more pessimistic expectations of 6.7%. While most people accept that China\u2019s GDP numbers should only be taking at face value, due to concerns that it is artificially inflated, this number does seem surprisingly good given how weak some of the more recent individual data components have been. This is borne out by a much bigger than expected drop in the September industrial production numbers, which came in at 5.7% and well below expectations of 6%, and well down from 6.1% in August, while Chinese retail sales saw an increase of 10.9%, only slightly higher than August\u2019s 10.8%. Fixed asset investment also disappointed, coming in at 10.3%, down from 10.9% in August. Economist Danny Gabay of Fathom Consulting echoed the scepticism about the Chinese figures. He told the Today programme: \u201cThe figures are produced remarkably quickly and rarely revised.\u201d And he believes the real figure is closer to 3%. Otherwise it appears a relatively quiet day so far, but we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all the latest developments.",

Many economists believe an expansion of the programme - which involves \u20ac60bn of asset purchases a month and is due to run until at least September 2016 - could be unveiled in December.</p> <p>ECB board member Ewald Nowotny said it was too early to discuss changing the programme in one of a couple of interviews over the weekend and today.

      "bodyText": "China is on the road to recovery. Or maybe it isn\u2019t, at least not for some time, say the contradictory reports on the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The latest GDP figures, showing a growth rate in the third quarter of 6.9%, down from 7% in the second quarter, have done little to lay this particular debate to rest. Some analysts argue Beijing is stuck in a rut, unable to wean itself off the colossal volumes of investment that it needs to keep its industrial turbines turning. Others spy a rising middle class with a strong appetite for services. They argue China will soon be rebalancing away from smoke-stack industries to employ millions more people in an expanded health service, transport system and financial services. What they all agree on is that official figures from Beijing\u2019s economic ministries should be treated with scepticism. Independent analysts at Lombard Street Research (LSR) stand firmly in the camp supporting China\u2019s shift to a more balanced economy, with industrial businesses less likely to soak up investment funds, allowing more funds for consumption. But for several years LSR has been one of the most sceptical users of official data. To illustrate the point, earlier this year when the official growth rate was 7% \u2013 the government target rate of growth \u2013 LSR was arguing it was below 4%. Its analysis depended on an interpretation of figures showing that industrial output had slowed more dramatically than official estimates and the sector\u2019s profitability had all but evaporated. Since then GDP has recovered, it says, with services in the vanguard. That means a rebalancing is running in tandem with a recovering economy, albeit with many bumps in the road and a warning to investors to steer clear of Shanghai\u2019s volatile stock market. Analysts at Fathom Consulting present a gloomier outlook. They are similarly sceptical of the official figures but far from interpreting the last two years as a rollercoaster of slumps and recovery, they describe a long decline with little upturn in sight. In a recent note it said: \u201cMany now widely dismiss China\u2019s official GDP statistics as little more than propaganda, and growth forecasts are slowly drifting closer to our own view. We have warned for years that China was at risk of a hard landing, and our China momentum indicator now suggests that growth is closer to 3% per annum.\u201d Nancy Curtin, the chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, is in the rebalancing camp. She said: \u201cThe service cogs are still improving and we can\u2019t be too negative about the medium-term prospects of an economy with both fiscal and monetary tools at its disposal, as well as a middle class taking a greater share of the economic pie. \u201cFor now, policymakers will no doubt attempt to mitigate some of the pressure and soothe the markets, and in the longer term eyes will be on other elements of the service sector to see if it can provide a leg up.\u201d The refusal of the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates while China\u2019s slowdown feeds market instability will give Beijing policymakers breathing space. As Curtin said, the question will be how China uses that breathing space.",

      "bodyText": "A planning logjam has contributed to weakened demand for bricks for housebuilding in the last few months, according to Michelmersh Brick Holdings, the largest maker of specialist bricks. Michelmersh\u2019s chief executive, Martin Warner, said the general election in May and increases to stamp duty for expensive homes had put some projects on hold but that delays caused by the planning process were the main reason. \u201cConstruction is down. We have seen it over the summer. If you talk to developers, one of the biggest problems is planning. The planning process is getting worse and worse rather than better,\u201d he said. In a trading update, Michelmersh said the company delivered fewer bricks than expected for the second half of the year but that prices were higher than budgeted. Michelmersh is supplying millions of bricks to match original Victorian bricks for the redevelopment of Elephant &amp; Castle in south London, while its Hathern Terra Cotta arm supplies materials for restoration at the New Bond Street flagship store of designer fashion label Jimmy Choo. Britain suffered a brick shortage in the last two years as a rise in housebuilding absorbed bricks stockpiled during the construction downturn following the financial crisis. Lack of bricks and bricklayers threatened to thwart government housebuilding proposals but Warner said planning is now the bigger obstacle because the mothballed brickworks have reopened. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do us too much harm to have a few more bricks in stock. We should be happy with where we are.\u201d Warner said he expected demand to pick up again after the first quarter of next year as projects receive planning approval and plans put on hold before the election take shape. \u201cPeople do get through planning eventually and the fundamental demand is there,\u201d he said. The government has pledged to relax planning requirements to encourage the construction of 200,000 starter homes for sale each year. In his party conference speech this month, the UK prime minister, David Cameron, said he would scrap rules that require developers to build affordable homes for rent. Warner said brick prices had increased despite the reduction in demand. Along with cost efficiencies, this means Michelmersh\u2019s profit for the year ending 30 December is likely to exceed forecasts. \u201cWe price ahead of the game and bricks are still very cheap in the grand scheme of things. The average price of a brick is 32p which is less than the price of a Mars bar.\u201d Analysts at Cenkos Securities increased their forecast for annual profit at Michelmersh to \u00a34.2m from \u00a33.8m but the brickmaker\u2019s comments on weakened demand sent the share price down 7.5% to 95p.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s economic growth slowed in the latest quarter to a six-year low of 6.9%, despite repeated interest rate cuts and other stimulus measures. The figure released on Monday compared with a year-on-year expansion of 7% in the previous quarter. Although it was slightly better than economists expected, the rate was the slowest since the 6.2% recorded in the first quarter of 2009 during the global recession. The GDP figures were part of a swath of data released on Monday giving another snapshot of the world\u2019s second biggest economy, which has seen stuttering growth in recent months after years of rapid expansion. It was also the first official confirmation of investors\u2019 fears about economic growth since a Chinese stock market slump coupled with a surprise currency devaluation in July and August. The output of China\u2019s huge manufacturing sector cooled more than expected to 5.7% in September, disappointing analysts who expected it to rise 6% on an annual basis after a rise of 6.1%the prior month. Fixed-asset investment growth eased to 10.3% year-on-year in the January-September period, also missing market expectations. But retail sales rose by a better-than-forecast 10.9%. The communist government has cut interest rates five times since last November in an effort to shore up growth, measures which have helped to ease investor fears that a downturn could trigger a worldwide slump. Shares in Asia Pacific shares held around two-month highs after the release of the figures. Although the Nikkei in Japan was down 0.5%, the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.88% and the ASX/S&amp;P200 was up 0.2% in Australia. Economists expected the Beijing government would stick to its policy of intervening to stimulate growth. \u201cThe manufacturing industry might cause most concern as it is a pillar of China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities in Shanghai. \u201cThe central bank is very likely to cut the interest rate and reserve ratio to help the economy, maybe also reduce taxes. Some short-term stimulation is also needed, such as simplification of the stock market system to boost more medium and small enterprises.\u201d \u201cWe see China\u2019s economy under downward pressure but relatively stable between 2012 and 2017, which is also a transformation period of China.\u201d Angus Nicholson of IG in Melbourne said the figures made it difficult for the markets to trust China\u2019s statistics office. \u201cOne could argue that GDP did grow at 7% in Q2 with the large contribution of financial services associated with the big rally in the stock markets [earlier in the year]. \u201cBut you would then have had to see a corresponding decrease in the Q3 number. The 6.9% Q3 GDP print really just makes one question the veracity of both the Q2 and Q3 numbers. It\u2019s hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Industrial production for September undershot at 5.7%, while nominal GDP came in at 6.2%.\u201d Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said: \u201cContinued downward pressures from real estate and exports caused GDP growth to drop. But robust consumption and infrastructure prevented a sharper slowdown.\u201d",
