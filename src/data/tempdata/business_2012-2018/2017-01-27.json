      "bodyText": "First came the home-baking revival, which prompted trays, tins and icing accoutrements to fly off shop shelves. Now more retro skills are making a big comeback: home sewing and dressmaking. Retailers are reporting a big leap in sales of dressmaking patterns and sewing machines, as a new generation battles with bobbins, pins and pinking shears. More than 1m people - almost all women - have taken up sewing in the last three years, according to research by the Craft &amp; Hobby Trade Association (CHA-UK), and 7.7m now count running up their own clothes as a hobby. According to Hobbycraft, the UK\u2019s biggest arts and crafts retailer, sales of patterns for both sewing and knitting soared 60% in 2016 \u2014 even though a dress pattern can cost more than a similar finished item at Primark \u2014 while sales of sewing machines have climbed nearly 30%. There has been a similar surge in the numbers reaching for their knitting needles, with their ranks swelling by 900,000 to 6.8m over the same period. Katharine Poulter, commercial director at Hobbycraft, said that, just as the Great British Bake-off boosted home baking, the BBC\u2019s The Great British Sewing Bee has helped rekindle interest in tailor\u2019s chalk and tape measures. The TV shows, says Poulter, \u201cmake people think the makers movement is a lovely thing to be part of.\u201d Low cost high street fashion and the end of school needlework lessons put a big dent in the popularity of sewing in the 80s and 90s, but the Sewing Bee, together with YouTube tutorials, enthusiastic hipsters and the wider handicrafts\u2019 renaissance has aided its comeback. \u201cHow we learn to do things is different now,\u201d says CHA-UK executive director Craig De Souza. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to sew and knit you can just watch a video on Youtube.\u201d Alex Jaycott, a director at Jaycotts, a Cheshire based family business that has been selling patterns and sewing equipment since 1920, says there has been a \u201cdefinite resurgence\u201d in interest. \u201cIn the last couple of years we have seen a huge uplift in sales of patterns and sewing equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been grassroots interest in sewing, thanks to the TV, but there is also the hipster thing going on, with the younger generation getting into it.\u201d Jaycott says sales have been boosted, as well-known pattern brands, such as Vogue and Butterick, have reissued vintage designs. One of last year\u2019s bestsellers was Vogue\u2019s Mondrian Dress, a \u00a310 pattern that enables DIY fashion enthusiasts to stitch together a lookalike of a classic 60\u2019s Yves Saint Laurent creation. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the business 30 years and certainly during the 80s and 90s it was tailing off and a lot of schools wouldn\u2019t have had a sewing machine in the building,\u201d says Jaycott. \u201cOver the last decade it has started to come back and sewing is being tackled from a fashion and design point of view.\u201d While many women used to learn how to sew in a straight line from their mother or grandmother, more recently that transfer of knowledge has broken down. Stores like Hobbycraft and John Lewis have stepped into the breach by offering tutorials, but for many learners the internet is key. A search on the word \u201csewing\u201d produces 1.9m how-to videos, tackling everything from threading a sewing machine to guides demonstrating how to draw your own complex patterns. Patrick Grant, creative director of Savile Row tailor Norton &amp; Sons, who was one of the Sewing Bee judges, says: \u201cIt\u2019s very therapeutic to make something with your hands. Sewing disappeared off the radar for 20 years but it, and craft in general, now feels a bit cooler. When I was a kid there was a stigma attached to wearing something homemade, but that has completely reversed.\u201d Grant, who is launching a range of sewing tools with Hobbycraft, has some words of encouragement for beginners: \u201cSewing is difficult to do really well but you can do something quite straightforward and it be good and wearable. Pyjama trousers are pretty simple, there\u2019s just a few steps - you just have to make sure they are big enough and long enough.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Re the letter from Charles Horton of Govia Thameslink Railway (21 January), removing the guarantee of \u201cturn up and go\u201d travel at 33 stations and formalising the need for advance booking all over the network means taking a significant step back for rail accessibility. It even goes against the grain of the rail industry itself, which is heading steadily towards the target of making all vehicles fully accessible by 1 January 2020. He should elaborate on exactly what \u201cclear system\u201d is in place for disabled passengers on Southern. We have recently heard reports of wheelchair users being left behind on platforms, as well as and instances of communication failures throughout the year \u2013 affecting even pre-booked travel. If he wants to restore disabled passengers\u2019 confidence, he should start by declaring publicly what percentage of trains are now running without an on-board supervisor. Southern should then begin a more intelligent approach to communications and staffing. Emily Yates Co-founder, Association of British Commuters \u2022 Calls for public ownership (Government planning possible takeover of Southern rail, 26 January) are understandable but there is also an opportunity to look at alternative ways of creating an efficient rail network \u2013 one that is trusted by passengers and workers alike. Inspiration can be taken from George Freeman MP, chair of the prime minister\u2019s policy board, who has long advocated a mutual model for rail franchises. This chimes neatly with both the Shaw report on the future shape and financing of Network Rail, which recommended that new franchises should have greater union and passenger representation, and with the PM\u2019s ambition for a greater voice for workers on company boards. More thought should be put into the running of rail franchises as multi-stakeholder social enterprises, with worker and passenger representation at the top table and a commitment to reinvesting profits in service delivery. Peter Holbrook Chief executive, Social Enterprise UK \u2022 Reading the letter from Charles Horton (CEO of Govia Thameslink Railway, the parent company of Southern) made me feel physically sick. Reports of disabled passengers being abandoned on station platforms, even despite having booked assistance in advance in accordance with Southern\u2019s degrading requirements, have been widely publicised. Mr Horton cannot blame Victorian infrastructure for the appalling consequences of his forcing through of driver-only operated services on the Southern network with no apparent regard for industrial relations or the health and safety of passengers. I am dependent on Southern to get to and from work. Mr Horton\u2019s stated aim of \u201cgetting all our passengers where they want to be, safely and on time\u201d is completely divorced from the daily reality experienced by many thousands of people. Rachel Martin Oxted, Surrey \u2022 You are quite right to highlight the plight of commuters in the East Sussex town of Seaford. As a resident here, I have become too used to spending four-plus hours a day on a train, often changing several times due to a multitude of excuses. When leaving London in the evenings, I now play the game \u201chow far south can I get before I resort to a taxi?\u201d However, the return of a full service is farcical. This week we have seen umpteen delays and disruption. While it\u2019s a relief to have the rail service back instead of replacement buses doubling the journey length, the delivery of service by Southern is not fit for purpose. The government has failed and the MP for the Lewes constituency, Maria Caulfield, has failed in this regard. Southern rail is a contract, not a franchise, meaning the government could and should have intervened sooner. The strikes were the tip of the iceberg, especially in Seaford, where we have had replacement rail buses for 11 of the past 18 months. The truth is that the government is taking areas like Seaford for granted, and the people have the right to feel betrayed. When will they stand up and take responsibility for a failing rail service and give it to an operator that can deliver. Kelly-Marie Blundell Seaford \u2022 As a disabled passenger, reliant on a mobility scooter and railways for transport, I can categorically state that the GTR approach to providing accessible transport is laughable and offensive. I have been abandoned due to last train cancellations, forced to wait for hours in the cold for taxis that, with the best will in the world, are incapable of transporting my scooter, been turfed off a train once boarded, refused boarding another, left on trains either \u201crunning fast\u201d or \u201cpulled up short\u201d due to either lack of platform or train staff, let alone a lack of communication between various parts of \u201coperations\u201d. There may be a perception that there are more staff than ever on trains but these are not readily evident, particularly within the London suburbs, this doesn\u2019t get over the lack of manned stations during all operational times. This is not guaranteeing disabled access! Until on-board supervisors and/or fully manned stations are mandatory and readily contactable this will never happen. I\u2019ve travelled via London Bridge and each time, upon my return, they have failed to call Coulsdon Town, meaning they are not aware I\u2019m on my way. If they can\u2019t contact them it seems they have no idea they need to contact Purley! While many may consider the railway infrastructure to be Victorian, the tracks and signalling have been upgraded since then. Or is Mr Horton now admitting that the technology introduced is not fit for purpose? I demand Mr Horton responds publicly.

      "bodyText": "Tesco has agreed a \u00a33.7bn deal to buy Booker, the cash and carry giant behind the Londis and Budgens convenience chains, in a move that will tighten its grip on the UK\u2019s \u00a3195bn food market. The deal is expected to be scrutinised by the competition authorities as Tesco is already the country\u2019s biggest retailer, with more than 3,500 stores and control of close to 30% of the grocery market. The proposed acquisition would turn Tesco into a major supplier to small retailers, serving 125,000 independent convenience stores as well as 468,000 restaurants and pubs. Analysts estimate the deal \u2013 if cleared by regulators \u2013 will hand Tesco another 2% of UK grocery sales courtesy of the Premier, Londis and Budgens chains that Booker supplies. The deal is the first major corporate move by Tesco since it was run by Sir Terry Leahy, who quit in 2011. In the years since, the grocer has been battered by the discounters and by the move to online and convenience shopping. Leahy\u2019s successor, Philip Clarke, was forced to step down after a series of profit warnings and the grocer was then engulfed in an accounting scandal that is still the subject of a Serious Fraud Office investigation. Tesco\u2019s current boss, Dave Lewis, who was parachuted in from Unilever to replace Clarke, said the Booker deal was good news for shoppers and the grocery industry. \u201cThe feedback we have had from our suppliers has been very positive, as they see a bigger, broader market opportunity,\u201d he said. Booker chief executive Charles Wilson added that the independent shopkeeepers he worked with were also enthusiastic: \u201cThey think this will help them provide a better offer to their customers.\u201d Lewis and Wilson batted away suggestions the Competition and Markets Authority would be wary of a deal that reinforces Tesco\u2019s dominant position in UK retail. \u201cWe are a wholesaler rather than a retailer,\u201d said Wilson, while Lewis highlighted that it was not acquiring convenience stores as the outlets served by Booker are owned by independent retailers. Booker\u2019s 200-strong cash and carry chain generates \u00a33.2bn of its \u00a35bn turnover. Retail experts nevertheless said Tesco\u2019s biggest challenge would be convincing regulators that competition in the convenience store market was not being lessened by the combination, as in some neighbourhoods it is possible that Tesco will either run or supply every grocery outlet. James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said opinion would be divided: \u201cSome retailers will welcome this news, others will be concerned about competing with stores supplied through the merged Booker and Tesco business, and some will be uneasy at the prospect of working in partnership with one of their biggest historical competitors.\u201d The ambitious plan was not met with universal enthusiasm by Tesco directors. Lewis admitted that Richard Cousins, the boss of catering group Compass who abruptly quit as Tesco\u2019s senior independent director earlier this month, had resigned over the deal, which took a year to negotiate. Cousins told the Financial Times he was \u201cvery much against the deal\u201d. He added: \u201cTesco is in the middle of a price war that could last for years. They need to make the business simpler, not more complex.\u201d Lewis said the board had a \u201cgood debate\u201d over the merits of the deal which was \u201cgood governance\u201d. He said that the rest of the Tesco board had backed the tie-up. Some analysts suggested Lewis was biting off more than he could chew. Since taking the reins in 2014, he has been restructuring Tesco following the accounting scandal and turning around the performance of its core UK supermarkets. Earlier this month, the grocer unveiled a strong Christmas performance. John Colley, a professor of practice at Warwick Business School, said Cousins\u2019 departure was significant: \u201cCompass has stuck to what it knows very successfully and shunned diversification as their shareholders will agree. Tesco seems to be chasing distractions before the job is finished in the supermarket grocery business.\u201d Tesco shares closed up 9% at 206p, while Booker shares leapt 16% to 213.4p. Tesco\u2019s shares were also boosted by its promise to resume dividend payments in the 2017-18 financial year. Wilson ruled out large-scale job losses, arguing that the savings would come from greater efficiency and procurement. He was confident that Booker\u2019s brand names Londis, Budgens, Premier and Family Shopper would remain. Under the terms of the deal, each Booker shareholder will receive 0.861 Tesco shares and 42.6p in cash, worth 205.3p a share. Booker shareholders will own 16% of the combined business. The deal has been recommended by both boards, but needs approval from regulators and both sets of shareholders. \u201cThe initial gut reaction, which is usually the best one, is that it may be sound for Tesco but far from compelling for Booker shareholders,\u201d said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. \u201cTesco is not a business without a lot to do fixing the UK stores, trying to make online sustainably profitable, rebuilding profitability in central Europe and generally deleveraging. Whether or not the integration of Booker is an ideal strategic step is subject to debate to our minds.\u201d Black added that the non-Booker independent and wholesale trade would be \u201cup in arms\u201d at this proposed merger. \u201cSo it could be a very messy process,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "British Airways cabin crew are to step up strike action by holding a six-day walkout in early February, in an escalating dispute about pay. Approximately 2,900 members of Unite in the mixed fleet division, a branch of predominantly younger and lower-paid BA recruits, will strike for three days from Sunday 5 February, and again from Thursday 9 February. The action follows two strikes totalling five days in January, which forced BA to cancel scores of flights. The airline said disruption to passengers was minimal, with all flying to their destinations on alternative or merged departures. BA also leased planes and crew from Titan Airways to operate dozens more flights on its behalf. Union reps from the mixed fleet urged the airline to engage in further talks to avert more action. In a letter, they wrote: \u201cYour reluctance to offer a reasonable pay deal to our members, yet spend what we believe is now reaching millions of pounds in trying to quash strike action, suggests money is available and this is a question of ideology. \u201cWe urge you to recognise that there is a chance here for British Airways to take a different route.\u201d The mixed fleet was set up by BA during the bitter industrial dispute between cabin crew and the airline in 2010, and all new recruits now join the branch, which operates both short-haul and long-haul flights from Heathrow. Basic pay starts at \u00a312,192, although BA says all earn at least \u00a321,000 a year once hourly flying pay and bonuses are added. Unite claims the average pay is \u00a316,000, including allowances. Unite\u2019s national officer, Oliver Richardson, said: \u201cRather than addressing poverty pay, British Airways is spending money hand over fist on chartering in aircraft to cover striking cabin crew. \u201cIf it can afford to waste money in such a manner then British Airways can clearly afford to address pay levels which are among the lowest in the industry.\u201d A BA spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have flown all customers to their destinations during the previous strikes by mixed fleet Unite and we will ensure this happens again. \u201cOur pay offer for Mixed Fleet crew is consistent with deals agreed with Unite for other British Airways colleagues. It also reflects pay awards given by other companies in the UK and will ensure that rewards for mixed fleet remain in line with those for cabin crew at our airline competitors.\u201d The airline said it would publish more details next week of its contingency plans for passengers who have booked to travel during the strike. Virgin Atlantic cabin crew were this month given a pay rise worth about 10% over two years after negotiations between Unite and the airline.",

    "webTitle": "Strong dollar drags US growth to slowest pace since 2011", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy slowed last year to register its worst performance since 2011 after the strong dollar sent exports tumbling and encouraged American businesses to import cheaper components from abroad. But the worsening trade position was offset by increases in consumer spending and business investment that analysts said would hand President Donald Trump a strong and growing economy. The Department of Commerce said US national income (GDP) expanded at an annualised rate of 1.9%, down from 3.5% in the third quarter and below analysts\u2019 forecasts of a 2.2% increase. For 2016 as a whole, the economy grew 1.6%, losing top spot in the G7 group of industrialised nations to the UK\u2019s 2%. It was the worst showing since 2011 and down markedly from 2.6% growth in 2015. Analysts said the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of last year\u2019s presidential election and the UK\u2019s Brexit vote meant that forecasts of trade and GDP growth were becoming cloudy and less predictable. The slowdown, even if it proves temporary, could also deter the Federal Reserve \u2013 the US central bank \u2013 from raising interest rates again until the picture becomes more certain. Trump and his treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, have insisted that the US economy can expand at a faster rate than under the Obama administration. Mnuchin, a former financier at Goldman Sachs, said last year after his nomination that GDP growth of 4% would be achievable once Congress implemented a series of tax cuts and spending plans put forward by Trump. But the high value of the dollar, which has hit exports, and Trump\u2019s threat to implement protectionist measures, including a 20% tariff on all Mexican imports to fund a border wall, have created uncertainty and dented Wall Street optimism for higher growth in 2017. Exports slumped by 4.5% in the last three months of the year with most of the hit coming from disappointing soybean sales, which rose sharply in the third quarter after a poor soy harvest in Argentina and Brazil before falling back to more normal levels. America\u2019s poor trade performance subtracted 1.7 percentage points from growth in the final three months of 2016. Nevertheless, consumer confidence has remained elevated and consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of economic growth, increased by 2.5% in the last three months of 2016 while business investment nudged 2.4% higher to register its best performance in more than a year. With a labour market that some economists say is at \u2013 or close to \u2013 full employment, the outlook for the economy remains bright, say some analysts. Wages are rising, housing construction is robust and banks are well placed to increase lending. Promised infrastructure spending by the Trump administration and the repatriation of factories by some of the biggest companies in the US are also expected to give the economy a short-term rush of activity. House construction, which had been falling for two quarters, rebounded in the fourth quarter, rising at an annual rate of 10.2% while government spending grew at a 1.2% rate as strength in state and local activity offset a drop in activity at the federal level. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: \u201cThe \u2018America first\u2019 expansionary policy, which is expected to include increased infrastructure spending and highly pro-business policies, should stimulate further growth in GDP. \u201cHowever, with the president less than one week in office and with key global trade agreements, including with the UK, still yet to be decided, it will be a while before we start to see the true impact of Trumponomics.\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the slowdown in fourth-quarter growth was not a cause for concern since the third and fourth quarter performances were heavily influenced by a temporary swing in exports. \u201cWe would be wary of reading too much into the slowdown in GDP growth ... because the temporary spike in soybean exports boosted the third quarter and subtracted from the fourth quarter,\u201d he said. Ian Kernohan, economist at fund manager Royal London Asset Management, said growth could reach 3% this year if Trump delivers his promised stimulus measures. But he expects the Fed to wait until that happens before embarking on further rate rises. He said: \u201cGoing forward, much will depend on the scale and timing of any fiscal stimulus by the new Trump administration, which could push US GDP growth to over 3% by 2018. We do not expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again until May, when they will have greater visibility on the new administration\u2019s plans.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s first nuclear power station in two decades will be delayed by a government decision to quit Europe\u2019s atomic power treaty, experts have warned. Ministers revealed on Thursday that Brexit would involve the UK leaving Euratom, which promotes research into nuclear power and uniform safety standards. The news poses problems for the Hinkley Point C station in Somerset, while raising questions over safety inspection regimes and the UK\u2019s future participation in nuclear fusion research. \u201cLeaving Euratom is a lose-lose for everyone. For nuclear proponents, the industry becomes less competitive \u2013 and for nuclear critics, safety regulation diminishes,\u201d said Dr Paul Dorfman of the Energy Institute at University College London. Referring to Hinkley and other nuclear projects in the pipeline, he said: \u201cThe UK nuclear industry is critically dependent on European goods and services in the nuclear supply chain and their specialist nuclear skills. Leaving Euratom will inevitably increas nuclear costs and will mean further delays. EDF, which is building the Hinkley project and hopes to construct other plants, has told MPs that \u201cideally\u201d the UK would stay in the treaty, as it provided a framework for complying with international standards for handling nuclear material. Without mentioning Hinkley, the French state-owned company also warned that restrictions on the movement of people because of Brexit could delay delivery of new energy infrastructure. Antony Froggatt, a research fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said: \u201cOutside of Euratom and the single market, the movement of nuclear fuel, equipment and trained staff will be more complicated.\u201d He noted that because the UK was a supporter of nuclear power, Brexit would affect the balance of nuclear policies in the EU, where Germany, Italy and even strongly pro-nuclear France had taken steps in recent years to reduce their reliance on atomic power. Vince Zabielski, a nuclear energy specialist at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, said: \u201cIf the UK leaves Euratom before new standalone nuclear cooperation treaties are negotiated with France and the US, current new build projects will be placed on hold while those standalone treaties are negotiated.\u201d Other lawyers questioned why the government had decided to quit Euratom and in the manner it had done so, in the explanatory notes accompany the article 50 bill. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to have been any real explanation as to why, because we are going towards the unknown at great speed. Legally we don\u2019t have to [leave Euratom because the UK is leaving the EU],\u201d said Jonathan Leech, a senior lawyer and nuclear expert at Prospect Law. \u201cAt the moment, the UK standing on the world nuclear stage is predicated on a series of cooperation agreements, and those we have the benefit of from being a member of Euratom, and the few bilateral agreements are based on Euratom, too. Take that away and you have no basis for international nuclear cooperation.\u201d He said quitting Euratom would create unnecessary uncertainty for new nuclear power and research into fusion power, a cleaner alternative to nuclear fission in which the UK has been a world leader for decades. Although the short-term future of the Joint European Torus, a nuclear fusion research centre in Oxfordshire, is guaranteed until 2018, last year\u2019s referendum result and the withdrawal from Euratom puts its longer-term future in doubt. Bernard Bigot, the director of the ITER project, a huge international undertaking to develop nuclear fusion in the south of France, said he believed the UK could still participate in ITER even when it leaves the treaty. \u201cThere are several ways for the UK to pursue its participation to ITER within the Brexit policy, if there is political will of the UK and the EU. This could occur either within or outside of the Euratom arrangement,\u201d he said. Leaving Euratom is likely to also add to the workload of the UK\u2019s nuclear regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, which is busy assessing designs for Britain\u2019s first Chinese-designed nuclear power plant. \u201cThe main burden of the UK leaving Euratom will be the need for it to cover its nuclear non-proliferation safeguards commitment and for this it will have to either set up a separate, independent agency or bring these treaty responsibilities into the Office for Nuclear Regulation,\u201d said John Large, a nuclear consultant. EDF said it had made its view clear on Euratom, and rejected the suggestion that the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the treaty would delay Hinkley Point C. A government spokeswoman said the UK wanted to see a continuity of cooperation and standards. \u201cWe remain absolutely committed to the highest standards of nuclear safety, safeguards and support for the industry. Our aim is clear \u2013 we want to maintain our mutually successful civil nuclear cooperation with the EU,\u201d she said.",

    "webTitle": "Final US growth figures under Obama are a triumph \u2013 for Trump  | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The last set of growth figures for Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in the White House could hardly have been better. For the new president, that is. Judging by the preliminary estimates, the pace of US growth slowed in the final three months of 2016 \u2013 and by more than Wall Street had been anticipating. Activity expanded at an annualised rate of 1.9% in the fourth quarter, down from 3.5% in the previous three months. Donald Trump, therefore, has a much easier inheritance than Obama, who came into office with the US suffering its biggest slump since the Great Depression. Obama\u2019s first job in 2009 was to stop the bleeding: halt the rise in unemployment and stop businesses going bust. This was achieved through highly aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and a short-lived burst of fiscal activism. It was enough to get the economy moving again, but not deliver the sort of turbocharged perfomance that had followed previous post-second world war recessions. The economy is growing, but not particularly strongly for a country with a history of bouncing back rapidly from setbacks. In 2016 as a whole, gross domestic product increased by 1.6%, compared with 2.6% the previous year. This fits with Trump\u2019s core message that something has gone fundamentally wrong with the world\u2019s biggest economy. There are, however, two other reasons why Trump should thank his lucky stars. The first is that the breakdown of the growth figure into its component parts shows the main reason for the slowdown in the fourth quarter was that exports fell and imports rose. America\u2019s poor trade performance subtracted 1.7 percentage points from growth in the final three months of 2016. This is not particularly surprising, given that the US dollar has been rising on foreign exchanges, which makes imports cheaper and exports less competitive. It also goes against the trend for the first three quarters of 2016, when exports helped increase growth. But, again, the latest data fits with Trump\u2019s narrative that more needs to be done to repatriate production and limit imports. The second reason Trump should count his blessings is that he will get the credit when the economy starts to grow more quickly this year, as it would even without the tax cuts and infrastructure spending he plans. Obama, despite what the new president has claimed, did not leave the economy in terrible shape. Growth picked up quite appreciably in the second half of 2016 and the economy is doing well enough for the Fed to consider raising interest rates again in March. There are potential problems for Trump. One is the impact of a strong dollar, not just on trade, but on vulnerable emerging market countries that have their debts denominated in the US currency. The other is that while his proposed tariffs and import taxes would help US producers, they would raise prices for US consumers, leading to reduced spending and slower growth, rather than faster.",

Obama\u2019s first job in 2009 was to stop the bleeding: halt the rise in unemployment and stop businesses going bust.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/27/us-economic-growth-slows-to-lowest-rate-since-2011\">US economic growth slows to lowest rate since 2011</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was achieved through highly aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and a short-lived burst of fiscal activism. It was enough to get the economy moving again, but not deliver the sort of turbocharged perfomance that had followed previous post-second world war recessions. <br></p> <p>The economy is growing, but not particularly strongly for a country with a history of bouncing back rapidly from setbacks.</p> <p>In 2016 as a whole, gross domestic product increased by 1.6%, compared with 2.6% the previous year. This fits with Trump\u2019s core message that something has gone fundamentally wrong with the world\u2019s biggest economy.</p> <p>There are, however, two other reasons why Trump should thank his lucky stars. The first is that the breakdown of the growth figure into its component parts shows the main reason for the slowdown in the fourth quarter was that exports fell and imports rose. America\u2019s poor trade performance subtracted 1.7 percentage points from growth in the final three months of 2016.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/us-gdp/\" data-alt=\"US GDP chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/us-gdp/\">US GDP chart</a> </figure>  <p>This is not particularly surprising, given that the US dollar has been rising on foreign exchanges, which makes imports cheaper and exports less competitive. It also goes against the trend for the first three quarters of 2016, when exports helped increase growth. But, again, the latest data fits with Trump\u2019s narrative that more needs to be done to repatriate production and limit imports.</p> <p>The second reason Trump should count his blessings is that he will get the credit when the economy starts to grow more quickly this year, as it would even without the tax cuts and infrastructure spending he plans. Obama, despite what the new president has claimed, did not leave the economy in terrible shape. Growth picked up quite appreciably in the second half of 2016 and the economy is doing well enough for the Fed to consider raising interest rates again in March.</p> <p>There are potential problems for Trump. One is the impact of a strong dollar, not just on trade, but on vulnerable emerging market countries that have their debts denominated in the US currency. The other is that while his proposed tariffs and import taxes would help US producers, they would raise prices for US consumers, leading to reduced spending and slower growth, rather than faster.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all the comments below the line. Have a good weekend. AM Kay Daniel Neufeld at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, looks back at the US economy under President Obama: The mixed picture for GDP growth in 2016 has been characteristic of the economic performance of the outgoing Obama administration. Under Obama, the US managed to avoid a second Great Depression and embarked on a somewhat lacklustre recovery starting in 2010. But, although the economy added a fair amount of jobs and the economic situation of many US households has improved considerably after the crisis, some downsides remain. Notably, the labour force participation rate has failed to pick up in line with what would be expected during the recovery of a sharp recession. Moreover, the US economy - similarly to the situation in the UK \u2013 is ailing from slow productivity growth. Most importantly, it seems that much of the increase in wages and job opportunities of the last six years has intensified already existing inequalities in the country. In terms of Mr Trump\u2019s economic policy programme, it is still unclear whether the administration will go ahead with the announced boost to infrastructure spending and additional tax cuts. If so we expect the Fed to raise interest rates in the second quarter of 2017 at the latest. The FTSE 100 is the only major European index making gains this afternoon, albeit small ones (up 8 points). Tesco is still the biggest riser, with shares up 10.5%. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,170 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 11,822 France\u2019s CAC: -0.6% at 4,840 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 19,308 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.4% at 9,478 Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research is fairly positive about the outlook for the American economy. We think that the economy is on track to expand by 2% to 2.25% in the first half of the year. Under the assumption that the new administration will pass a fiscal stimulus in time without derailing global trade, growth in the second half of 2017 will most likely be faster. US markets have opened (very) slightly higher: Dow Jones: +0.01% at 20,103 S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 2,299 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,667 Ian Kernohan, economist at fund manager Royal London Asset Management, said the US economy could grow by more than 3% by 2018. US GDP growth was estimated at 1.9% on an annualised basis in the final quarter of 2016, and just 1.6% for the calendar year. However, this relatively slow expansion was still sufficient to drive employment levels higher and unemployment lower, leading to a pick-up in wage growth. Going forward, much will depend on the scale and timing of any fiscal stimulus by the new Trump administration, which could push US GDP growth to over 3% by 2018. We do not expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again until May, when they will have greater visibility on the new administration\u2019s plans. US growth in 2016 overall was 1.6%, the slowest since 2011 and far weaker than the 2.6% growth achieved in 2015. It was also a slower rate than the UK, which grew by 2% in 2016 - probably faster than any other G7 economy (we haven\u2019t got all the figures yet). Here is our full story on the US figures: IG traders expect US markets to open higher Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, says the slowdown in US growth will not deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in March. Q4 GDP of 1.9% is not a bad figure, when taken together with the unrevised 3.5% growth in Q3, and suggests that the US economy picked up momentum in the second half of the year. With few shocks in the data, the main source of interest we think is the business investment figure, which rose by 3.1% (annualised quarter on quarter), following four quarters of declines. Fed hawks will take heart from this data. This is another clue that markets are still too cautious with respect to the timing of the next Fed rate hike. We see few reasons why the Fed should wait until June, and look for a March hike. Growth in the world\u2019s largest economy was held back in the fourth quarter by plunging shipments of soybeans, which in turn dragged exports lower. Household spending was a key driver of the 1.9% headline rate of economic growth, the US department of commerce said. Worth pointing out that the US quarterly growth figures are annual rates... Alternatively... Breaking: Growth in the US slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 1.9% from 3.5% in the third quarter. Economists predicted growth of 2.2%. More soon. Growth in the world\u2019s largest economy slowed to 2.2% in the final quarter of 2016, from 3.5% in the third, figures out in less than an hour are expected to show. It will provide investors with a steer on what shape the economy was in as Obama handed Trump the keys to the White House. Failure to break the impasse of deadlocked bailout talks at Thursday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting saw the Athens Stock Exchange shed 2.9% today with bank shares plummeting by more than 5%. The next tranche of emergency funding from Greece\u2019s third \u20ac86bn bailout hinges on the conclusion of a review by creditors of Greek progress on reforms. If the funds are not released, a re-run of the Greek debt crisis looms. Athens has to meet around \u20ac10.5bn in debt repayments as of July \u2013 money it currently does not have. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government has been keen to wrap up the review so that Greece can join the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme \u2013 viewed as essential if Greece is to regain access to international capital markets. But to do this Tsipras will have to agree to imposing more austerity once the current aid programme expires in mid 2018. As eurozone finance ministers met, the International Monetary Fund reiterated its belief that Greek debt is unsustainable, predicting it would become \u201cexplosive\u201d after 2030. In Greece, fears of euro expulsion and fresh elections are growing. Either Tsipras bows to demands at a time when his government\u2019s popularity has nosedived, or he calls early polls ushering in a period of renewed uncertainty for the EU\u2019s weakest member state. Greek shares are down today after lack of progress between Greece and its fellow eurozone members at Thursday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem called on Greece to move faster on reforms so that its creditors\u2019 could return to Athens as soon as possible and resume negotiations about the next tranche of funding. The Athens stock exchange is down 2.9%, with banking stocks the biggest fallers: Sticking with currencies, the European Central Bank has revealed that it withdrew about \u20ac17,000 worth of fake \u20ac500 bank notes from circulation in the second half of 2016. The latest figures from the ECB show that almost 4.9% of the \u20ac353,000 withdrawn were \u20ac500 notes. The ECB said: Some 353,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in the second half of 2016, a slight increase compared with the first half of 2016 and 20.7% fewer than in the second half of 2015. The number of counterfeits remains very low in comparison with the increasing number of genuine banknotes in circulation (over 19 billion during the second half of 2016). The vast majority of counterfeits were \u20ac20 and \u20ac50 notes, accounting for 80%. The ECB has already announced that it will scrap the \u20ac500 note over fears that the high denomination notes are used to finance crime. The pound has slipped from a five-week high this morning but is still on track for a weekly gain. Investors have been encouraged by better-than-expected growth figures which showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2016. The pound is currently down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.2539. The number of individuals to be declared financially bust in 2013 rose 13% in 2016 to 90,930 (from 80,404). The figures from the government\u2019s Insolvency Service cover England and Wales. It was the first rise in six years. \u201cIt is very distressing to live with unsustainable personal debt so it is important for people to seek advice\u201d, said Sarah Albon, chief executive of the service. National Debtline which provides free advice online and over the phone, said the figures point to tougher times ahead for families. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust which runs National Debtline, said: While the government is rightly focused on those who are \u2018just about managing\u2019, these figures are a reminder that a smaller but growing number of households are not managing at all. The rise in insolvencies in 2016 points to tougher times ahead for UK households. At National Debtline we are already seeing our busiest January in years, with calls up 17% on last January and a rise of 55% in the number people seeking advice online. With household debt levels growing significantly and inflation now beginning to rise, we expect demand for debt advice to continue to be significantly higher this year than last. Not much sympathy for BT from blog readers commenting below the line... but shares are not suffering too much this morning, off 0.5%. That said, they did fall off a cliff on Tuesday, down 21% wiping almost \u00a38bn off the value of the company after the extent of the problems in Italy were laid bare. The share price graph tells the story: Over in France, households don\u2019t appear to be concerned about uncertainty surrounding elections, Brexit, the future of the eurozone, or anything else. Consumer confidence hit the a nine-year high in January according to the official statistics agency, Insee. The headline index hit 100 for the first time since November 2007. Julien Manceaux, ING senior economist covering France, says the upturn in sentiment and other positive indicators would be encouraging for the next French president. It is the first time since 2007 that French consumers have been that positive about the future. Consumer confidence has been improving since mid-2014, but it took until recently to see all components improving. In January, consumers were particularly optimistic on the future of unemployment and on their purchase intentions, although their current capacity to save remains limited. All in all, if this is another significant improvement (business confidence rebounded as well and industrial production was remarkably strong in the fourth quarter of 2016), there is still some way to go before to label it a full-speed recovery. However, these more positive signs have been awaited for a long time. If they are too late to save President Hollande\u2019s legacy, they are a strong starting point for the next French president. Here is our full story on the latest from BT, including a 37% slump in third-quarter profits. Investors are clearly happy about Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn deal with Booker. Tesco shares are now up almost 10%. Booker shares are up 16%. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Tesco is taking \u201ca bold new direction\u201d. The deal with Booker shows Tesco is not going to sit on its hands and wait for its dominant market position to slowly leak away to competitors. The UK\u2019s supermarkets are engaged in new strategies to cope with the brave new world, where the discounters have stolen market share and consumers have turned away from big superstores, preferring instead to do their shopping in convenience stores or on their mobile phones. Sainsbury bought Argos, Morrisons is flirting with Amazon, and now Tesco has revealed its plans to drive further growth. Nick Bubb, independent retail analyst, says the deal is likely to come under scrutiny from the competition regulator: Our instant reaction is that the Competition and Markets Authority will have a field day with this, as although Tesco is mainly a retailer in the UK and Booker a wholesaler, Tesco does own the One Stop convenience store chain that competes with Booker\u2019s interest in symbol groups and convenience store retailing (via Premier and Londis etc), so it is by no means clear that the CMA will allow things to proceed very far without having a good look at the overlap. The mystery behind Richard Cousins\u2019 departure from Tesco has been solved... Cousins, the chief executive of catering group Compass, quit as senior independent director of Tesco on 3 January just days before the supermarket chain revealed its Christmas trading figures. Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive confirmed today that Cousins resigned because he didn\u2019t agree with the Booker deal. Lewis described the discussions as \u201cgood governance\u201d and said he respected Cousins\u2019 decision. The rest of the board was behind the deal, he added. The John Lewis Partnership and pension trustee have agreed a 10-year plan to eliminate the pension deficit. John Lewis reduced its defined benefit pension scheme to \u00a3479m (as at 31 March 2016), from a previous valuation of \u00a3840m. The plan to eliminate the deficit includes a \u00a3303m cash contribution from the company, of which \u00a3183m is due to be paid before the end of March 2017. Gavin Patterson, BT\u2019s chief executive, has commented on what the accounting scandal might mean for his pay package (\u00a35.3m last year): [The issue is] for another day. That\u2019s that then.. Some more comments from BT boss Gavin Patterson. He has told reporters that while shareholders have a right to be angry about the accounting scandal in its Italian business, the situation was now under control: Frankly I am angry that the integrity of BT has been undermined by the wrongdoing of a few individuals in one part of the business. The situation is now under control, we have already appointed new management and as you would expect we are proactively providing assistance for the Italian authorities. We mustn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that BT is in good health overall. BT shares are down about 0.4%. The company has already said it will look at executive pay in light of the improper behaviour in Italy. Patterson earned \u00a35.3m last year including an annual bonus of just over \u00a31m and share awards worth \u00a33m. The finance director, Tony Chanmugam, who was already due to step down in July, received \u00a32.8m, including a \u00a3587,000 bonus. Philip Hammond, UK chancellor, has arrived in Brussels for the Ecofin meeting of finance ministers. He told reporters that Britain will respect its obligations under European Union rules as its seeks to strengthen trade ties around the world. It comes as Theresa May prepares to meet US President Trump later today, with a UK/US trade deal expected to be high on the agenda. Hammond said in Brussels: Of course we want to strengthen our trade ties with the very many trade partners we have around the world. But we are very mindful of our obligations under the treaty and will follow them precisely. Britain remains a fully engaged member of the European Union. We will continue to abide by the rules, regulations and the laws of the European Union for so long as we are members. Most of Europe\u2019s major markets are down in early trading. The FTSE 100 is the exception, but only just (up 5 points): FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,167 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 11,828 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 4,853 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 19,400 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 9,485 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 367 Tesco is at the top of the FTSE 100 leader board with shares up 8.3% after it revealed plans to by the food wholesaler, Booker, in a \u00a33.7bn deal. Back to Tesco\u2019s deal to buy Booker... Tesco\u2019s chief executive Dave Lewis had this to say (he\u2019s calling it a merger): Tesco has made significant progress in turning around our UK retail business. This merger with Booker will further enhance Tesco\u2019s growth prospects by creating the UK\u2019s leading food business with combined expertise in retail, wholesale, supply chain and digital. Wherever food is prepared and eaten - \u2018in home\u2019 or \u2018out of home\u2019 - we will meet this opportunity with the widest choice and best service available. Booker says it is the UK\u2019s biggest food wholesaler, serving a total of 1.3m customers. Customers are varied, and include the prison service in England and Wales, Marks &amp; Spencer and most of the cinema chains in the UK. Here is our full story on the deal: Also coming up... Finance ministers of the European Union are gathering for the latest Ecofin meeting. We\u2019ll bring you any interesting snippets from the sidelines. And it\u2019s GDP day in the US! At 13.30 UK time we\u2019ll get fourth-quarter growth figures from the world\u2019s largest economy. They will be Obama\u2019s sign-off, as Michael Hewson from CMC markets explains: Today\u2019s first iteration of US Q4 GDP will be the final legacy of the Obama Presidency, and the economy that he has left for the new incumbent. How the US economy performs from here will largely be down to Donald Trump, even if Obama laid the foundations. Expectations are for a modest slowdown from the 3.5% growth seen in Q3 to 2.2%. A large part of this slowdown is likely to be as a result of lower exports, given that the high Q3 number was boosted by a large jump in soybean exports, due to a shortage in South America. This isn\u2019t likely to be repeated, while personal consumption is also expected to come in lower. Traders at IG in the City are predicting markets will open lower across Europe: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some major corporate news this morning from two of the UK\u2019s biggest firms. BT has revealed that Corrado Sciolla, head of its continental Europe business, is leaving after an accounting scandal in the Italian business wiped almost \u00a38bn off the company\u2019s value on Tuesday. According to Reuters, BT put it plainly: Corrado is leaving the business, this happened on his watch. Announcing third quarter results this morning, BT\u2019s chief executive Gavin Patterson said: We\u2019ve undertaken extensive investigations into our Italian business, including an independent review by KPMG, and I am deeply disappointed with the unacceptable practices by some that we\u2019ve found. This has no place at BT, and it undermines the good work we\u2019re doing elsewhere in the Group. We are committed to ensuring the highest standards across the whole of BT. In other news, Tesco is buying the food wholesaler Booker in a \u00a33.7bn deal. Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain said that buying Booker, which owns Budgens and Londis, would help speed up the turnaround of Tesco (was hit by its own accounting scandal a couple of years ago). More on both stories soon.",

Most importantly, it seems that much of the increase in wages and job opportunities of the last six years has intensified already existing inequalities in the country.</p> <p>In terms of Mr Trump\u2019s economic policy programme, it is still unclear whether the administration will go ahead with the announced boost to infrastructure spending and additional tax cuts. If so we expect the Fed to raise interest rates in the second quarter of 2017 at the latest.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-588b5d2ae4b0f1550c0d9295\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-27T14:51:06.476Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE outperforms European peers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 is the only major European index making gains this afternoon, albeit small ones (up 8 points).

      "bodyText": "What is Booker? Booker is a grocery wholesaler supplying 125,000 independent convenience stores as well as 468,000 restaurants, pubs and leisure facilities such as cinemas. The group employs 13,000 people, had sales of \u00a35bn and made \u00a3155m in operating profit in the year to March 2016. It is the UK\u2019s largest cash-and-carry operator via its 172-store Booker chain and Makro, which has 30 outlets. Booker also controls the Premier, Londis, Family Shopper and Budgens symbol groups which make up about half of the retail clients it supplies. Premier is the largest branded group with 3,358 outlets, while Londis has 1,903, Budgens has 150 and Family Shopper 52. Booker doesn\u2019t own these stores \u2013 they are all independently run and owned \u2013 but it sells them a large proportion of their stock and assists with marketing, IT and a whole range of other services making for a close relationship. The group\u2019s Booker Direct service also delivers grocery supplies to most of the major cinema chains, including Odeon and Cineworld, the national prison service and provides the limited array of non-own label food sold in Marks &amp; Spencer. Booker also supplies 450,000 caterers including major chains such as Wagamama, Carluccios and Byron burgers and 700,000 small businesses. Booker opened its first store in Mumbai in 2009 and now has six wholesale outlets in India, where it also runs the Happy Shopper brand. Why does Tesco want to buy Booker? There are four main reasons: \u2022 Shoppers are moving away from big supermarkets and locating suitable new sites for its Tesco Express and One Stop chains has become more difficult. Tesco wants to extend its reach by supplying thousands of independent convenience stores. \u2022 Buying Booker would also take Tesco into catering supplies \u2013 a new fast-growing market as people increasingly opt to dine out or eat takeaways rather than cook at home. \u2022 If the deal goes through Tesco will have access to more than 5,000 corner shops where customers can pick up goods ordered online or access Tesco services such as banking and its mobile phone network. \u2022 The merger will give it more clout with suppliers and cut costs by merging distribution and other operations. Analysts estimate Booker will add about \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn to Tesco\u2019s current \u00a345bn of buying power. Meanwhile, Tesco estimates it will save \u00a3175m a year in costs, \u00a396m of which will come from improved procurement. Will the competition watchdog back the deal? Tesco already controls nearly 30% of the UK grocery market \u2013 nearly twice as big as its closest rival, Sainsbury\u2019s. It operates about 1,750 Tesco Express convenience stores and 780 One Stop outlets in the UK as well as more than 900 supermarkets. The merger would give Tesco access to 5,400 more convenience stores in Booker\u2019s brand groups and a further 2% share of the UK grocery market. Tesco already has a 17% share of the convenience store sector, according to Euromonitor, and the merger with Booker would take that up to 27%. The Co-op, its nearest rival, has a 15% market share. Tesco believes the merger will get the green light from competition authorities because it will not own the thousands of stores supplied by Booker. In theory, it would not be able to control prices in these stores as they are run and owned by independent operators. It may also be hoping that the regulator will look at the grocery market as a whole, rather than separating out the convenience sector. When Tesco bought T&amp;S Stores, the owner of the One Stop chain, in 2002, the deal was cleared because regulators judged the convenience store market to be separate from the supermarket business. But its view may have changed. However, the deal would add to Tesco\u2019s already massive power with food manufacturers, farmers and brands. What does it mean for shoppers? In theory, Tesco\u2019s better buying clout and more efficient operations should lead to lower prices for shoppers. However, in some areas Tesco could control the supply of groceries and alcohol, not only to its own local supermarket and Tesco Express but to dozens of local independent convenience stores, cinemas and cafes. Such widespread power could reduce competition and keep prices high.",

Tesco wants to extend its reach by supplying thousands of independent convenience stores. </p> <p>\u2022 Buying Booker would also take Tesco into catering supplies \u2013 a new fast-growing market as people increasingly opt to dine out or eat takeaways rather than cook at home.</p> <p>\u2022 If the deal goes through Tesco will have access to more than 5,000 corner shops where customers can pick up goods ordered online or access Tesco services such as banking and its mobile phone network.</p> <p>\u2022 The merger will give it more clout with suppliers and cut costs by merging distribution and other operations. Analysts estimate Booker will add about \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn to Tesco\u2019s current \u00a345bn of buying power.

It operates about 1,750 Tesco Express convenience stores and 780 One Stop outlets in the UK as well as more than 900 supermarkets.</p> <p>The merger would give Tesco access to 5,400 more convenience stores in Booker\u2019s brand groups and a further 2% share of the UK grocery market.</p> <p>Tesco already has a 17% share of the convenience store sector, according to Euromonitor, and the merger with Booker would take that up to 27%. The Co-op, its nearest rival, has a 15% market share.</p> <p>Tesco believes the merger will get the green light from competition authorities because it will not own the thousands of stores supplied by Booker. In theory, it would not be able to control prices in these stores as they are run and owned by independent operators. </p> <p>It may also be hoping that the regulator will look at the grocery market as a whole, rather than separating out the convenience sector. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/oct/30/tesco\">When Tesco bought T&amp;S Stores, the owner of the One Stop chain, in 2002</a>, the deal was cleared because regulators judged the convenience store market to be separate from the supermarket business. But its view may have changed.</p> <p>However, the deal would add to Tesco\u2019s already massive power with food manufacturers, farmers and brands.</p> <h2><strong>What does it mean for shoppers?</strong></h2> <p>In theory, Tesco\u2019s better buying clout and more efficient operations should lead to lower prices for shoppers.</p> <p>However, in some areas Tesco could control the supply of groceries and alcohol, not only to its own local supermarket and Tesco Express but to dozens of local independent convenience stores, cinemas and cafes. Such widespread power could reduce competition and keep prices high. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Platinum miner Lonmin has come under attack over its record on conditions for its workers, nearly five years after dozens of people were killed in violence at its Marikana mine in South Africa. Speaking as protesters displayed placards bearing the names of the dead, the chief executive, Ben Magara, told shareholders at the group\u2019s annual meeting that progress on building homes for 33,000 staff had been \u201cslower than we would have liked\u201d. But he said rock-bottom platinum prices made it impossible for the company to resolve the housing issue and stay financially sound. Thirty-four people were killed near the Marikana mine in August 2012, after workers went on strike, demanding a living wage from Lonmin in a complex dispute that escalated into violence. The former bishop of Pretoria Johannes Seoka, who was on the phone to one of the victims when the police opened fire, said the company should take more responsibility. \u201cWe\u2019re convinced that what happened is the result of their own reaction to demands of the workers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they had talked with the workers that massacre would not have happened.\u201d Seoka and Amnesty International called for the company to move faster on building homes for miners, many of whom live in informal communities with no electricity or running water. Lonmin reached a deal with workers last year for the basic monthly pay of 4,000 rock drill operators to rise by 2018 to nearly 12,500 South African rand (\u00a3744), the amount they were demanding in the days leading up to the 2012 massacre. But one shareholder said she believed miners\u2019 wage demands were \u201cunreasonable\u201d, comparing the sum to her own pension and disability allowance. \u201cThe bulk of my pension goes on utilities,\u201d she said. \u201cThey [mine workers] say they don\u2019t have electricity, gas or running water so I don\u2019t understand what they want to spend it on.\u201d Lonmin said it had taken steps to help the families of the Marikana massacre victims, including offering them jobs, paying for their children\u2019s education and agreeing to improve housing and wages.",

      "bodyText": "BT\u2019s chief executive has sought to reassure investors that an accounting scandal in Italy which wiped \u00a38bn off the company\u2019s market value is under control, but refused to discuss whether he should pay back some of the bonuses he received during the period of mismanagement. Announcing a 37% slump in third-quarter profits, Gavin Patterson said shareholders had a right to be angry at the scandal but maintained that the rest of the business, which accounted for 90% of profits, was doing well. \u201cFrankly, I am angry that the integrity of BT has been undermined by the wrongdoing of a few individuals in one part of the business,\u201d he said. \u201cMany shareholders are angry. They have a right to be. What happened in Italy was completely unacceptable. The situation is now under control.\u201d The company also confirmed that its European head, Corrado Sciolla, was to leave in the wake of the scandal. \u201cCorrado is leaving the business, this happened on his watch,\u201d the company said. On Tuesday, the company revealed the mismanagement in Italy was worse than it had originally thought when it told investors about the scandal in October, and said it would now cost \u00a3530m rather than \u00a3145m. Patterson would not be drawn on whether he felt he should take some accountability by giving back any bonus payments. BT\u2019s remuneration committee has launched an investigation into whether leading executives, including Patterson, should have any bonus payments clawed back for missing targets after the company delivered profit warnings for the next two years. \u201cThat is a matter for the remuneration committee,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are doing today is focusing on fixing the issues in Italy. Ninety percent of the business is doing well. We are focused on managing the business and [the] remuneration [question] is not for today. We will cross that bridge when we get to it.\u201d Patterson earned \u00a35.3m last year, including an annual bonus of just over \u00a31m and share awards worth \u00a33m. BT is facing at least two shareholder lawsuits in the US, accusing the company and its senior executives of securities fraud. On Thursday, the ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded its outlook for BT to \u201cnegative\u201d to \u201creflect the company\u2019s weaker operating performance over the medium term\u201d. Patterson said on Friday: \u201cIt is fair to say the last few days have been difficult. We are providing assistance to the authorities. BT remains in good health. We remain confident in our strategy. We need to keep this in perspective.\u201d The mismanagement in Italy, where BT has operated since the 1990s, emerged over the summer when the company was approached by a whistleblower. BT\u2019s audit committee and the external auditors PwC did not pick up the improper accounting practices, but Patterson said he was not going to bring PwC\u2019s contract to a premature end. \u201cIt is far too early to be making a decision about their future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is fair to say that in a couple of years we need to go through a [review] process but we will deal with that at the time.\u201d BT brought in KPMG to perform forensic accounting duties in its investigation which revealed the full cost of the scandal. \u201cIt can be very challenging to find out unless you\u2019ve got forensic accountants and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in the last quarter,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cWe\u2019ve really got underneath this issue, we\u2019ve scaled it, we\u2019ve sized it and now we\u2019ve acted.\u201d Patterson also refused to explicitly rule out a sale if the Italian business cannot be successfully restructured, but said he believed BT could turn the operation around. \u201cWe will need to go and look at cost base in some detail but we are confident we can get it to a profitable position,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t we will look at all options for the business going forward [including a sale]. At this stage I am confident we can get it to a profitable position.\u201d The third-quarter results showed a 37% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a3526m, with the fallout of the scandal and a slowdown in UK public sector work and international corporate business overshadowing better results elsewhere. The figures included record revenue growth for EE, the mobile company it acquired for \u00a312.5bn in 2015, adding 276,000 pay-monthly customers. BT\u2019s consumer division also did well, increasing its broadband and TV revenues by 8%. BT Openreach had a record number of new customers, with 498,000 homes and businesses signing up for faster broadband speeds in the quarter. \u201cThere are certainly some positives to take from today\u2019s result,\u201d said Sam McHugh, an analyst at Exane. \u201cHowever, presumably this is all factored into BT\u2019s new guidance, so it is not clear that these results will translate into earnings upgrades, and with the accounting scandal hanging over them and reputation a little damaged, it will take some time for investors to regain some trust in BT.\u201d Andrea Giovanni Bono, the head of BT\u2019s businesses in Switzerland, the Nordics, central and eastern Europe and Russia, will take responsibility for running the Italian business from 1 February.",

BT Openreach had a record number of new customers, with 498,000 homes and businesses signing up for faster broadband speeds in the quarter.</p> <p>\u201cThere are certainly some positives to take from today\u2019s result,\u201d said Sam McHugh, an analyst at Exane. \u201cHowever, presumably this is all factored into BT\u2019s new guidance, so it is not clear that these results will translate into earnings upgrades, and with the accounting scandal hanging over them and reputation a little damaged, it will take some time for investors to regain some trust in BT.\u201d</p> <p>Andrea Giovanni Bono, the head of BT\u2019s businesses in Switzerland, the Nordics, central and eastern Europe and Russia, will take responsibility for running the Italian business from 1 February. </p>",

      "bodyText": "More than one in seven free-to-use cash machines across the UK could start charging or be shut down if the simmering row about the Link network cannot be resolved, an industry lobby group has warned. After a crucial meeting of the more than 30 members of the Link cash machine network failed to reach an agreement over a new charging system, the ATM Industry Association said 8,000 ATMs were at risk of being removed or starting to charge for withdrawals. According to ATMIA, the cities most at risk of losing free cashpoints are London, Belfast, Glasgow, Birmingham, Sheffield and Cardiff. Other areas that could be hit hard include Devon, Hampshire, west Wales, Northern Ireland, Northumberland and Aberdeenshire. Under the current system, 97% of withdrawals from cash machines do not incur a charge. Of the 70,000 cash machines across the UK, 16,000 charge for withdrawals and 54,000 are currently free to use. Of the free machines, some 23,600 are provided by independent suppliers. According to the ATMIA\u2019s estimates, around \u00a314.7bn of the cash withdrawn each year would be affected by the 8,000 ATMs either closing or having charges imposed. It is not clear how much customers face being charged \u2013 the average fee paid by customers at machines that currently levy a fee is \u00a31.70, with the average amount withdrawn is \u00a369 Link is grappling with concerns among some members about the price they charge each other to allow their customers to withdraw cash. There are calls for this interchange fee to be reduced \u2013 although at Thursday\u2019s meeting no decision was taken The ATMIA\u2019s calculations are based on the impact of a cut to the interchange fee, which is calculated by dividing the cost of running the free-to-use network by the number of transactions. \u201cIndependent cash machines play a vital role in allowing all of us convenient access to cash,\u201d said Ron Delnevo, executive director for Europe of the ATMIA. \u201cWith the question remaining over whether some banks will be willing to pay the true cost of providing ATMs, we still risk thousands of these cash points disappearing from the most vulnerable communities. \u201cMany of my independent members are now calling on the regulator and government to be part of the review process, and to ringfence existing ATM interchange to make sure the current free to use estate is not undermined,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is key to securing the free access to cash that has so well served the public.\u201d Link did not comment directly on the ATMIA calculations but said a working group would be set up to find a solution. \u201cWhile commercial perspectives may vary, every Link member was clear at the meeting that ensuring the future of the Link Network and the cash access needs of UK consumers remains their number one priority,\u201d said John Howells, chief executive of Link. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, warned the banks, building societies and independent providers that it was ready to investigate. \u201cWidespread charging would be of considerable concern, particularly in rural areas and poorer urban neighbourhoods,\u201d he said. \u201cLink now have an opportunity to sort it out. If they don\u2019t, the Treasury committee will almost certainly need to investigate.\u201d",
