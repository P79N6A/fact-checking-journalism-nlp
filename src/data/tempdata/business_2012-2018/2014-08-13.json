      "bodyText": "Supermarkets are grappling with their first significant fall in sales volumes since the second world war, according to analysts who warned shoppers' efforts to save money are having an \"unprecedented effect\" on the UK's major supermarkets. The volume of items sold in Britain's supermarkets fell back by 3.2% in the first half of 2014 according to analysts at IRI, which it said showed that price cuts by supermarkets trying to combat competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl were not the only cause for a dramatic fall in sales. \"Consumers are struggling to keep within their budgets as wages rise slower than price inflation and child benefit cuts kick in,\" said Tim Eales, strategic director of insight at IRI. \"They are cutting back on how much they buy from the major supermarkets, some moving instead to the discount shops, buying lower priced alternatives or simply making do with less. This is having an unprecedented effect on sales from the UK's major supermarkets.\" He said that even though retailers have cut the price of hundreds of products, the average price of a shopping basket had fallen just 0.5% in the past two months, the equivalent of just 54p a week for the average family spending \u00a3500 a month on groceries. However, Eales estimates that shoppers switching to lower-cost options such as own-label or less premium brands cost the grocery industry more than \u00a3800m in 2013 and was likely to cost considerably more this year. \"It is going to be increasingly difficult for supermarkets to find paths to growth during the next few years unless they think differently,\" Eales said. The analysts' figures come after the latest survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) on Tuesday showed the value of underlying food sales fell by 3.5% in the quarter to the end of July, the deepest three-month average decline since the retail trade body began keeping records in December 2008. In contrast, non-food sales rose by an average 3.4% according to the BRC. The trade body blamed price cuts for the food industry flop, but IRI's figures indicate a change in shopper behaviour is also to blame. Hot drinks and foods sold in tins and packets have seen the biggest dive in sales, with the volume down 5% in the first half of this year, while frozen foods and chilled foods have also suffered - down 4% and 3.6% respectively. However sales of beer, lager and cider remain on the up, with sales rising 6.8% in volume as Brits enjoyed the World Cup with a tipple on the sofa. Non-alcoholic cold drinks also got a boost from the warm weather with sales up 0.6% on last year.",

      "bodyText": "The London housing market stumbled in July as sales dropped and inquiries fell at their fastest rate since the onset of the credit crisis, in a further sign that the UK property market is cooling. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said \"London indicators are going into reverse\" as it reported the most rapid decline in inquiries from buyers in the capital since April 2008, while the number of agreed sales fell to 16 per surveyor from 19 in June. Across the UK, a fall in the number of would-be homebuyers is set to lead to a reduction in house price growth over the coming months, the professional body for surveyors and estate agents said, as supply begins to outweigh demand. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, said: \"A range of policy initiatives adopted by the Bank of England in recent months \u2013 alongside heightened expectations surrounding a turn in the interest rate cycle \u2013 has clearly had an impact on sentiment in the market. \"The shift in the mood music among potential buyers in the London market has been particularly pronounced but that is in a sense consistent with the move to a more sustainable market in the capital.\" Separate figures from chartered surveying group e.surv, which undertakes valuations for more than 20 mortgage lenders, also showed a fall in buyer activity during the month. The cooling demand will be welcomed by policymakers, who have tried to take the heat out of the market with proposals for curbs on mortgage lending, set to come into force in October. Rics said its members now expected property values to increase at a faster rate outside London over the next year than within the capital. House prices had been powering ahead in London, with some areas recording increases of more than 20% over the past year as buyers chased the small number of homes on the market, but in recent weeks there have been signs of a shift. On Tuesday, estate agent Haart said the supply of properties in London had risen by 32.3% over the year but demand from buyers fell by 15.7%. Generally, Rics said there was evidence that surveyors were \"paring back their longer term bullishness\". Across the UK as a whole, they predicted 4.7% growth in house prices in the next year, down from 5.9% in March, while in London the forecast has dropped from 9.3% to 4.6%. The fall in buyer inquiries across the UK takes the level back down to that last seen in January 2013, before the government launched its Help to Buy scheme for homeowners with small deposits, and before better mortgage availability and improved confidence in the economy started to fuel the market. Despite the slowdown in interest from buyers, across the UK the number of sales agreed by each surveyor remained higher than at the start of this year at 24.6 over the month. In July 2013, the figure was 17.6. Rics said it was unclear if the change was a \"pause for breath\" or a genuine turning point. The implementation of new rules on borrowing, introduced in April in the mortgage market review (MMR) did coincide with a fall in mortgage approvals, and Rics said this could be a factor in the fall in inquiries. Also, affordability has become stretched as prices have risen at a rate far higher than wages and the Bank has signalled it will step in to curb risky mortgages, proposing a cap on loan-to-income ratios from October. Peter Rollings, CEO of London estate agency Marsh &amp; Parsons, said the \"unbelievable pace\" of the housing market at the start of 2014 could not have been maintained. \"The process of buying and selling property in the capital is noticeably less fraught and off-putting than it was a couple of months ago,\" he said. \"Currently, the key component stabilising the London market is an increasing supply of property, which has surged 52% since the beginning of the year. \"This natural return to more normal trading conditions, where buyers can enjoy greater availability and sellers are inspired to sell now that they have more choice for their onward purchase, is a step in the right direction and will ensure long-term energy and activity in the market.\" The e.surv research, which is based on mortgages approved during the month, showed that 66,279 home loans were granted, a 1.4% fall on June's figure and the strongest July total since 2007, when there were 112,291. The number of loans taken by buyers with a deposit of 15% or less was up by more than half year-on-year, at 11,533 and accounted for 18% of approvals. In London, the proportion borrowing at that level was just 8%, due to the monthly cost of servicing a large mortgage.",

      "bodyText": "Chocolate makers already choking on the rising price of cocoa face another price crunch in commodity markets after warnings of a global shortage of hazelnuts. The price of hazelnuts has increased by more than 60% this year to a 10-year high after bad weather devastated crops in Turkey, the world's biggest producer. One Scottish manufacturer that sells bags of mixed nuts has already decided to take hazelnuts out of the pack, according to an industry source. About 70% of the world's hazelnuts are grown on steep slopes near Turkey's Black Sea coast, but this year's harvest is likely to be sharply down after hail storms and frost in late March destroyed hazel flowers at a critical moment in the growing season. The price of the nuts has reached $10,500 (\u00a36,300) per tonne, compared with $6,500 (\u00a33,900) per tonne in February, according to Michael Stevens, a trader at Edinburgh-based Freeworld Trading. The full extent of the damage is not yet clear, but the Turkish industry is braced for a harvest that could be down to 540,000 tonnes, against pre-frost expectations of up to 800,000 tonnes. It comes as food companies also face rocketing prices for almonds, cocoa and coffee \u2013 a potential nightmare for those who enjoy a Ferrero Rocher with their after-dinner coffee. The hazelnut price rise will be particularly tough for buyers at some of the world's biggest confectionery companies, such as Cadbury, whose Whole Nut bar \u2013 made with hazelnuts \u2013 is one of its bestsellers. A spokesman for the American conglomerate Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, declined to comment on whether it would increase the price of its chocolate bars. Mondelez is the name of the snack company spun off by America's Kraft, which completed a controversial takeover of the British chocolate maker in 2010. Ferrero, the Piedmont-based company that makes Ferrero Rocher and Nutella, the cocoa and hazelnut spread, will also be watching the market closely. Ferrero is the world's biggest buyer of hazelnuts, using 25% of the world's supply and making 180m kg of the spread every year, according to the Italian Trade Agency. But the company could be insulated from the latest price moves following its recent purchase of Turkey's largest hazelnut processor, Oltan. The deal to purchase Oltan, which has eight factories shelling, chopping and roasting nuts, is reported to have unsettled other confectioners, which are uncomfortable that one of their suppliers has fallen into the hands of a rival. Meanwhile, almond prices are at a nine-year high, because of drought in California, the world's biggest grower, while a prolonged dry spell in Brazil in January and February reduced the coffee harvest, pushing up prices. Not all the current price moves in food commodities are due to unseasonal weather. The price of cocoa has been driven to a three-year high with consumers in China and India getting a taste for chocolate. The hazelnut price surge has left market players reeling. \"Buyers are living hand to mouth,\" said Stevens. \"Some people had contracts already [pre-dating the frost] and they are not going to get them. A lot of people are still uncovered in the market and people that thought they were covered are now in the market again.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government has pulled out of plans to sell shares in Lloyds Banking Group to the public before next year's general election. George Osborne, the chancellor, had said he wanted the public to be able to be able to buy shares in Lloyds. But the Treasury, which still owns 25% of Lloyds following its \u00a320bn bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, has ruled out a public share sale anytime soon due to stock market volatility. While the public will have to wait until at least summer 2015 for the chance to buy shares in Lloyds, the Treasury is likely to continue selling chunks of the bank to institutional investors. Sources in the Treasury said selling shares to the public now would be too risky given market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty. There are also concerned about the 6% drop in Lloyds share price since June. The government is keen to ensure it achieves a good price for the taxpayer following accusations that it sold Royal Mail on the cheap - losing taxpayers \u00a3750m in a single day. A spokesman for the Treasury said: \"The chancellor set out the government's approach to the state-owned banks in his Mansion House speech last year: we want to maximise support for the British economy, get the best value for money for the taxpayer and return the state-owned banks to private ownership. Any decisions on share sales will be determined by value for money and market conditions.\" There are only very brief windows of opportunity to launch the public offer before the election. The sale process could not start before the Scottish independence referendum next month, and would not be permitted in the run up to Lloyds' annual result in February or the Budget in March. By that time it would be just three months until the general election. Other headaches include uncertainty of Lloyds' hopes to restart dividend payments after six years and the results of Bank of England stress tests. The government has already sold two chunks of Lloyds shares to institutions \u2013 making about \u00a37bn and reducing the taxpayer's stake to 24.9%. Keith Bowman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The timing would be tight for a public offering. But an institutional sale would be a smoother process, with previous sales passing off with few problems.\" A public sale of all the remaining government-owned shares, worth \u00a313bn at Wednesday's closing price of 73.7p, would be the biggest privatisation in decades. The flotation of 60% of Royal Mail last October made the government \u00a32bn. If the shares are sold at yesterday's price the government will just about break even on its investment - having bought up \u00a320bn of Lloyds shares at an average price of 73.6p in 2008 to keep the bank afloat during the crisis. Last month, Lloyds reported a 33% fall in first-half profits to \u00a3863m as its bill for the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal increased by \u00a3600m and it paid out penalties for rigging interest rates. Lloyds declined to comment on the government's delayed share sale plans, which were first reported by Sky News.",

There are also concerned about the 6% drop in Lloyds share price since June.</p> <p>The government is keen to ensure it achieves a good price for the taxpayer following accusations that it sold Royal Mail on the cheap - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/01/royal-mail-undervaluing-taxpayer-cable\" title=\"\">losing taxpayers \u00a3750m in a single day</a>.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Treasury said: \"The chancellor set out the government's approach to the state-owned banks in his Mansion House speech last year: we want to maximise support for the British economy, get the best value for money for the taxpayer and return the state-owned banks to private ownership. Any decisions on share sales will be determined by value for money and market conditions.\"</p> <p>There are only very brief windows of opportunity to launch the public offer before the election. The sale process could not start before the Scottish independence referendum next month, and would not be permitted in the run up to Lloyds' annual result in February or the Budget in March. By that time it would be just three months until the general election.</p> <p>Other headaches include uncertainty of Lloyds' hopes to restart dividend payments after six years and the results of Bank of England stress tests.</p> <p>The government has already sold two chunks of Lloyds shares to institutions \u2013 making about \u00a37bn and reducing the taxpayer's stake to 24.9%.</p> <p>Keith Bowman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The timing would be tight for a public offering. But an institutional sale would be a smoother process, with previous sales passing off with few problems.\"</p> <p>A public sale of all the remaining government-owned shares, worth \u00a313bn at Wednesday's closing price of 73.7p, would be the biggest privatisation in decades. The flotation of 60% of Royal Mail last October made the government \u00a32bn.</p> <p>If the shares are sold at yesterday's price the government will just about break even on its investment - having bought up \u00a320bn of Lloyds shares at an average price of 73.6p in 2008 to keep the bank afloat during the crisis.</p> <p>Last month, Lloyds reported a 33% fall in first-half profits to \u00a3863m as its bill for the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal increased by \u00a3600m and it paid out penalties for rigging interest rates.</p> <p>Lloyds declined to comment on the government's delayed share sale plans, which were first reported by Sky News.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Shock fall in UK wages is first since 2009", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's economic recovery is not feeding through to workers' pockets according to official figures showing that wages fell for the first time since the 2009 recession, despite a fall in the jobless rate to its lowest point since 2008. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the April to June quarter showed that wages, including bonuses, fell by 0.2%. Excluding bonuses, wages rose by 0.6% \u2013 the slowest growth rate since 2001, when records began. Meanwhile, the Bank of England indicated that the squeeze on households will last until the year end as it halved its wage growth estimate for 2014 to 1.25%, below an inflation rate running at 1.9%. Recent pay surveys have also shown pay stagnating at below inflation levels. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said last week that pay was likely to stay below inflation for several months and unlikely to jump above inflation until next year. John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said the employment figures reflected the UK's booming economy but that workers were suffering \"paymageddon\" as wages went into reverse. \"Good news for the jobless is being offset by ever slimmer pickings for those already in work, giving the UK labour market a distinctly bittersweet flavour,\" he said. \"This doesn't look like a labour market that needs an interest rate hike to cool it down but instead one where workers appear desperate for a pay hike.\" The ONS said the drop in wages follows a spike last year, when some employers who usually pay bonuses in March shifted them to April. The implication is that the comparison with the April to July period last year is a statistical blip that should drop out of the wages figures next month when April is no longer included. James Knightley, UK economist at ING Financial Markets, said the bad news on wages might be shortlived if the minimum wage rise scheduled for October has a ripple effect across the economy. \"It is important to remember that the national minimum wage goes up by 3% in October and this could be the catalyst for broader wage increases in the UK economy.\" The number of people in work rose 167,000 on the previous three months to 30.6 million, with 132,000 fewer people out of work, at 2.08 million people. The jobless total is the lowest since the end of 2009, giving an unemployment rate of 6.4%, compared with 6.5% last month. There were also 8.86 million economically inactive people \u2013 those without jobs but not seeking or available to work \u2013 aged 16-64. This was 15,000 more than in January to March 2014 but 130,000 fewer than a year earlier. The general secretary of the TUC, Frances O'Grady, said the figures suggested the economy is \"very good at creating low-paid jobs, but struggling to create the better-paid work we need for a fair and sustainable recovery\". She said: \"Self-employment has been responsible for almost half of the rise in employment over the last year. The fact that self-employed workers generally earn less than employees means our pay crisis is even deeper than previously thought, as their pay is not recorded in official figures.\" In the last year, the number of employees rose by 447,000 to reach 25.77 million while the number of self-employed people climbed by 408,000 to reach 4.59 million. Another factor depressing wages could be the introduction of the government's Nest pension scheme, which covers the 10 million workers not already covered by workplace retirement savings. Employers already part of the scheme must pay at least 1% of salary into workers' Nest pensions, which they may deduct from planned pay rises. The secretary of state for work and pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, who has attempted to take some of the credit for falling levels of unemployment following the introduction of stricter eligibility tests on benefit claimants, said the government is targeting full employment. \"The best way to help even more people into work is to go on delivering a plan that's creating growth and jobs,\" he said. Chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: \"There is still a long way to go, but this is solid progress and the significant fall in youth employment is particularly encouraging and welcome.\" The unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds fell to 16.9%, down from 19.0% in the period January to March and 21.4% a year earlier, but higher than the pre-downturn trough of 13.8% in 2008. Stephen Timms, the shadow employment minister, said it was \"extremely worrying\" that the figures show pay falling far behind inflation. \"For Iain Duncan Smith to claim that people are better off in the face of these figures shows just how out-of-touch this Tory-led government is,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The prospect of an interest rate rise in 2014 appeared to diminish on Wednesday after the Bank of England admitted it is in the dark about the true state of the British economy. The August inflation report laid bare the dilemma over the timing of the first rise faced by the Bank's policymakers, who are struggling to reconcile rapidly falling unemployment and record employment with very weak wage growth. On the one hand, members of the Bank's rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) revised down their estimate of spare capacity in the economy to 1% of GDP from a May forecast of 1-1.5%, as employment growth rockets. Governor Mark Carney and his colleagues have made it clear that borrowing costs \u2013 on hold at 0.5% since March 2009 \u2013 will have to rise before spare capacity is fully used up. But on the other hand, wage growth has been much weaker than expected, prompting the MPC to halve its forecast for pay growth to 1.25% by the end of 2014. With inflation expected to remain just below the 2% target by the end of this year, it means real pay for the average British worker is expected to fall for the rest of 2014, prolonging the squeeze on household budgets. Carney signalled that pay growth will be crucial to the timing of the first rise amid conflicting signals. \"Pay growth has been remarkably weak, even as unemployment has fallen rapidly. \"In light of the heightened uncertainty about the current degree of slack, the committee will be placing particular importance on the prospective paths for wages and unit labour costs.\" Carney repeated the Bank's well-rehearsed line that when rates do start to rise, increases are likely to be \"gradual and limited\". However, in a warning shot that households accustomed to low borrowing costs should prepare for higher borrowing costs, he added: \"That's an expectation, not a promise.\" The pound fell to a four-month low against the dollar following Carney's comments and the weaker outlook for wages, as markets interpreted them as a signal that a 2014 rate is looking increasingly unlikely. Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets, said: \"The clear signal that we take from [the August] report is that the odds of a move before the end of 2014 have reduced further. We retain a forecast that the first 25 basis point hike will be in February 2015.\" In June, Carney was accused by Pat McFadden, Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee of behaving like an \"unreliable boyfriend\", giving too many mixed messages on the likely timing of the first rate rise. Following the publication of the August inflation report, Kathleen Brooks, research director at forex.com said he was behaving more like a \"fearful fiance\". \"He has popped the question and put the prospect of a rate hike out there, but is yet to commit to a date for the big day.\" The Bank nudged up its forecast for growth in 2014 to 3.5% from 3.4%. Similarly it raised its 2015 forecast to 3% growth from 2.9%. Carney said that although the economy is \"returning to a semblance of normality,\" risks remain \u2013 including heightened geopolitical tensions and weak recovery in the eurozone. He also stressed it was unclear how rising interest rates would affect the economy by weighing on domestic demand.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes for a recovery in the eurozone suffered another blow on Wednesday with figures showing industrial output fell for a second successive month. Production declined across the 18 eurozone members by an average 0.3%, with a return to growth in France and Italy offset by falls in Ireland and the Netherlands and slow progress in Germany, which struggled to 0.2% growth. Spain was the worst hit of the currency bloc's major economies with a 0.8% drop in industrial production. It also suffered the sharpest drop in shop prices for five years, undermining Madrid's claim that a rebound in employment last month was a clear indication of the country's return to sustained growth. Spanish consumers have proved reluctant to spend on the high street while unemployment remains at around 25%, forcing shops to offer bigger discounts in July than June. Weakness across the manufacturing, energy and mining sectors will pose a problem for Brussels and the European Central Bank (ECB), ahead of second-quarter GDP figures on Thursday that are expected to show a further slowdown from the 0.2% growth in the first three months of the year. The \u20ac9.6tn economy is struggling to gain momentum with its recovery a year after exiting recession. High unemployment, sluggish reforms and the fallout from conflict in Ukraine, Gaza and Iraq are holding it back. The latest sign of just how fragile the eurozone's economic rebound remains came this week, after German investor sentiment dropped to its lowest level since December 2012 on concerns that European sanctions against Russia will harm exports. Brussels and the ECB have pleaded for more time to allow policies to work. Brussels has emphasised the need for governments to bring annual spending deficits under control as a prerequisite for extra support, while the ECB has set a high bar for further measures to ease credit and support borrowing. Mario Draghi, the ECB president, said last week at the central bank's monthly press conference that inflation remained on target to be 2% or just below in the medium term. This was in spite of a slide further into what the central bank has previously described as a \"danger zone\" when prices in the single currency area rose by only 0.4% in the year to July, down from 0.5% in June. Critics of the ECB's stance have argued that low rates of inflation reflect the weakness of the economy and have called for a more coordinated intervention to boost investment and bolster consumer confidence. The ECB is under pressure to match the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England with the introduction of quantitative easing (QE), which involves huge buying of government bonds to drive down long-term interest rates, cutting the cost of borrowing. Draghi has said the ECB's ruling council is ready to launch its own version of QE, but will act only if it sees clearer signals the eurozone economy is heading back into recession. Adding to the pressure on Draghi, Spain's National Statistics Institute reported a drop in prices of 0.4% for July. In the previous month, Spain's economy, the fourth largest in the eurozone, had reported an annual inflation rate of zero. Prices were kept down by the lower cost of entertainment, electricity, tobacco, food and soft drinks, the official statistician said. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the ECB would wait to see whether limited measures put in place in June had an effect before adopting QE. \"The disappointing performance of the economy in the second quarter will do little to affect policy. Draghi has already largely dismissed the weakness to temporary factors, notably a higher than usual number of holidays having not been accurately reflected in the seasonal adjustment of data. \"It seems that the bar to further stimulus remains high. Not only does the ECB emphasise that prior stimulus should boost growth and inflation sufficiently, but Draghi continues to stress that national governments need to speed up structural reforms,\" he said. Peter Vanden Houte, a eurozone analyst at ING Financial Markets, said: \"With the geopolitical tensions not cooling down for the time being, there is little likelihood that the growth pace will accelerate in the second half of the year. The ECB will be pressured to undertake additional action if some of the downside risks materialise. \"However, as the ECB already all but emptied its toolbox in June, the next step would be full-blown QE, something still considered to be a bridge too far for the majority of the governing council members.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britons' appetite for new cars has continued unabated, helping drive a sharp rise in first-half sales and profits at one of the country's biggest car dealers. Lookers, which sells nearly 120,000 new and used vehicles a year, said pre-tax profits surged 38% to \u00a338m in the six months to June, with sales up 29% to \u00a31.6bn. It now expects to beat market forecasts with pre-tax profits of \u00a360m for the full year, thanks to record car sales. Chief executive Andy Bruce said: \"New car sales and the market in general are rising, having dropped below the normal level of sales during the recession. We've seen that pent-up demand.\" Up to four-in-five new car purchases are now being made on credit, meaning Lookers has also benefited from record low interest rates. New car sales have risen every month for more than two years, defying the slowdown that has hit other European markets. Analysts say Britons have been seduced by cheap finance and heavy discounting, but that the market looks set to cool off next year. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new car sales rose by 6.6% in July, prompting it to raise forecasts for the full year. It now expects new car registrations to rise by 8% this year to hit 2.45m. But analysts at IHS Automotive have warned that growth might sink to between 1% and 2% next year. Colin Couchman said: \"Our expectation is that things will start to cool off a bit.\" He forecast that pent-up demand left over from the recession should tail off over the next 12 months. He also expects carmakers to scale back their efforts to drive UK sales if the European economy picks up. \"As that recovers, the push from the carmakers in the UK will ebb away a bit.\" With consumer spending weak across Europe, car manufacturers have focused on the UK with knock-down prices, generous offers and cheap financing deals. Bruce disputes this view of the market, saying that Lookers sees a long-term trend of rising new car sales in the UK. \"There is a lot more growth left in the new car market because of this pent-up demand that has not yet been satisfied.\" He is not concerned about the prospect of rising interest rates, which could make finance packages to buy new cars more expensive. Instead, he points out that the expected rise in rates is driving the value of the pound higher, which makes the UK an attractive market for car manufacturers to export to.",

It now expects to beat market forecasts with pre-tax profits of \u00a360m for the full year, thanks to record car sales.</p> <p>Chief executive Andy Bruce said: \"New car sales and the market in general are rising, having dropped below the normal level of sales during the recession. We've seen that pent-up demand.\" Up to four-in-five new car purchases are now being made on credit, meaning Lookers has also benefited from record low interest rates.</p> <p>New car sales have risen every month for more than two years, defying the slowdown that has hit other European markets. Analysts say Britons have been seduced by cheap finance and heavy discounting, but that the market looks set to cool off next year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/06/uk-new-car-sales-rise-29th-month-forecast\" title=\"\">The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders</a> said new car sales rose by 6.6% in July, prompting it to raise forecasts for the full year. It now expects new car registrations to rise by 8% this year to hit 2.45m. But analysts at IHS Automotive have warned that growth might sink to between 1% and 2% next year. Colin Couchman said: \"Our expectation is that things will start to cool off a bit.\"</p> <p>He forecast that pent-up demand left over from the recession should tail off over the next 12 months. He also expects carmakers to scale back their efforts to drive UK sales if the European economy picks up. \"As that recovers, the push from the carmakers in the UK will ebb away a bit.\" With consumer spending weak across Europe, car manufacturers have focused on the UK with knock-down prices, generous offers and cheap financing deals.</p> <p>Bruce disputes this view of the market, saying that Lookers sees a long-term trend of rising new car sales in the UK. \"There is a lot more growth left in the new car market because of this pent-up demand that has not yet been satisfied.\"</p> <p>He is not concerned about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/13/bank-england-edges-closer-interest-rate-rise\" title=\"\">the prospect of rising interest rates</a>, which could make finance packages to buy new cars more expensive. Instead, he points out that the expected rise in rates is driving the value of the pound higher, which makes the UK an attractive market for car manufacturers to export to.</p>",

      "bodyText": "London's escalating love affair with giddying views will reach a new height this autumn. Starting in November, up to 6,000 City workers will move their swivel chairs and espresso machines into the highest offices in Britain, in the Leadenhall building. The Guardian was granted access to the 225m skyscraper \u2013 known as the Cheesegrater \u2013 ahead of completion. We saw how workers will be whisked skywards at a stomach-dropping 18mph in fully glazed lifts. Desks will look down on the Gherkin, the roof deck of the NatWest tower and, across the Thames, to the viewing decks of the Shard, the only taller building in the UK. No one in the City will enjoy a loftier view, apart from the falcons that have been provided with a nest box on the roof. But this is more than just another notch on London's priapic skyline \u2013 soon to see the addition of \"the scalpel\" and \"the helter skelter\" tower, which will overshadow the Cheesegrater as the tallest building in the Square Mile. The Cheesegrater, at 122 Leadenhall Street, is directly across the road from the Lloyd's building, the Grade I-listed tangle of ducts and pipes, recognised by some as a masterpiece of the hi-tech movement after it opened in 1986 and derided by others as looking like a misplaced oil refinery. Both buildings were designed by Richard Rogers and bookend 30 years of one of the country's most celebrated star architects and British architecture itself. The buildings beg a question: is anything left of the radical vision of Lloyd's, or has British architecture become afraid to offend? Graham Stirk is well placed to answer. This softly spoken architect was raised in Leeds, and began his career in 1983, aged 25, as a junior in Rogers' practice, designing brackets to hold those famous ducts and vents. Now, one of Rogers' senior partners, Stirk has overseen the design of Leadenhall. \"I knew we would be compared,\" he said. \"It is a terrifying prospect\". The two buildings opened in starkly different circumstances. Lloyds opened three weeks after the big bang deregulation of financial markets which unleashed a confident City boom that fuelled the 1980s' \"loadsamoney\" culture. Leadenhall will open in the cautious atmosphere of a fragile financial recovery. Both buildings were shaped in part by wars that date them. The famous external staircases of the Lloyd's building were redesigned in steel after the sinking of the Sir Galahad supply ship in the Falklands war was partly blamed on the flammability of its aluminium superstructure, while glazed staircases on Leadenhall were scrapped after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. But, said Stirk, the buildings had \"their DNA and an evolutionary path\" in common. \"They share a really tough structural language,\" he said. \"If anything, Leadenhall is tougher. Lloyd's has nice rounded concrete columns, this has big manufactured I-sections. It is almost bridge engineering. It has a much more dominant impact on London's skyline than Lloyd's.\" The sheer heft of Leadenhall's 15,000-tonne steel frame as it crashes into the ground at its base is undeniably impressive, yet the simple triangular glass-skinned silhouette is far more polite than the riot of the Lloyd's exterior. One key reason for the difference, Stirk explains, is that the latter was designed for a client while Leadenhall was designed for British Land, a speculative developer. Hence its sleeker, less aesthetically challenging profile. \"When I look at Lloyd's, it is amazingly dense,\" said Stirk. \"It is almost a medieval cathedral in terms of its surface complexity. When I look at Leadenhall, it is something that has to have sufficient neutrality [to work as a speculative office building].\" The services and lifts are all encased in a glazed \"cassette\" on one side of the building rather than being exposed, which Stirk describes as a \"jellyfish\" effect. The inside-out design of Lloyds has recently been cited as a concern to its main occupiers who are considering moving out. Last year, Richard Ward, then chief executive of Lloyd's of London, said: \"There is a fundamental problem with this building. Everything is exposed to the elements, and that makes it very costly [to maintain].\" The building's exposed innards caused widespread palpitations when it was built in the 1980s and Stirk recalled \"a very, very mixed reaction\". \"We had very little work after this,\" he said. \"Everyone says it must have been amazing, but no. Some of those reactions were, 'We like Lloyd's but we don't want one of those.' It had a particular exuberance. It was not fully understood what problems this building was solving.\" He said there was a view that the architects had \"imposed something\", but that ignored the way \"it was the product of an evolutionary process over eight years\". Since Lloyd's, Stirk thinks there has been an increase in the \"homogeneity\" of architecture. Marco Goldschmied, Rogers' former partner who was instrumental in the creation of Lloyd's, said that was partly down to the suppression of architects' \"experimental energy\" by the planning process. \"Lloyd's sparked the rise of the monsters that are the National Trust and English Heritage and the use of questions in the planning process such as does a proposal 'cause harm' which implies a fear of non-conformity,\" he said. \"There was a subtle closing of the ranks against this kind of architecture.\" As a result, he said, an \"international corporate style\" had emerged as developers tried to reduce the risk of schemes being rejected by planners, which could cost international investors fortunes. \"Offices are the most difficult buildings to design as an architect,\" Stirk said. \"It is not like an art gallery or airport. These buildings come automatically with a primary message. Office buildings are kind of anonymous and are the most unloved building type on earth.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 14 August 2014.

      "bodyText": "And finally.... there are signs today that Greece\u2019s six-year economic slump could soon be over. GDP data released this morning showed that the Greek economy shrank at an annual pace of just 0.2% in the second quarter. That\u2019s the slowest contraction since the financial crisis began, and much slower than the first quarter of 2014, when GDP declined by 1.1%. More details here. And that\u2019s all for today. I\u2019ll be back early tomorrow morning, when the big news should be the first estimate of growth across the eurozone. Goodbye, and thanks for reading. GW. Wall Street has joined the gentle recovery across the stock markets today, with the Dow Jones index gaining 50 points, or 0.35%, in early trading. The main European markets are all showing gains, led by Germany\u2019s Dax. And in Moscow, the MICEX is up almost 2%. Geopolitical worries, and the news that Japan\u2019s GDP tumbled by 1.7% last quarter, are not pulling down shares. Our own Larry Elliott is back from the Bank of England (where he suggested Carney and colleagues are looking rather clueless), and provided some spot-on analysis of the inflation report. He writes..... The message from the Bank of England was clear. As clear as mud, that is. The economy is a mystery to the best brains of Threadneedle Street, scratching their heads at figures showing unemployment and earnings growth are both heading south at a rapid pace. This really shouldn\u2019t be happening as far as the Bank is concerned, which is why its quarterly inflation report was riddled with uncertainty. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is at odds about how much spare capacity remains after the Great Recession. Policymakers are unsure what is happening to the housing market. Some of them think wage growth is about to pick up; some of them don\u2019t. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, bridled at suggestions that the MPC doesn\u2019t really have a clue about what\u2019s going on and that therefore any guidance the Bank gave about the future path of interest rates should be taken with a bucket load of salt. Increases in bank rate, when they come, were likely to be \u201cgradual and limited\u201d. Short of breaking into Stevie Wonder\u2019s Don\u2019t You Worry \u2018Bout a Thing, Carney could not have been more emollient or reassuring. \u201cEven if spare capacity were to be eliminated at a stroke overnight, the appropriate level of Bank Rate would not be far from where it is today\u201d, he said.... More here: Bank of England inflation report: pay puzzle gives Carney some wriggle room Over in America, a disappointing set of retail sales figures have just raises concerns over the strength of its recovery. Retail sales were flat in July, the worst performance in six months, having only risen by 0.2% in June. Car sales fell, and demand for electronics and home appliances was weak -- not a great sign of consumer confidence. Core retail sales, which strips out cars, gasoline, food services and building materials, rose by just 0.1% in July, and June\u2019s figure was revised down from 0.6% to 0.5%. Ahha! On page 29 of the BoE\u2019s Inflation report is a bar chart, showing how most new jobs created in the last six months have been in \u2018low skill\u2019 professions. This may help explain the low growth in average earnings in recent months, if more new hirers are taking lower paid positions. Hat-tip to Jeremy Warner of the Telegraph for flagging it up: Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has seized on the news that the Bank of England has slashed its forecast for wage growth this year, to just 1.25%. He says: \u201cThe inflation report shows why this is no time for complacent and out-of-touch claims from Ministers that the economy is fixed and people are better off. \u201cWhile the economy is finally growing again and unemployment is falling, working people are still seeing their living standards squeezed. Pay growth is at a record low and lagging behind inflation and the Bank of England has halved its forecasts for wage growth this year.\u201d As covered earlier this morning, the latest unemployment data showed earnings growth faltering, Total wages (including bonuses) have shrunk for the first time since 2009. And stripping out bonuses, average earnings rose by the lowest since records began in 2001, up just 0.6%. Michael Izza, chief executive of ICAEW (which represents accountants) says the Bank of England\u2019s new, lower wage growth forecasts are a concern: The numbers of self-employed and part-time workers, together with those on zero-hours contracts are contributing to a flexible labour market that is keeping wages down. In addition, auto-enrolment means that employers are having to fund pensions from somewhere, and wages are suffering as a result. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, says the Bank of England is giving out \u201cmixed messages\u201d on the outlook for interest rates. The higher growth forecast for 2014 and the lower estimate for the amount of slack in the economy may be seen as a signal to bring forward interest rate rises. However, Governor Carney\u2019s comments will reassure businesses that the MPC will not rush any increases in rates. He also acknowledged that the rising supply of labour in the economy may provide new sources of economic capacity. An early UK interest rate rise looks a little less likely, reckons Neil Lovatt, director of financial products at Scottish Friendly. He says: \u201cTo read between the lines, the message today is that rates are still destined to rise, but when that will be is still up for debate. The fickle nature of the UK economy seems to keep everyone guessing.\u201d \u201cAny rate rises will be small, but even very small rises in interest rates will have a significant effect on what is still a fragile economy. That said, savers thinking that the \u2018good old days\u2019 of high interest rates will return are going to be sorely disappointed and the sooner we adapt to this environment the better.\u201d Berenberg Bank have kindly wrapped up the changes to the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts: Growth up. The BoE raised its growth forecasts to 3.5% in 2014 and 3.0% in 2015, both up by 0.1ppts from their previous forecast. Although they cut their 2016 forecast to 2.6% from 2.8% Inflation up in 2014 but down in 2015 and 2016. The BoE now forecasts 1.9%, 1.7% and 1.8% inflation for 2014, 2015 and 2016, compared to 1.8%, 1.8% and 1.9% in their previous forecast. Unemployment down. To 5.9%, 5.6% and 5.4% in 2014, 2015 and 2016, from 6.3%, 6.0% and 5.9% in the previous forecasts. Pay growth cut in the near term but raised later in the forecast. Specifically, the BoE now forecasts wage growth of 1.25%, 3.25% and 4% in 2014, 2015 and 2016 from 2.5%, 3.5% and 3.75%. Slack now estimated at 1% of GDP, compared to 1-1.5% in the second quarter. So, good news on growth and unemployment, but bad news on pay. As Berenberg\u2019s UK economist, Rob Wood, puts it, there\u2019s \u201csomething for everyone\u201d. This fan chart shows the new growth forecasts: One more key point -- the Bank of England flagged up that geopolitical dangers (think Ukraine or the Middle East) are a growing threat to Britain\u2019s recovery. Carney said: \u201cMarkets have been remarkably resilient to some of these geopolitical events and we\u2019re only beginning to see the first advance signs of the middle through some of our major export markets such as Germany and the movements of some of the confidence indicators.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quote) Quick recap. 1) The Bank of England has slashed its forecasts for wage growth, conceding that the recovery has still not fed through to people\u2019s pockets. The BoE now expects earnings to rise by just 1.25% this year, down from 2.5% previously. It admitted that there appears to be more slack in the economy than it realised, although it is also being eaten up at a faster rate. Governor Mark Carney said the UK was experiencing \u201cstrong output growth\u201d, but this has not been matched by a material pickup in productivity, or wages. 2) The prospects of an early rise in UK interest rates appear to have faded. The pound tumbled on the news, shedding one cent against the US dollar to $1.6714 as investors calculated that an early rate rise is less likely than before. The Bank also hammered home that interest rate rises will be gradual and limited, when the time comes to end Britain\u2019s long period of record-low borrowing costs. 3) \u201cContingency plans\u201d have been drawn up in case Scotland votes for independence. Carney said: \u201dUncertainty about the currency arrangements could raise financial stability issues....We have contingency plans.\u201d 4) During an occasionally barbed press conference, Carney denied that the Bank was increasingly clueless about the UK economy. He argued that rising geopolitical risks mean there is naturally more uncertainty about the situation, and denied that his precious forward guidance policy has been a muddle. 5) Europe remains a big worry. The BoE says that: Eurozone growth continued to disappoint, net lending has been falling and inflation has stayed low. And deputy governor Minouche Shafik warned that the UK can\u2019t rely on the eurozone to drive its recovery. Incidentally, we had further confirmation this morning that the eurozone is struggling -- a poor set of industrial production numbers. My colleague Jo Moulds reports: Factory output in the eurozone contracted unexpectedly in June, further damaging hopes of a strong recovery. Industrial production dropped 0.3% on the month following a 1.1% drop in May, hit by the ongoing conflicts in the Ukraine, Iraq and Gaza. Production was flat compared to the same time last year. Economists had been targetting a 0.1% rise on the year. The annual reading was the lowest since August 2013. Britain can\u2019t rely on the eurozone economy to drive our recovery, warns the Bank of England\u2019s new deputy governor, Minouche Shafik. Asked about the impact of the European Central Bank\u2019s new stimulus measures (including hundreds of billions of cheap loans for banks), Shafik urged caution, saying the new impact of this LTRO programme will become clear over time. The eurozone still faces low growth and low inflation, Shafik says, and we need to see whether the ECB\u2019s measures lead to stronger credit growth and a stronger recovery. The UK can\u2019t rely on a eurozone recovery to lift our recovery. It would be good if the eurozone could drive us forwards, as it\u2019s such an important export market, that\u2019s not very likely, she concludes. And that was the end of the press conference. Summary and reaction to follow... Asked about the rise in self-employed workers (as covered earlier in the blog) deputy governor Ben Broadbent plays down the suggestion that it\u2019s a risk. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing for productivity, he claims. The Bank of England is tweeting some of the key points from today\u2019s briefing, including a rather dashing (and slightly menacing?) photo of the governor: Carney treats a question about his \u2018muddled\u2019 forward guidance policy with some distain. Asa Bennett of the Huffington Post points out that the initial pledge (no rate rise until unemployment has fallen below 7%), has evolved into a broader measure based on slack, wage growth, and the like. Was it a muddle, or a learning process? Not an unfair question, frankly, if a little mischievous. But Carney doesn\u2019t look pleased, claiming that Bennett is the muddled one, and that his guidance has been entirely consistent across many inflation reports and MPC minutes. It\u2019s consistent, it\u2019s boring, but what\u2019s what you get, he smiles. The audience aren\u2019t smiling, though: Mark Carney has revealed that the Bank of England has drawn up contingency plans in case Scotland votes for independence next month. Asked for his views on the prospect of \u2018sterlingisation\u2019 (that Scotland would use the pound without a formal currency union), Carney reveals that that BoE is preparing for all eventualities, as \u201cuncertainty\u201d over Scotland\u2019s currency arrangements could hit financial stability. He concedes that He says: We have contingency plans\u2026. but it\u2019s never a good idea to talk about them in public apart from to say that you have them. Carney says that in terms of the Bank\u2019s responsibilities for financial stability, we have \u201ca wide range of tools and plans\u201d. And the BoE isn\u2019t the only body with responsibilities here -- some are shared with the Treasury. Back on the markets.... Carney says he is \u201cencouraged\u201d that the financial markets are more responsive to the latest data. James Macintosh of the Financial Times takes up Larry\u2019s point, that the Bank is looking increasingly clueless (on a spectrum between certainty and cluelessness). Mark Carney replies; if we can agree that the range is between perfect certainty and perfect uncertainty, it\u2019s fair that there is more uncertainty, mainly around the issue of productivity. Here\u2019s a link to the inflation report (sorry for the delay #hectic) Ah, the Scotland question -- is it time for Alex Salmond to produce a Plan B on an independent Scotland\u2019s currency? Mark Carney takes a cautious line; the Bank will implement whatever policymakers decide, but it has \u201cnoted\u201d the statements from the three main UK political parties that they would not enter a formal currency union with iScotland. He also points out that the Bank has a responsibility for financial stability across the UK, and will keep discharging those duties until circumstances change. Could the Bank of England raise interest rates by as little as 0.125%, or would that be the equivalent of \u2018boiling the frog\u2019, asks Szu Ping Chan of the Telegraph. Carney chuckles at the analogy, but doesn\u2019t suggest such a small rise is on the agenda. Ed Conway of Sky invites Mark Carney to comment on the financial markets\u2019 expectations for UK interest rate rises (harking back to his Mansion House speech in June, when he suggested they were too dovish). Carney plays the ball deftly, saying that the overall shape of market expectations are consistent with an adjustment that is both gradual and limited. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent chips in, saying that it\u2019s a \u201cfalse dichotomy\u201d to suggest the Bank should either be completely certain about everything, or completely clueless. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, isn\u2019t impressed by today\u2019s report: Doesn\u2019t today report show that the Bank \u201creally hasn\u2019t got a clue, the MPC is divided, and that anyone taking out a mortgage or an overdraft would be ill-advised, as anything you say must be taken with a very large pinch of salt?\u201d, Larry politely suggests. Governor Carney defends his record, suggesting rather archly that Larry should try speaking to a lot of firms around the country*. The firms I speak to insist that business have understood the Bank\u2019s \u2018forward guidance\u2019, he adds. Interest rates will go up as the economy improves, they will go up to a limited extent, ands gradually, Carney says. But there are geopolitical dangers, and we may need to react to them. * - Like in Rochdale, perhaps, Governor? How much spare capacity is left to be absorbed in the UK economy? Carney says there is \u201ctremendous uncertainty\u201d about the degree of slack, among policymakers on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (the overall view is that there\u2019s 1% of capacity to mop up). That\u2019s not hugely reassuring, given the importance that the Bank now puts on the issue when setting monetary policy. Alex Brummer of the Daily Mail wants more details about the Bank\u2019s worries about geopolitics. Carney replies that there is a \u201cslight downturn skew\u201d to today\u2019s growth forecasts. Onto questions -- Ben Chu of the Independent asks why the Bank has lowered its forecasts for productivity growth. Mark Carney explains that firms have been taking on workers rather than investing in new equipment, as labour is cheaper than capital. That process should end once cheap labour has been mopped up, meaning workers demand higher wages, and encouraging firms to invest in new equipment that will boost productivity. That process is taking longer than thought. The pound has hit its lowest level against the US dollar since last May, as the markets digest the inflation report (and the jobless data). Sterling is down by 0.45% today, at $1.6732. On interest rates, Mark Carney again reiterated that borrowing costs will rise in a \u201csmall, slow\u201d manner, when the appropriate moment comes. The economy is returning to a semblance of normality, Carney concludes. Carney says that the amount of spare capacity in the economy has fallen somewhat in the last quarter, but the Bank also reckons there was more slack in the UK than before. Over at the Bank of England, governor Mark Carney is unveiling the Quarterly Inflation Report. He is declaring that the Uk recovery is \u201con track\u201d.... \u201cRobust growth\u201d has taken output above the pre-crisis peak, and the Bank has revised its near-term forecast for growth up. But the Bank has also slashed its forecast for wage growth in the UK. It now expects wages to rise by just 1.25% in 2014, down from 2.5% previously. It sees growth picking up to 3.25% in 2015, down from 3.5% before. And in 2016, it reckons wages will rise by 4%, up from 3.75% previously. Carney is also warning that Britain faces rising geopolitical risks, while the eurozone economy remains weak. And the persistent strength of sterling is also a worry. You can watch the press conference live here (right-click to open in a new tab). Today\u2019s report have cast a shadow over hopes that 2014 will be \u201cthe year of the pay rise.\u201d, says the Resolution Foundation. Adam Corlett, their economic analyst, comments: \u201cOnce again a strong employment performance is to be welcomed but concerns remain over wages. There is still good reason to expect that real pay will start increasing during 2014 but today\u2019s disappointing performance pushes the wages recovery further down the road. It\u2019s now almost impossible for average real pay in 2014 as a whole to exceed last year\u2019s unless we see an unprecedented surge in wages during the rest of the year. The number of people receiving the Jobseekers Allowance could soon fall below the one million mark: The Press Assocation reports: The claimant count fell for the 21st month in a row in June, by 33,600 to 1.01 million, according to today\u2019s data from the Office for National Statistics. If the trend continues, the number of Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance claimants will fall below a million next month for the first time since September 2008. Nearly forgot... you can see the full labour market report here (as a pdf). Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has claimed that his changes to the welfare system have helped heal the labour market. Here\u2019s his official response to the jobless figures: \u201cIn the past, many people in our society were written off and trapped in unemployment and welfare dependency. But through our welfare reforms, we are helping people to break that cycle and get back into work. \u201cThe Government\u2019s long-term economic plan to build a stronger economy and a fairer society is working - with employment going up, record drops in youth unemployment and hundreds of thousands of people replacing their signing-on book with a wage packet. \u201cThis is transformative, not only for these individuals and their families, but for society as a whole. That is why we have set full employment as one of our key targets - bringing security and hope to families who have lost their jobs and others who never had jobs, we put people at the heart of the plan. \u201cThe best way to help even more people into work is to go on delivering a plan that\u2019s creating growth and jobs.\u201d However....critics, such as our own Polly Toynbee, are less impressed with Duncan Smith\u2019s performance, given the stuttering start to his universal credit project: Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s delusional world of welfare reform Today\u2019s slump in real wages are a blow to hopes that the cost of living squeeze was easing -- readers may remember that four months ago there was chatter that the squeeze was over, after pay rises (briefly) burst above inflation. Could Britain\u2019s falling real wages be partly due to changes in the composition of the labour market, with more people taking lower-paid jobs? Newsnight\u2019s economics correspondent, Duncan Weldon, reckons so: Britain\u2019s youth unemployment total has fallen: The ONS reports that there were 767,000 unemployed people aged from 16 to 24 in April-June 2014; 102,000 fewer than for January to March 2014 and 206,000 fewer than for a year earlier. These were the largest quarterly and annual falls in youth unemployment since comparable records began in 1992. The recovery in the labour market has partly been driven by Britain\u2019s army of self-employed people, which swelled by almost 10% over the last year. The ONS reports that, since April-June 2013, The number of employees increased by 447,000 to reach 25.77 million. The number of self-employed people increased by 408,000 to reach 4.59 million. These two charts show what a bizarre jobs recovery the UK is experencing. On the one hand, the employment rate is close to its highest level on record, as jobless falls and more people find work (820,000 in the last year). But yet, real wages are shrinking - with the gap between earnings and inflation widening alarmingly (whether you include volatile bonuses or not) One reason for caution -- pay packets were boosted a year ago, because many bonuses were held back until after the UK top tax rate fell to 45%, in April 2013. The ONS points out that \u201csome employers who usually paid bonuses in March paid them in April last year.\u201d But if you strip out bonuses, pay is still up a measly 0.6% year-on-year, the lowest on record. This chart from Bloomberg confirms that UK wages have suffered their first fall since the depths of the financial crisis: Here are the key points on today\u2019s unemployment data, from the ONS: For April to June 2014, there were 30.60 million people in work, 167,000 more than for January to March 2014 and 820,000 more than a year earlier. For April to June 2014, there were 2.08 million unemployed people, 132,000 fewer than for January to March 2014 and 437,000 fewer than a year earlier. For April to June 2014, there were 8.86 million economically inactive people (those out of work but not seeking or available to work) aged from 16 to 64. This was 15,000 more than for January to March 2014 but 130,000 fewer than a year earlier. For April to June 2014, pay including bonuses for employees in Great Britain was 0.2% lower than a year earlier, but pay excluding bonuses was 0.6% higher. Breaking News: Wage growth in the UK has hit its lowest level on record, and actually contracted if bonuses are included. The Office for National Statistics reports that average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by a mere 0.6% in the three months to June. That means pay packets lagged well behind inflation -- which hit 1.9% in June. Including bonuses, total pay packets actually contracted by 0.2% during the quarter, the first fall since 2009. In brighter news, the overall unemployment rate fell to 6.4% in April-June, which is the lowest since the end of 2008. And the claimant count fell by 33,000, showing that the labour market continues to recover. But that recovery still isn\u2019t reaching people\u2019s pockets. More details and reaction to follow Nearly time for the UK unemployment data to hit the wires.... Reminder -- economists expect another rise in employment, and a drop in the number of people claiming benefits. But a crucial issue is whether earnings are picking up, after years of low pay rises. As my colleague Katie Allen reports, many employees have been hit hard: Angela Chicken was still in hospital with her newborn son when she was made redundant. She had been earning \u00a311 an hour as a graphic designer. Ten years on, the 52-year-old single mother makes around \u00a38 an hour working part-time at her local Sure Start children\u2019s centre in Southampton. With the cost of living rising faster than her pay, Chicken\u2019s wages have fallen even further in real terms, a pattern likely to be reflected across the country in the latest official labour market figures today. After bills and housing costs, Chicken is left with \u00a3108 a week to feed herself and her son, buy clothes and anything else they need. They eat well, she said, but there is little left for treats or outings. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have enough money to go on holiday \u2026 I don\u2019t get haircuts, I very rarely buy any clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I have had to do is pull myself back over the last 10 years to a position that isn\u2019t as good as it was because I got knocked off my perch.\u201d More here: In low-wage economy employers paying well make sound investment Most of Europe\u2019s stock markets have risen this morning, despite the worrying economic news from Asia overnight (details). Germany\u2019s DAX is leading the way, up 77 points or 0.86% at 9147. Insurance group Swiss Re has cheered investors by posting a 3.5% jump in profits. In London the FTSE 100 is flat (dragged back by a few companies going \u2018ex-dividend\u2019). The Bank of England may admit this morning that it was too optimistic about wage growth, reckons Bloomberg\u2019s Emma Charlton: We also have confirmation that the eurozone has slipped worryingly close to deflation last month. Fresh data this morning showed that Spain\u2019s consumer prices index fell by 0.3% year-on-year in July, the biggest drop in almost five years. Month-on-month they slipped by 0.9%. In France, prices were up by a meagre 0.5% last month compared with July 2013, and also fell on a monthly basis, down 0.3%. Global economy watchers have two big pieces of economic data from Asia to digest today. 1) Japan has suffered its biggest contraction since the 2011 tsunami, in a blow to efforts to revitalise its economy. Japanese GDP fell at an annualised rate of 6.8% between April and June (meaning it shrank by 1.7% during the quarter). The slump is being blamed on the recent hike in Japan\u2019s sales tax, from 5% to 8%, which encouraged firms and households to bring forward their spending to January-March. The government remains relaxed, saying the economy is recovering. But critics of prime minister Abe\u2019s stimulus plan suggest he may have to postpone plans to raise the sales tax again in December. 2) The news from China isn\u2019t too rosy either. The broadest measure of new credit has dropped to the lowest since the global financial crisis, suggesting many banks are cutting back on new lending. Economists are concerned, as Chinese banks also face the impact of the property market downturn. Beijing may need to unleash further stimulus measures to avoid growth weakening. fastFT has a round-up of analyst comments. Analysts at ING will be combing the inflation report for signs that the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee was divided last week, when it voted to leave interest rates unchanged. They say: The Bank will release new forecasts and update its forward guidance which will leave the door open for a rates rise this year. Any hints of dissent at the August meeting will boost the case for a November hike. The Bank of England inflation report will be scrutinised for hints over interest rate rises, the latest assessment of \u2018slack\u2019 in the economy, wage growth (or lack thereof), and the outlook for growth (could possibly be revised up) and inflation (might be revised down). Mark Carney can also expect a few questions about the UK housing market. Here\u2019s Angela Monaghan\u2019s preview: Bank of England inflation report \u2013 what to watch for City analyst Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that today\u2019s data will show another welcome drop in the jobless rate, but an unwelcome drop in wage growth. He writes: The latest ILO unemployment numbers for June are expected to see a drop from 6.5% to 6.4%, while jobless claims in July are expected to show another drop of 30k, slightly lower than the 36.3k drop seen in June. Wages growth continues to be the economic head scratcher and is the Bank of England\u2019s biggest problem when it comes to deciding when to raise rates. If we continue to see the gap with inflation widen out then it becomes increasingly difficult to see how the Bank could even contemplate a rate rise this year. Expectations are for flat wage growth for the 3 months to June, down from the 0.3% rise in May. * - The wages figures are skewed by the cut in Britain\u2019s top rate of income tax back in April 2013. That prompted some firms to hold back bonus payments until then, making comparisons trickier. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re tracking two big events in the UK this morning. First, the latest unemployment figures, due at 9.30am BST. They are expected to show another drop in the number of people out of work. But that labour market recovery has come at a price -- low wage growth, and today\u2019s figures are likely to show pay rises lagging behind inflation again. That would mean real wages are still falling; taking the shine off Britain\u2019s economy recovery. That data will set the scene for the Bank of England\u2019s latest quarterly Inflation Report, released at 10.30am. This is the Bank\u2019s latest health-check on the UK economy, including forecasts for growth and inflation. But the big issue is whether the BoE has moved closer to hiking interest rates -- Governor Mark Carney will probably be quizzed on this during the press conference. The key issue is whether the Bank thinks most of the spare capacity, or \u2018slack\u2019, in the economy has now been mopped up. Carney will probably reiterate that the Bank is watching wage growth closely \u2013 showing whether employers are having to pay more for talent, and whether households could cope with higher borrowing costs. As Ian Williams of Peel Hunt explains: Formal changes to the forecasts are likely to be minimal; the overall assessment of the degree of slack, especially regarding the labour market, will be the focus of investor interest. Elsewhere, European stock markets are expected to rise modestly, despite ongoing geopolitical tensions [the Russian aid convoy chugging towards the Ukraine border could be the next flashpoint]. And in the euro area, investors are digesting yesterday\u2019s slump in German investor confidence, and fretting about how bad tomorrow\u2019s growth figures for the April-June quarter could be. I\u2019ll be tracking the key events though the day....",

      "bodyText": "UK profits have slumped by a third at energy company E.ON after a mild winter caused lower demand for heating. The German-owned company, which supplied power to 4.8m British households and 500,000 businesses in 2013, also said it was concerned about the political crisis in Ukraine and reported a sharp fall in profits from its Russian division. The UK accounts for 9% of E.ON's earnings but energy sales fell by 10% in the first half of 2014, compared with the previous year when the UK endured a big freeze and a delayed start to summer. Tony Cocker, E.ON's UK chief executive, said: \"Although parts of the UK faced widespread storms, the first six months were actually considerably warmer in comparison to the same period in 2013. This has meant customers have used less energy.\" UK profits, measured as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, fell to \u00a3188m in the first six months of 2014, compared with \u00a3273m the previous year. E.ON is one of the big six energy companies under fire from politicians and consumer watchdogs for alleged profiteering. Officials at the Competition and Markets Authority recently embarked on the largest-ever investigation of the energy market to check whether consumers are getting a bad deal. Cocker said he was pleased the energy market was being investigated. \"We feel that through our own actions, and the CMA investigation, we can take another step towards becoming our customers' trusted energy partner.\" The UK was not the only part of the E.ON empire to suffer falling earnings: group profits were down 12% to \u20ac5bn (\u00a34bn), as the company was hit by exchange rate fluctuations and falling prices in its German home market. Profits from Russia slid by 24%, as a result of the weakening rouble, which reduced earnings when the numbers are converted into euros. The rouble has fallen by 7% against the euro since the start of the year, amid tension between Russia and the west over Ukraine which has hit investor confidence in Germany. Group chief executive Johannes Teyssen said the company was monitoring the Ukraine crisis with some concern, but assumed \"it would be able to continue to be able to work together successfully with Russian companies\". The biggest factor hitting profits was a 20% fall in gas revenues, as an expansion of renewable power in the German home market reduced wholesale power prices. The German government wants to get 40% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025, although it has recently taken steps to slow the rapid expansion of solar and wind power. Teyssen said the fall in wholesale power prices had become less pronounced and that the German government had recognised \"the problems of implementing the transformation of the country's energy system\".",

The economy is a mystery to the best brains of Threadneedle Street, scratching their heads at figures showing unemployment and earnings growth are both heading south at a rapid pace. This really shouldn't be happening as far as the Bank is concerned, which is why its quarterly inflation report was riddled with uncertainty. The Bank's monetary policy committee is at odds about how much spare capacity remains after the Great Recession. Policymakers are unsure what is happening to the housing market. Some of them think wage growth is about to pick up; some of them don't. Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, bridled at suggestions that the MPC doesn't really have a clue about what's going on and that therefore any guidance the Bank gave about the future path of interest rates should be taken with a bucket load of salt. Increases in bank rate, when they come, were likely to be \"gradual and limited\". Short of breaking into Stevie Wonder's Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing, Carney could not have been more emollient or reassuring. \"Even if spare capacity were to be eliminated at a stroke overnight, the appropriate level of Bank Rate would not be far from where it is today\", he said. It is entirely possible that the governor is right about that. The history of the labour market for the past quarter of a century is that unemployment can fall for long periods without higher wage increase putting upward pressure on inflation. That was the case in the 1980s, when it took a momumental housing boom to derail the economy. It was even more the case in the decade and a half between Britain leaving the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in 1992 and the start of the financial crisis in 2007. The notion that something structural has happened in the labour market is supported by the moderation of earnings growth in the years running up to the financial crisis and the extraordinarily weak wage growth subsequently. According to the Office for National Statistics, there are more than 800,000 people employed than there were a year ago but the rate of average earnings growth - once bonuses have been stripped out - halved from 1.2% to 0.6%. The Bank has halved its forecast for earnings growth by the end of 2014 from 2.5% to 1.25%. The City viewed the ONS data and the inflation report as dovish. With real incomes being caned, the likely date for the first increase in bank rate has been pushed back from the end of 2014 to early 2015. Sterling fell as markets took heed of Carney's comment that even when borrowing costs do rise they will settle at a lower level than before the recession. This was an \"expectation not a promise\", the governor said, leaving himself some wriggle room. And no wonder. This, after all, is the Bank that forecast a year ago that it would take until 2016 for unemployment to dip below 7%, something that happened within six months. It is the Bank that expresses surprise, regular as clockwork, every three months about the divergent trends in the labour market. Whatever Carney says, the Bank is groping around in the dark. At the moment it doesn't really know what's going on but hopes that if it sits tight for long enough, the fog covering the economy will lift.",

      "bodyText": "HSBC has given 15 of its top bankers \u201cfixed pay allowance arrangements\u201d worth \u00a37.1m under a controversial new pay scheme designed to dodge tough new European Union rules on bankers\u2019 bonuses. Britain\u2019s biggest bank awarded Samir Assaf, the head of its investment bank, \u00a31.5m worth of shares, and chief executive Stewart Gulliver was given shares worth \u00a3850,000. Peter Wong, deputy chairman and head of the Asia-Pacific region, was given \u00a3760,000 worth. Iain Mackay, finance director, and Marc Moses, chief risk officer, got \u00a3470,000 worth. The awards are part of big banks\u2019 plans to increase the basic pay of executives to sidestep tough new EU rules designed to clamp down on excessive bonuses. Banks have turned to awarding fixed pay allowances after the EU ruled to cap bonuses to 200% of salary, even if shareholders wanted to approve higher payments. The new payments are counted as fixed pay, which means banks can, with shareholder approval, pay bonuses of 200% of bankers\u2019 collective basic pay and fixed pay allowances. The fresh money, which is not subject to clawbacks designed to retrospectively recoup bonuses in the event of any wrongdoing emerging in the future, covers the first half of the year \u2013 and bankers can look forward to further payments every three months. A fifth of the shares will vest in March 2015, with the rest locked up until 2020. Gulliver, whose total pay and bonuses in 2013 were \u00a38m, has said his maximum potential pay each year will fall from \u00a313.8m to \u00a311.4m under the new arrangements. Gulliver, who started his career at HSBC more than 30 years ago as a currency dealer, also receives \u00a379,000 for the use of cars in Hong Kong and accommodation in the territory worth \u00a3229,000. Assaf was one of the highest paid bankers in the world in 2012, collecting \u00a37.1m including a \u00a34.5m bonus. His pay for last year was not disclosed. Earlier this year HSBC revealed that it pays more than 330 staff more than \u20ac1m. Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland announced on Tuesday that it had given 10 top executives share awards worth a total of \u00a33.5m under a similar scheme.",

At the same time, wage growth hit its lowest level on record, leaving economists and other commentators scratching their heads over the state of the UK recovery.</p> <h2>TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady</h2> <p>\"The combination of rising employment and falling pay growth suggests the economy is very good at creating low-paid jobs, but struggling to create the better-paid work we need for a fair and sustainable recovery. Self-employment has been responsible for almost half of the rise in employment over the last year. The fact that self-employed workers generally earn less than employees means our pay crisis is even deeper than previously thought, as their pay is not recorded in official figures.</p> <p>\"Falling unemployment is always welcome \u2013 particularly for young people who are finally starting to find work \u2013 but unless the quality of job creation increases Britain's living standards crisis will continue and people will be locked out of the benefits of recovery.\"</p> <h2>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</h2> <p>\"These figures show that the UK labour market is strong and flexible. However, wages growth declined on the quarter for the first time in five years, which is a warning sign that the economic recovery although on the right track, is still fragile. In this environment, the MPC needs to take its time before considering a rise in interest rates, and assure businesses that when they eventually start rising, this will happen slowly and at a measured pace.\"</p> <h2>Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club</h2> <p>\"Today's labour market data provides further evidence that the relationship between unemployment and earnings has broken down. A plausible argument for this divergence relates in part to a plentiful supply of workers, driven by high levels of inward migration, a rise in the number of older workers and the impact of welfare reform. At the same time, insecurity among existing employees, created by the experience of the recession and the knowledge that firms have plenty of choice when it comes to who they employ, may be keeping a lid on pay demands.</p> <p>\"So the UK economy's expansion looks set to continue being favourable to jobseekers but less so for those already in work. The good news for everyone is that limited pressure on firms' bottom lines from pay rises should keep inflation down and stay the MPC's hand in raising interest rates. So the enemy of so many economic expansions in the past \u2013 a wage-led inflationary surge triggering a sharp hike in borrowing costs \u2013 seems unlikely to emerge.\"</p> <h2>Robert Wood at Berenberg Bank</h2> <p>\"The doves would say that weak wage growth signals continued slack in the labour market and little inflationary pressure in the system, which should allow the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold beyond the end of this year. On the other hand, the hawks could point to the fact that slack is falling very rapidly. The degree of spare capacity is very hard to estimate, but it is not difficult to observe that unemployment is falling quickly.</p> <p>\"If it kept dropping as fast as during the past 12 months, then the unemployment rate would reach 5% by this time next year, below its average in the 10 years to 2007. The continued weakness in productivity, which based on today's figures probably fell again in the second quarter, adds weight to those hawkish views. We expect the rapid falls in slack to prompt a rate hike in November this year. But that is not a nailed-on certainty. Indeed, we put a 60% probability on it. Continued weak wage growth raises the risk that the Bank of England will wait until next year.\"</p> <h2>Elizabeth Martins at HSBC</h2> <p>\"Today's labour market data continued to complicate matters for policymakers at the Bank of England. A fall in unemployment to 6.4% augurs for a hike sooner rather than later. But with wages growing at their slowest rate in the series' 13-year history, the earnings data does the opposite. Which of these two divergent stories the [monetary policy committee] places more weight on could determine which way they vote \u2013 or indeed which way they have already voted.

Growth in regular pay \u2013 excluding bonuses - measured by weekly average earnings is weakening across all sectors. Bonus pay was down even more. As a result, total pay measured by weekly annual earnings actually fell by 0.2 percentage points comparing the three months to June 2014 with the same three months a year ago. It is hard to see where the pay revival is going to come from \u2013 and until real wages start to grow again, it will not feel like much of a recovery to most people in work.\"</p> <h2>Chris Williamson at Markit</h2> <p>\"Unemployment dropped to its lowest since late 2008 in the three months to June, as employment continued to rise. The puzzle persists, however, as to why this tightening of the labour market is not feeding through to higher pay. Pay, excluding bonuses, rose at the weakest rate since records began in 2001. With inflation running three times faster than wage growth, policymakers will be wary of hiking interest rates though fear of stalling the recovery. The timing of the first hike in interest rates therefore remains uncertain. A rise in February of next year looks the most likely scenario, although an earlier hike in November of this year remains a distinct possibility.\"</p> <h2>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency company World First</h2> <p>\"The first fall in wages in nominal terms since 2009 will come as a real gut punch for those investors and central bank watchers looking for an interest rate increase in the UK in the fourth quarter of this year.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England signalled it is edging closer to a rise in interest rates but admitted it is in the dark about the true state of the British economy. Policymakers at Threadneedle Street used the August inflation report to revise down their estimate of spare capacity in the economy, to 1% of GDP, from its May estimate of 1-1.5%. Governor Mark Carney and his colleagues on the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee have made it clear that the best time to increase borrowing costs \u2013 on hold at 0.5% since March 2009 \u2013 will be before spare capacity has been fully absorbed. The MPC said it expected the bank rate to remain below pre-crisis levels of around 5% for some time to come but said that it could offer no guarantees because of the uncertainties surrounding the economy. Carney reiterated that when rates do start to rise, increases will be \"gradual and limited.\" However, he cautioned: \"That's an expectation, not a promise.\" The governor highlighted a range of risks facing the UK economy, including heightened geopolitical tensions, a weak recovery in the eurozone, and UK household indebtedness. He said: \"Even if spare capacity was absorbed at a stroke overnight, Bank rate would not be far from where it is today because of these headwinds.\" The August report laid bare the dilemma faced by the MPC, which is trying to reconcile rapidly falling unemployment with very weak wage growth. The MPC sharply revised down its forecasts for pay growth, predicting average wage rises of 1.25% by the end of 2014 - half its May forecast of 2.5%. With inflation expected to remain just below the 2% target by the end of this year, it means real pay is expected to fall for the rest of the year. Unemployment, meanwhile, is forecast to move below 6% by the end of 2014. The City is likely to interpret the August report as a signal that the MPC is becoming increasingly divided about the appropriate timing of the first rate rise. The Bank noted in the report: \"Not surprisingly, there is a wide range of views on the committee about the likely degree of slack. Uncertainty about how much slack there is has increased in recent months, in part reflecting labour market out turns.\" The bank revised up its growth forecast for 2014 to 3.5% from 3.4%, and for 2015 to 3% from 2.9%.
