      "bodyText": "The TSB meltdown is likely to drag into the weekend as customers who are unsure whether they have been paid vented their anger at the bank\u2019s inability to resolve the IT crisis. TSB customers continued to report several problems including wages failing to be paid into their accounts \u2013 and bills going unpaid as a result. Others said they had been turned away at tills after trying to use their debit cards in stores. The Spanish-owned bank said on Friday that half of its 5 million customers were still unable to access their online accounts. Those that were able to log in experienced continued problems including access to other customers\u2019 payees, missing standing orders, and in some cases, the wrong balance. Business customers of TSB reported they had been unable to make the usual payroll run, meaning customers of other banks have also become affected. At one point on Friday afternoon, customers reported that the internal systems in some branches had also gone down. TSB said on Thursday that staff were continuing to work on a resolution, but could give no indication when its systems would be back to normal. Its chief executive, Paul Pester, said he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for the botched systems upgrade but no further information emerged from the bank. Last Sunday\u2019s attempt to migrate customers to a new database was due to save the bank\u2019s owners, Sabadell, \u00a3100m a year. Now the bank faces having to pay out a similar amount in compensation to customers and potential fines by the Financial Conduct Authority, which has dispatched a team to monitor the situation. Meanwhile, evidence emerged on Friday of the long-term damage the crisis will have on the TSB brand. Customers have started using the account-switching service to move to rival banks. One switching site on Friday reported that traffic to its comparison site was twice its normal level. Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?, said: \u201cIf the bank is to restore the trust of its customers, it must be swift in responding to those affected and in providing compensation. Customers should note down every time they\u2019re affected as evidence to ensure they receive what they\u2019re due.\u201d Wes Streeting, a Labour MP on the Commons Treasury select committee, said TSB\u2019s management needed to explain to parliament how the IT glitch occurred. \u201cThere can be no excuses for such a serious failure, but we need to understand what has gone so evidently badly wrong,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The financial disruption that could result if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal is to be examined by the Bank of England in a joint working group with the European Central Bank. Intense lobbying by banks and insurance companies in the City, fearful that billions of pounds\u2019 worth of cross-border financial contracts would lose their legal status if negotiations failed, appeared to have succeeded when EU officials agreed that the ECB would join Threadneedle Street officials to assess the risks. The European commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive arm \u2013 said the Bank of England and ECB, which regulates the 19-member euro bloc, would set up a joint technical working group to study risk management around the day Britain leaves the EU. Officials said the work of the committee would be separate from Brexit negotiations in Brussels, adding that it would focus on the potential disruption to the financial services industry when Britain ceases to be an EU member at midnight at the end of Friday 29 March 2019. The group will be chaired by the ECB president, Mario Draghi, and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who will report regularly to the commission and Britain\u2019s Treasury. They will both send representatives to monitor the committee\u2019s work. \u201cOther relevant authorities will be invited on an issue-specific basis,\u201d the commission said. \u201cThe primary responsibility to prepare for Brexit remains with market participants.\u201d UK negotiators are hopeful that a deal with the EU will allow businesses to continue relying on EU law until the end of 2020. But the failure to reach agreement on the Irish border and deadlock over the future terms of trade have panicked City firms and heightened the potential harm of the UK departing without a deal. The group is expected to hold its first meeting before the summer, when it is likely to examine work already completed by the Bank of England and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on the fate of cross-border insurance contracts and derivatives deals. Before the Brexit vote in 2016, Carney put in place contingency plans drawn up with the Treasury that included the provision of a \u00a3250bn war chest to ensure that financial institutions did not run short of cash during a period of uncertainty. The Bank has set up arrangements with other central banks around the world to provide foreign currency to the UK markets should that be required. Following the Brexit vote, more than $2tn was wiped off global financial markets and Carney was forced to say that he was ready to do whatever was needed to mitigate the impact of the vote. However, it has become clear that the deep links between the City of London and the continent have meant the ECB needed to participate in devising plans to protect the financial system from disruption. Carney has warned that it is in the interests of all parties in the negotiations to plan for a smooth Brexit because 90% of euro derivatives are cleared in London and thousands of insurance payouts made to EU citizens every day. EU businesses, which raise 50% of their corporate funding in London, are also vulnerable to the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. Miles Celic, chief executive of financial services lobby group TheCityUK, said: \u201cNot all challenges thrown up by Brexit can be solved by the industry, the UK or the EU in isolation. There are many practical issues which require close regulatory dialogue and cooperation. The new working group is a positive and pragmatic development. We look forward to engaging with it and are confident that real progress can be made quickly.\u201d Chris Cummings, the chief executive of the Investment Association, whose members manage funds worth nearly \u00a37tn, said he wanted to see officials devise a regulatory framework that would \u201cprovide firms with reassurance about their long-term ability to serve their customers, savers and investors throughout Europe beyond March 2019\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A group of Tory and Labour backbenchers are increasingly confident they can force Theresa May to introduce public ownership registers in Britain\u2019s overseas territories in an attempt to prevent them from being used to hide \u201cdirty money\u201d. Nineteen Conservative MPs have signed an amendment scheduled for debate in the Commons on Tuesday \u2013 theoretically a sufficient number to defeat the government, which has halted plans to implement a transparency measure originally proposed by David Cameron and George Osborne in 2013. The Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is one of the two principal backers of the amendment, said: \u201cThere is a spectrum of activity that starts with tax avoidance and then quickly goes on to money laundering and organised crime. Britain and its overseas territories have become the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money because of the secrecy of our offshore ownership laws.\u201d More than half of the offshore companies referred to in the Panama Papers were set up in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to Transparency International. The jurisdiction allows people to register companies in secret, prompting accusations that it is easy to hide cash and assets without external scrutiny. Conservative supporters of the amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill are led by Andrew Mitchell and include the former cabinet ministers Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Crabb and Ken Clarke. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, are also backers. Mitchell said he was hopeful the government would recognise the strength of parliamentary opinion on the subject and find a way of \u201celegantly getting off the hook\u201d. He said: \u201cThe argument that the registers are available in private to UK authorities is insufficient. Public registers allow reporting and discussion of these matters by the media and civil society, as was demonstrated by debate that followed the leak of the Panama Papers.\u201d No 10 said on Friday it was studying the amendment carefully, prompting speculation that ministers may attempt to broker a compromise. \u201cWe want to analyse its effectiveness. This is an important issue and one we want to get right,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. There are 14 British overseas territories, with a combined population of 350,000. Several have become major offshore financial centres, including Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar and the BVI. The overseas territories have introduced private central registers of ownership, which are accessible to UK law enforcement and tax authorities. The amendment calls on them to make those publicly available by December 2020, or have UK ministers impose that requirement upon them via orders in council. Some of the territories have expressed opposition to the imposition of public registers, with one leading offshore centre saying it would cost its public purse $100m (\u00a372m) a year. In March, in a previously unreported submission, the BVI government told British MPs debating the bill that such a move \u201cwithout consultation or consensus effectively disenfranchises the BVI legislature and its electorate creating resentment and damaging the historically strong relationship between the BVI and the UK\u201d. It said the territory was still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma and could not afford to deal with the effects from lost revenue. The BVI called on the UK government \u201cto foot the bill or see a crisis in the BVI\u2019s public services. Over the next 10 years this could result in an additional funding gap of $1bn.\u201d Proponents of the amendment have lobbied government ministers. In an attempt to allay Foreign Office concerns about introducing the disclosure measure so soon after the hurricane, the backbenchers agreed to leave the timing for implementation until 2020. The sanctions and anti-money laundering bill is nearing the end of the parliamentary approval process, with its report and third reading in the Commons scheduled for Tuesday, having passed through the Lords.",

      "bodyText": "The former trade minister Lord Price is unswayed. He voted remain and is still a remainer, despite spending a year at the heart of the government Brexit machine. \u201cI voted to remain and if I voted again today I\u2019d vote to remain,\u201d he explained. With the experience of more than a year in the trade department, criss-crossing the world banging the drum for Brexit Britain, he reckons the UK has up to five years of \u201cbumps along the road\u201d ahead. \u201cThe UK had a remarkable set of opt-outs and opportunities,\u201d Price told the Guardian as he prepared to take an unpaid role as chairman of the Fairtrade Foundation. \u201cWe were able to leverage not being in the euro, not being in the Schengen Area and had opted out of some of the social chapters,\u201d he said. \u201cOver many years the UK had engineered a position where it was a great place to come and do business. We have now got to think how we can achieve the same but in a global context.\u201d Price had spent the previous decade running the supermarket chain Waitrose and was hired by the then prime minister David Cameron in 2016. But within months he found himself working for the arch Brexiteer Liam Fox, who was installed by Theresa May as international trade secretary. Price continued: \u201cI am optimistic that we can get to a good place in terms of an independent trading relationship, but it will take three to five years. It won\u2019t happen overnight and in the interim companies might think twice about investing and consumers might decide they want to be more cautious.\u201d Given that roughly 30% of what is eaten in Britain today is imported from mainland Europe, there are concerns about the outlook for grocery prices if British negotiators cannot replicate the status quo. Price is optimistic, however. \u201cI don\u2019t think European countries want to impose tariffs on food. At the moment there is a \u00a310bn surplus in food traded with the UK. France runs a surplus of \u00a34bn, of which \u00a33bn is food. Spain equally [runs a surplus], Italy equally. Those countries are very aware of the fact the UK is extraordinarily important to them. \u201cWe are adopting EU standards on day one, so if there is regulatory compliance and no tariffs \u2013 and goods can be checked at the point of departure and arrival \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t expect to see food rotting at the ports. With a transition period, there is enough time to plan.\u201d Price joins Fairtrade at a time when the charity is said to be facing the biggest crisis in its 25-year history. Its famous logo is stamped on more than 5,000 products, ranging from coffee and tea to bananas and flowers, but its supporters were stunned last year when Sainsbury\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest retailer of Fairtrade products, announced it was setting up its own foundation. The supermarket giant\u2019s decision follows that of the US group Mondel\u0113z International, the owner of Cadbury, which has developed its own certification scheme called Cocoa Life. Some supporters worry that the proliferation of company-run ethical schemes will confuse consumers and weaken a Fairtrade model that guarantees a minimum price to farmers as well as a financial bonus used to fund community projects. Price argues that the opposite is true: \u201cFairtrade doesn\u2019t survive or not because of the decision Sainsbury\u2019s make about putting their own mark on a box of tea. It\u2019s bigger than that. It\u2019s a huge idea about helping the least developed [countries] get a fairer deal. \u201cHow can Fairtrade be in crisis when it\u2019s got a turnover of \u00a31.6bn in the UK and a business like Mondel\u0113z is saying it wants to work hand in glove with it and Sainsbury\u2019s is saying it\u2019s so important they might put in place the investment to build their own mark? Ultimately the goal of Fairtrade is not to have Fairtrade.\u201d These days the Fairtrade brand is part of the commercial mainstream and, despite the Sainsbury\u2019s setback, sales increased by 7% to exceed \u00a31.7bn for the first time in 2017. However, Price cautions: \u201cIf you think about Fairtrade as just a commercial entity and that\u2019s it, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. It also has to be a voice for change and fairness.\u201d As the charity prepares for its 25th birthday, the Tory peer, who has also turned his hand to writing business and children\u2019s books, said it was time to consider how the Fairtrade model was evolving. \u201cDo people pay us to help them certify products, or for the infrastructure we have?\u201d were, he said, among the questions he would work with the charity\u2019s chief executive, Michael Gidney, to answer. Price believes another area to explore is how Fairtrade products could be sold online. The businessman, who spent more than 30 years working for the John Lewis Partnership, also plans to use his experience of the corridors of power to ensure that farmers in developing countries are not penalised by Brexit. \u201cThere is a role to play in making sure our voice is heard in the department for international trade (DIT),\u201d he says. \u201cI also want to make sure we have a strong relationship with the department for international development.\u201d The EU has carved out economic partnership agreements with a number of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and Price said it was important for the UK to \u201cpick those up\u201d and offer countries the same deal they have now. \u201cThere are some developing African countries paying tariffs on agricultural goods coming into Europe, and the DIT has said they would want to take some of those away. It\u2019s about making sure we are close to that.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s stock market has responded to today\u2019s growth slowdown....by hitting its highest level in almost three months. The FTSE too jumped 80 points to close at 7,502, its highest finish since 31 January. It\u2019s mainly due to the slide in the pound, which pushes up the value of exporters (as their overseas earnings are more valuable). Major multinational firms led the risers, including Burberry (+3%), Unilever (+2.5), and Diageo (+2.2%). European stock markets showed more modest gains, with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 0.65% and France\u2019s CAC up 0.5%. Markets were also cheered by the remarkable scenes from Korea today, where the leaders of North and South have held talks and even hugged like a couple of old friends. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: The drop in the pound has helped the FTSE 100. The British equity benchmark is internationally focused and the slide in the pound has helped the market hit its highest level since early February. The geopolitical mood is improving after the historic meeting between North and South Korean leaders, as it suggest the two nations are on the road to peace. And that note, it\u2019s time to wrap up. Thanks, and have a good weekend. GW These charts help tell the (unhappy) story of Britain\u2019s economy in the last three months: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says there are three reasons why the UK economy slowed to a near-standstill in the last three months. First, construction had a terrible start to the year, with a drop in output of more than 3%. Without that, growth would have been 0.3%, in line with City forecasts. Activity had been weak in every month, not only in late February and early March, the ONS made clear. Some analysts said the first-quarter collapse of the construction company Carillion, which had knock-on effects to smaller subcontracting firms, had a bigger impact than the weather. Second, the strong performance by manufacturing during 2017 came to an end in early 2018. Factory output was up 1.3% in the final three months of last year but by 0.2% in the latest quarter. A slowdown in the eurozone has led to weaker demand for UK exports but survey evidence suggests that manufacturers have run into capacity constraints following years of underinvestment. Third, the lack of spending power for consumers is having an impact on the service sector, which accounts for around 80% of the economy and grew by only 0.3% in the first quarter. More here: Back in the markets, the pound has hit an eight-week low as traders continue to digest Britain\u2019s alarmingly sharp slowdown. Sterling has shed a cent and a half, to $1.37, its lowest point since the start of March. The pound has also shed one eurocent against the euro, dropping to \u20ac1.14. Investors are concluding that an early UK interest rate rise now looks a lot less likely, given the weak growth in the last quarter - and the fact that the poor weather is only partly to blame. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says the UK GDP figures have undermined the pound sharply. Buying sentiment towards the British Pound was dealt a severe blow on Friday, following reports that the U.K economy grew much slower than expected in Q1. U.K GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in the first quarter, much worse than the expected 0.3%, and its weakest since 2012. While the snow had some negative impacts on GDP, the bad weather really can\u2019t bear all the blame - its effects on growth were small. Today\u2019s dismal GDP figures have not only dented confidence in the health of the U.K economy, but also in the Bank of England\u2019s ability to raise interest rates in May. With the Pound notorious for its extreme sensitivity to monetary policy speculation, further downside is likely as investors heavily reduce bets of a rate hike next month. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are teaming up to protect the financial services industry from Brexit risks. Details are sparse, but presumably it will look at the issue of access to the EU by City banks after Brexit, passporting, regulatory equivalence, and the huge number of EU-based derivative contracts owned by UK banks. In a statement, the UK government says: Today, the European Commission and HM Treasury have asked the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to convene a technical working group on risk management in the period around 30 March 2019 in the area of financial services. The European Commission and HM Treasury will attend as observers and other relevant authorities will be invited on an issue-specific basis. This technical work is separate from the on-going negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK and from the negotiations on the overall understanding of the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. In a nutshell.... Here\u2019s Moody\u2019s take on the American growth figures: U.S. GDP growth moderated in the first quarter, but at least part of the slowdown is statistical coming from residual seasonality in the data. Real GDP grew 2.3%, better than expected but below the 2.9% in the fourth quarter and the weakest growth in a year, according to the advanced estimate from the BEA. Growth, though modest, was widespread including investment, consumer spending, trade and government. Imports and durable goods spending were drags. Real disposable income growth accelerated to 3.4% on the back of tax cuts, after rising 1.1% in the fourth quarter. The saving rate jumped to 3.1%, from 2.6% in the fourth quarter. The US GDP report shows that consumer spending, the biggest portion of the American economy, only rose by 1.1% in the last quarter. However, business investment remained solid, and trade boosted growth (having been a drag on growth at the end of last year). Growth in government spending slowed to 1.2%, from 3%, but inventory building by companies added almsost 0.5% to growth. That all added up to a growth rate of 2.3% (if the pattern in Q1 was expanded over the full year) - a little better than expected. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: NEWSFLASH: America\u2019s economy grew much faster than Britain in the first three months of this year. US GDP expanded by almost 0.6% between January and March, or at an \u2018annualised rate\u2019 of 2.3%. That beats forecasts of 2.0% annualised growth, but is a little slower than the 2.9% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. More to follow.... We\u2019re about to discover how America\u2019s economy fared in the first three months of this year. But first, here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the disappointing UK growth figures: Britain\u2019s economy slowed to a virtual standstill in the first three months of 2018, the weakest period of activity in more than five years. Office for National Statistics figures showed a sharp contraction in the construction sector, weaker manufacturing growth and a squeeze on consumer spending power contributed to GDP growth of 0.1% in the first quarter. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the economy was strong and that the exceptional weather in late February and early March had been partly to blame for the slowdown. The ONS, however, said the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d had been only a minor factor. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cOne week of snow doesn\u2019t explain a decade of weak growth, dismal productivity and falling wages. It\u2019s the avalanche of cuts that has done the long-term damage.\u201d The performance of the economy was much worse than the Bank of England had been expecting and almost certainly puts paid to any chance of an interest rate rise when the monetary policy committee meets early next month. City firm Fathom Consulting reckon there\u2019s an evens chance that Britain suffers two quarters of negative growth this year - the official definition of a recession. In another worrying sign, the ONS says there is a \u201clonger-term weakening\u201d in Britain\u2019s service sector, particularly in \u201cdomestic consumer-facing industries\u201d. Here\u2019s a chart showing the details of today\u2019s UK GDP report: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady blames government cutbacks for Britain\u2019s slowdown: \u201cOne week of snow doesn\u2019t explain a decade of weak growth, dismal productivity and falling wages. It\u2019s the avalanche of cuts that has done the long-term damage. \u201cWe need to modernise Britain\u2019s infrastructure. The government should set up a National Investment Bank to upgrade roads and rail, and to bring high-speed broadband and clean energy to every part of Britain. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time to get our public services back up to strength. Schools, hospitals and other vital services are part of Britain\u2019s core economy. If they remain starved of resources, the rest of the economy will continue to struggle too.\u201d The Evening Standard (edited by former chancellor-turned-newspaper editor George Osborne) has pinned the blame firmly on Brexit: The latest figures out today show gross domestic product grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of this year. There\u2019s been a sharp fall in construction, manufacturing barely grew and the consumer is squeezed by higher inflation. All this against the backdrop of a world economy that, by contrast, is going gangbusters. Two years ago, Britain was the fastest growing of the major Western economies. Then the country voted to leave the EU, and the Government said we would also leave the single market and customs union. Now we are the slowest growing of the major Western economies. Draw your own conclusions. Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, says Britain is still \u2018Tiggerish\u2019 despite the slowdown (referencing a line from chancellor Hammond\u2019s budget speech) Today\u2019s figures also show that Britain\u2019s economy has only expanded by 1.2% in the last year. That\u2019s much slower than average, illustrating how growth has slowed in recent quarters. Professor Costas Milas and Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool argue that such weak growth \u201ckills the case\u201d for the Bank of England raising UK interest rates next month. How likely is for this first GDP estimate to be revised upwards? Our database suggests that since 2006, the ONS has produced a first annual GDP growth reading which has on average been only 0.11 percentage points lower than the revised one. Therefore, if history repeats itself, the revised GDP growth reading will be only slightly higher at 1.2%+0.11%=1.31% which is equally disappointing! MPC members cannot, and will not, ignore the fact that the latest data for GDP growth and inflation are substantially weaker than their most recent predictions. Annual GDP growth of 1.2% is far below their forecast in February 2018 that suggested 1.65% was the most likely outcome for the first quarter of 2018. Likewise, the figure for 2018Q1 CPI inflation, of 2.7%, is also far lower than their prediction of 2.92% reported in February 2018. Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman has opined: Alfie Stirling, Head of Economics at the New Economics Foundation, makes an important point - the link between wages and economic growth has frayed badly since the financial crisis: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP estimates from the Office for National Statistics are again disappointing, and fall far short of what would be expected from a healthy economy. \u201cBut worse still is that GDP growth of any kind is no longer leading to higher real wages. Since 2010, GDP growth has become \u2018decoupled\u2019 from growth in pay with the latest estimates showing that total pay in February was the lowest monthly level seen for 2 years. \u201cThis grim phenomenon is unique, both to the community of major economies and to the UK\u2019s own historical record. It points to an economic model that is no longer working for people.\u201d Danielle Haralambous, UK analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, isn\u2019t buying the \u2018snow excuse\u2019 either. She says: Growth was surprisingly soft in the first quarter of 2018, even lower than our expectation, which factored in the impact of bad weather in February-March. This hit output in the construction sector particularly hard, but there is more to the story than snow, and the slowdown will be a big consideration in the Bank of England\u2019s deliberations next month. Ivan Petrella, associate professor at Warwick Business School, says the UK economy is showing signs of weakness - and Brexit may well be to blame. Today\u2019s GDP number confirms a recent trend of slow growth and a weakening economy. \u201cOne is tempted to attribute a large part of that to uncertainty following the Brexit referendum. In fact, after the initial boost to growth associated to the fall of the pound, the UK economy considerably under-performed with respect to its European partners last year and shows all the signs of heading for the same trend this year. Here\u2019s Rob Kent-Smith of the Office for National Statistics on Britain\u2019s shock slowdown: \u201cOur initial estimate shows the UK economy growing at its slowest pace in more than five years, with weaker manufacturing growth, subdued consumer-facing industries and construction output falling significantly. \u201cWhile the snow had some impact on the economy, particularly in construction and some areas of retail, its overall effect was limited with the bad weather actually boosting energy supply and online sales.\u201d John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, says Philip Hammond should blame his own government, not the weather, for Britain\u2019s alarmingly weak growth this year. McDonnell argues that the UK urgently needs fresh investment: \u201cToday\u2019s disappointing GDP figures further confirm that continued Tory austerity cuts are weakening growth. \u201cThe Chancellor will want to blame this all on a bit of bad weather, but the ONS say this had a limited impact. The truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. \u201cThis is the weakest Q1 growth since 2012. It\u2019s clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt. \u201cThe next Labour government will end austerity and provide the investment vitally needed to kick-start the economy to deliver rising living standards for the many, not the few.\u201d UK chancellor Philip Hammond has blamed the \u2018Beast from the East\u201d for Britain\u2019s weak growth, saying that \u201cexceptional\u201d bad weather had some impact. One problem, chancellor.... the Office for National Statistics says the snow only had a \u201cgenerally small\u201d impact. According to the ONS, Britain\u2019s services industries were \u201cbroadly unaffected\u201d by the bad weather, while there is \u201cno evidence to show that the fall in the manufacturing growth was due to the effects of the snow.\u201d Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, says Britain\u2019s GDP figures are \u201cparticularly disappointing\u201d. Growth has slowed much more sharply expected, and he singles out Britain\u2019s exit from the EU as a factor: \u201cThe icy weather slowed industrial deliveries, grounded construction projects, and pushed consumers off the high-street, so some cooling was expected. But it clear that some further underlying weakness persists in the economy. \u201cIt should hopefully bounce back this quarter. Some of the business activity lost due to the snow will be recovered over the coming months, leading to a rebound in the figures. Consumer spending power will also be bolstered by the fall in inflation. \u201cBut, the bigger picture remains one of a safe but sluggish economy. Confidence amongst business leaders, whilst no longer outright pessimistic, remains very much on the fence, and that is largely a result of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Brexit. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from political paralysis. \u201cSadly, the latest GDP figures confirm what we have been saying for some time: the UK is stuck in the global growth slow lane, while other countries race ahead. \u201cWestminster politicians need to start focusing their attention on a much stronger, more proactive drive to boost growth and investment. While the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 clearly had an impact in the first quarter, the underlying slow-growth trend is real cause for concern. Marshall adds that Britain\u2019s \u201cfaltering infrastructure, a training system in chaos and patchy digital connectivity\u201d are all holding the economy back. Most worryingly, Britain\u2019s economy has actually shrunk - once you adjust for population increases. Although gross domestic product has risen by a meagre 0.1% in the last three months, it contracted by 0.1% on a per-capita basis. The ONS is adamant that this slowdown can\u2019t just be blamed on the icy weather that blasted Britain over the winter: There were gasps on the City\u2019s trading floors (and in at least one newsroom) when the unexpectedly weak UK growth figures were released. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, says the slowdown in growth caused \u201ca sharp intake of breath\u201d. 0.1% is the lowest quarter on quarter growth since Q4 2012 with particular weakness seen in construction and services sectors \u2013 sectors worth over 80% of the UK economy. There are some caveats within this number of course; it is only the advance reading and therefore subject to revision and the poor weather that the UK suffered will have had a large effect on demand, particularly private consumption. That being said, March\u2019s numbers were horrific, are unlikely to be part of the sample yet and any revision to this advance number could easily be lower as opposed to higher.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just UK voters who could call themselves the JAMs \u2013 Just About Managing - it now seems that the wider UK economy is in that predicament too.\u201d Marc Br\u00fctsch, chief economist at insurance group Swiss Life, says the UK economy failed to hit expectations: Economist Howard Archer also fears that the economy is weakening: Sterling is tumbling as City traders react to the news that the UK economy barely grew in the last three months. The pound has lost a whole cent against the US dollar to $1.3815, its lowest level since 9 March. Investors are wagering that the Bank of England will be reluctant to raise interest rates next month, when the UK economy looks so fragile. The Office for National Statistics reports that Britain\u2019s construction sector shrank sharply in the last three months, dragging the UK growth rate down to just 0.1%. The ONS says: UK GDP growth was the slowest since Quarter 4 2012, with construction being the largest downward pull on GDP, falling by 3.3%. Production increased by 0.7%, with manufacturing growth slowing to 0.2%; slowing manufacturing was partially offset by an increase in energy production due to the below-average temperatures. The services industries were the largest contributor to GDP growth, increasing by 0.3% in Quarter 1 2018, although the longer-term trend continues to show a weakening in services growth. While some impacts on GDP from the snow in the first quarter of 2018 have been recorded for construction and retail sales, the effects were generally small, with very little impact observed in other areas of the economy. BREAKING! UK economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of 2018, with GDP rising by just 0.1%. That\u2019s the weakest quarterly growth since the last three months of 2012, and a worse result than expected. More to follow.... Tensions is building as the City prepares for the first estimate of UK GDP to be released, in just three minutes... Economist Catherine Colebrook has written about the shortcomings with GDP in the Guardian today. She says it fails to measure whether poverty is being reduced, whether the environment is being protected, or if people are happier (themes that Bobby Kennedy picked up in 1968). She explains: If we want to understand whether the economy is really delivering for its citizens, we need some new indicators. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), where I am the chief economist, is proposing a dashboard of five outcome indicators, to be updated annually, which would directly measure our progress against the outcomes the public wants the economy to deliver \u2013 broadly shared prosperity, justice and sustainability. Our chosen indicators are the distribution of the gains from growth; poverty rates among children and adults; levels of wellbeing among individuals at different income levels; the gap between the median income of the poorest region of the UK and the richest; and the gap between projected carbon emissions and the cost-effective path to decarbonisation. Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce is also expecting a UK slowdown.... Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, says there\u2019s a risk that Britain\u2019s growth rate slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year, to below the City forecast of 0.3%. If so, that would cut the chances that the Bank of England raises interest rates next month. It\u2019s now 50 years since Robert F. Kennedy gave his now-famous speech explaining why gross domestic product is a flawed measure that tracks \u201ceverything, except that which makes life worthwhile\u201d. Here\u2019s a Youtube clip of the speech, given to the University of Kansas in March 1968, three months before Kennedy\u2019s assassination. As Kennedy brilliantly put it: It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. The UK Treasury have created a short video explaining GDP: Sylvia Walter, senior economist at insurance company Swiss Life, says the French government shouldn\u2019t panic about the slowdown: Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the current rolling strikes on France\u2019s railways will hurt growth this quarter. Bloomberg\u2019s Marcus Bensasson says bad weather hurt the French manufacturing sector: France\u2019s economy saw growth slow sharply in the first quarter as winter storms ripped through the country, hitting factory production. Gross domestic product expanded 0.3 percent, the weakest in more than a year and less than half the 0.7 percent pace recorded in the previous three months. It\u2019s also slightly below the 0.4 percent estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Just in: Spain\u2019s economy has posted another quarter of solid growth. Spanish GDP rose by 0.7% during the first three months of this year, official figures show. That means Spain has grown by 0.7% per quarter for nine months in a row. The annual growth rate dipped slightly, to 2.9% from 3.1%, but is still fairly strong. Bad weather, falling business investment and weaker export growth have combined to slow the French economy. Statistics firm INSEE explains that a series of factors meant French growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last three months, from a bouncy 0.7% in the last three months of 2017. According to INSEE: French household consumption rose by 0.2%, the same as three months earlier Business investment (gross fixed capital formation) dropped to +0.6%, from +1.1% Exports fell by 0.1%, having risen by 2.5% in October-December. Manufacturing production shrank by 1.1%, compared with 1.5% growth previously That all adds up to a chunky slowdown - economists had expected growth to slow to +0.4%. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, says it\u2019s a poor - but not catastrophic - result, adding: [Annual] Growth of above 2.5 per cent in the second half of 2017 was never going to be sustained for long, and one-off factors such as weather also likely dented consumers\u2019 spending in Q1. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a major healthcheck on the global economy with new growth figures for Britain, the United States, France and Spain. Economists predict they will show a slowdown on both sides of the Atlantic in the first three months of this year, as bad weather and worries over trade wars hit growth. In the UK, quarterly growth is tipped to fall to 0.3%, from 0.4% in October-December. That would be rather weak performance in historical terms., below the country\u2019s long-term trend growth rate. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada thinks Britain could have suffered an even sharper slowdown, given the bitter weather that gripped the country this winter. Q1 GDP is out today, but will likely be affected to the severe weather conditions in the quarter. Our economists are in line with consensus (0.3% q/q), but markets would probably be tolerant of a downside miss in particular, given the weather-related uncertainty. US growth is also expected to have slowed, from around 0.7% to 0.5% on a quarterly basis. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says the American growth figures will be closely scrutinised by investors. Economic growth in the first quarter is forecast to have slowed to 2% on an annualised basis, down from 2.9%, as consumers spending braked sharply. This is expected to more of a bump in the road rather than the start of a full on change in direction for the US economy, which remains supported by a tightening labour market and sizeable tax cut. And we\u2019ve just learned that French growth rate slowed sharply, to just 0.3% from 0.7% in the previous quarter. That appears to confirm fears that the eurozone is slowing, after a strong 2017 (more in a moment). Also coming up today We\u2019ll be watching the ongoing tech problems at TSB Bank, as customers still struggle to access their accounts a week after its IT migration. Eurozone finance ministers will be meeting to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout, which expires this summer.

      "bodyText": "US economic growth slowed moderately in the first quarter, the first preliminary assessment of the health of the economy since Donald Trump signed huge tax cuts into law last year. Gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of goods and services produced in the US \u2013 rose at an annual rate of 2.3% from January through March, the commerce department said on Friday. The figure was lower than the fourth quarter, when GDP grew at a 2.9%, and the third quarter, which saw an increase of 3.2%. Trump argued that his $1.5tn tax cuts would boost US GDP to above 3% \u2013 ending years of lackluster growth in the wake of the last recession. His goal was derailed in the first three months as consumers trimmed spending. Household outlays increased at 1.1% in the first quarter, down from 4% in the last quarter of 2017. After a Christmas holiday splurge, consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket items like cars and washing machines. Sales of durable goods fell 3.3%, their steepest decline since 2009. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said the latest GDP figures were \u201csomething of a disappointment since the tax cuts should have provided an immediate boost\u201d. But he cautioned that the US economy had \u201crepeatedly swooned\u201d in the first quarter of the year and added that 2.3% was still ahead of most economists\u2019 expectations. While Trump\u2019s tax overhaul will take years to filter into the wider economy, Friday\u2019s report suggests its initial impact was subdued. The figure will be revised twice in the next couple of months as more data becomes available. Business spending remained robust, with spending on commercial construction, equipment and software rising at an annualized rate of 6.1%. The US job market has continued a record-breaking series of increases. March was the 90th straight month that the US had added jobs, the longest streak of month-on-month growth since records began in the 1930s. And while the latest GDP figures came in below Trump\u2019s ambitions, they were still stronger than those experienced by most western economies. The US economy grew by 0.6% over the quarter compared to 0.1% in the UK and 0.3% in France. Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform Infinox, said the GDP figures were likely to reinforce the Federal Reserve\u2019s resolve to keep raising interest rates.",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond was in an upbeat mood when he held a breakfast at the British embassy in Washington DC during last week\u2019s spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The economy had turned a corner, the chancellor insisted, once again comparing his mood to the ever-cheerful Tigger in AA Milne\u2019s Winnie the Pooh stories. Whether Hammond remains quite so Tiggerish in the light of the latest UK growth figures remains to be seen. In the first three months of the year, gross domestic product grew by only 0.1%, the weakest quarterly result since the UK was having a post-London Olympics hangover in late 2012. The City knew the news was going to be bad but not that bad. Publicly, the chancellor put a brave face on it. Progress had been made. Strip out the impact of the weather on activity and the economy was fundamentally strong. The Office for National Statistics, the body responsible for producing the UK\u2019s economic data, had a rather different take. Yes, the ONS said, the blizzards brought in by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d had some impact on growth but not all that much. Energy output had actually gone up as a result of the unusually cold weather. Instead, the ONS pointed to three key reasons for the first-quarter slowdown. First, construction had a terrible start to the year, with a drop in output of more than 3%. Without that, growth would have been 0.3%, in line with City forecasts. Activity had been weak in every month, not only in late February and early March, the ONS made clear. Some analysts said the first-quarter collapse of the construction company Carillion, which had knock-on effects to smaller subcontracting firms, had a bigger impact than the weather. Second, the strong performance by manufacturing during 2017 came to an end in early 2018. Factory output was up 1.3% in the final three months of last year but by 0.2% in the latest quarter. A slowdown in the eurozone has led to weaker demand for UK exports but survey evidence suggests that manufacturers have run into capacity constraints following years of underinvestment. Third, the lack of spending power for consumers is having an impact on the service sector, which accounts for around 80% of the economy and grew by only 0.3% in the first quarter. \u201cDespite services growth in the most recent quarter, the quarter on same quarter a year ago growth shows a longer-term weakening in this part of the economy, particularly in the more domestic consumer-facing industries,\u201d the ONS reported. The explanation for this is simple: the rising cost of imports triggered by the post-referendum fall in the value of the pound has meant prices have been rising faster than wages. Consumers have been tightening their belts. The good news for the Tigger at the Treasury is that this period has now come to an end. According to the ONS, inflation is on the way down and earnings are on the way up. Real incomes \u2013 pay packets adjusted for inflation \u2013 are rising. There are reasons to think that the first quarter will mark the low point. That said, the economy still faces some serious headwinds. Cuts to welfare benefits that came into force earlier this month are evidence that austerity remains a drag on activity. The housing market, which so often in the past has been a short-term engine for growth, is flat. And while Hammond thinks the 21-month implementation period for a Brexit deal will give businesses more confidence to invest, much uncertainty persists about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Union. Up until a week ago, the City had been convinced that the Bank of England would raise interest rates when its monetary policy committee (MPC) meets next month. The first signs that Threadneedle Street was getting cold feet came when the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said in Washington that financial markets were getting ahead of themselves. Following the release of the latest ONS growth figures, the City thinks a May rise is inconceivable, which is why the pound fell by 1% against the US dollar and the euro. Borrowing costs are set to stay at 0.5%, although two MPC members \u2013 Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders \u2013 are likely to vote for a quarter-point rise on the grounds that the weakness seen in the first quarter was temporary and that wage pressures are starting to build. John Wraith, strategist at UBS, ruled out a rate rise at any time in 2018, saying: \u201cThe slow-motion slowdown we have warned of many times is continuing to materialise and with inflation likely to return to target within the next three to six months, we believe the case for higher rates will look increasingly threadbare from both real activity and inflation standpoints.\u201d",

Following the release of the latest ONS growth figures, the City thinks a May rise is inconceivable, which is why the pound fell by 1% against the US dollar and the euro.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-27T14:50:12/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Consumer role\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-27T14:50:12/embed.html\">Consumer role</a> </figure>  <p>Borrowing costs are set to stay at 0.5%, although two MPC members \u2013 Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders \u2013 are likely to vote for a quarter-point rise on the grounds that the weakness seen in the first quarter was temporary and that wage pressures are starting to build.</p> <p>John Wraith, strategist at UBS, ruled out a rate rise at any time in 2018, saying: \u201cThe slow-motion slowdown we have warned of many times is continuing to materialise and with inflation likely to return to target within the next three to six months, we believe the case for higher rates will look increasingly threadbare from both real activity and inflation standpoints.\u201d</p>",

L&amp;G said it was in the process of recruiting a management team to run the new division, which is expected to build and buy homes to address a \u201cchronic shortfall\u201d of affordable housing. \u201cAffordable housing is a classic example of underinvestment with minimal new equity capital being deployed to the sector,\u201d the L&amp;G chief executive, Nigel Wilson, said. \u201cThis is not a sustainable position \u2013 either for the sector or for the 1.3m households currently on a waiting list.\u201d The affordable homes business marks L&amp;G\u2019s latest move into the UK housing market, where it is becoming a significant player. The insurer is already investing about \u00a31.5bn in the build-to-rent sector, with sites in Bristol, Edinburgh, Salford, Bath, Brighton, Leeds and Walthamstow. It aims to have 6,000 build-to-rent homes in planning, development or operation by the end of 2019. L&amp;G has also promised to revolutionise the housebuilding industry by constructing thousands of prefab homes from its new modular housing factory in Leeds. The homes are made and fitted out in the factory before being transported to their destinations on the back of trucks. The new affordable-homes business will become a subsidiary of Legal &amp; General Capital (LGC), which focuses on areas where there has been a lack of investment and innovation. L&amp;G said it would offer a more \u201csustainable\u201d approach to providing affordable homes after housing associations have taken on a lot of debt over the years to fund developments. Theresa May has described the \u201cnational housing crisis\u201d as one of the biggest barriers to social mobility in Britain, with 300,000 new homes a year needed to address the shortage. She has argued that key workers such as nurses, teachers and firefighters should be the priority for affordable homes. A shortage of homes in the UK has helped to support house prices in recent months, despite a slowing economy and weaker consumer spending. The average price of a home edged up 0.2% to \u00a3213,000 in April, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide, following two consecutive monthly falls. It pushed up the annual rate of growth in house prices to 2.6%, from 2.1% in March. \u201cLooking ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market but also with respect to interest rates,\u201d the Nationwide chief economist, Robert Gardner, said. \u201cSubdued economic activity and the ongoing squeeze on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing-market activity and house-price growth this year.\u201d Nationwide is predicting UK house-price growth of about 1% this year, down from 2.6% in 2017.",

    "webTitle": "The battle for Sky: what next for Murdoch, Comcast and Disney?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Comcast is attempting to outfox Rupert Murdoch\u2019s attempt to take over Sky, by lodging its own bid for the pay-TV group. Meanwhile, Disney is waiting in the wings with a $66bn (\u00a347bn) bid for Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox entertainment business, which includes a 39% stake in Sky. This complex game of cat and mouse involving three global media heavyweights is set to play out over the summer. What does Murdoch do now? Fox, controlled by Murdoch, said it was \u201cconsidering its options\u201d regarding its \u00a310.75 per share bid for the 61% of Sky it does not already own. In reality, Murdoch is working out how much to sweeten his \u00a311.3bn offer, which values Sky at \u00a318.5bn. But it is complicated. Under the terms of Murdoch\u2019s separate deal to sell Fox to Disney, which includes his current 39% stake in Sky, he must ask for consent to raise his offer. He will have to find \u00a34bn (an extra \u00a32 a share) just to get his nose in front of Comcast\u2019s \u00a312.50 per share (\u00a322bn) bid for Sky. However, he may need to offer well over \u00a35bn more (\u00a35 a share) to win the day. Can Murdoch win? The 87-year-old has known since he first lodged his bid for Sky in December 2016 that he was always going to have to pay significantly more to win over Sky\u2019s independent shareholders when they vote on the deal. So he is certainly prepared to take on Comcast. The question is how much does Disney \u2013 as Fox\u2019s soon-to-be new owner \u2013 want Sky, and how much it will support an improved bid from Murdoch. What about the UK competition regulator\u2019s investigation into Fox\u2019s Sky bid? The Competition and Markets Authority is due to deliver its verdict on whether owning Sky \u2013 and Sky News \u2013 gives the Sun and Times owner Murdoch too much power over UK news media to the culture secretary, Matt Hancock, on 1 May. Murdoch has already offered editorial and financial safeguards, while Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Murdoch achieve regulatory clearance. If Hancock blocks Murdoch\u2019s deal, the UK takeover panel has said Disney must buy the remaining 61% of Sky it will not own within 28 days of completing its takeover of Fox. Unless, of course, Comcast has already bought Sky. What does Comcast\u2019s move mean for Disney? Under the terms of Disney\u2019s deal to buy Fox it cannot make a direct move for Sky without Murdoch\u2019s permission. Disney will rubber stamp a new bid by Fox for Sky, although it will ultimately pick up the tab via extra debt on its balance sheet. Disney will not have to resubmit a fresh bid for Fox in light of Sky\u2019s increased value. Disney is buying a vast array of Fox assets, so it is not known what price it valued Sky at internally. Disney shareholders may not be happy with an increased bid for Sky adding to its debt, but executives would have been well aware that Murdoch\u2019s bid was considered by the market to be a low opening gambit and should have factored that in. What does Comcast do now? Comcast is aiming to steal what Disney called the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of Fox\u2019s assets, but its offer is seen by the City as the opening salvo in a bidding war. The company has said it could live with Fox or Disney as minority shareholders if it takes control of Sky. Who will win? Comcast is considered to have more financial firepower, so investors believe Disney/Fox will have to think about lodging a new bid of such scale that Brian Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, will balk at shareholder reaction to a retaliatory offer. Disney and Comcast rate Sky highly and one investor says that with such deep pockets on both sides, it could mean the \u201cbidding gets stupid\u201d.",

Meanwhile, Disney is waiting in the wings with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/14/rupert-murdochs-60bn-disney-deal-reshapes-his-media-empire\">a $66bn (\u00a347bn) bid</a> for Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox entertainment business, which includes a 39% stake in Sky. This complex game of cat and mouse involving three global media heavyweights is set to play out over the summer. </p> <h2><strong>What does Murdoch do now?</strong></h2> <p>Fox, controlled by Murdoch, said it was \u201cconsidering its options\u201d regarding its \u00a310.75 per share bid for the 61% of Sky it does not already own. In reality, Murdoch is working out how much to sweeten his \u00a311.3bn offer, which values Sky at \u00a318.5bn. But it is complicated. Under the terms of Murdoch\u2019s separate deal to sell Fox to Disney, which includes his current 39% stake in Sky, he must ask for consent to raise his offer. He will have to find \u00a34bn (an extra \u00a32 a share) just to get his nose in front of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/25/comcast-launches-rival-22bn-sky-takeover-bid\">Comcast\u2019s \u00a312.50 per share (\u00a322bn) bid</a> for Sky. However, he may need to offer well over \u00a35bn more (\u00a35 a share) to win the day. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/25/comcast-launches-rival-22bn-sky-takeover-bid\">Comcast launches rival \u00a322bn Sky takeover bid</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Can Murdoch win?</strong></h2> <p>The 87-year-old has known since he first lodged his bid for Sky in December 2016 that he was always going to have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/13/fox-chance-securing-sky-football-premier-league-rights-broadcasting-standards\">pay significantly more</a> to win over Sky\u2019s independent shareholders when they vote on the deal. So he is certainly prepared to take on Comcast.  The question is how much does Disney \u2013 as Fox\u2019s soon-to-be new owner \u2013 want Sky, and how much it will support an improved bid from Murdoch.</p> <h2><strong>What about the UK competition regulator\u2019s investigation into Fox\u2019s Sky bid?</strong></h2> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority is due to deliver its verdict on whether owning Sky \u2013 and Sky News \u2013 gives the Sun and Times owner Murdoch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/14/rupert-murdoch-sky-takeover-bid-competition-cma\">too much power over UK news media</a> to the culture secretary, Matt Hancock, on 1 May. Murdoch has already offered editorial and financial safeguards, while Disney has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/03/disney-offers-to-buy-sky-news-to-ease-murdochs-117bn-takeover\">offered to buy Sky News</a> to help Murdoch achieve regulatory clearance. If Hancock blocks Murdoch\u2019s deal, the UK takeover panel has said Disney must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/12/disney-must-bid-sky-murdoch-offer-fails-uk-watchdog-rules\">buy the remaining 61% of Sky</a> it will not own within 28 days of completing its takeover of Fox. Unless, of course, Comcast has already bought Sky. </p> <h2><strong>What does Comcast\u2019s move mean for Disney?</strong></h2> <p>Under the terms of Disney\u2019s deal to buy Fox it cannot make a direct move for Sky without Murdoch\u2019s permission. Disney will rubber stamp a new bid by Fox for Sky, although it will ultimately pick up the tab via extra debt on its balance sheet. Disney will not have to resubmit a fresh bid for Fox in light of Sky\u2019s increased value. Disney is buying a vast array of Fox assets, so it is not known what price it valued Sky at internally. Disney shareholders may not be happy with an increased bid for Sky adding to its debt, but executives would have been well aware that Murdoch\u2019s bid was considered by the market to be a low opening gambit and should have factored that in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What does Comcast do now?</strong></h2> <p>Comcast is aiming to steal what Disney called the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of Fox\u2019s assets, but its offer is seen by the City as the opening salvo in a bidding war. The company has said it could live with Fox or Disney as minority shareholders if it takes control of Sky.</p> <h2><strong>Who will win?</strong></h2> <p>Comcast is considered to have more financial firepower, so investors believe Disney/Fox will have to think about lodging a new bid of such scale that Brian Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, will balk at shareholder reaction to a retaliatory offer. Disney and Comcast rate Sky highly and one investor says that with such deep pockets on both sides, it could mean the \u201cbidding gets stupid\u201d. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy slowed to a virtual standstill in the first three months of 2018, the weakest period of activity in more than five years. Office for National Statistics figures showed a sharp contraction in the construction sector, weaker manufacturing growth and a squeeze on consumer spending power contributed to GDP growth of 0.1% in the first quarter. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the economy was strong and that the exceptional weather in late February and early March had been partly to blame for the slowdown. The ONS, however, said the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d had been only a minor factor. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cOne week of snow doesn\u2019t explain a decade of weak growth, dismal productivity and falling wages. It\u2019s the avalanche of cuts that has done the long-term damage.\u201d The performance of the economy was much worse than the Bank of England had been expecting and almost certainly puts paid to any chance of an interest rate rise when the monetary policy committee meets early next month. The Bank, along with most City economists, had been expecting growth of 0.3% and the surprise news from the ONS led to a drop in the pound in the currency markets. GDP per head, which adjusts for a rising population, fell in the three months to March and was only 0.6% higher than a year earlier. Some analysts said growth was likely to pick up over the coming months because earnings were growing faster than prices, reversing the trend of the past year. Over the year to the first quarter, the economy grew by 1.2%, well below its five-year average of 2.2% and the slowest annual rate since the spring of 2012. The ONS\u2019s flash estimate showed construction output was down 3.3% in the first three months of the year, while manufacturing growth slowed to 0.2%. Production, which includes electricity and gas supply in addition to manufacturing, rose by 0.7% as a result of households using more energy during the cold weather. Services, which account for almost four-fifths of the economy, grew by 0.3%. Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS said: \u201cWhile the snow had some impact on the economy, particularly in construction and some areas of retail, its overall effect was limited, with the bad weather actually boosting energy supply and online sales.\u201d Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at WorldFirst, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just UK voters who could call themselves the Jams (Just About Managing), it now seems that the wider UK economy is in that predicament too. \u201cAt the beginning of last week, the expected probability of a base rate hike at May\u2019s Bank of England meeting was around 86%; it now sits at 34% and sterling is sliding as investors price in a delay to increases in the base rate until December.\u201d In another sign of the pressures on household budgets, figures from the Insolvency Service showed the number of people unable to pay their debts in England and Wales reached its highest level in more than five years in the first three months of 2018. There were 27,388 personal insolvencies in the first quarter of 2018 \u2013 the highest quarterly figure since the third quarter of 2012.",

    "webTitle": "What does the TSB fiasco tell us about banking in Britain? | Patrick Collinson", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "TSB stands for Totally Shambolic Bank, according to some headlines, after its online and mobile services went into meltdown following a botched IT transfer. It was by any measure the worst failure by a British bank since RBS left its customers locked out of their accounts in 2012. So what does the TSB fiasco teach us about banking today? \u2022 Branches matter They\u2019re supposed to be a thing of the past. They\u2019ve been closing at a rate of about 300 a year since 1989, accelerating to more than 700 last year. Business gurus talk about \u201cbricks and clicks\u201d as the business model \u2013 mixing branches and online to give customer service. But what happens when the clicks don\u2019t work and the bricks aren\u2019t there? TSB\u2019s online lock-out was particularly appalling for business owners, as I found out when speaking to one outside one of TSB\u2019s few branches in London this week. His business could not see any of its transactions. Just as seriously, he couldn\u2019t pay his staff. He had to go down to a branch to arrange for a large sum to be transferred to another bank, so he could pay them. \u2022 Telephones matter even more It\u2019s evident that most people locked out of their accounts did the next most convenient thing and phoned instead. But TSB didn\u2019t pick up. As banks shifted to apps and online, they massively degraded their call centre operations, and can\u2019t cope when things go wrong. Lloyds has slashed thousands of jobs from its call centres. TSB, which was carved out of Lloyds, evidently no longer had enough staff to cope when the phones began ringing. Customers suffered mind-numbing delays only for the line then to go dead. Amid the meltdown, TSB said it was suffering from a lack of \u201cbandwith\u201d, but what it really needed was more bums on seats. \u2022 You can\u2019t hide There was a chasm between what TSB officials said was going on, and what customers said on Twitter. On the far side of the chasm was Josep Oliu, chairman of TSB owners Banco de Sabadell, who boasted on Monday, as the bank went into meltdown: \u201cWith this operation, Sabadell demonstrates its capacity of technological management.\u201d He was deservedly mocked, and that press release has now disappeared from Sabadell\u2019s site. We now know IT workers in Spain were quaffing cava celebrating the success of the transfer. Meanwhile, its social media team were telling customers the problem was \u201cintermittent\u201d. That annoyed nearly everyone. Then customers were told the service would be \u201cup and running soon\u201d \u2013 but they were soon found out. On Tuesday the hapless team said it would all be over by the afternoon. It wasn\u2019t. At 3.40am on Wednesday the breakthrough happened with the chief exec tweeting: \u201cOur mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running.\u201d Only they weren\u2019t, really. Bits worked. On the seventh day, TSB admitted half its online customers could not get through. In the era of Twitter, corporate boasts don\u2019t work; they just wind up the customers. \u2022 But you won\u2019t run On Twitter, furious customers were united in proclaiming how they will leave TSB just as soon as they can. Indeed, some will, but the reality is that most won\u2019t, and the banks know it. During the RBS crash, the customers of its subsidiary Ulster Bank were abandoned for the best part of a month. That Ulster Bank nonetheless kept most of its customers in Northern Ireland is testimony to either complete apathy, or the belief that switching accounts is even more hassle. The business owner I spoke to hated TSB but said moving accounts would bring him even more grief. \u2022 Spare a thought for Sophie, but not for Paul One customer started a hashtag #PoorSophie for a TSB staffer who was evidently working round the clock posting replies to furious customers on Twitter. It\u2019s no fun when you\u2019re the frontline staff taking abuse. Meanwhile, Paul Pester, the boss of TSB, did what most bank chief execs did during the 2007-08 financial crisis. He virtually disappeared from view. Only on the third day of the lock-out did we hear from him with a tweet beginning: \u201cI\u2019ve just resurfaced \u2026\u201d Multimillion-pound bonuses to Pester and 30 other senior TSB staff are dependent on the IT migration. TSB\u2019s remuneration committee has yet to decide whether to pay Paul Pester his \u00a31.6m bonus. Will it have the backbone to refuse it? We all saw how bonuses returned after the last financial crash. I\u2019ll let you guess if it will be Paul or Sophie in the money after this fiasco.",

He had to go down to a branch to arrange for a large sum to be transferred to another bank, so he could pay them.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Telephones matter even more </strong>It\u2019s evident that most people locked out of their accounts did the next most convenient thing and phoned instead. But TSB didn\u2019t pick up. As banks shifted to apps and online, they massively degraded their call centre operations, and can\u2019t cope when things go wrong. Lloyds has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/21/lloyds-warrington-call-centre-loss-645-jobs-antonio-horta-osorio\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/21/lloyds-warrington-call-centre-loss-645-jobs-antonio-horta-osorio\">slashed thousands of jobs from its call centres</a>. TSB, which was carved out of Lloyds, evidently no longer had enough staff to cope when the phones began ringing.</p> <p>Customers suffered mind-numbing delays only for the line then to go dead.</p> <p>Amid the meltdown, TSB said it was suffering from a lack of \u201cbandwith\u201d, but what it really needed was more bums on seats.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 You can\u2019t hide</strong> There was a chasm between what TSB officials said was going on, and what customers said on Twitter. On the far side of the chasm was Josep Oliu, chairman of TSB owners Banco de Sabadell, who boasted on Monday, as the bank went into meltdown: \u201cWith this operation, Sabadell demonstrates its capacity of technological management.\u201d He was deservedly mocked, and that press release has now disappeared from Sabadell\u2019s site. We now know IT workers in Spain were <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6393841884086755328/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BpsUydS1yQ%2FiON%2BX%2F1YBwrg%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base-view_activity_details\" title=\"\">quaffing cava</a> celebrating the success of the transfer.</p> <p>Meanwhile, its social media team were telling customers the problem was \u201cintermittent\u201d. That annoyed nearly everyone. Then customers were told the service would be \u201cup and running soon\u201d \u2013 but they were soon found out. On Tuesday the hapless team said it would all be over by the afternoon. It wasn\u2019t. At 3.40am on Wednesday the breakthrough happened with the chief exec tweeting: \u201cOur mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running.\u201d Only they weren\u2019t, really. Bits worked. On the seventh day, TSB admitted half its online customers could not get through. In the era of Twitter, corporate boasts don\u2019t work; they just wind up the customers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e549664ea0eed6e6013c549fe55e90106cc1b10e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e549664ea0eed6e6013c549fe55e90106cc1b10e/0_270_3661_2197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TSB chief executive Paul Pester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TSB\u2019s remuneration committee has yet to decide whether to pay chief executive Paul Pester his \u00a31.6m bonus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u2022 But you won\u2019t run</strong> On Twitter, furious customers were united in proclaiming how they will leave TSB just as soon as they can. Indeed, some will, but the reality is that most won\u2019t, and the banks know it. During the RBS crash, the customers of its subsidiary Ulster Bank were abandoned for the best part of a month. That Ulster Bank nonetheless kept most of its customers in Northern Ireland is testimony to either complete apathy, or the belief that switching accounts is even more hassle. The business owner I spoke to hated TSB but said moving accounts would bring him even more grief.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Spare a thought for Sophie, but not for Paul</strong> One customer started a hashtag #PoorSophie for a TSB staffer who was evidently working round the clock posting replies to furious customers on Twitter. It\u2019s no fun when you\u2019re the frontline staff taking abuse. Meanwhile, Paul Pester, the boss of TSB, did what most bank chief execs did during the 2007-08 financial crisis. He virtually disappeared from view. Only on the third day of the lock-out did we hear from him with a tweet beginning: \u201cI\u2019ve just resurfaced \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Multimillion-pound bonuses to Pester and 30 other senior TSB staff are dependent on the IT migration. TSB\u2019s remuneration committee has yet to decide whether to pay Paul Pester his \u00a31.6m bonus. Will it have the backbone to refuse it? We all saw how bonuses returned after the last financial crash. I\u2019ll let you guess if it will be Paul or Sophie in the money after this fiasco.</p>",
