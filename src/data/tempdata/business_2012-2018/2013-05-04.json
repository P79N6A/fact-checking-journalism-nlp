      "bodyText": "George Osborne and Vince Cable have tried cajoling, coaxing and bribing Britain's banks to lend more to businesses and help rebuild the economy. Yet the latest official figures show lending to firms still falling, while the reputation of the banks has continued to be undermined by scandals from Libor-fixing to money-laundering. And despite a forest of new regulations and reforms, many officials privately believe that if it came to the crunch, any future chancellor would have little choice but to bail out a big bank that fell into distress. Meanwhile, ordinary savers have little choice but to plump for one of the so-called big four banks \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC \u2013 that dominate the sector and have, according to Martin Wheatley, head of new watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, spent years \"viewing consumers simply as sales targets\". On Friday, campaigners, academics and financiers will gather in London at the Transforming Finance conference, to offer a more radical vision of how banking could be rebuilt to serve the economy better \u2013 and keep savers and taxpayers safer. Here are 10 proposals that will be on the agenda. 1 BYPASS THE BANKS While the mainstream banks remain reluctant to lend, scores of innovative institutions are springing up to channel savers' money to promising investments, or to lend to people who were previously \"unbanked\". Many of these new bodies are harnessing technology. The Bank of England's executive director for financial stability, Andy Haldane, has suggested that \"peer-to-peer\" financial institutions are set to become increasingly economically important. The conference will hear from several such bodies, including Abundance, which invites the public to invest directly in renewable energy projects; Buzzbnk, which raises money from the public for charities and social enterprise; and the London Rebuilding Society, which allows hard-to-reach customers \u2013 including, say, those with special needs, or very low incomes \u2013 to borrow against the value of their homes to fund major refurbishment. 2 CAPITAL CONTROLS For about 25 years, there was a prevailing consensus that lifting barriers to cross-border flows of capital and allowing financial institutions to bestride the world was a good thing because it helped spread risk and let investment flow to where it was needed. But Ann Pettifor of the economics thinktank Prime argues that these flows of hot money bring few benefits and leave policymakers powerless to the whims of financial markets. \"The number one priority must be capital controls,\" she says. \"The Bank of England can control the policy rate, but it has no control over all other rates \u2013 and the policy rate is irrelevant to the real economy.\" She would like to see controls imposed \u2013 perhaps by taxing flows of money into or out of the economy \u2013 to prevent sharp swings in interest rates such as those that have driven Greece and Cyprus to the brink of bankruptcy. \"We're talking about democracy here: the financial markets have hollowed out our democracy.\" 3 NANNY STATE Ever since Alistair Darling rescued RBS, the Treasury has been determined to manage the taxpayers' stakes in the bailed-out banks at arm's length, being scrupulously careful not to exert undue political influence. George Osborne appears to be keen to hand the bank back to the private sector before the next general election. But a growing number of thinkers \u2013 not least the new archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby \u2013 are calling for a much more hands-on approach. That could just mean breaking RBS up into two entities: a \"bad bank\", to deal with the legacy of dodgy lending decisions from before the crisis; and a \"good bank\", free to make new loans. But Tony Greenham at the New Economics Foundation (Nef) would go further and separate it into a series of regional lenders, firmly rooted in their local area. \"RBS should absolutely not just be flogged off. It's about doing something that services broader economic interests, and not just the short-term economic cycle,\" he says. Pettifor agrees that the state should take closer control over the banks it rescued. \"I would say to them: the taxpayer's willing to provide support to you, but the terms are: 'thou shalt lend to the productive sector, not the speculative sector'.\" Professor Richard Werner of Southampton University adds that by breaking up RBS into scores of separate, local banks \u2013 perhaps two or three in each county \u2013 with jointly owned back-office operations, the government could create the equivalent of the much-admired German Sparkasse network of local lenders. \"We need local banks, and they need to be independent, largely separate entities. It's not rocket science: we need small loans across the country, and that needs small banks,\" he says. 4BANG 'EM UP \"What we would like to see in the most serious cases is senior members of the bank in the dock,\" says Rosie Sharpe of campaign group Global Witness. It has tracked the activities of financial institutions in a series of money-laundering and corruption cases, many of them involving developing countries. High-level executives back in the banks' home countries invariably get off scot-free. Sharpe points to the fact when HSBC was recently fined $1.9bn by the US authorities for facilitating money-laundering by terrorists and drug-runners in Mexico and Colombia, head of compliance David Bagley resigned, but no other senior executive was punished. \"There should be someone at board level who is personally responsible,\" she says. 5PEOPLE POWER Much of the money circulating around the financial system is owned by ordinary members of the public, through their Isas, pension plans and other savings. Catherine Howarth, chief executive of lobby group ShareAction, says: \"What I'm hoping to convey at the conference is the potential to grow a popular movement for change in finance among the millions of citizens with a small stake in the system.\" She would like to see workers asking more questions about how the shareholdings in their pension funds are managed, and given new rights to information about how their investments are being used. She says: \"The widespread lack of trust in the financial system and in pension providers could be reduced if people could access information and influence what happens to their hard-earned savings.\" 6LOOK TO THE LONG TERM The short-termism of banks and City investors, who tend to demand a fast return on their cash, has been a frequent complaint of British companies for many years. Howarth at ShareAction believes one way of changing that entrenched quick-buck culture is to change the definition of the \"fiduciary duty\" that fund managers and pension fund trustees legally owe their clients. The Law Commission is consulting on clarification of the term to allow investment managers to take into account longer-term issues \u2013 such as climate change or unethical behaviour \u2013 that could affect a company's sustainability over a bigger timescale than the next quarter or two of results. Campaigners hope a change of definition could help persuade decision-makers at the heart of the financial system to take a more enlightened view of their responsibilities \u2013 and serve the economy better, too. 7 MAKE THEM PAY Despite all the changes in regulation since the financial crisis, many officials believe Britain's biggest banks continue to receive a huge implicit state subsidy \u2013 worth \u00a335bn a year, according to the Nef \u2013 because anyone who lends them money assumes that, in extremis, they would be bailed out. Finance Watch, a Brussels-based thinktank, calls for the banks to be forced to pay the full cost of that subsidy. On that basis, many of the relatively low-margin trading that forms a large part of the activity of giant, cross-border banks would be uneconomic, and the economic advantages of being such a huge bank would diminish. \"It's about applying the rules of capitalism to investment banks,\" says spokesman Greg Ford. \"There should be no subsidies, no bailouts for failure.\" 8 GET MUTUAL \"Once you raise your eyes over the Channel, you find that we have a very weird-looking banking system,\" says Nef's Greenham. Since a wave of \"demutualisations\" in the 1980s and 1990s, Britain's banks are overwhelmingly owned by shareholders (including, since the crisis, the taxpayer). On the continent, mutual ownership, with the benefits flowing back to savers and borrowers instead of out to shareholders in dividends, is far more common. These \"stakeholder banks\" have generally shown themselves to be more resilient during the past five years. The Co-operative Bank's recent withdrawal from a deal to buy more than 600 branches from the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group dashed the hopes of many campaigners keen to see a mutual mount a genuine challenge to the status quo in the banking sector. But Move Your Money, the group that tries to persuade consumers to boycott the big banks, is keen to see local credit unions attracting more customers, and there are calls for the strict regulatory limits on their activities to be lifted, to allow them to provide a fuller banking service. 9 START YOUR OWN CURRENCY As a small-scale fightback against globalised high finance and footloose multinationals channelling profits offshore, a number of regions have started \"parallel currencies\", which can only be spent on goods and services from local businesses. In Bristol, for example, the local credit union allows savers to deposit money in their accounts and receive the same number of \"Bristol pounds\" in exchange, which they can spend in the area, or even use to pay some local taxes. The idea is not to replace sterling \u2013 each Bristol pound in circulation is backed by \u00a31 \u2013 but to encourage money to circulate around the local economy, creating jobs and stimulating growth. 10GET TOUGH ON COMPETITION Lack of competition has been a problem in the British banking system for decades. Sir John Vickers, author of the independent commission on banking's 2011 report, called for the sector to be referred in its entirety to the Competition Commission if it failed to implement all of his reforms. But many of those speaking at the Transforming Finance conference would like to see more drastic action, such as limits on the market share of deposits a single bank can take. Greenham at Nef says it's also crucial for more information to be made available about where banks operate, where they take savings, and where they lend, postcode by postcode, so that the authorities and the public can see if deposits are being sucked out of some areas and channelled elsewhere. In the US, the Community Reinvestment Act forces banks to publish such data.",

Since a wave of \"demutualisations\" in the 1980s and 1990s, Britain's banks are overwhelmingly owned by shareholders (including, since the crisis, the taxpayer). On the continent, mutual ownership, with the benefits flowing back to savers and borrowers instead of out to shareholders in dividends, is far more common. These \"stakeholder banks\" have generally shown themselves to be more resilient during the past five years.</p> <p>The Co-operative Bank's recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/24/coop-pulls-out-talks-buy-lloyds-bank-branches\" title=\"\">withdrawal from a deal</a> to buy more than 600 branches from the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group dashed the hopes of many campaigners keen to see a mutual mount a genuine challenge to the status quo in the banking sector. But Move Your Money, the group that tries to persuade consumers to boycott the big banks, is keen to see local credit unions attracting more customers, and there are calls for the strict regulatory limits on their activities to be lifted, to allow them to provide a fuller banking&#xa0;service.</p> <h2>9 <strong>START YOUR OWN CURRENCY</strong></h2> <p>As a small-scale fightback against globalised high finance and footloose multinationals channelling profits offshore, a number of regions have started \"parallel currencies\", which can only be spent on goods and services from local businesses. In Bristol, for example, the local credit union allows savers to deposit money in their accounts and receive the same number of \"Bristol pounds\" in exchange, which they can spend in the area, or even use to pay some local taxes. The idea is not to replace sterling \u2013 each Bristol pound in circulation is backed by \u00a31 \u2013 but to encourage money to circulate around the local economy, creating jobs and stimulating growth.</p> <h2>10<strong>GET TOUGH ON COMPETITION</strong></h2> <p>Lack of competition has been a problem in the British banking system for decades. Sir John Vickers, author of the independent commission on banking's 2011 report, called for the sector to be referred in its entirety to the Competition Commission if it failed to implement all of his reforms. But many of those speaking at the Transforming Finance conference would like to see more drastic action, such as limits on the market share of deposits a single bank can take.</p> <p>Greenham at Nef says it's also crucial for more information to be made available about where banks operate, where they take savings, and where they lend, postcode by postcode, so that the authorities and the public can see if deposits are being sucked out of some areas and channelled elsewhere. In the US, the Community Reinvestment Act forces banks to publish such data.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As the horsemeat scandal reached its peak in February, the bosses of Britain's biggest supermarkets and suppliers were summoned to Whitehall to explain themselves. Packed into a Defra meeting room on a Saturday morning, the shopkeepers were given an almighty dressing down and ordered to take responsibility for one of the biggest food adulteration revelations of recent years. Among them was Justin King, at 51, and after nearly a decade at the helm of Sainsbury's, regarded as the elder statesman of the grocery business. He was, he says, determined not to take the criticism lying down. He accused government officials of failing to understand the industry, and even threatened to call on the prime minister to demand a ceasefire. Three months on, with horsemeat found in beefburgers, bolognese sauces, lasagnes and corned beef \u2013 but not in any Sainsbury's products \u2013 King still recalls the behaviour of those running the country with exasperation. He said: \"That moment was when politics and business were at their most tense, because politicians felt they had to be saying something. The reason no one was saying anything was because we were doing the responsible, trustworthy thing, which is understanding the issue before we shouted about it, while the dynamic of politics is the opposite. \"In business, we understand it and then we talk about it, while in politics they talk about it and at some later date work out whether their understanding fits with what they said about it some weeks before.\" It was perhaps surprising that King wanted to take such an active role in tackling the scandal on behalf of the industry, given that his own supermarket group had come through unscathed while bitter rivals Tesco and Asda were caught out. But the new old man of retail, having worked for PepsiCo, Marks &amp; Spencer and Asda before his nine years at Sainsbury's, says he has seen far worse and that the public is not quite as worried about horsemeat as might be expected. \"We've had foot and mouth, bird flu and BSE, all of which were examples where the supply chain was challenged, so this is nothing new. It's all about trust and acting in a trustworthy way. \"People are pretty realistic. If you Google horsemeat, [a lot of the hits] are horsemeat jokes. So there was an immediate juxtaposition in the consumers' minds that it was serious but they got a lot of enjoyment from it, too.\" However, King is keen to stress that businesses must stop feeling sorry for themselves and realise that the customers are victims too. \"I don't think it is fair enough for retailers affected to say they were victims. I had a very simple view \u2013 which is that I'm on the same side of the table as the customer. \"The second you say you're a victim in this situation, even when you are, you put yourself on the wrong side of the table. The real victims are the consumers, who have paid their hard-earned cash.\" This week, the City will see that Sainsbury's has been largely unaffected by the scandal. Full-year results released on Wednesday will show sales up 4.6% to around \u00a325.6bn, with underlying pre-tax profits expected to be up 5% to \u00a3748m. The focus may now have moved away from horsemeat, but City investors will be keen to learn more about King's future. He has been touted as the next boss of Formula One, when Bernie Ecclestone hands over the keys to the world's most glamorous sporting franchise. Last weekend that speculation reached a new pitch after the supermarket confirmed that headhunters Egon Zehnder had been retained to advise on King's successor. Sources inside the company suggest the process could take a year and that the process is merely a matter of good management. King refuses to quash rumours that he is interested in the F1 job \u2013 he only ever says that he is \"not aware of a vacancy\". He is a huge racing fan and has helped his son Jordan to become one of the most promising drivers of his generation. But if the call from Ecclestone, F1's diminutive owner, fails to come, a career in politics might appeal. King is a former board member of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and was a member of David Cameron's business advisory group \u2013 before they fell out over King's objections to government plans to allow new staff to surrender employment rights in exchange for shares. However, poor pay in the public sector could prove a sticking point for the businessman, who earned \u00a33m last year \u2013 20 times more than the PM. On the subject of King's future, analysts at Barclays wrote: \"No CEO remains forever, and at some point Justin King will prove the press predictions correct and move on. However, he may be keen to be in charge when Sainsbury's regains its number two market-share position from Asda \u2013 his former employer.\" That could happen later this year, after a remarkable 33 consecutive quarters of growth. According to industry data from Kantar Worldpanel, Sainsbury's is outperforming its rivals as the only big four supermarket to be increasing its market share. The grocer now accounts for nearly 17% of all the money spent on groceries in the UK, a slight rise on last year, at a time when Morrisons, Asda and Tesco all lost customers. Sainbury's successful Paralympics sponsorship, leading position in convenience stores and growing online presence have also helped, while Tesco's decision to open no more megastores, and write off \u00a3800m on land it had bought for new developments but will now never use, may also give King cause to crow. He was always angry about Tesco's land-grab. \"If you're acquiring a site just a mile from an existing site, are you doing it because you think it's valuable to trade, or because it stops a competitor?\" And his vitriol for the number one supermarket doesn't stop there. He is equally scathing about Tesco's new price promotion, which promises shoppers that Tesco's prices for own-label and branded goods are cheapest. Having complained directly to Tesco and failed to reach a compromise, Sainsbury's has now appealed to the Advertising Standards Authority. \"We have exhausted everything we could with them [Tesco], so were left with no choice but to go to the ASA,\" he says. \"You can't have advertising saying that where your chicken comes from is important, while at the same time still sourcing your chicken from Thailand and Brazil, and then doing a price comparison with Sainsbury's chicken, which is sourced from the UK. That is inherently unfair.\" Tesco said: \"We use an independent agency to check prices of branded and own-label products at other retailers \u2013 online daily for Asda and Sainsbury's, and, since they don't have an online grocery service, twice a week at Morrisons stores. The basis for our comparisons is made clear on the price promise website.\" This may not be enough to soothe King's feelings, but perhaps he will soon be directing his passions elsewhere. Less horsemeat, more horsepower?",

That is inherently unfair.\"</p> <p>Tesco said: \"We use an independent agency to check prices of branded and own-label products at other retailers \u2013 online daily for Asda and Sainsbury's, and, since they don't have an online grocery service, twice a week at Morrisons stores. The basis for our comparisons is made clear on the price promise website.\"</p> <p>This may not be enough to soothe King's feelings, but perhaps he will soon be directing his passions elsewhere.

If our obstinate chancellor is not prepared to own up to the need, then he should have words with his prime minister about his interest in another cabinet post and leave the door open for a more expansion-minded colleague. Two names that come to mind are Lord Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke. Both have had to pay lip service to the chancellor's \"austerity strategy\", but it is obvious from the conclusions of his recent Downing Street-commissioned report on growth what Heseltine really thinks of Plan A. And Clarke knows that the way to achieve a reduction in the deficit is by encouraging the economy to grow at a decent lick \u2013 not add to private sector cutbacks with public sector ones on top. This is what he achieved during his 1993-97 chancellorship. Alas, at 80 Heseltine would probably not want the job, and Clarke is far too unpopular with the Thatcherites who, along with Ukip, have now frightened that nice David Cameron into ditching his attempts to soften the Conservative party. George Osborne's shamelessness knows no bounds. The ratings agencies were going to be the judge and jury of his pre-Keynesian strategy. They have given their verdict. The American academics Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart had in theory demonstrated that borrowing and rising debt levels caused low (or no) growth, but rival academics have now demonstrated that their research was deeply flawed: the causality is the other way around. When elaborating on his austerity strategy in the Mais Lecture of 2010, Osborne drew putative justification for his policies from the work of Rogoff and Reinhart. It is, by the way, with some amusement that one now finds the two academics proclaiming: \"Our consistent advice has been to avoid withdrawing fiscal stimulus too quickly, a position identical to that of most mainstream economists.\" The question is whether a fiscal stimulus should be withdrawn at all before a decent economic recovery is established. For all his previous fiscal sins \u2013 and they are not nearly as grievous as they have been painted \u2013 Gordon Brown realised this. The error made by policymakers in the UK and the eurozone has been, in the words of Sir Samuel Brittan, to return \"to old habits\" after the rescue operation of 2009-10. Osborne has admitted, indeed boasted, that his model was Geoffrey Howe's budget of 1981, which \u2013 according to mythology \u2013 produced a dramatic recovery by cutting public spending and raising taxes. Osborne rescinded Labour's cut in VAT and began a public spending squeeze, the consequences of which are all around us \u2013 with more to come as the Treasury completes a new spending round for the year 2015-16. The 1981 fiscal squeeze did not produce a recovery; but the economic cycle eventually turned up, helped not least by the budget strategy of easier monetary policy and an engineered fall in the pound. Then came the abolition of credit controls. Even so, unemployment went on rising until 1986. An important difference between then and now is that we now have a banking crisis. Also \u2013 as former Treasury official Sir Tim Lankester pointed out at a seminar on 1981 last week organised by the Treasury and the Mile End Group \u2013 consumer debt was much lower then than now. All this talk about double dip or no double dip is a red herring. The fact is the economy remains in depression, with gross domestic product some 15% below what previous trends would suggest possible. Now, controlling and curbing the growth of public spending is in the Treasury's DNA. But this is not the time for further cuts; indeed, it is time to reverse the process by which youth programmes, school sports facilities (so much for the Olympic spirit) and many local social services are being emasculated. The pressure for economically unnecessary, indeed socially harmful, cuts has become so intense that furious cabinet ministers in other departments are urging the prime minister to break his commitment to \"ringfence\" the health service. The absurdity of the situation was vividly brought home to me by the wonderful NHS surgeon who recently operated on my left shoulder after I had tripped on a pavement: London teaching hospitals are noticing a significant increase in admissions to accident and emergency as a result of falls connected with unmended pavements and potholes. It is the economics of the madhouse for local authorities to be in this position, thereby adding to the pressure on the NHS. How about government grants of, say, \u00a32m per local authority, to be spent specifically on mending all those potholes and pavements, on condition that the money has to be spent by 30 September 2014?",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The business secretary, Vince Cable, is urging the chancellor to consider breaking up Royal Bank of Scotland to boost competition in the financial sector instead of dashing to privatise the bailed-out lender. He waded into the debate about the future of RBS after reports that George Osborne was hoping for a quick selloff. Cable said: \"I don't see the need for any haste.\" Sir Philip Hampton, the bank's chairman, said on Friday that the clean-up of the battered lender would be \"substantially complete\" by 2014, allowing the Treasury to start selling shares before the general election. But Cable is keen to ensure that all options remain on the table, including breaking the bank up. \"There's a lot to be said for the idea of using RBS to create a more competitive banking sector,\" he said. Insiders have argued that splitting up RBS would create insurmountable legal and practical problems, but Cable said: \"You probably could create separate entities and I'm sure that would be healthy.\" Encouraging competition in banking is a key aim of the coalition and ministers were disappointed by the collapse last month of a deal under which the Co-operative Bank sought to buy more than 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group, creating a powerful mutually owned \"challenger bank\". Cable said consumers and businesses had been left with even less choice than before the financial crisis. \"It's become very, very narrow, and it almost entirely consists of shareholder banks,\" he said. RBS was bailed out by Alistair Darling, the then Labour chancellor, in the financial crisis in late 2008. It required two fresh recapitalisations the following year as the shaky state of its finances became clearer, receiving a total of \u00a345bn. With lending to small businesses in Britain's recession-scarred economy still falling, despite a series of government initiatives, the future of RBS has become a fraught political issue. Senior figures, including the archbishop of Canterbury and former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson, have called for it to be broken up into a \"bad bank\", with legacy loans from the boom years, and a \"good bank\" that would then be free to make new loans. Some campaigners have argued that it should be split into a series of regional lenders that could focus on small businesses. Tony Greenham, of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: \"It absolutely should not be flogged off: why would you turn the clock back to a banking system that was so manifestly dysfunctional before 2008 by just selling it back?\" The share price of both RBS and Lloyds Banking Group remain well below the average paid by the government when it part-nationalised them. Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, said: \"The bottom line is that a selloff of the government's stakes in the banks would be no quick fix for either the public finances or the problems in the lending market.\" But some Tory strategists believe that selling at a loss would be better than hanging on to RBS beyond the election. A Treasury spokesman insisted the chancellor was willing to examine alternatives to a full privatisation and denied any rush to offload the bank. \"It's a company that's gradually returning to health, but it is gradual: it's still quite a long slog,\" he said.",
