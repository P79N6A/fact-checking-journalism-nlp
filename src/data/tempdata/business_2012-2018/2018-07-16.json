      "bodyText": "Government ministers and Britain\u2019s equalities watchdog are failing to save more than a million older workers from discrimination, bias and outdated employment practices, according to a group of MPs. In a highly critical report for the government, the women and equalities committee said the talents of older workers were going to waste because too little was being done to enforce discrimination law. The panel of MPs accused the government and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, set up a decade ago, of \u201cfailing to enforce the law\u201d on age discrimination. Prejudice against older workers, unconscious bias and causal ageism were made illegal in the UK under the Equality Act 2010. However, the committee said it had found widespread failings in its enforcement, saying the scale was \u201calarming and totally unacceptable\u201d. Maria Miller, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cAs a country, we face serious challenges recruiting and retaining an experienced and skilled workforce. Until we tackle discrimination against the growing number of over 50s, they will continue to be consigned to the \u2018too old\u2019 pile instead of being part of the solution.\u201d Over the next few decades the shape of the labour market in Britain will change dramatically as more people stay in employment for longer than before. About a third of workers will be over the age of 50 by 2020, while nearly a quarter of the UK population will be aged 65 or over within two decades. The report says women tend to be hardest hit by the lack of flexibility offered by companies for older workers when many people over the age of 50 need to reduce their working hours to care for loved ones. It called on the government to introduce a statutory entitlement for five days\u2019 paid leave for carers, and a longer period of unpaid leave, to help older workers balance work with caring. While the government has focused on skills and training for younger workers through apprenticeships, the committee warned that older workers had been neglected by government education policies. The EHRC chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said the organisation takes robust enforcement action and would work with the government. \u201cIt is unacceptable that ageism still exists in the workplace and there is a clear need to make people more aware of what age discrimination looks like and what to do if you experience or witness it,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, London\u2019s stock market closed lower tonight. The FTSE 100 lost 61 points to end at 7,600, a fall of 0.8%. Miners and oil companies were among the fallers, following the slowdown in Chinese growth and persistent worries about trade spats. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: The FTSE fell heavily on Monday, dipping below 7600, as commodity stocks and a stronger pound weighed on the index. With the Chinese economy expanding at a slightly slower pace in Q2, metal prices tumbled, causing mining stocks to trace the price lower, which oil majors slipped as oil tumble 3%. Given the heavy weighting of resource stocks on the FTSE, the blue-chip index lagged significantly behind its European peers. Germany\u2019s DAX had a better day, up 0.16% while France\u2019s CAC dipped by 0.3% as the Paris exchange enjoyed a quiet session after the World Cup final. Goodnight! GW Here\u2019s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on the IMF\u2019s new economic forecasts: Rising trade tensions between the United States and the rest of the world could cost the global economy $430bn (\u00a3324bn), with America \u201cespecially vulnerable\u201d to an escalating tariff war, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Delivering a sharp rebuke for Donald Trump, the Washington-based organisation said the current threats made by the US and its trading partners risked lowering global growth by as much as 0.5% by 2020, or about $430bn in lost GDP worldwide. Although all economies would suffer from further escalation, the US would find itself \u201cas the focus of global retaliation\u201d with a relatively higher share of its exports taxed in global markets. \u201cIt is therefore especially vulnerable,\u201d the fund said. Just in: CNBC are reporting that Goldman Sachs will name their new CEO tomorrow morning. David Solomon, currently president of Goldman Sachs, will be promoted to succeed Lloyd Blankfein, they say. That wouldn\u2019t be a surprise; Solomon has been in poll position for the top job since rival Harvey Schwartz stepped down four months ago. Solomon is known as a food fanatic and music fan (spinning vinyl as \u201cDJ D-Sol\u201d).... The IMF expects advanced economies to slow next year, while emerging markets will power on. But these forecasts could turn to dust if the tit-for-tar trade dispute turns into an damaging trade war. The IMF\u2019s Maurice \u201cMaury\u201d Obstfeld is speaking now, warning that the global recovery has plateaued and become less balanced. Obstfeld says: We continue to project global growth rates of just about 3.9 percent for both this year and next, but judge that the risk of worse outcomes has increased, even for the near term. He points out that growth has slowed recently in the eurozone, Japan and the UK (which is why the IMF has trimmed their growth forecasts). Obstfeld says Europe looks less stable than three months ago (before Italy\u2019s populist government was sworn in, and Germany\u2019s coalition was split over migration). He explains: Political uncertainty has risen in Europe, where the European Union faces fundamental political challenges regarding migration policy, fiscal governance, norms concerning the rule of law, and the euro area institutional architecture. The terms of Brexit remain unsettled despite months of negotiation. Obstfeld also warns that financial markets seem \u201cbroadly complacent\u201d about the risks of a trade war, and the geopolitical tensions rising across the world. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that hundreds of billions of dollars of growth will be wiped out, if a full-scale trade war breaks out. The IMF estimates that the global economy will be 0.5% smaller by 2020 if the various tariffs threatened by the US, China, Europe, Mexico, Japan and Canada are all implemented. The warning comes in the IMF\u2019s latest economic outlooks, which also cuts Europe\u2019s growth predictions this year. Maury Obstfeld, IMF Economic Counsellor, says: The risk that current trade tensions escalate further\u2014with adverse effects on confidence, asset prices, and investment\u2014is the greatest near-term threat to global growth. Global current account imbalances are set to widen owing to the United States\u2019 relatively high demand growth, possibly exacerbating frictions. The United States has initiated trade actions affecting a broad group of countries, and faces retaliation or retaliatory threats from China, the European Union, its NAFTA partners, and Japan, among others. Our modeling suggests that if current trade policy threats are realized and business confidence falls as a result, global output could be about 0.5 percent below current projections by 2020. As the focus of global retaliation, the United States finds a relatively high share of its exports taxed in global markets in such a broader trade conflict, and it is therefore especially vulnerable. The IMF has lowered its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 2.2%, from 2.4% back in April. It has also cut its forecast for UK growth in 2018 to just 1.4%, from 1.6%. But it still expects the global economy to grow by 3.9% this year, and in 2019. It\u2019s pretty obvious that trade wars can make imports more expensive, as tariffs are effectively paid by consumers. But they can also make domestic goods cheaper, if suppliers are left with a glut of products which they can no longer sell competively overseas. And this is already happening in America, where pork prices are falling on fears that China will stop importing as many US hams. Bloomberg reports that hog futures are weak this year. And American meat lovers are already taking advantage, and tucking into some culinary treats..... On Saturday in Dallas, as many as 30 people on a local bacon-focused food tour were set to traverse the city chomping down on bacon donuts, bacon brown sugar ice cream, bacon jam and candied bacon. While retail bacon prices are down in the past 12 months, they\u2019re still up from six years ago, so any relief from higher costs will be welcome news to the pork enthusiasts. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a bonding experience,\u201d said Jeanine Stevens, the owner of Dallas Bites! Tours, which takes participants to little known restaurants and other eateries. \u201cBacon is a kind of food that people just feel a little bit lighthearted about. It\u2019s a fun food.\u201d Vincent-Fre\u011bde\u011bric Mivelaz of Switzerland\u2019s SwissBank is concerned by today\u2019s Chinese growth figures. Mivelaz points out that there are signs of weakness, with fixed asset investment dropping from 6.1% to 6% per year in June, industrial production growth down to 6% from 6.8%, and retail sales growth below their recent average. He adds: Money supply is tightening, due to caution of financiers and debt risk, so the Chinese economy is expected to slow down industrial activity and private consumption. Trade tariffs will be a key factor in coming months. Here\u2019s our Beijing correspondent, Lily Kuo, on China\u2019s retaliation against America\u2019s tariffs: China has filed a complaint against the US at the World Trade Organisation over Donald Trump\u2019s threats to place tariffs on an additional $200bn worth of Chinese goods. The one-sentence announcement on Monday, from China\u2019s ministry of commerce, comes less than a week after the US president called for a second round of tariffs on China, in retaliation for Chinese tariffs placed on American goods. On 6 July, the US imposed 25% tariffs on $34bn in Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to hit back with levies on the same amount of US exports to China. In response, the White House last week released a wide-ranging list of $200bn in Chinese goods, from tobacco to dog and cat food, to target with 10% tariffs. Beijing said it would \u201cfight back as usual\u201d and would file a complaint with the WTO. The new round of tariffs would not come into effect until September, making China\u2019s response uncharacteristically quick. Up to now Beijing has waited for the US to \u201cfire the first shot\u201d in the escalating trade war... More here: Newsflash: US retail sales grew steadily last month, indicating that America\u2019s economy is growing steadily despite tariff worries. Retail sales jumped by 0.5% in June, the Commerce Department reports. That\u2019s the fifth monthly rise in a row. May\u2019s figures have also been revised higher, to show a 1.3% increase - up from 0.8% previously. However, \u2018core retail sales\u2019 (stripping out cars, gasoline, food and building materials) were flat in June. Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Here\u2019s a handy chart, showing how the availability of credit in China has recently been reined in, after a long period of loose monetary policy after the financial crisis. London\u2019s stock market has fallen into the red, as City traders fret about the risk of a tradw war. The FTSE 100 has shed 88 points, or over 1%, to 7573. After a slow start, equities took a hit as the oil price fell, hitting shares in energy producers and miners. Brent crude is now down almost 2% at $73.94 per barrel, following the news that China\u2019s growth rate has slowed. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE\u2019s initially meagre losses gathered pace as Monday went on, the index dragged lower by its commodity stocks. With Brent Crude slipping 1.1%, and copper down 0.7%, both suffering in light of China\u2019s Q2 slowdown, the FTSE\u2019s hefty oil and mining ended up in the red, dragging the UK index lower in the process. Getting back to trade, the boss of asset management giant BlackRock has warned that Donald Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China will hurt growth. Larry Fink told Bloomberg TV that America\u2019s economy would suffer if the White House imposes tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports (as it threatened last week). Fink said that US economic growth has been strong in 2018, but it will weaken in 2019 if America escalates the trade war with China. He predicted that: GDP will slow down dramatically.....we\u2019ll have even more uncertainty about the state of the world. Fink added that shares would tumble if a full-blown trade war broke out, adding that \u201cmarkets will speak louder than any single voice\u201d. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson says the UK\u2019s new concept fighter jet will help the country \u201c\u201cfly higher, further and faster than ever before\u201d. Williamson explains that the Tempest could be operated by a pilot, or be flown unmanned (using a virtual cockpit, I think). He hopes that the plane could be operational by 2035, and adds that Britain is open to partnering with other countries on its future fighter programme (as happened with the Eurofighter Typhoon, of course). Several major engineering and defence firms are already on board, including Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems. Over in Farnborough, Britain\u2019s defence secretary has just unveiled a new concept fighter jet to protect the UK in the coming years. It\u2019s called \u201cTempest\u201d, and dubbed a next-generation fighter jet that could eventually replace the Eurofighter. Just in: the Eurozone suffered a drop in exports in May, narrowing its trade surplus with the rest of the world. However, the euro area\u2019s trade surplus with America has grown - which will not please Donald Trump. Eurostat reports that the eurozone exported \u20ac189.6bn of goods to the rest of the world in May 2018, a drop of 0.8% compared with May 2017. Imports from the rest of the world rose by 0.7% to \u20ac173.1bn, (from \u20ac171.9bn in May 2017). This means the euro area\u2019s goods surplus has shrank to \u20ac16.5bn in May, down from \u20ac19.3bn a year earlier. The figures also show that the European Union exported 2.1% more goods to America in the first five months of 2018, but imported 3.1% less. As a result, the EU\u2019s trade surplus with the US has swelled to \u00a354.8bn, up from \u00a348.1bn a year ago [more details here]. Trump has other things on his mind today, of course, but this data might reinforce his belief that the EU treats America very badly on trade. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take: China announced it filed a World Trade Organization challenge on Monday to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal for a tariff hike on $200bn of Chinese goods, reacting swiftly amid deepening concern about the economic impact of their spiraling technology dispute. The one-sentence Commerce Ministry statement gave no legal grounds for the challenge or other details. It is an unusually rapid move for a trade case, coming less than one week after the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] announced the tariff plan, which wouldn\u2019t take effect until at least September. The USTR said last week that it proposed the levy in response to Beijing\u2019s decision to retaliate for U.S. tariff hikes over complaints China is hurting American companies by stealing or pressuring foreign enterprises to hand over technology.... This is a swift move by China. By appealing to the WTO, Beijing is signalling that it won\u2019t accept America\u2019s proposal to slap 10% tariffs on a wide range of imports - from meat and vegetables to chemicals and consumer products (plus plenty of unusual items). However, China still hasn\u2019t revealed how it will retaliate against America\u2019s plan to make $200bn of its imports less competitive. That may be because Beijing can\u2019t announce reciprocal tariffs, as it doesn\u2019t import enough stuff from the US.... Newsflash: China has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over America\u2019s latest threat to impose levies on Chinese imports. According to Associated Press, Beijing is protesting about the plan to hit $200bn of Chinese goods with a new 10% tariff (probably starting in September). Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit believes China\u2019s economy has held up well despite the trade spat with the US. However, he also expects growth to slow in the next few months. Rafferty says: \u201cThe data shows that global trade headwinds have yet to grip China\u2019s economy. Despite the heated global rhetoric around trade and associated financial market volatility, China\u2019s export sector performed well in the second quarter of the year and will probably prove quite resilient under the limited tariff actions we anticipate from the US and China. We are more concerned about slowing domestic demand within China\u2019s economy, with investment persistently weak and consumption also having slowed, and these are much more important drivers of growth than exports. The fall in industrial output growth in June was notable in this regard. The authorities have begun to loosen policy settings, but will be reluctant to go too far given their desire to curb financial risks. As such, we expect growth to slow in the second half of the year and more markedly in 2019.\u201d ING economist Iris Pang has spotted an important detail in today\u2019s Chinese growth figure. China\u2019s robot production only grew by 7.2% year-on-year in June, compared to 23% for 2018 as a whole. That signals that factory bosses are worried about the future, and refusing to invest in new equipment right now. European stock markets are subdued this morning, with the FTSE 100 dipping by 18 points (0.2%) in early trading. Germany\u2019s DAX has made a better start, up 0.35%, while the French CAC is flat (maybe Parisian traders are recovering from the World Cup). Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are awaiting developments in Helsinki, and not too alarmed by the Chinese growth figures.... Looking ahead, the Trump-Putin summit could have an impact on risk assets as the US president continues to show a willingness to disrupt the established world order. After calling the EU a \u2018foe\u2019 on trade, European leaders in particular will be wary about just how much Trump cosies up to Putin, which may dampen risk appetite. But at the very least it deflects attention away from Chinese trade wars for the time being. Asian stocks fell as overnight China GDP data disappointed a touch but we can look through the noise here. There is little change from the last several quarters with growth holding just below the 7% level. The chatter is that trade war concerns are weighing on business confidence but this sounds more like a lot of noise. Tusk: Let\u2019s not start trade wars European Council President Donald Tusk has urged the world\u2019s major powers, including China, to help prevent a global trade war that would hurt the global economy. Speaking at the 20th EU-China summit, Tusk called for policymakers to strengthen and reform the \u2018rules-based\u2019 international setup, rather than unravelling it. He also gave a pointed nudge towards the US-Russia summit which is taking place in Helsinki later today, saying: \u201cWe are all aware of the fact that the architecture of the world is changing before our very eyes. And it is our common responsibility to make it a change for the better. Let us remember, here in Beijing, and over there, in Helsinki, that the world we were building for decades, sometimes through disputes, has brought about peace for Europe, the development of China, and the end of the Cold War between the East and the West. It is a common duty of Europe and China, America and Russia, not to destroy this order, but to improve it. Not to start trade wars, which turned into hot conflicts so often in our history, but to bravely and responsibly reform the rules-based international order.\u201d Tusk has also tweeted that he hopes his message reaches the leaders of the US and Russia in Finland. Iris Pang, Greater China Economist at ING in Hong Kong, argues that Chinese policymakers need to do more to boost growth. She says: \u201cThey need to slow financial deleveraging slightly and to turn their focus more on growth-supportive measures, for example increasing liquidity through (bank reserve requirement) cuts. \u201cIf the situation gets worse a lot faster than what we expect I do think Chinese authorities need to beef up supportive measures, both fiscal and monetary.\u201d Although China\u2019s growth rate only dipped slightly, it\u2019s a worrying sign for the health of the global economy, argues Bloomberg News. They fear that the \u2018spillover effects\u2019 of China\u2019s slowdown could hurt other countries, arguing: Confirmation that China\u2019s economy is slowing amid an escalating trade war is a worrying omen for global growth. Data released since Friday has affirmed what\u2019s been expected for some time: That an ongoing campaign to curtail credit is putting the brakes on the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Given that China generates as much as a third of global growth, that\u2019s adding to signs that the best world expansion in years is plateauing. The International Monetary Fund, which has repeatedly warned that the trade spat between the U.S. and China will reverberate globally, is scheduled to release fresh growth forecasts later Monday. The Chinese economy grew at an expected 6.7 percent in the second quarter, its slowest pace since 2016, while key readings on investment growth and industrial output slowed in June. Retail sales held up. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong, has warned clients that the trade row between Beijing and Washington could soon cause serious harm to economic growth. \u201cIf the US and China do not resume talks in the next two months or so, the conflict will escalate further, with major economic implications for themselves and the global economy,\u201d Investment manager Mario Cavaggioni tweets: Back in April, Beijing told state-owned banks to stop lending so much money to local authorities to fund building projects. That clampdown is now hitting growth, argues Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong. \u201cA main reason for the slowdown is that infrastructure investment began to slow down in the first quarter as the government was trying to control local government debt. \u201cThe good news is that there is space to provide more fiscal support through tax cuts and higher infrastructure investment. We expect they will move along these lines.\u201d Mao Shengyong, spokesperson for China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, has told reporters that the Chinese economy made a \u201cgood start\u201d to 2018 - despite growth slowing a little in the April-June quarter. Reuters has more details: Noting increasing external uncertainties and the fact that China is still going through a critical stage in structural adjustment, Mao said the country would stick to the supply-side structural reform and coordinate efforts to ensure stable and sound economic performance. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China\u2019s growth rate has dipped to its lowest rate since 2016, in a sign that the trade dispute with America maybe hitting its economy. Chinese GDP rose at an annual rate of 6.7% in the second quarter of 2018, partly due to slower-than-expected growth in factory output. That\u2019s a slight deterioration on the first three months of this year, when the economy expanded by an annual rate of 6.8%. Although this is above Beijing\u2019s goal of growth \u201cabove 6.5\u201d, it will stoke concerns that the tariffs imposed by America this year are hurting. It could also show that the campaign to rein in shadow banking and risky lending is also restraining growth. Official government figures also show that industrial output only grew by 6.7% year-on-year in June, down from 6.9%. However, retail sales jumped by 9% year-on-year, up from 8.5%. China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics warned that there are \u201cincreased uncertainties\u201d in the global economy (no prizes for who they\u2019re thinking of...). It also argued that the Chinese economy is still on a \u201csteady and improving trend\u201d, despite the shadow of a trade war with America. Asian stock markets dipped following the data, with the Shanghai Composite down around 0.8%. European markets are also set for an underwhelming start to the new week. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now. Also coming up today The International Monetary Fund is publishing its latest assessment of the global economy this afternoon. We also get new eurozone trade stats and US retail sales figures. Investors will be watching Helsinki, as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin hold a summit. The meeting comes just days after 12 Russian military intelligence officials were indicted for allegedly trying to hack the Democratic party\u2019s emails and computer networks during the 2016 election campaign. Trump has given European leaders fresh cause for alarm, declaring that the EU is a \u201cfoe\u201d given how it trades with America. Plus, there\u2019s always Brexit. Overnight, Conservative MP and former minister Justine Greening has called for a second referendum, creating yet another headache for Theresa May ahead of more crunch votes in parliament this week.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Who\u2019s afraid of Jeremy Corbyn? The board of John Laing Infrastructure Fund (JLIF), which invests in trains, hospitals, schools, police stations and so on, seems to be. It is \u201cminded to recommend\u201d a takeover offer at 142.5p, or \u00a31.45bn, a price it surely would have rejected without a second thought last September when JLIF\u2019s shares stood at 139p. JLIF\u2019s decision to smile upon the joint approach from Dalmore Capital and Equitix Investment Management owes much to the political heat around PFI projects, which comprise the bulk of the group\u2019s portfolio. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, described PFI as a \u201cwaste of taxpayer money\u201d at Labour\u2019s party conference last year and said he wanted to nationalise. JLIF said soon afterwards that it would expect to get only 86% of book value if all of its 57 PFI contracts were taken back into public control. Confidence in PFI was further dented when Carillion collapsed in the new year. In this unpromising climate, JLIF\u2019s shares fell as low as 110p in April and were only 118p at the end of last week. That explains the board\u2019s willingness to talk to Dalmore and Equitix. On a bald calculation, the bidders are offering a 20% premium to the share price. They are also offering more than the book value of the assets \u2013about 130p, according to City analysts\u2019 latest estimates \u2013 which will have been a key consideration. If the stock market is not willing to shoulder the political risks, the scope to raise equity for expansion is limited. Thus the decision to talk to the would-be bidders looks simultaneously timid and logical. The interesting question is why Dalmore and Equitix spy value where others see danger. Perhaps they think Corbyn will never reach Downing Street. Perhaps, as big investors in projects such as the Thames Tideway \u201csuper sewer\u201d and the HS1 rail link, they think they are too big to be pushed around. Or perhaps, since they are managing money for a lot of pension funds and local authorities, they think a future Labour government wouldn\u2019t bite too hard in practice. Whatever the explanation, this situation is odd. Stock markets are giving up on infrastructure and anything vaguely related to PFI. Yet private pools of capital, including pension fund money, are gung ho for more. Even allowing for different investment horizons, both camps can\u2019t be right. Wishy-washy formula The UK corporate governance code, it could be said, is an exercise in pointing out to boards what should have been obvious to them in the first place. Still, we should raise a small cheer that the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the guardian of the code, is introducing what could be called a \u201cPersimmon clause\u201d that would give remuneration committees powers to override \u201cformulaic outcomes\u201d. If such an arrangement had been in place at the housebuilder, the chief executive Jeff Fairburn\u2019s \u00a3100m jackpot via a share-based scheme could have been cut down automatically to a less ridiculous size. As it was, Persimmon\u2019s board had failed to put a cap on potential rewards and found itself begging Fairburn and a couple of his colleagues to be less greedy. The chairman and the chair of the pay committee resigned in shame or embarrassment. The FRC\u2019s new stricture may prevent similar fiascos in future. Other reforms to be welcomed include the command that boards \u201cshould take into account workforce remuneration\u201d and that executive directors\u2019 pensions contributions \u201cshould be aligned with those available to the workforce\u201d. Yes, there ought to be limits to how far a company can pretend its executive directors inhabit a different universe on pay, although implementation is obviously everything. In that context, it\u2019s a shame that the reformed code, while talking a lot about the need for listed companies to have a \u201cpurpose\u201d, left it wholly open to boards to decide how to take account of the views of staff and outsiders. The least demanding method is to designate a non-executive director to \u201cengage\u201d with stakeholders. It\u2019s what the government, after abandoning its bullish talk about worker representation, signalled it wanted. But, come on, the formula is wishy-washy in the extreme. Elon Musk\u2019s fan club must be concerned Is Elon Musk\u2019s fan club getting worried? It should be. In recent weeks, the Tesla billionaire has taken angry shots at Wall Street analysts and the press, while sounding more interested in his space adventures than the earthly pursuit of ramping up the production of electric cars. Now Musk has made a baseless allegation against a British cave diver involved in the Thailand rescue. One hopes the diver, Vernon Unsworth, sues. Tesla investors may wish the same. If unchecked, the founder\u2019s erratic behaviour could be a long-term danger to their wealth.",

It is \u201cminded to recommend\u201d a takeover offer at 142.5p, or \u00a31.45bn, a price it surely would have rejected without a second thought last September when JLIF\u2019s shares stood at 139p.</p> <p>JLIF\u2019s decision to smile upon the joint approach from Dalmore Capital and Equitix Investment Management owes much to the political heat around PFI projects, which comprise the bulk of the group\u2019s portfolio. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-labour-would-bring-pfi-contracts-back-in-house\">described</a> PFI as a \u201cwaste of taxpayer money\u201d at Labour\u2019s party conference last year and said he wanted to nationalise. JLIF said soon afterwards that it would expect to get only 86% of book value if all of its 57 PFI contracts were taken back into public control. Confidence in PFI was further dented when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carillion\">Carillion collapsed</a> in the new year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/16/senior-executives-face-clampdown-selling-share-awards\">Senior executives face clampdown on selling share awards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this unpromising climate, JLIF\u2019s shares fell as low as 110p in April and were only 118p at the end of last week. That explains the board\u2019s willingness to talk to Dalmore and Equitix. On a bald calculation, the bidders are offering a 20% premium to the share price. They are also offering more than the book value of the assets \u2013about 130p, according to City analysts\u2019 latest estimates \u2013 which will have been a key consideration. If the stock market is not willing to shoulder the political risks, the scope to raise equity for expansion is limited. Thus the decision to talk to the would-be bidders looks simultaneously timid and logical.</p> <p>The interesting question is why Dalmore and Equitix spy value where others see danger. Perhaps they think Corbyn will never reach Downing Street. Perhaps, as big investors in projects such as the Thames Tideway \u201csuper sewer\u201d and the HS1 rail link, they think they are too big to be pushed around. Or perhaps, since they are managing money for a lot of pension funds and local authorities, they think a future Labour government wouldn\u2019t bite too hard in practice.</p> <p>Whatever the explanation, this situation is odd. Stock markets are giving up on infrastructure and anything vaguely related to PFI. Yet private pools of capital, including pension fund money, are gung ho for more. Even allowing for different investment horizons, both camps can\u2019t be right.</p> <h2>Wishy-washy formula</h2> <p>The UK corporate governance code, it could be said, is an exercise in pointing out to boards what should have been obvious to them in the first place. Still, we should raise a small cheer that the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the guardian of the code, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/16/senior-executives-face-clampdown-selling-share-awards\">is introducing</a> what could be called a \u201cPersimmon clause\u201d that would give remuneration committees powers to override \u201cformulaic outcomes\u201d.</p> <p>If such an arrangement had been in place at the housebuilder, the chief executive Jeff Fairburn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/25/persimmon-investors-revolt-bonus-pay-vote\">\u00a3100m jackpot via a share-based scheme</a> could have been cut down automatically to a less ridiculous size. As it was, Persimmon\u2019s board had failed to put a cap on potential rewards and found itself begging Fairburn and a couple of his colleagues to be less greedy. The chairman and the chair of the pay committee resigned in shame or embarrassment. The FRC\u2019s new stricture may prevent similar fiascos in future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up&quot;\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other reforms to be welcomed include the command that boards \u201cshould take into account workforce remuneration\u201d and that executive directors\u2019 pensions contributions \u201cshould be aligned with those available to the workforce\u201d. Yes, there ought to be limits to how far a company can pretend its executive directors inhabit a different universe on pay, although implementation is obviously everything.</p> <p>In that context, it\u2019s a shame that the reformed code, while talking a lot about the need for listed companies to have a \u201cpurpose\u201d, left it wholly open to boards to decide how to take account of the views of staff and outsiders. The least demanding method is to designate a non-executive director to \u201cengage\u201d with stakeholders.

      "bodyText": "The latest housing finance figures pour yet more cold water on suggestions that the Reserve Bank might increase interest rates. There are no signs of an economy that needs slowing down, and if anything the economy is performing in a way that in previous times would have had the RBA looking to cut rates. Next month, when (I guess we should say \u201cif\u201d, but, really we can almost certainly say \u201cwhen\u201d) the Reserve Bank keeps the cash rate at 1.5% it will mark two years of no changes. The last time the RBA moved the cash rate was August 2016 when it cut the rate from 1.75% to the current record low. Over the past few months a chorus of \u201cvery serious people\u201d have been stroking their chins and calling for the cash rate to be raised because ... well, just because. The notional reason is that 1.5% is well below the \u201cneutral rate\u201d of 3.5% and the sooner we get back there the better because should things turn bad in the world economy the current rate doesn\u2019t leave the RBA with much room to move, and other nations have already begun raising their rates. But really, so what? Yes, other nations, such as the USA and Canada, have been raising their official interest rates this year, but they were coming off a much lower base than ours. And both countries (and generally all other major economies) continue to have interest rates much lower than the in the pre-GFC era: And while it is nice to think about our interest rate in terms of what other nations might be doing and what might occur in the world economy, the reality is our own economy has zero need for an interest rate rise. Inflation and wage growth are barely registering a pulse, and using the proxy of the difference between Australian government indexed bond yields and the 10-year bond yield, the expectation for inflation remains well below anything that would have you thinking the RBA needs to apply the brakes: And it\u2019s a reminder that raising the cash rate does slow the economy. And the one area it slows things most directly is already doing well enough on its own. The latest housing finance data showed that for the 11th straight month, the total value of housing finance commitments fell in trend terms. The last time that happened outside of the GFC was in 2007-08 when the RBA was raising the cash rate by a full percentage point. Lending in May was 6.1% below 12 months ago, driven largely by a 14.3% fall in investor lending. But even the value of owner-occupier housing finance was just 0.9% above that of May last year \u2013 the lowest 12 month growth since the end of 2016: The flee of investors from the housing market is clear when we look at total numbers. In December 2016, there was $13bn worth of investor-housing finance taken out. Since then it has fallen each month to now being just $10.7bn \u2013 the lowest monthly amount for nearly five years: Clearly the macroprudential tools brought in by the Apra \u2013 such as limiting the growth rate of investor credit \u2013 have worked. And the whole point of such tools is to allow the RBA to keep interest rates lower than otherwise would be the case. The limits on investor lending help curb the growth of house prices even when interest rates are at levels that in past times would have seen a housing boom. Does that mean your mortgage rates won\u2019t be going up any time soon? Well, alas no. There is the possibility that banks will start raising rates independent of the RBA because of a recent increase in the cost of short-term financing. In the past few months, for reasons that are not entirely clear \u2013 but I\u2019ll bet a few dollars on the possibility of Trump wanting to declare a trade war on the entire planet as a factor \u2013 the cost of banks\u2019 short-term debt has risen sharply. So sharply has it risen that it is back at levels not seen since the chaos days of the GFC: This however is not as big of an issue as back then, because before the GFC banks were using cheap short-term debt to cover about 35% of their finance, now it accounts for around only 20%. By contrast, back then, domestic deposits (ie money we give the banks for which they pay us interest) only took up 40% of their funding, now it is 60%. And because the interest rates people are getting for their term deposits has actually fallen on average during the period the RBA has kept the cash rate steady, the cost of such funding has fallen over the past two years: And we should always remember that the gap between the standard variable rate and the cash rate is much larger than it was 10 years ago, and that banks have not cut their rates by as much as has the RBA over the past five years: But even if the increase in short-term funding costs did force banks to raise their own mortgage rates, that would actually if anything put pressure on the RBA to cut rates to counteract that rise, should it believe those rises are slowing the economy by more than it likes. It\u2019s why there is absolutely no expectation of a rate rise in the future. At the start of the year the market was pricing in two cash rate rises by the middle of next year; by April the expectation was for one rate rise by July next year; last month that had been pushed out to October. Now the market rates there being barely a 50% chance of a cash rate rise happening by December 2019: So forget the calls for rate rises and worries about \u201cneutral rates\u201d or what the USA is doing. Until we start to see inflation and wages getting close to normal levels, the RBA is unlikely to feel any need to move \u2013 especially if the housing market continues to slow as it has this year.

      "bodyText": "Rising trade tensions between the United States and the rest of the world could cost the global economy $430bn (\u00a3324bn), with America \u201cespecially vulnerable\u201d to an escalating tariff war, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Delivering a sharp rebuke for Donald Trump, the Washington-based organisation said the current threats made by the US and its trading partners risked lowering global growth by as much as 0.5% by 2020, or about $430bn in lost GDP worldwide. Although all economies would suffer from further escalation, the US would find itself \u201cas the focus of global retaliation\u201d with a relatively higher share of its exports taxed in global markets. \u201cIt is therefore especially vulnerable,\u201d the fund said. Trump raised the stakes in his mounting trade dispute with China last week by proposing 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods entering the country, on top of $34bn of tariffs that were officially imposed on Beijing at the beginning of the month. The Chinese government, which hit back at the first wave of US tariffs with similar measures, was quick to warn of further retaliation on Monday. The US president also rattled European leaders by labelling the EU one of his greatest \u201cfoes\u201d over trade, while leaving behind a trail of political chaos in Britain from his visit last week. Issuing its latest World Economic Outlook report on Monday amid the rising tensions, the IMF said there were greater risks emerging for the global economy since its last assessment in the spring. Although world growth remains strong, the expansion is \u201cbecoming less even, and risks to the outlook are mounting\u201d, it said. Warning that the broad expansion for the world economy that began about two years ago has plateaued, Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said: \u201cCountries must resist inward-looking thinking and remember that on a range of problems of common interest, multilateral cooperation is vital.\u201d Beyond the immediate threat from weaker levels of international trade, the IMF said greater use of protectionist measures could hinder business investment, disrupt global supply chains, slow the spread of productivity-boosting technologies and raise the price of consumer goods. Despite highlighting greater risks for the world economy, the fund left its global growth forecast of 3.9% for both this year and next unchanged. However, it unveiled sharp slowdowns for the EU, UK and Japan amid weaker growth and increasing political tension. Growth in the UK this year is forecast to slow to 1.4%, compared with an estimate of 1.6% made in April, as a consequence of weaker economic growth in the first quarter of 2018. The British economy ground to a halt in March amid freezing weather and heavy snowfall, although has since staged a modest rebound. The fund also highlighted the risk attached to Westminster and Brussels failing to make further progress on the terms of Brexit, despite several months of negotiations between the two sides. Germany, France and Italy were among European nations receiving the sharpest downgrades for growth this year, of as much as 0.3% compared with forecasts made in April, amid rising political risks in the single currency area triggered by the Italian election earlier this year. Growth across the eurozone this year is forecast to slow to 2.2%, compared with an earlier forecast for an expansion of 2.4%. The IMF said China would continue to grow at the slower rates it forecast back in April, of about 6.6% this year. While the US faces greater risks from trade, the fund said Trump\u2019s tax cuts would also mean the American economy continuing to grow in line with its previous estimates, of around 2.4% this year. The Japanese economy is forecast to cool to 1%, marking the slowest growth rate among advanced nations \u2013 a downgrade of 0.2% \u2013 following weak private consumption and investment in the first quarter of the year. The IMF also warned of risks as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates. Alongside the threat of greater trade disputes, Obstfeld said: \u201cFinancial markets seem broadly complacent in the face of these contingencies.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has plans for a new wave of job cuts, with more than 300 posts to go in stores around the country, according to documents seen by the Guardian. The high street chain, which last week warned that its decision to close 100 stores would not necessarily be the end of its attempts to restructure, has been consulting on redundancies among managers in a bid to streamline its business. The embattled retailer has already announced a series of job losses this year, with the closure of a distribution centre in Warrington adding to redundancies from stores being shut. Along with other high street retailers, Marks &amp; Spencer has been hit by the move to online shopping together with higher costs, including business rates, at a time of falling consumer spending. In May, it reported a steep fall in annual profits and said clothes and food sales had fallen. A bill of \u00a3514.1m for restructuring the business put further pressure on its earnings. The new redundancies follow a review of the company\u2019s set-up, which found inconsistent management structures in similar stores and overlapping management roles. Other major British retailers, including Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco, have made similar moves to reduce management roles in their stores as they try to keep a lid on costs in a very competitive market. The consultation documents seen by the Guardian state that while sales activity across Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s stores had fallen by 7.5% over the past two years, management costs had risen. \u201cThis has contributed to reducing store profitability, impacting on our ability to trade our existing stores and open future stores viably,\u201d the documents read. In response, 351 redundancies have been proposed across a range of roles. The retailer said it planned to reduce store, commercial and operations managers by 115 and to make redundant 182 section managers in the same sectors of the business. On top of these, it would reduce the number of visual managers, who prepare store displays, by 54. M&amp;S confirmed the proposals and said the affected staff had been told. A spokeswoman said: \u201cM&amp;S is transforming and this is a tough but necessary decision to take to ensure our stores support the future of the business and provide the best service for our customers.\u201d Last week, the company\u2019s chairman, Archie Norman, gave a stark warning to shareholders attending the M&amp;S annual general meeting, saying the business was \u201con a burning platform\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Plans to slash the fees paid by banks to cash machine operators have been scaled back after they prompted fears of ATM \u201cdeserts\u201d appearing in parts of the UK. The U-turn came less than a month after Link, the UK\u2019s largest cash machine network, began a phased reduction in \u201cinterchange\u201d fees, with cuts of 5% a year planned until 2021. The cuts would have saved banks millions of pounds in charges, but after an outcry from campaigners and concerns from regulators, they were partially abandoned. A third reduction in fees, due in January 2020, has been cancelled, while the fourth, scheduled for January 2021, has been put under review. However, the next planned cut in June 2019 will still go ahead. Link\u2019s chief executive, John Howells, said: \u201cLink is committed to maintaining the UK\u2019s extensive coverage of free-to-use cash machines for many years to come. \u201cHowever, many consumers are turning to alternatives to cash more quickly than expected, and usage of ATMs is now dropping at 6% per annum. Link will therefore adjust interchange to maintain free-to-use coverage in line with our commitments to the public and to our participants.\u201d In June, Which? revealed cash machines around the UK are closing at a rate of 300 a month, with rural communities worst affected. The dramatic increase in contactless payments for small transactions is making cash less necessary, but Which? said the planned fee cut was making it more difficult for independent operators to survive. Link, which is largely controlled by major high street banks, has also come under pressure from the Payment Systems Regulator to maintain a viable ATM network. In a statement, the regulator said: \u201cWe welcome Link\u2019s announcement, which gives us further assurances that it is committed to making sure communities do not lose their free-to-use ATMs. \u201cFrom the very start, we said that any reduction to the interchange fee must be made incrementally, and only after the impact of the previous change had been considered properly. \u201cWe said that it was really important the Link board carefully reviews its decisions on interchange fees to reflect changing market conditions and demand for cash, and change course if needed. Link\u2019s announcement shows that our approach was the right one.\u201d The UK has about 70,000 ATMs, and more than 97% of withdrawals are from free-to-use machines. But since June, the fee paid by banks for each withdrawal has fallen from 25p to 24p, the first stage in the phased reduction to 20p. While the cuts may appear small, independent cash machine operators that run many machines in convenience stores in remote locations said they were likely to make many ATMs unprofitable.",

      "body": "<p>Plans to slash the fees paid by banks to cash machine operators have been scaled back after they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/01/free-to-use-link-cash-machines-atm-deserts-uk\">prompted fears of ATM \u201cdeserts\u201d</a> appearing in parts of the UK.</p> <p>The U-turn came less than a month after Link, the UK\u2019s largest cash machine network, began a phased reduction in \u201cinterchange\u201d fees, with cuts of 5% a year planned until 2021. </p> <p>The cuts would have saved banks millions of pounds in charges, but after an outcry from campaigners and concerns from regulators, they were partially abandoned. </p> <p>A third reduction in fees, due in January 2020, has been cancelled, while the fourth, scheduled for January 2021, has been put under review. However, the next planned cut in June 2019 will still go ahead. </p> <p>Link\u2019s chief executive, John Howells, said: <em>\u201c</em>Link is committed to maintaining the UK\u2019s extensive coverage of free-to-use cash machines for many years to come. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, many consumers are turning to alternatives to cash more quickly than expected, and usage of ATMs is now dropping at 6% per annum. Link will therefore adjust interchange to maintain free-to-use coverage in line with our commitments to the public and to our participants.\u201d<br></p> <p>In June, Which? revealed cash machines around the UK are closing at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/29/hundreds-of-cash-machines-close-as-uk-turns-to-contactless-payments\">rate of 300 a month</a>, with rural communities worst affected.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/19/peak-cash-over-uk-rise-of-debit-cards-unbanked-contactless-payments\">dramatic increase in contactless payments</a> for small transactions is making cash less necessary, but Which? said the planned fee cut was making it more difficult for independent operators to survive.</p> <p>Link, which is largely controlled by major high street banks, has also come under pressure from the Payment Systems Regulator to maintain a viable ATM network. </p> <p>In a statement, the regulator said: \u201cWe welcome Link\u2019s announcement, which gives us further assurances that it is committed to making sure communities do not lose their free-to-use ATMs.<br></p> <p>\u201cFrom the very start, we said that any reduction to the interchange fee must be made incrementally, and only after the impact of the previous change had been considered properly. </p> <p>\u201cWe said that it was really important the Link board carefully reviews its decisions on interchange fees to reflect changing market conditions and demand for cash, and change course if needed. Link\u2019s announcement shows that our approach was the right one.\u201d</p> <p>The UK has about 70,000 ATMs, and more than 97% of withdrawals are from free-to-use machines. But since June, the fee paid by banks for each withdrawal has fallen from 25p to 24p, the first stage in the phased reduction to 20p.</p> <p>While the cuts may appear small, independent cash machine operators that run many machines in convenience stores in remote locations said they were likely to make many ATMs unprofitable.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China has filed a complaint against the US at the World Trade Organization after Donald Trump\u2019s threats to place tariffs on an additional $200bn (\u00a3150bn) worth of Chinese goods. The one-sentence announcement by the ministry of commerce comes less than a week after the US president called for a second round of tariffs on China, in retaliation for Chinese tariffs placed on American goods. On 6 July, the US imposed 25% tariffs on $34bn in Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to hit back with levies on the same amount of US exports to China. In response, the White House last week released a wide-ranging list of Chinese goods, from tobacco to pet food, worth $200bn it would target with a 10% tariffs. Beijing said it would \u201cfight back as usual\u201d and would file a complaint with the WTO. The latest round of tariffs would not come into effect until September, making China\u2019s response uncharacteristically quick. Up to now Beijing has waited for Washington to \u201cfire the first shot\u201d in the escalating trade war. Chinese economic data on Monday fanned fears that trade frictions between the two countries may soon have an impact on the world\u2019s second largest economy. China\u2019s $12.5tn economy expanded 6.7% in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. It was in line with expectations but was modest by recent Chinese standards. The FTSE 100 index was down just over 1% by lunchtime in London on Monday. In Asian trading, MSCI\u2019s index of Asia Pacific shares except for Japan fell 0.36%, while mainland Chinese stocks, already among the world\u2019s worst performing this year, fell 0.6%. Mao Shengyong, a spokesman for China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said the economy\u2019s growth was stable, but added: \u201cThe uncertainties of the external environment are mounting. \u201cGenerally speaking, trade frictions unilaterally started by the US will have an impact on the economy of both countries.\u201d In total, the US has threatened to place tariffs on more than $500bn worth of Chinese goods to the US, an amount that Beijing cannot reciprocate. US exports to China last year were worth about $130bn. Some US business groups worry the disparity will push Beijing to hit back with \u201cqualitative measures\u201d such as delaying approvals for inward investments into China, extra customs inspections for goods or boycotts of American brands. The trade war is not the only potential drag on China\u2019s economy. Over the last few years the Chinese government has launched a campaign to reduce financial risk by tightening lending and reining in excess debt. Analysts say that has led to a broader slowdown. Factory output in June fell to a two-year low. The country also faces a slowing property market and slower-than-expected domestic consumption. Retail spending rose 9% in June, half a percentage point higher than the month before. \u201cUncertainty about the scale and composition of US tariffs on China\u2019s exports is already dampening business confidence and delaying investment,\u201d Louis Kuijs, the head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said in a note. \u201cIf the US and China do not resume talks in the next two months or so, the conflict will escalate further, with major economic implications for themselves and the global economy.\u201d Despite the slowdown, China\u2019s monthly trade surplus with the US hit a record high in June, widening to $29bn, from $24.6 in May. For the first half of this year, Chinese exports to the US were 13.6% higher. China has repeatedly said it can weather a trade war better than the US but the prospect of tariffs on as much as $500bn of Chinese goods has worried investors and businesses. Forecasters say if the first US round of tariffs, implemented on 6 July, is expanded to cover another $200bn of goods as Trump has threatened, China\u2019s economy could lose 0.4 percentage points, according to HSBC estimates.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global workforces will fall as the next industrial revolution gets under way, the head of one of Germany\u2019s biggest firms has warned, unless workers are retrained with new skills. Joe Kaeser, global chief executive of the engineering giant Siemens, said up to almost a third of jobs could be lost as the transition from combustion engines to electric cars takes place over the next decade, in what will be \u201cone of the single most important transformations of all time\u201d. Speaking over the weekend at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Kaeser said it would be a key challenge for industry leaders to build the car of the future responsibly and get the transformation right, because ultimately many traditional roles will disappear in the short-term. \u201cIt may cause quite a dip in employment, because if you have 20-30 less value chain, then \u2026 you have 20%-30% fewer jobs. That is how it has been in the first three industrial revolutions. There has always been a significant change in employment. And then by enabling growth, it actually turned out that more jobs were created. Higher growth was achieved and obviously more people moved out of poverty and had better lives. \u201cSo the first three worked very well and now we\u2019re on the verge of the fourth industrial revolution which will obviously affect manufacturing massively as it accounts for 70% of global GDP.\u201d Kaesar said it would be up to governments and business to find a solution to the challenges that advances in technology would create, including the retraining of workers whose skills would no longer be relevant. \u201cThe social and economic impact of digitalisation is going to be massive. The least efficient part of the value chain, the middle man, will be cut out. Unfortunately the least efficient part of the value chain is human beings so someone has to do something about the fall out,\u201d he said. \u201cPreferably governments and business would retrain together. Governments need to set the framework and the private sector needs to fill it with content.\u201d Siemens, which employs more than 370,000 people globally and 15,000 in the UK, is already spending \u20ac500m a year on retraining and qualifications, with plans to invest more, Kaeser said. Earlier this year Siemens announced plans to invest \u00a3200m and create hundreds of jobs in a new UK train factory in Goole, east Yorkshire, to service contracts including HS2 and London Underground. The Munich-based firm has had British operations for more than 170 years and currently operates 14 factories serving local demand in the UK, which is Siemens\u2019 fourth largest market behind the US, Germany and China. It has also chosen Hull as its European and global hub for renewable energy, making wind turbines. Kaeser said he was satisfied that Theresa May was seeking a practical outcome in Brexit negotiations, and that Siemens remained committed to the UK. He said the German firm was early and fast to seek dialogue with the UK government a couple of weeks after the referendum. \u201cFrom what I think I see, the perception is that the government and the prime minister are trying to find a way to make it work. You look for the 70/30 solution, so you try to get 70% right. You\u2019re still missing 30%, but you get something done. If you wait for 100% it might never get done, because who gets 100%?\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important that government provides a view on what they\u2019re trying to achieve and then we can make up our minds on what that means for us. We are reasonably satisfied with the dialogue we have with the government and the political leadership.\u201d Kaeser, who met Donald Trump in Davos in January, said he had been surprised and alarmed by the pace of the escalating trade tensions between the US and its major trading partners. \u201cIf you start something and let it out of the box, it\u2019s often hard to get it back in. That\u2019s what I\u2019m most concerned about. [It could lead to] nationalism and protectionism. \u201cIt should be a concern for every responsible citizen of this planet. How do we avoid the further splitting of our societies?\u201d Kaeser said trade wars had no place in the digital future, where data flowed freely and there were no boundaries. New relationship with EU will secure millions of jobs \u2013 Theresa May Britain\u2019s new relationship with the EU will secure millions of aviation jobs and strengthen Britain\u2019s position as a leading aerospace nation, Theresa May will say on Monday. Opening the 2018 Farnborough International Airshow, the prime minister will say the UK is at the forefront of civil aviation, as she announces \u00a3343m of research funding to support new technology such as greener planes. \u201cI want us to build on [our leading position in aerospace] and ensure not only that we retain our prominence, but that in an increasingly competitive industry we make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead.\u201d A spokesman for Airbus, the European aerospace giant that has publicly called for more clarity on Brexit, responded: \u201cWe welcome the commitment and personal endorsement of our sector from the prime minister and this is a reflection of the importance of aerospace in the UK.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on 16 July 2018 to clarify the impact on jobs of the next industrial revolution in the first paragraph",

That is how it has been in the first three industrial revolutions. There has always been a significant change in employment. And then by enabling growth, it actually turned out that more jobs were created. Higher growth was achieved and obviously more people moved out of poverty and had better lives.</p> <p>\u201cSo the first three worked very well and now we\u2019re on the verge of the fourth industrial revolution which will obviously affect manufacturing massively as it accounts for 70% of global GDP.\u201d</p> <p>Kaesar said it would be up to governments and business to find a solution to the challenges that advances in technology would create, including the retraining of workers whose skills would no longer be relevant.</p> <p>\u201cThe social and economic impact of digitalisation is going to be massive. The least efficient part of the value chain, the middle man, will be cut out.

      "bodyText": "Art educators who allege they have been sacked by the National Gallery, many after decades of service, are bringing their cases to an employment tribunal in the latest legal row over the gig economy. A group of 27 artists and art lecturers who worked in the building overlooking Trafalgar Square in London, are claiming unfair dismissal and seeking to be recognised as employees rather than freelancers. Lawyers for the claimants will on Monday argue in a preliminary hearing that they suffered age and sex discrimination, should have been fully consulted and are entitled to retrospective holiday pay. The educators welcome school tours and members of the public, giving talks, workshops and information about the history of the institution and the works of art on display. James Heard, the longest-serving claimant who worked there for 45 years, said: \u201cWe are standing up for fair treatment for staff in the arts, and to protect the teaching expertise at the heart of our museums. Our national galleries are something the UK is extremely proud of and it is vital that the educators who hold the collective knowledge of these places are properly protected.\u201d Most recent test cases on employment status have related to private sector firms such as Uber, Deliveroo and Pimlico Plumbers. The National Gallery, the educators say, demonstrates that exploitation also exists in the state sector. The National Gallery said: \u201cIt is our understanding that the claims have arisen out of the Gallery\u2019s wish to change from offering ad hoc work to offering more secure employment, with additional pension and worker benefits. This change reflects the Gallery\u2019s strategy to develop our programmes to increasingly reach new audiences and make the most of digital technology to widen our engagement.\u201d While insisting they were freelancers, the gallery paid them through a taxed PAYE system, gave them official\u2019s badges, trained them, subjected them to regular appraisals, provided offices and access to the staff canteen, according to the claimants. In effect, it is alleged, they were employees. Of the 27, most have been dismissed. Seven are now working, under protest, on less well-paid staff or casual contracts. Their treatment is said to be typical of many in the underfunded museum and galleries sector. The claimants have set up a page on the crowdfunding website CrowdJustice to raise funds for their legal claim. Jo Lewis, who has worked for the National Gallery for 16 years, said: \u201cWe are asking for our longstanding contribution to the National Gallery to be recognised and valued. We are asserting our rights as employees, and at a minimum as \u2018workers\u2019.\u201d Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Ross, a claimant who worked for the National Gallery for 22 years, said: \u201cWe love the gallery and recognise its importance in artistic and cultural education. However, despite our attempts to raise our concerns with the gallery, we as a group have not been given the rights to which we believe we are entitled.\u201d Marie van der Zyl, a solicitor at the law firm Gordon Dadds LLP which is representing them, said: \u201cIndividuals working in the arts are in need of certainty surrounding their employment rights and it\u2019s essential to ensure they are categorised correctly.\u201d The National Gallery also stated: \u201cThe entire group were consulted for their views together and individually over the change for a period of three months between October 2017 and January 2018. These jobs were offered to all of our existing freelance service providers last year. We still have vacancies which are available, although unfortunately not all of the group have expressed an interest in these. \u201cThe Gallery is not yet in receipt of the details of each complaint, but believes that we have acted both lawfully and fairly in changing our service provision to one of secure employment.\u201d",
