      "bodyText": "Your article (Tainted Tucker at head of queue for Bank job, 8 October) speculates on the shortlist for the next governor of the Bank of England from which George Osborne will make his pick over the next month or so. It is generally accepted that the financial services bill, now going through parliament, will make this governor the most powerful in the history of our country, with wide-ranging powers and responsibilities to determine the future of our financial system and economic policy-making. Yet this appointment remains in the hands of one man, the chancellor of the exchequer. At the behest of the chancellor, Conservative backbench backwoodsmen have blocked my bill requiring the consent of parliament to this appointment, which was sponsored by a cross-party group of senior MPs. To have the authority to drive through the effective reform of our financial system, the new governor will need to show he or she has the confidence of all parties and beyond. Leaving this critical appointment solely in the hands of the chancellor risks tainting the new governorship from the outset with allegations of political bias or cronyism. John McDonnell MP Lab, Hayes and Harlington \u2022\u2008If Sharon Bowles gets the job of governor of the Bank of England, I hope she won't bow to the influence of financial lobbyists and perpetuate the \"light touch\" approach to financial regulation that allowed the financial crisis to happen (Lib Dem MEP is surprise applicant for Bank governor, 10 October). Unfortunately, her track record does not point in this direction. According to her website, in the first seven months of 2012, she had 29 meetings with financial sector lobbyists. Meanwhile, she refused to have a single meeting with members of the 11 World Development Movement groups in her south-east England constituency who wanted to discuss regulation to prevent financial speculation driving up food prices. In 2010 her party stated: \"We cannot build an economy on financial gambling. Radical reform of the financial infrastructure is needed.\" But Bowles has continued to defend unbridled speculation on the price of food and other commodities. With the Bank of England due to take on a more significant role in supervising financial markets from next year, the City might welcome her appointment, but the recruitment committee should think twice. Deborah Doane Director, World Development Movement \u2022\u2008Simon Jenkins is wrong to accuse economists of intellectual failure; what they have been guilty of is intellectual cowardice (We need an iconoclast to lead the Bank of England, 10 October). It is beyond comprehension that economists could not have foreseen the dire consequences of the speculative boom in property etc in the years prior to 2009. I cannot recall one who spoke against the folly of 125% mortgages. They all preferred to keep their heads below the parapet and not criticise the prevailing neoliberal economic consensus and not put at risk their chances of academic preferment.

      "bodyText": "Greece's biggest company, Coca-Cola Hellenic, is pulling out of the near-bankrupt country and seeking refuge by listing on the London stock exchange. The \u20ac5.7bn (\u00a34.6bn) company, which bottles Coke in 28 countries from Russia to Nigeria, said it would move its headquarters to Switzerland and hopes to list its shares on the FTSE 100 in London. Coca-Cola Hellenic, which makes up a fifth of the Athens stock market, said it was ditching Greece after credit rating agencies downgraded the company's rating following the country's downgrade deeper into \"junk\" status. The firm, which is 23%-owned by Coca-Cola, hopes switching to London will rid it of the \"Greek discount\", which has depressed the shares because many international investors are afraid of putting money into the debt-ridden country. Dimitris Lois, the chief executive, said listing in London would \"give us greater recognition among international investors, will increase the liquidity of our stock and improve our access to the international equity and debt markets.\" Lois said leaving Greece made \"clear business sense\" because 95% of the company's operations and nearly all its investors were outside the country, with 16% of sales coming from Russia, 15% in Italy and 9% in Nigeria. In a statement, Lois said he hoped the company would be able to join the FTSE 100 index of the UK's biggest companies. CCH's market value of \u00a34.6m would, in theory, make it Britain's 74th-biggest company, just ahead of British Land. The announcement \u2013 a heavy blow to the Greek treasury as CCH is among the nation's biggest taxpayers \u2013 came on the day official figures showed Greek tax revenues fell \u20ac1.3bn short of the target set by the Troika of international lenders in the bailout agreement. Analysts said Greece's high corporation taxes, which can reach 45%, were likely to have been a big factor in CCH's decision. A spokesman for the company said: \"The move is very much tax neutral. Each country market has its own operating company which pays corporate tax in that country. Since the operating company in Athens will remain, the group's overall expected tax rate will remain between 25% and 27%.\" Manos Hatzidakis, an analyst at Beta Securities, said: \"The Greek bourse is losing a very good company and the London Stock Exchange is gaining a very important group. \"It's very bad news for the Greek economy and bourse.\" Because most of its activities are outside Greece, CCH has consistently out-performed the Athens stock market, which has slumped to a 20-year low.

Is the best thing now to turn what's left into cash and end the miserable tale? That's what the Bakries are suggesting in a proposal that, as ever with Bumi, is less than straightforward. In three stages, the Indonesians would buy the assets for $1.2bn (\u00a3750m) in cash plus cancellation of their 23.8% stake in the London-listed company.

The response to the Bakries' proposal was a jump in the price of Bumi shares to 260p. The gap from the theoretical 483p says the proposal is sketchy. Indeed it is: the Bakries don't say how they would finance the deal. And are all parts of the transaction conditional on each other? Bumi shareholders would probably welcome a parting of the ways with the Bakries, which a disposal of the 29% holding in Jakarta-listed Bumi Resources would achieve. But they might wish to persevere with Berau, whose 83% holding implies control, the quality that has been in shortest supply all along. The best policy for the independent directors on the Bumi board led by worthies Sir Julian Horn-Smith, Lord Renwick and Sir Graham Hearne is to treat the proposal seriously. If there is a realistic prospect of getting 483p \u2013 and that's a big \"if\" \u2013 most original investors would probably be happy to take the loss.

The deal, for an undisclosed sum, ends years of uncertainty for Abel and Cole, which nearly went bust at the height of the financial crisis with consumers unwilling to pay premium prices for organic food. It is the second time the founder, Keith Abel, has sold the company in the last five years. William Jackson, a 180-year-old family business, has no plans to lay off any of the 450 staff at Abel and Cole and the company will continue to be run by Abel. He said: \"With our new partners we have the security and stability we need to grow and flourish.

Abel and Cole managed to turn around disastrous losses of \u00a327m in 2010 to underlying profits of \u00a34.6m in the 12 months to August this year. It is the first time William Jackson has ventured into the organic vegetables market and ends an eight-year absence from the retail sector after selling its Jacksons convenience store business to Sainsbury in 2004. Abel started his company in 1988 selling potatoes door-to-door in south London and grew it into a multimillion-pound business worth nearly \u00a340m in 2007. He sold a stake to private equity firm Phoenix that year, but profits plunged and in 2010 control of the business passed to Lloyds Banking Group in a debt-for-equity swap.

    "webTitle": "BAE-EADS: Angela Merkel blamed for collapse of \u00a328bn merger", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) mega-merger between BAE Systems and EADS collapsed as a result of personal opposition from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and despite a series of 11th-hour interventions from Downing Street officials and their counterparts in Paris and Berlin attempting to keep the deal alive. The proposed combination of Britain's largest defence contractor and the Franco-German owner of Airbus would have created a pan-European manufacturing powerhouse with 220,000 employees, making hi-tech products ranging from nuclear submarines and Typhoon fighter jets to the A380 superjumbo. Sources close to the deal said Merkel had become the most significant obstacle to thrashing out an agreement, with No 10 officials participating in frantic high-level discussions on Tuesday night when it became clear that opposition from Germany was in danger of scuppering the deal. \"It [Merkel's opposition] was a key factor in the decision to terminate the talks,\" said the source. Another added that Merkel appeared to be \"philosophically opposed\" to combining a defence business with a civil aerospace company. \"The fundamental problem is that Merkel does not feel comfortable with the deal, full stop.\" The UK, French and German governments all had the power to veto the deal but Berlin's concern over the potential size of the French shareholding in the combined company, as well as disagreements over the location of the group's headquarters, proved to be the deal breaker that could not be resolved by the last-ditch round of phone diplomacy. BAE's chief executive, Ian King, said failure to agree the size of French and German shareholdings was the key factor behind abandoning the deal , ahead of a 5pm deadline set by the UK Takeover Panel. Declining to comment on Merkel's role, he indicated that Paris and Berlin would have to change their stance if the companies ever wanted to attempt a merger in the future. \"Unless European governments completely change their current view, we would not be in a position to resurrect the deal.\" BAE's chairman, Dick Olver, said the UK government had been \"incredibly helpful\" and denied that the failure to pull off the deal had now made BAE vulnerable as a takeover target for other overseas buyers \u2013 despite speculation that a US defence group such as Boeing or Lockheed Martin could now consider an approach for Britain's largest manufacturing employer. The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said the deal \"had to be done on the basis it was in Britain's national interest\" but the two companies had decided it was \"too difficult to progress this project further\". A source close to EADS said David Cameron had been \"really, really interested\" in the merger. \"There was a view that the British would be the biggest problem but that did not turn out to be the case.\" In a joint statement, the companies said they could not resolve state concerns about the deal, with the UK, French and German governments unable to reach agreement. \"It has become clear that the interests of the parties' government stakeholders cannot be adequately reconciled with each other or with the objectives that BAE Systems and EADS established for the merger,\" the statement said. A person close to the negotiations added that while Germany had proved to be the biggest obstacle, there were still differences to resolve between France and the UK that had not been cleared by Tuesday night's flurry of calls, even if there had been more substantial progress between London and Paris. It is understood that every solution proposed drew an objection from one of the three governments. France, which controlled 15% of EADS directly, was unhappy with German demands for the business to have its headquarters in Munich, while Germany was concerned that France could end up with a bigger shareholding in the new business than the 9% it was seeking. The UK, in turn, refused to allow German and French political representatives to sit on the BAE board, as would have been likely under the dual-listed structure envisaged by both companies. The UK's largest trade union, Unite, said a merger would have \"protected the UK's long-term interests\" if it had been accompanied by a jobs guarantee for British employees. BAE employs 37,500 people in the UK and is Britain's largest manufacturing employer. Ian Waddell, a Unite official, said the UK government could secure such a guarantee in future mergers or takeovers by taking an equity stake in BAE. Although the British government has a \"golden share\" in the business, which can block a foreign takeover, it does not control a significant block of shares similar to France's stake in EADS. When their indirect and direct shareholdings are taken together, France and Germany each control 22.35% of EADS. \"It was an unequal negotiation with France and Germany,\" he said. Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP for Wyre and Preston, who organised a petition against the deal signed by 45 MPs, said the deal should never have been promoted due to the threat of French and German political interference. Wallace said the collapse of the merger put the future of BAE boss King, and his board colleagues, at risk. \"The BAE board should now reflect long and hard at what their strategic error could mean for the company's future. If they have put at risk my constituents' jobs and fatally wounded the UK's jewel in the manufacturing crown, then they should consider their position.\"",

      "bodyText": "The head of the International Monetary Fund has called on governments to co-operate to heal a fractured global economy or risk a further slowdown in economic growth. Christine Lagarde warned that only with greater co-operation and courage could governments hope to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. In a speech to the IMF's annual meeting in Tokyo, Lagarde said banking regulators had told her that reforms of the financial system were incomplete and in many cases banks were as unsafe as before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. She said policymakers needed to take immediate action to resolve issues hanging over from the financial crisis. Europe has come under fire for its failure to end the debt crisis in the euro currency union. Leaders in the US and Asia have become frustrated at delays in agreeing measures to bolster Greece, Spain and Portugal. Largarde avoided direct criticism of eurozone leaders but warned that only swift action could end the uncertainty that is hitting economies across the world. The IMF cut its global growth forecast this week for the second time since April. Lagarde said Asian economies had been some of the hardest hit by the slowdown that most analysts believe follows the failure of European leaders to deal with the debt crisis. Lagarde said: \"We expect action and we expect courageous and co-operative action on the part of our members.\" The IMF has expressed frustration with Europe's piecemeal response to its debt crisis and warned that a recent respite in borrowing costs for debt-laden countries such as Spain may prove short-lived unless eurozone leaders come up with a comprehensive and credible plan. Standard &amp; Poor's cut its crdit rating on Spain on Wednesday to a level just above junk territory, and Moody's may soon follow. The IMF itself has come under fire after it admitted in its World Economic Outlook report that officials underestimated the effects of austerity measures on economic growth. The report found that previous estimates that for every \u00a31 of spending cuts the economy shrank by 50p were wrong and the economy shrank by around \u00a31.30 instead. The IMF was a strong supporter of austerity measures adopted by Western countries, including the UK, in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Most countries that adopted austerity programmes have missed their deficit reduction targets after a sharp slowdown in economic growth hit tax revenues and private sector activity. The IMF has U-turned in recent months and urged government to allow their austerity reforms to be planned over a longer period to lessen the impact on growth. The chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to admit next month he has missed at least one of his key deficit reduction targets at his Autumn Statement. He has already announced an extension of the government rolling five-year austerity regime to 2018. Lagarde said she backed the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who argued it was necessary to pursue government spending cuts or risk a backlash from international money markets and a rise in borrowing costs. Oxfam said there was a danger that the IMF's focus on the eurozone risked losing sight of the effects of the economic slowdown on the poorest. \"It's imperative that the poorest countries are not overlooked at this meeting.

S&amp;P said it had lowered the rating on Spain's debts two notches following a slump in its fortunes that meant its recession would be longer and unemployment higher than expected. The agency also cited the increase in social unrest and the probable rise in tensions between central government and the regions. \"The downgrade reflects our view of mounting risks to Spain's public finances, due to rising economic and political pressures,\" said the ratings agency. \"In our view, the capacity of Spain's political institutions (both domestic and multilateral) to deal with the severe challenges posed by the current economic and financial crisis is declining, and therefore, in accordance with our rating methodology, we have lowered the rating by two notches.\" S&amp;P attached a \"negative outlook\" to its rating, a warning of another possible downgrade in the medium term. Rival ratings agency Moody's is considering the situation in Madrid and is expected to issue its own downgrade within days. It is likely to tell investors that Spain's limited scope for improvement means its debt should be considered junk. That would mean many of the world's largest investment funds, including British pension funds, would be forced to sell their loans to Spain. S&amp;P said it would drop the country's debt status one notch further if political support for Madrid's reform agenda weakened. It added that another downgrade would also follow if Spain's borrowing costs reached unsustainable levels or if debt topped 100% of GDP. The rating agency doubts the 17-member euro currency union will support attempts to boost Spain's troubled banking system following dissent from Finland and other countries keen to limit the extent of bailout funds. S&amp;P said the country's debt burden would \"balloon\" without access to EU funds. \"Against the backdrop of a deepening economic recession, we believe that the government's resolve will be repeatedly tested by domestic constituencies that are being adversely affected by its policies,\" S&amp;P said. \"Accordingly, we think the government's room to contain the crisis has diminished.\" Spain's economy is shrinking and its banks are struggling under the weight of a collapsed real estate market.
