      "bodyText": "Investigators are waiting to see if it is safe to enter a smouldering Chevron oil refinery after it was ravaged by fire, sending plumes across the San Francisco bay area and Californian gasoline prices surging. Experts warned it could take months to repair the refinery in Richmond, a 2,900-acre facility which refines about 150,000 gallons of gasoline daily, 15% of the state's daily needs. Monday evening's blaze began in a tower and spread to at least three units used to cool water, prompting hundreds of people to seek treatment for respiratory problems and panic buying at the pumps, raising prices 11% in the bay area. However, initial predictions that prices could exceed $4 per gallon were scaled back because spare capacity in other west coast refineries could fill much, if not all, of the gap. \"There's room in the system to pick up the slack,\" Rob Schlichting of the California Energy Commission told reporters. \"The large jump we saw on Wednesday in prices I think was mostly panic buying.\" Chevron was expected to file a structural engineering and environmental report by Friday specifying how investigators could safely enter the facility. The all-clear would let a team of Chemical Safety Board inspectors \u2013 the same which investigated the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 to begin sifting through the charred equipment of a refinery which opened in 1902. The Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory lists the refinery as one of California's top emitters of toxic chemicals. It has been cited by San Francisco Bay area regulators for violating air regulations 93 times in the past five years, reported AP. The number increased from 15 violations in 2007 to 23 in both 2010 and 2011. After the fire residents besieged legal firms \u2014 queues snaked around blocks \u2014 to register compensation claims. The fire began after vapour ignited but the cause remained unclear. A second, smaller fire erupted on Wednesday. Chevron issued a statement saying it resulted in \"no injuries, presented no immediate threat to the public and was extinguished in minutes.\" The company said the refinery was now partially operating, but did not say how much it was producing, nor the extent of damage and likely duration of repairs. Fixing water cooling units would take time, Richard Kuprewicz, a pipeline safety expert, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"They've got to rebuild them, and that will take a while.

Walker, a 72-year-old who has worked in finance and banking for half a century, will replace Marcus Agius, who resigned following the record breaking \u00a3290m fine slapped on the bank for attempting to manipulate the crucial interest rate benchmark. The appointment of the Cambridge graduate, who began his career in the Treasury and the Bank of England before becoming a regulator, will help to accelerate the search for a new chief executive to replace Bob Diamond, who left abruptly the week after the Libor fine was announced in June. \"My immediate priority, and critical to Barclays' ongoing success, will be the appointment of a new chief executive and I will be fully engaged in that process,\" Walker said in the statement announcing his appointment.

Some \u00a3100,000 of his \u00a3750,000 a year fee for being chairman will be paid in shares and he is committed to working \"no fewer than four days per week\". While Walker began his career in the Treasury and ended up running the former City regulator, the Securities and Investments Board in 1988, he went on to a City career which spanned both retail banking, at Lloyds, and investment banking at Morgan Stanley. Both areas are crucial for Barclays but there is speculation the investment banking arm \u2013 created by Diamond and until recently known as Barclays Capital \u2013 will be scaled back. But Agius signalled that Walker's appointment should quash any ideas that the so-called universal banking model \u2013 combining investment banking and retail banking \u2013 would be broken up. \"He will be taking over at a time when Barclays' universal banking model is delivering a strong performance in difficult markets,\" Agius said. Walker said he was \"looking forward\" to joining Barclays and \"playing my part in taking the company forward after recent events\". \"The UK needs a strong financial services sector and Barclays has a crucial role to play in ensuring that this country has a successful, well-governed banking industry,\" Walker said. His appointment has been cleared by the Financial Services Authority and given tacit approval by the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, who was approached by the Barclays non-executive director Sir John Sunderland, who led the search. Top five shareholder Legal &amp; General Investment Management was supportive, saying the bank had \"engaged and sought\" shareholder views. Repairing relationships with regulators will also be key for Walker after a top FSA official Andrew Bailey told MPs the bank had a reputation for \"gaming\" its regulators. Diamond left after King told Agius that the chief executive no longer had the confidence of his regulators. Walker has handled crisis in the past. In 1985 he was parachuted as chairman into Johnson Matthey Bankers, a bullion firm linked to a coup in Nigeria, which at the time was described as \"the biggest crisis for the Bank of England since the bank failures of 1973 and 1974\".

Knight has dropped his formal resolution to place himself on the board and is happy to see Parker replace David Newlands as chairman immediately rather than next month. And the Parker-led board of directors will be happy for Knight to join their ranks from mid-December without having to undergo the tiresome business of seeking other shareholders' approval. It's all part of an \"open and constructive\" dialogue on strategy, apparently. These \"open\" discussions, however, don't extend to informing the other 75% of shareholders about what's going on.

      "body": "<p>Broadcasters were in the spotlight again, ending among the leading risers in an uncertain FTSE 100.</p> <p><strong>ITV - </strong>which was<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/aug/07/itv-cash-return-ftse-rises\" title=\"\">boosted earlier in the week by talk of a \u00a31.3bn return to shareholders</a> <strong>- </strong>closed 1.95p higher at 83.2p after forecasts of a good advertising performance next month. Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Initial feedback from a major media buyer suggests September has seen a rebound in advertising for ITV. If correct, this supports our view that July and August advertising weakness was caused more by a temporary shift of spending from TV to newspapers to capture Olympic audiences rather than a more negative general stance on advertising. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong>BSkyB</strong> climbed 9p to 752p after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/08/bskyb-sky-sports\" title=\"\">it won an appeal against an Ofcom ruling </a>that it must sell its sports channels to rivals at regulated prices. The move could boost the company's profits, according to analysts at Espirito Santo:</p> <blockquote> Sky may receive a one-off payment of around \u00a325m (2% of 2013's estimated pretax profits) from the escrow account where competitors continued pay the difference between regulated prices and BSkyB's original rate cards. Moreover, Sky may receive an additional \u00a315m incremental wholesale revenues from existing contracts, going forward. </blockquote> <p><strong>BT</strong>, which recently won rights to Premier League football matches, fell 5.4p to 216.3p after the ruling. <strong>Virgin Media</strong> lost 15p to \u00a317.51, although there is the still the prospect of a hearing at the court of appeal.</p> <p>Overall the market celebrated five years since the start of the financial crisis with a modest gain. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 5.59 points higher at 5851.51, in quiet trading, proving the summer lull has finally arrived.</p> <p>Poor UK trade figures had little real impact, while lower than expected Chinese inflation figures prompted talk the country could take more measures to boost its economy. This lifted mining shares, with <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> rising 100p to \u00a362.90, after a 32% increase in second quarter earnings, while <strong>Xstrata</strong> added 12.5p to 925p following its results earlier in the week.</p> <p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> continued its recovery following Tuesday's 16% drop in the wake of New York regulators accusing the bank of $250bn worth of illegal transactions with Iran.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/08/standard-chartered-chief-defends-bank\" title=\"\">The bank came out fighting</a> in a press conference on Wednesday, attempting to repair its battered reputation and accusing the regulator of \"factual inaccuracies\" in its attack. It did admit that $14m of transactions did breach US rules.</p> <p>Buyers have now come back for the banks shares, pushing them 47.5p higher to \u00a313.63 and making them the biggest riser in the leading index. Ian Gordon of Investec kept his buy recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> We wouldn't expect any bank's press conference to prove pivotal, but chief executive Peter Sands' performance yesterday afternoon should, we believe, act as a source of further comfort to shareholders. This doesn't look like a bank \"in crisis mode\", as one might reasonably expect. Standard Chartered is taking the unusual, but courageous, stance of facing down a regulator because it believes that the regulator is factually wrong. Let justice prevail on 15 August [when a hearing takes place]. We expect the end-game to be a fine (of unwarranted size), and then we move on. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Bank of America Merrill Lynch moved its rating from underperform to neutral.</p> <p><strong>Unilever</strong> added 17p to \u00a322.95 as fellow consumer goods group Nestle said it believed pressure from high food prices would ease in the second half of the year.</p> <p>But <strong>Amec</strong> fell 56p to \u00a311.03 after its half year results. Jon Bell at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> We note a more cautious tone from management around the operating margin which has fallen by 70 basis points to 7.5%, mainly due to a shift in business mix.

      "bodyText": "Broadcasters were in the spotlight again, ending among the leading risers in an uncertain FTSE 100. ITV - which was boosted earlier in the week by talk of a \u00a31.3bn return to shareholders - closed 1.95p higher at 83.2p after forecasts of a good advertising performance next month. Liberum Capital said: Initial feedback from a major media buyer suggests September has seen a rebound in advertising for ITV. If correct, this supports our view that July and August advertising weakness was caused more by a temporary shift of spending from TV to newspapers to capture Olympic audiences rather than a more negative general stance on advertising. Meanwhile BSkyB climbed 9p to 752p after it won an appeal against an Ofcom ruling that it must sell its sports channels to rivals at regulated prices. The move could boost the company's profits, according to analysts at Espirito Santo: Sky may receive a one-off payment of around \u00a325m (2% of 2013's estimated pretax profits) from the escrow account where competitors continued pay the difference between regulated prices and BSkyB's original rate cards. Moreover, Sky may receive an additional \u00a315m incremental wholesale revenues from existing contracts, going forward. BT, which recently won rights to Premier League football matches, fell 5.4p to 216.3p after the ruling. Virgin Media lost 15p to \u00a317.51, although there is the still the prospect of a hearing at the court of appeal. Overall the market celebrated five years since the start of the financial crisis with a modest gain. The FTSE 100 finished 5.59 points higher at 5851.51, in quiet trading, proving the summer lull has finally arrived. Poor UK trade figures had little real impact, while lower than expected Chinese inflation figures prompted talk the country could take more measures to boost its economy. This lifted mining shares, with Randgold Resources rising 100p to \u00a362.90, after a 32% increase in second quarter earnings, while Xstrata added 12.5p to 925p following its results earlier in the week. Standard Chartered continued its recovery following Tuesday's 16% drop in the wake of New York regulators accusing the bank of $250bn worth of illegal transactions with Iran. The bank came out fighting in a press conference on Wednesday, attempting to repair its battered reputation and accusing the regulator of \"factual inaccuracies\" in its attack. It did admit that $14m of transactions did breach US rules. Buyers have now come back for the banks shares, pushing them 47.5p higher to \u00a313.63 and making them the biggest riser in the leading index. Ian Gordon of Investec kept his buy recommendation, saying: We wouldn't expect any bank's press conference to prove pivotal, but chief executive Peter Sands' performance yesterday afternoon should, we believe, act as a source of further comfort to shareholders. This doesn't look like a bank \"in crisis mode\", as one might reasonably expect. Standard Chartered is taking the unusual, but courageous, stance of facing down a regulator because it believes that the regulator is factually wrong. Let justice prevail on 15 August [when a hearing takes place]. We expect the end-game to be a fine (of unwarranted size), and then we move on. Meanwhile Bank of America Merrill Lynch moved its rating from underperform to neutral. Unilever added 17p to \u00a322.95 as fellow consumer goods group Nestle said it believed pressure from high food prices would ease in the second half of the year. But Amec fell 56p to \u00a311.03 after its half year results. Jon Bell at Shore Capital said: We note a more cautious tone from management around the operating margin which has fallen by 70 basis points to 7.5%, mainly due to a shift in business mix. Given [the caution], evidence elsewhere of the effects of the global slowdown (e.g. Cape) and with the shares trading at the top end of their recent range, we downgrade our recommendation from buy to hold.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK's biggest trade deficit since modern records began 15 years ago prompted calls for the government to provide more help for exporters struggling to cope with weakening global demand for their products. The British Chambers of Commerce called on the business secretary, Vince Cable, to boost infrastructure spending, create a new investment bank and assist with trade finance after the latest official figures showed the gap between imports and exports widened from \u00a32.7bn to \u00a34.4bn in June. David Kern, the BCC's chief economist, said: \"British exporters have untapped potential to expand, but they need more government support to help them compete globally and diversify towards growing markets outside the EU. We need firmer action in key areas such as trade finance, promotion and insurance. More infrastructure spending and the early creation of a business bank would make a major contribution towards stronger growth in UK exports.\" Labour also seized on data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing that the value of UK exports of goods and services fell by 4.6% between May and June while imports declined by 0.7%. The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: \"The Business Department has failed to adequately help firms which want to export, in particular small companies. It speaks volumes that the government's finance scheme to boost exports only helped five firms before being quietly dropped.\" Umunna added that the government's promise of an export-led recovery had been \"shattered\" by the figures and called on ministers to adopt \"industrial strategies across the board\". The ONS said the UK trade deficit was the largest since comparable records began in 1997. It was made up of a \u00a310.1bn deficit in trade in goods, offset by a \u00a35.8bn surplus in services. City analysts said the figures were poor even when allowing for the disruption to business caused by the extra bank holiday in June to celebrate the Queen's diamond jubilee. They noted that the trade gap for the second quarter \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend than one month's figures \u2013 increased from \u00a37.8bn to \u00a311.2bn, enough to wipe a percentage point off economic growth. In the three months to June, the value of exports was down by 2.7% while imports were flat. Although Britain's export performance has been hampered by the prolonged crisis in the eurozone, the slowdown in the rest of the world has also started to hit British firms. The ONS said Britain's deficit with the European Union increased by \u00a30.5bn in June to \u00a34.9bn, while the deficit with the rest of the world widened by \u00a31.3bn to \u00a35.2bn. Exports to the US, the Netherlands, France, China, Italy and Spain fell heavily in June. In the second quarter of 2012, the EU deficit increased by \u00a31.8bn to \u00a314.1bn and the non-EU shortfall rose by \u00a31.5bn to \u00a314.2bn. The biggest falls in overseas sales during the quarter were to the US and Germany. The government's aim since it arrived in power more than two years ago has been to rebalance the economy towards exports but the figures for the first half of 2012 show that the deficit is on course to be higher than in 2010. Ministers have blamed the problems in the eurozone for the difficulties faced by exporters, but City analysts said there were now problems in North America and Asia. Daniel Solomon, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \"Growth in much of emerging Asia has been slowing for some time and, while the US is growing slowly, the labour market has been fragile there for a while.\" Chris Willliamson, economist at Markit, said: \"The fall could perhaps be in part blamed on the disruption to shipments caused by extra holidays for the Queen's jubilee, but there is clearly an underlying trend of worrying weakness in overseas demand.\" He added that the fall in exports in the second quarter was the biggest since 2006. Vicky Redwood, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said that if the extra bank holiday had affected shipments through UK ports, it should have affected imports as severely as exports. \"And previous extra bank holidays have not had that big an impact. In June 2002, the month of the golden jubilee, the deficit widened by only \u00a30.4bn.\" Britain's trade in oil plunged deeper into the red in June, notching up a deficit of \u00a31.5bn. During the 1980s and 1990s, Britain's growing trade deficit in goods was masked by a healthy surplus in oil but the decline in North Sea production over the past decade has meant a deficit averaging \u00a31bn a month during 2012.",

In the three months to June, the value of exports was down by 2.7% while imports were flat.</p> <p>Although Britain's export performance has been hampered by the prolonged crisis in the eurozone, the slowdown in the rest of the world has also started to hit British firms.</p> <p>The ONS said Britain's deficit with the European Union increased by \u00a30.5bn in June to \u00a34.9bn, while the deficit with the rest of the world widened by \u00a31.3bn to \u00a35.2bn. Exports to the US, the Netherlands, France, China, Italy and Spain fell heavily in June.</p> <p>In the second quarter of 2012, the EU deficit increased by \u00a31.8bn to \u00a314.1bn and the non-EU shortfall rose by \u00a31.5bn to \u00a314.2bn. The biggest falls in overseas sales during the quarter were to the US and Germany.</p> <p>The government's aim since it arrived in power more than two years ago has been to rebalance the economy towards exports but the figures for the first half of 2012 show that the deficit is on course to be higher than in 2010.</p> <p>Ministers have blamed the problems in the eurozone for the difficulties faced by exporters, but City analysts said there were now problems in North America and Asia.</p> <p>Daniel Solomon, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \"Growth in much of emerging Asia has been slowing for some time and, while the US is growing slowly, the labour market has been fragile there for a while.\"</p> <p>Chris Willliamson, economist at Markit, said: \"The fall could perhaps be in part blamed on the disruption to shipments caused by extra holidays for the Queen's jubilee, but there is clearly an underlying trend of worrying weakness in overseas demand.\" He added that the fall in exports in the second quarter was the biggest since 2006.</p> <p>Vicky Redwood, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said that if the extra bank holiday had affected shipments through UK ports, it should have affected imports as severely as exports. \"And previous extra bank holidays have not had that big an impact. In June 2002, the month of the golden jubilee, the deficit widened by only \u00a30.4bn.\"</p> <p>Britain's trade in oil plunged deeper into the red in June, notching up a deficit of \u00a31.5bn.</p> <p>During the 1980s and 1990s, Britain's growing trade deficit in goods was masked by a healthy surplus in oil but the decline in North Sea production over the past decade has meant a deficit averaging \u00a31bn a month during 2012.</p>",
