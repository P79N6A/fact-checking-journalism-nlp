    "webTitle": "BHS scandal: what we learned this week", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chaos at BHS in the run-up to its collapse was laid bare this week as senior managers at the department store and its former owner made a series of extraordinary allegations. Darren Topp, chief executive of BHS, told a parliamentary committee that Dominic Chappell, the former owner, had his \u201cfingers in the till\u201d and had threatened to kill him. Chappell responded by claiming that the retail tycoon Sir Philip Green, who sold him BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015, had blocked a rescue deal with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct. Green will get his chance to answer questions from MPs investigating the demise of the company on Wednesday next week, but pressure on the billionaire is growing. Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his tenure at BHS between 2000 and 2015. BHS is being wound down, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving it with a \u00a3571m pension deficit. After the explosive parliamentary hearings and a dump of new documents shedding further light on correspondence between the main players, this is what we have learned this week about the BHS scandal before Green\u2019s highly anticipated appearance 1. Dominic Chappell is a \u201cmythomaniac\u201d The dictionary definition of a mythomaniac is an abnormal or pathological tendency to exaggerate or tell lies. That is an extraordinary way to describe the owner of a company that employs 11,000 people, but that is how Michael Hitchcock, the former financial consultant of BHS, described Chappell to MPs. \u201cThe lay person\u2019s term is he was a premier league liar and a Sunday pub league retailer, at best,\u201d Hitchcock added for good measure. MPs then heard about Chappell moving \u00a31.5m out of BHS into a separate entity called BHS Sweden, a loan against his father\u2019s house, and the death threats to Topp, which Chappell later denied. The Guardian has uncovered plenty of evidence that Chappell\u2019s business career prior to BHS was not as prosperous as he claimed. It is no surprise, therefore, that Frank Field MP described Chappell as a \u201cWalter Mitty character\u201d. What is a surprise, however, is that Green thought it was appropriate to sell BHS to Chappell. It remains to be seen whether Chappell really was, as he claimed, in the helicopter squad of the SAS. 2. Chappell broke pledges he made before buying BHS Correspondence between Goldman Sachs, executives at Arcadia \u2013 Green\u2019s retail business \u2013 and Chappell reveal the to-ings and fro-ings of the negotiations that led to Chappell buying BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015. For example, Chappell pledged that his consortium would invest \u00a3120m in BHS and a month before the deal he outlined how the new board of management would look. However, the \u00a3120m never arrived and the chairman, chief executive and chief financial officer mentioned in his board never joined. The emails also show that Green appeared to be consistently sceptical about the credibility of the bid \u2013 threatening to pull out on more than one occasion. An email sent by Arcadia\u2019s finance director, Paul Budge, on 20 January 2015 even suggests that less than two months before the deal was completed, Green had little idea who Chappell was and that Chappell had little idea about the scale of BHS\u2019s pension problems. Budge refers to Chappell as \u201cDominic of Swiss Rock [the name of the consortium at the time], who worked in the background with Paul S [Sutton, who initially tried to buy BHS from Green] when we started conversations a year or so back\u201d. At the same time, Chappell was telling his financial advisers that he was on first-name terms with Green and had been entertained on his yacht. The emails suggest that Chappell may have duped Green into thinking he was more credible than he was but also raise further questions about why the tycoon agreed the deal. 3. Mike Ashley could have saved BHS Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, told MPs he \u201c100%\u201d wanted to buy BHS. Chappell claimed a deal with Ashley had been blocked by Green, who went \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out that Sports Direct was in talks to buy BHS and pushed the retailer into administration by calling in a \u00a335m loan that Arcadia was owed. Green denies Chappell\u2019s allegations but MPs want answers about what actually happened and whether the Topshop boss could have done more to save BHS. 4. BHS\u2019s shops and offices were valuable The property that BHS owned and occupied was key to Chappell\u2019s takeover of the retailer and how it was financed. Through a complex deal, Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions planned to make \u00a310m by buying BHS\u2019s headquarters from Green and then selling it on to a property company. However, Green pulled out of this deal, instead bagging a windfall for his wife Lady Green by selling it to his own company Arcadia for \u00a353m. Retail Acquisitions also collected \u00a37m by selling the building next to BHS\u2019s offices and raised millions from loans against the company\u2019s shops. These deals meant Retail Acquisitions did not put any of its own funds into BHS but also explain how value was stripped out of the company. 5. Green could lose his knighthood The latest allegations have not only increased the questions facing Green, but raised the likehood he could lose his knighthood. The allegations prompted Jim McMahon, a Labour MP, to write to David Cameron asking him to consider stripping Green of his honour. A group of Conservative MPs are also writing to the honours forfeiture committee, which will then have to formally consider the tycoon\u2019s knighthood. Green\u2019s position has not been helped by the revelation that the taxpayer stands to lose up to \u00a336m from the collapse of BHS, while Arcadia is likely to recoup \u00a335m as the top creditor. If Green does not pledge to pump hundreds of millions into the BHS pension deficit and relinquish his claim to the \u00a335m in his appearance next week, this pressure will grow.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green will express regret about the collapse of BHS when he faces MPs next week as pressure builds on the billionaire to pump hundreds of millions of pounds into the retailer\u2019s beleaguered pension fund. Green will claim he was duped by Dominic Chappell, a three-time bankrupt, into selling him BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015. The tycoon will appear in front of a parliamentary committee as MPs call for Green to be stripped of his knighthood if he does not help to fill the \u00a3571m deficit in BHS\u2019s pension scheme. Jim McMahon, a Labour MP, has written to David Cameron asking him to consider stripping Green of his honour, while a group of Conservative MPs are writing to the honours forfeiture committee, according to Westminister sources. The committee will then have to formally consider the tycoon\u2019s knighthood and advise the Queen on what action to take. The pressure on Green has increased after it emerged that the collapse of BHS is set to cost the taxpayer up to \u00a336m and that Lady Tina Green, his wife, enjoyed a \u00a353m windfall from the sale of the retailer\u2019s headquarters to Arcadia, the Greens\u2019 retail business. BHS is being wound down after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. Green controlled BHS for 15 years until 2015 when it was sold to Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions. The tycoon and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his tenure at BHS. MPs on the work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee heard extraordinary evidence this week from the senior managers at BHS and Chappell. Chappell claimed that Green pushed BHS into administration after hearing that the retailer was in talks with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct about a rescue deal. Green denies this and is planning to rebut a series of Chappell\u2019s allegations when he appears in front of MPs. He could also propose an offer to MPs that involves him pumping money into the BHS pension scheme and waiving Arcadia\u2019s claim to \u00a335m from the administration process. However, Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, has indicated that he wants Green to put \u00a3600m into the pension scheme. Sources close to Arcadia claim that Chappell was able to not only convince Green that he was credible, but some of the City\u2019s leading advisers. They point to a business plan put together by Grant Thornton and a number of pledges made by Chappell prior to the deal as evidence that he appeared a credible buyer. Emails published by MPs show that Chappell\u2019s consortium pledged to invest \u00a3120m into BHS and bring in a high-profile chairman and chief executive. They did neither. A spokesman for Arcadia said: \u201cSir Philip is looking forward to the select committee hearing on Wednesday, when he will attempt to answer questions put to him about the collapse of BHS, and counter the lies and false allegations made about him.\u201d Meanwhile, Lady Green has written to MPs denying that she lent Chappell \u00a33.5m. Chappell told MPs that Lady Green gave Retail Acquisitions a loan of \u00a33.5m while it owned BHS. However, in a letter to the parliamentary committee, Lady Green said: \u201cContrary to what Mr Chappell said to the committee, I can confirm in unequivocal terms that I have never, at any time, lent any money to RAL [Retail Acquisitions] or Mr Chappell or had any other personal business dealings with them. \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, neither has my husband,\u201d she added.",

Green controlled BHS for 15 years until 2015 when it was sold to Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">The tycoon and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m</a> in dividends, rent and interest payments during his tenure at BHS.</p> <p>MPs on the work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/bhs-inquiry-hears-of-theft-and-death-threats-in-dramatic-day-of-testimony\">heard extraordinary evidence this week from the senior managers at BHS and Chappell</a>. Chappell claimed that Green pushed BHS into administration after hearing that the retailer was in talks with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct about a rescue deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb035f627fa257d3dea3ee167b6160780d16d8db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb035f627fa257d3dea3ee167b6160780d16d8db/0_38_1564_938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Chappell giving evidence before MPs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Chappell giving evidence before MPs .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Green denies this and is planning to rebut a series of Chappell\u2019s allegations when he appears in front of MPs. He could also propose an offer to MPs that involves him pumping money into the BHS pension scheme and waiving Arcadia\u2019s claim to \u00a335m from the administration process. However, Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, has indicated that he wants Green to put \u00a3600m into the pension scheme.</p> <p>Sources close to Arcadia claim that Chappell was able to not only convince Green that he was credible, but some of the City\u2019s leading advisers. They point to a business plan put together by Grant Thornton and a number of pledges made by Chappell prior to the deal as evidence that he appeared a credible buyer. Emails published by MPs show that Chappell\u2019s consortium pledged to invest \u00a3120m into BHS and bring in a high-profile chairman and chief executive. They did neither.</p> <p>A spokesman for Arcadia said: \u201cSir Philip is looking forward to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/bhs-sir-philip-green-dominic-chappell-evidence-business-select-committee\">select committee hearing on Wednesday</a>, when he will attempt to answer questions put to him about the collapse of BHS, and counter the lies and false allegations made about him.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lady Green has written to MPs denying that she lent Chappell \u00a33.5m. Chappell told MPs that Lady Green gave Retail Acquisitions a loan of \u00a33.5m while it owned BHS.</p> <p>However, in a letter to the parliamentary committee, Lady Green said: \u201cContrary to what Mr Chappell said to the committee, I can confirm in unequivocal terms that I have never, at any time, lent any money to RAL [Retail Acquisitions] or Mr Chappell or had any other personal business dealings with them.</p> <p>\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, neither has my husband,\u201d she added.</p>",

With opinion polls tight and less than two weeks to go before the vote, sterling came under pressure and it was down more than 1% against the US dollar at one point on Friday. In late afternoon trading the pound was worth $1.43. \u201cThe opinion polls are as close as they\u2019ve been for the entire campaign. And while the phone polls still show a lead for remain, with the online polls much closer and significant doubts about the reliability of all polls whatever the methodology, financial markets remain very jittery about the possibility of a \u2018leave\u2019 win,\u201d said economists at Daiwa Capital Markets in London in a note to clients. For stock markets, worries about the 23 June referendum compounded fears of a global economic slowdown, falling oil prices and next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting on US interest rates. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks suffered its biggest one-day drop since mid-February and closed down 1.9% at 6,115.8. It was a similar picture around the world. As investors reacted to the cocktail of concerns by dumping stocks for bonds, Wall Street was down markedly at the time of the London close. In Germany the Dax stock index dropped 2.5% on the day and France\u2019s Cac 40 fell 2.2%. In a sign of investors\u2019 nervousness, gold prices climbed to a a three-week high. The precious metal has long been seen as a safe investment in uncertain times and in the last week gold has climbed 2% to $1,269.8 an ounce. Economists at the consultancy Capital Economics said the gold price appeared to be tracking the odds of Brexit. Other commodities were also being influenced by the approaching poll. \u201cA UK vote to leave the EU ... would presumably have a negative impact on global business and investor confidence and hence undermine the prices of industrial commodities. On the other hand, it should boost demand for safe havens, including gold whose price could easily jump to $1,400 per ounce in the event of a Brexit vote,\u201d they wrote in a research note. Amid rising risk aversion, government bonds were in high demand. Bond yields, which move inversely to bond prices, set new record lows around the world. On many government bonds the yields are now in negative territory, which means investors are technically paying for the privilege of lending to a government. In Germany, yields on the 10-year \u201cBunds\u201d dropped to a new record low on Friday of 0.022% and there was speculation they could hit zero and maybe even dip into the red. \u201cNegative rates are increasingly becoming the benchmark against which investors judge prospective returns, hence the lack of hysteria in the last couple of weeks as 10-year German bund yields have fallen to within a whisker of zero percent,\u201d said Chris Iggo, head of fixed income at AXA Investment Managers. Yields on Bunds and other government bonds have been falling on the back of Brexit worries but also on expectations that the US Federal Reserve will delay an anticipated increase in interest rates. The central bank meets next week having hinted at a June rate rise and then more recently suggested there was too much uncertainty to act this month. That followed news of a sharp slowdown in US job creation in May. James Knightly, economist at ING Bank, said: \u201cThe Fed will probably want to see at least two decent jobs figures before pulling the trigger on higher rates. This means we continue to favour the September ... meeting for the next rate rise.\u201d Yields on UK government bonds, known as gilts, also hit all-time lows on Friday, albeit in thin volumes as traders hung back from taking any big bets ahead of the tight referendum. The 10-year gilt yield dropped to 1.213% at one point, the lowest on record.",

      "bodyText": "Financier Guy Hands dramatically abandoned his \u00a31.5bn lawsuit against Citigroup on Friday, nine years after the ill-fated \u00a34.2bn takeover of music group EMI that sparked a long-running legal battle with the American bank. At a special court hearing on Friday, lawyers for the financier\u2019s private equity fund, Terra Firma, told a London court the action had been withdrawn, just four days into a case that had been expected to last until mid-July. \u201cTerra Firma confirms it unreservedly withdraws its allegations of fraud,\u201d David Wolfson \u2013 standing in for lead QC Anthony Grabiner \u2013 told the hastily convened court. Terra Firma will also pay the costs of the US bank, likely to run into millions of pounds. Hands, who had been claiming at least \u00a31.5bn from Citi, had been questioned by the bank\u2019s lawyer for the previous two days, and his evidence had been expected to last into next week. He had faced repeated questions about his recollection of events in 2007 when Terra Firma took over EMI just before the credit crunch and had been accused of having a \u201chazy memory\u201d. At one stage during his questioning of Hands, Mark Howard QC, representing Citi, said: \u201cThe problem is, Mr Hands, your story is shifting and it is impossible to reconcile these different versions.\u201d Citi was an adviser to EMI \u2013 at the time the label of Kylie Minogue, Coldplay and the Beatles \u2013 and lent Terra Firma \u00a32.5bn to fund the deal in which Hands admitted he had personally lost \u20ac200m (\u00a3156m). One of the claimant\u2019s arguments was that Citi banker David Wormsley had told Hands there was a rival bid for EMI and the price at which to table the offer. The case had focused on alleged \u201cfraudulent misrepresentations\u201d made during 2007 by Wormsley, then the head of UK banking at Citi; Michael Klein, who was head of global banking; and Chad Leat, co-head of global credit markets. Mr Justice Burton, the judge who had been presiding over the case, said: \u201cI\u2019m sure this is the right result.\u201d Outside court, Citi said: \u201cWe have always maintained that the allegations made by Terra Firma were entirely baseless and that Citi, specifically David Wormsley, Michael Klein and Chad Leat, acted at all times with absolute honesty and professional integrity throughout the EMI transaction. We are very pleased that Terra Firma has unreservedly withdrawn the allegations, agreed to the dismissal of the proceedings and will pay Citi\u2019s costs in relation to this matter.\u201d It was the second time Citi had faced Terra Firma in court. A New York jury had rejected a claim against Citi in 2010 \u2013 where the relationship between Hands and Wormsley had been subjected to close scrutiny \u2013 but an appeal allowed the case to be transferred to the UK in 2013. Hands, who was not in court, said the latest claim had been brought in good faith. \u201cHowever, it has become evident that our documentation of the fast-moving and complex events, and memories of these events after nine years, are no longer sufficient to meet the high demands of proof required for a fraud claim in court,\u201d he said. \u201cThe matter is now closed,\u201d said Hands, saying that the Terra Firma business he founded in 2003 was looking to the future. \u201cWe have an exciting portfolio of companies, a talented and experienced team, supportive and loyal investors and \u20ac1bn of capital to invest,\u201d he said. The case had begun to scrutinise the goings-on in the City in the run-up to the credit crunch and how negotiations for deals took place. If the case had continued, Wormsley, Klein and Leat had been expected to give evidence. The court had heard that at one stage allegations \u2013 since removed \u2013 had been made by Hands against Chuck Prince, former chief executive of Citi, to embarrass Citi and force the bank to settle. \u201cThat\u2019s not correct,\u201d Hands had said.",

      "bodyText": "The number of US oil rigs rose for the second week in a row after the recent rise in the crude price to above $50, according to the regular Baker Hughes report. The weekly count showed a total rise of 6 rigs to 414, as the increase in oil prices to an 11 month high encouraged drillers back to the wells. The rise was split between three oil rigs and three gas. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day and the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has said it would be a disaster for Britain if it voted to leave the EU, and would also hurt Europe and cause short term market instability. [To be fair short term market instability is already with us] According to Reuters, Renzi said at a conference in Genoa in northern Italy that Brexit would be \u201ca dreadful mistake for both Britain and Europe.\u201d Moving from fears of the UK leaving Europe to the England football team leaving the Euros, Zoe Wood has been looking at the winners and losers from the feast of football which begins this evening. Read her report here: It was a bad end to the week as investors took fright, with Brexit fears dominating the markets but a fall in oil prices and nervousness ahead of next week\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting adding to the uncertainty. Bond yields fell sharply and gold rose as investors took a safety first approach. In the UK, leading shares suffered their sharpest one day percentage fall since 11 February, while European markets also recorded major losses. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Markets have come full circle this week, with the gains seen in the early part of the week giving way to substantial losses towards the end. It is particularly notable that whilst European indices have seen substantial losses, the US markets are have managed to claw back some early losses, highlighting proximity of the link between todays selling and the fear of a Brexit. Banks came under particular pressure on concerns about the impact of negative bond yields while commodity companies suffered as metal and oil prices fell. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 116.13 points or 1.86% at 6115.76 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.52% to 9834.62 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.24% lower at 4306.72 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.62% to 17,120.16 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.18% down at 8490.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 4.18% to 618.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.43% or 78 points. And Brent crude has slid 2.18% to $50.82 a barrel. Worries about the global economy could be one factor pushing bond yields lower but it may not be the real story, says Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics: One possible explanation for the latest decline in global bond yields is that concerns about global growth have surfaced again. Certainly, some of the recent data have been disappointing. US non-farm payrolls for May were the weakest since 2010 and the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest level since early 2014... However, in our view these worries about the global economy look over-stated. Most importantly, we suspect that abrupt slowdown in US payrolls growth is not the start of a new recession... The upshot is that a downturn in prospects for global growth cannot explain the slump in global yields. Instead, falling yields probably reflect the reduced expectations for US interest rate hikes. As we think the Fed will resume its tightening cycle before the end of this year, and fears of Brexit should fade whatever the outcome of the referendum, we anticipate that bond yields will rebound. The pound hit a six week low of $1.4315, down 1% on the day, before recovering slightly to $1.4332 as Brexit worries persist. The US consumer confidence figures come ahead of next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting but are unlikely to prompt a rate rise, says James Knightly at ING Bank: [The confidence report] gives us some confidence in the view that last week\u2019s payrolls disappointment is not the start of a new trend seeing as confidence remains close to cycle highs, suggesting no distress about the state of the jobs market. Moreover, with the consumer expectations component looking healthy at 83.2, it suggests consumer spending should perform well in the coming months. With job openings at cycle highs, businesses are still recruiting so we would expect a decent rebound in the June jobs report. However, the Fed will probably want to see at least two decent jobs figures before pulling the trigger on higher rates. This means we continue to favour the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting for the next rate rise. The consumer confidence survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumers were a bit less optimistic in early June due to increased concerns about future economic prospects. The recent data magnified the growing gap between the most favorable assessments of Current Economic Conditions since July 2005, and renewed downward drift of the Expectations Index, which fell by a rather modest 8.6% from the January 2015 peak. The strength recorded in early June was in personal finances, and the weaknesses were in expectations for continued growth in the national economy. Consumers rated their current financial situation at the best levels since the 2007 cyclical peak largely due to wage gains. Prospects for gains in inflation-adjusted incomes in the year ahead were also the most favorable since the 2007 peak, enabled by record low inflation expectations. On the negative side of the ledger, consumers do not think the economy is as strong as it was last year nor do they anticipate the economy will enjoy the same financial health in the year ahead as they anticipated a year ago. A sustained reduction in the pace of job creation could prompt consumers to hold down spending to increase their precautionary savings. Overall, the data still indicate that real consumer expenditures can be expected to rise by 2.5% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017. In the US, consumer confidence slipped back in the preliminary June reading, but not as much as expected. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell from 94.7 in May to 94.3, but this was better than the forecast figure of 94. The current conditions index of 111.7, up from 109.9, was the highest since July 2005. With stock markets under pressure amid a cocktail of concerns - including Brexit, falling oil prices, next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting on US interest rates - gold is one of the havens being sought by investors. At the moment the metal is up around $5 an ounce at $1274. And here\u2019s how it has been tracking the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit debate: Here\u2019s the state of bond yields, many in negative territory: Wall Street has opened lower: Dow Jones: -0.5% at 17,896 S&amp;P 500: -0.6% at 2,104 Nasdaq: -0.8% at 4,917 Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, has written a note on the likelihood of a domino effect across Europe, should Britain vote to leave the EU on 23 June. He describes the possibility of a domino effect as \u201cthe main risk to watch for global markets and the global economy\u201d. However, Schmieding and his colleagues at Berenberg suggest the likelihood is low, and place the likelihood of Brexit at just 30%. Italy would be the country to watch, Schmieding concludes: First, Italy matters because of its size (the fourth-largest in the EU) and its debt (133% of GDP). Second, since the demise of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy lacks a strong centre-right that could take over from Matteo Renzi\u2019s centre-left. Third, if Renzi\u2019s government were to fall, unlikely but not impossible if he loses the referendum on constitutional reform this October, parties with more than 50% support in current opinion polls may campaign in hypothetical early elections with a promise to hold a referendum on euro membership. That could rattle markets. But Renzi remains in the pole position. That Italy could be governed by an anti-euro coalition still looks unlikely. US markets are expected to open lower: Earlier Russia\u2019s central bank cut interest rates for the first time in nearly a year, citing an imminent economic recovery and more stable inflation. After reducing its main lending rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, Russia\u2019s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said there was unlikely to be any direct influence on the country\u2019s economy in the event of the UK voting to leave the EU, according to Reuters. But there could be indirect risks through reaction in the currency markets, she told a news conference. If things stay as they are the FTSE 100\u2019s fall - now 1.86% - will be the biggest daily decline in percentage terms since the middle of February. With US futures suggesting a 95 point fall on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens, the chances of a big recovery are not huge. The FTSE 100 is now down 114 points or 1.8% at 6,118. Spreadex\u2019s Connor Campbell gives this update on European markets: Things got far, far worse in Europe, an alarming drop pushing the region\u2019s indices to a series of 2 and a half week lows. With Brent Crude dipping below $51.50 per barrel, and the commodity sector rapidly losing the gains seen at the start of the week, the FTSE plunged over 100 points this Friday. Finding a clear, concrete reason for this violent investor reaction is difficult; rather it seems that the commodity reversal, alongside a sharp decline from the financial sector, has joined the pre-referendum jitters to produce a bearish weight the markets are unable to handle. He says the Brexit jitters are now spreading beyond the FTSE to other European markets. The eurozone indices bested the FTSE in the poor performance stakes this morning, the DAX and CAC dropping a whopping 2.1% and 1.8% respectively. Like the UK index that leaves both at their worst price since May 24th, fears of a Brexit taking hold of the eurozone indices in a way that hasn\u2019t previously been seen. Rewinding to slightly earlier in the day, the OECD\u2019s secretary general Angel Gurria gave an impassioned speech when asked about Brexit by a journalist. Speaking in Paris at the launch of the organisation\u2019s economic survey of the EU and eurozone, he said the British voters were being purposely misled by members of the leave camp, some of whom were motivated by their own political motivations... The message is not permeating easily because there is a lot of emotion and frankly there is a lot of very misleading messaging that is going on. I give you one example. It is often mentioned by the people who are promoting Brexit that \u2018there is stifling regulation of the UK economy and we will now be able to deregulate\u2019. That is absolutely false. The UK is one of the least regulated, most flexible, open economies ... so much so that if they were on their own the improvement on regulation would be relatively modest. So you would not gain very much there. People do not have the elements to know whether that is true or not. He said that all the key institutions and groups - the London School of Economics, the CBI, the OECD, the IMF, the WTO, the trade unions - had provided evidence of the likely impact of Brexit. But the leave campaign had not. The people promoting Brexit are speaking emotionally and they fail to provide any evidence to the contrary. For Gurria, Brexit is personal as well as professional. This is an intergenerational decision that has to be taken. I say that with the authority of being the father of a British citizen, married to a British citizen, and with two British children. I would like them to have a better future. And I would like them to have a European future. And not in an isolated society, an isolated economy. Gurria said there were too many voices, leaving the voting public confused. It is a cacophony of voices and in many cases the voices of those who are promoting their own political [ambitions] even if it is at the expense of future generations. It is our duty and obligation to continue with the message, mostly to the British people. It\u2019s the British people who would suffer this drop in wellbeing and revenue. The Europeans are going to recover pretty fast, but the UK is going to take a much greater hit. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is not the only one warning Brexit could prompt other countries to leave the EU. Billionaire George Soros warned on Thursday it could lead to a collapse of the EU, and ratings agency Fitch said last week: If the UK were to thrive outside of the EU, it might encourage other countries to follow suit. No wonder investors are feeling anxious. It\u2019s not all terrible from Sch\u00e4uble though, he would take us back, eventually: At some point, the British will realise they have taken the wrong decision. And then we will accept them back one day, if that\u2019s what they want. Sch\u00e4uble has also warned Brexit could lead to other countries leaving the EU, Reuters is reporting. You can\u2019t rule it out. How would the Netherlands, which has traditionally been very closely allied with Britain, react, for example? If need be, Europe would work without Britain. It would be a miracle if Britain quitting did not have any economic disadvantages [for the UK]. Germany\u2019s finance minister added that in the event of Brexit, a call for more integration among remaining EU members would not be the appropriate response. Even in the event that only a small majority of the British voters reject a withdrawal, we would have to see it as a wake-up call and a warning not to continue with business as usual. Either way, we have to take a serious look at reducing bureaucracy in Europe. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s combative and influential finance minister has waded into the Brexit debate. In a characteristically frank interview with German magazine Der Spiegel (to be published over the weekend), Sch\u00e4uble says the door to the single market would be slammed in Britain\u2019s face should it vote to leave the EU on 23 June. The Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann reports from Berlin: Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has slammed the door on Britain retaining access to the single market if it votes to the leave the European Union. In an interview in a Brexit-themed issue of German weekly Der Spiegel, the influential veteran politician ruled out the possibility of the UK following a Swiss or Norwegian model where it could enjoy the benefits of the single market without being an EU member. \u201cThat won\u2019t work,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble told Der Spiegel. \u201cIt would require the country to abide by the rules of a club from which it currently wants to withdraw. \u201cIf the majority in Britain opts for Brexit, that would be a decision against the single market. In is in. Out is out. One has to respect the sovereignty of the British people.\u201d Reuters is reporting that Sch\u00e4uble has also warned Brexit could lead to referendums in other EU countries, therefore destabilising the whole region. Shares in all FTSE 100 companies are lower. The top performers are down... The bottom performers are down... Equity losses are gathering pace. Major European markets are down more than 1%. The FTSE 100 is down 1.5% or 96 points at 6,136. Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.7% at 9,921 France\u2019s CAC: -1.2% at 4,352 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -2.1% at 17,396 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1.6% at 8,632 The OECD says the European economy is slowly improving, but new challenges are emerging, including the prospect of Brexit. Gurria turns to the risk of Brexit: It would hurt British growth, FDI inflows, trade. GDP could be 3% lower than if you did not have Brexit, if you go for remain. He says the biggest negative impact will be on Britain. The EU will suffer less, because it is a big unit, able to withstand Brexit. Gurria repeats the OECD\u2019s claim that UK workers would lose the equivalent of a month\u2019s wages every year outside the EU. We are strongly saying remain. This is best for the UK, the EU and the world. The last thing we need is uncertainty, we have enough of that already. The OECD\u2019s secretary general, Angel Gurria, says tensions in European financial markets have receded. Why? Gurria lists the reasons. The key has been better European policies. New rules. Monetary policy from the ECB has obviously been supportive. It looks like we are moving to a better fiscal position without having to do much heavy lifting. The building blocks to banking union are underway. But, Gurria says, unemployment is still high, and investment has been weak. We are still below pre-crisis levels, he says. UK, Germany and the US are the only three countries where this is not the case. The OECD press conference on Europe is starting. Watch live here. The European Union must drop barriers to immigration to boost growth, according to the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, in clear opposition to arguments put forward by the leave camp in the EU referendum that the UK would prosper despite restrictions on migrant workers. The Paris-based thinktank, which is funded by the world\u2019s richest nations, said the EU needed to encourage workers to move to where they can find a job by forcing countries to recognise professional qualifications and allow workers to transfer their pensions. In its latest survey of the EU and the eurozone, the OECD said obstacles to labour mobility remained one of the three significant barriers to growth, alongside a failure to break the banking sector\u2019s monopoly on lending to businesses and Brussels\u2019 inability to tackle restrictions that remain in the single market. \u201cBarriers to intra-EU labour mobility, including recognition of professional qualifications and supplementary pension portability, remain significant and need to be reduced. Labour market requirements for non-EU migrants should be further standardised,\u201d the OECD said. It also said the inflow of refugees was \u201ca major and pressing challenge\u201d that must be met collectively by the EU countries. (Read the full story here.) Asian markets closing prices: Construction output jumped 2.5% in April, beating expectations of a 1.7% rise. It was the largest monthly increase since January 2014. It followed a 3.6% drop in March according to the Office for National Statistics data. New building work was up 2.9%, while repair and maintenance increase by 1.9%. Despite the better-than-expected number, construction output was still lower in April than it was in the same month last year, by 3.7%. But again, this wasn\u2019t as bad as the 4.8% annual drop forecast by economists. Not everyone thinks piling into bonds at any cost is a good idea. Janus Capital\u2019s Bill Gross is one of them. The bond market sage thinks there is a disaster brewing. Specifically, he took to Twitter to describe the negative yields on $10trn of sovereign debt as \u201ca supernova that will explode one day\u201d. Benchmark 10-year German bund yields have hit a fresh record low, as investors rush to the relative safety of bonds versus equities. The low was 0.0021%, meaning it is getting cheaper and cheaper for the German government to borrow money. If bund yields venture into negative, investors will be paying the government to buy its debt... The flight from equities continues this morning, with European markets down in early trading. As part of the same story, German bund yields have hit fresh record lows this morning , edging closer to negative territory (more on this soon). Oil prices are lower, with Brent Crude down 0.8% at $51.53 a barrel. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has this take: Europe\u2019s second half of the week slump continued to gather pace this Friday, the session starting with another sharp slide. With nothing on offer the FTSE had little choice but to focus on Brent Crude\u2019s retreat (the black stuff back down to $51.50 per barrel) and the increasing uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum at the end of the month (the pound dropping another 0.4% against the dollar). The eurozone indices have seen an even more dramatic drop this week. The DAX, which had briefly pushed beyond 10,300 on Tuesday, plunged below 10000 as the morning got underway, while the CAC is now nearing 4,350, a price not seen since May 24th. German annual inflation has been confirmed at zero in May, unchanged from earlier estimates according to the Federal Statistics Office. (This is the harmonised rate, to compare with other European countries.) Also coming up today... We have UK construction output data for April at 9.30. Economists are forecasting a 1.7% increase over the month, following a 3.6% drop in March. Industrial production data and trade data earlier in the week were both better than expected, so it will be interesting to see whether construction had a decent April, and what that might mean for growth in the second quarter overall. At 10am (UK time) the OECD is launching its economic survey of the EU and the eurozone. A press conference hosted by secretary general Angel Gurr\u00eda will be available to watch here and we will be bringing you all the key points. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Gold is in focus, nearing a three-week high and on track for a second weekly rise as investors seek save have assets in an uncertain world. The precious metal has been rising since last Friday, when US payrolls data came in shockingly weak, with just 38,000 jobs added compared with the 164,000 forecast by economists. It is part of a fresh wave of jitters among investors, who have plenty of uncertainty to contend with. On Thursday this week, Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, warned of the risk of lasting damage to the eurozone economy if leaders did not urgently introduce structural reforms. And as Britain\u2019s referendum on EU membership draws ever closer, the outcome of the 23 June poll is too close to call. Brexit, and all the uncertainty that comes with it, is a real prospect. Investors are piling out of equities, with Asian markets falling on Friday following losses on Wall Street and European markets on Thursday. Bonds as well as gold and silver are appealing to investors seeking less risky assets. Gilt yields on German and UK 10-year bonds fell to record lows yesterday, meaning investors had to pay more to hold government debt in those countries. As Michael Hewson comments, German bunds were \u201cwithin touching distance of negative territory\u201d. He adds: A move into negative territory for German bunds in the coming days would mean that investors would be paying to lend money to the German government all the way out to ten years, in the same way they currently are for Japan now. Who would have thought that even possible even a year ago, investors paying governments to own their debt? Spot gold was trading at $1,267 an ounce, while bullion touched its highest since May 18 at $1,271.31.",

Instead, falling yields probably reflect the reduced expectations for US interest rate hikes.

      "bodyText": "Guy Hands conceded in a London court that his reputation was severely tarnished by the disastrous \u00a34.2bn debt-fuelled takeover of EMI and admitted that his legal battle against the US bank was more likely to be beneficial in repairing the \u20ac200m damage to his finances than in restoring his standing in the City. But now, after he has withdrawn his claim against Citi, the financial hole will get larger. He faces a multimillion-pound bill to repay the US bank\u2019s legal costs after withdrawing a legal claim over the takeover of the music group. The EMI deal, clinched just as the credit crunch took the wind out of the decade\u2019s debt-fuelled acquisitions spree, had been a rare blemish on the career of a 56-year-old who is so severely dyslexic that the judge heard that he reads using a blocked colour system he has been using since he was nine or 10. Educated at Oxford, Hands began his career at Goldman Sachs before joining Japanese bank Nomura \u2013 where he earned his reputation as a dealmaker by buying rolling stock company Angel Trains \u2013 and which eventually led to the creation of his private equity firm Terra Firma in 2002. Hands moved the investment house, which owns businesses as diverse as Odeon and UCI cinemas and Wyevale Garden Centres, to Guernsey for tax reasons in 2009. Four years ago, Terra Firma bought Four Seasons care homes \u2013 a business in an industry facing severe pressure \u2013 while the longest running investment, dating back to 1996, is Annington, which leases more than 40,000 homes to the Ministry of Defence. The court also heard about a meeting held in one of the series of upmarket hotels run by his wife Julia, with whom he has four children. In court, Citi\u2019s lawyer Mark Howard had said Hands had been described as an investor with \u201cmagic sauce\u201d, with a reputation for cutting costs and securitising \u2013 borrowing against income streams generated by the business \u2013 and being a good negotiator. They are skills he will need after Friday\u2019s events in court.",

But this is no outpouring of patriotic support for England, Wales and Northern Ireland from retail executives. Shop owners, publicans and restaurateurs are hoping for a sales fillip off the back of a football feelgood factor, with some sectors in particular expecting for a boost from the month-long tournament, although the wider UK economy stands to benefit if workers concentrate on their jobs more than matches. WINNERS Sportswear retailers and brands With all the home nations, barring Scotland, in contention economists see greater potential for a pickup in UK retail sales. Of course, it will help if at least one team survives the group stage. With Nike\u2019s replica England shirts carrying a price tag of more than \u00a350, stores such as Sports Direct and JD Sports will be the big winners from a successful tournament for the three lions. But with Euro 2016 merchandise running from \u00a3250 Nike Mercurial Cristiano Ronaldo boots, to footballs, mugs and 50p packs of Panini stickers there is plenty of opportunity for other retailers to get involved. \u201cThe better the home nation countries do, the greater the potential boost to the economy,\u201d says Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight. And disastrous group stages for the home nations will at least please bargain hunters, he adds. \u201cIf there are widespread early exits, there will be a large number of souvenirs and replica kits in the bargain buckets.\u201d TV retailers The prospect of a major sports tournament, with the Rio Olympics to follow, is just the excuse many Britons need to buy a bigger TV. John Lewis and Argos have already reported a surge in sales while Currys PC World is again running a cash-for-goals promotions with shoppers who have spent more than \u00a3699 on a TV receiving \u00a310 back every time their team finds the net. The market is also being boosted by the growing popularity of Ultra HD TVs, a new technology that offers four times the resolution of HD screens and the promise of seeing \u201cevery blade of grass on the pitch\u201d. \u201cWe know that if customers have already been contemplating getting a new TV, this is the kind of event that will trigger them into action,\u201d said a spokesman for electronic goods retailer Dixons Carphone. Supermarkets The major supermarkets will be the biggest beneficiaries of a strong run for the home nation teams as Britons host match parties and \u2013 weather permitting \u2013 light the barbecues. Based on previous championships, food and sales have been boosted by around 3% during a tournament, compared with the same month in a non-tournament year. \u201cThe theory is that there are a lot more people sat in front of the TV and enjoying a pizza and beer than when a tournament isn\u2019t happening,\u201d says Tim Denison, retail analyst at Ipsos Retail Performance. \u201cAnd if the sun shines too, you invite more people round and have more of a party \u2013 evening games are ideal for extra sales in food and drink.\u201d Pubs and restaurants For many fans unable to soak up the terrace atmosphere in France, the next best thing is a pub packed with fans. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association estimated that beer lovers will sink an extra 17m pints this weekend as England play Russia, Wales take on Slovakia, and Northern Ireland clashes with Poland. \u201cThis summer\u2019s Euro 2016 tournament is a huge opportunity for the leisure sector,\u201d said David Muslin, director of leisure and catering at research firm CBRE. \u201cCity centre pubs will be the initial winners, especially where there are mid-week games. Equally, restaurants will benefit, with diners drawn to eat both before and after the matches.\u201d Takeaway operators are also gearing up for a rush with Domino\u2019s Pizza enlisting an extra 10,000 staff \u2013 a recruitment drive that was publicised by former England football player and manager Kevin Keegan \u2013 ahead of an expected 7m pizza orders. Bookmakers The World Cup and European Championships are the biggest events in the bookmaking calendar and Leicester City\u2019s surprise Premier League win is expected to have boosted interest in football betting. For the listed players Paddy Power, Ladbrokes and William Hill navigating the tournament successfully can make or break their financial year. If England were to win though, bookies might be the only people not smiling. LOSERS Productivity There are also potential losers, as celebratory hangovers and desktop match viewing dents productivity at companies around the UK. Britain\u2019s problem with raising productivity \u2013 economic output per hour worked \u2013 is unlikely to be solved over the next month. \u201cThere is the possibility that there will be a small hit to productivity from people watching the games on TV when they would otherwise be working,\u201d adds Archer. \u201cThere could also be some people taking their holidays in France to watch the football, who would otherwise have taken them at home. However, I suspect that these potential negative factors will be slight.\u201d High street fashion Fashion retailers have already had a tough year as a mild winter was followed by an inclement spring. Socialising with friends during the tournament is just another reason to stay away. England\u2019s opening match kicks-off at the high street-friendly time of 8pm on Saturday, which means at least that drinks and snacks will be bought for the match in the morning or afternoon. But earlier kick-offs could be a problem, according to independent retail analyst Nick Bubb, who warns that daytime fixtures can be \u201cdistracting for shoppers\u201d.",

Britain\u2019s biggest retailer will sell the loss-making restaurants to Boparan Restaurant Holdings, the investment vehicle of Ranjit Singh Boparan, a wealthy British businessman. The price was not disclosed. Boparan owns Harry Ramsden\u2019s fish \u2019n\u2019 chip restaurants, the London chain Fishworks and The Cinnamon Club, the high-end Indian restaurant in Westminster. Boparan is also known as the \u201cChicken King\u201d for supplying processed poultry and ready-meals to supermarkets, including Tesco. He owns Northern Foods, the company behind Goodfella\u2019s pizzas and Fox\u2019s biscuits. Giraffe has 54 standalone restaurants, including 12 franchise sites and three within Tesco stores. Tesco is also selling its 95.5% controlling stake in the Kipa retailer in Turkey to Migros, the country\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, for \u00a330m. The sale will reduce Tesco\u2019s debt burden by \u00a3110m. Migros is owned by the London-based private equity firm BC Partners. Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who took over in 2014 to revive the retailer, has been selling off a string of businesses, including its South Korean chain, to cut debts and focus on the core UK retail operations. There has been speculation that Dobbies garden centres and the Harris + Hoole coffee chain could also be sold off. Lewis said: \u201cAs we stabilise the business in the UK, we continue to focus on where we can best serve the needs of our customers, while ensuring our business remains sustainable for the long term. \u201cGiraffe is a much-loved brand and, while casual dining remains an important part of the shopping trip for many of our customers, we will continue to meet these needs through our Tesco Caf\u00e9s and other providers.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry is losing a key member of its management team after John Smith, chief operating officer, announced plans to step down next year. Smith, who said he was leaving to pursue new interests, is understood to be seeking a chief executive post after seven years at the fashion retailer. He will work out his 12-month notice period. \u201cWith the company\u2019s future strategies now in place, I am ready to embark on a new challenge. Having been the CEO of a fast-growing international business in the past, I am exploring a number of exciting new leadership opportunities in that arena,\u201d said Smith who was chief executive of BBC Worldwide from 2004 to 2012. Smith\u2019s exit comes as Burberry faces pressure to bolster its senior management team with retail and digital expertise amid poor trading figures. Investors have raised concerns that Christopher Bailey, the chief executive and chief creative officer, is struggling to cope with his joint role, which he moved into after the departure of former chief executive Angela Ahrendts in 2014. The company, famous for its trenchcoats, admitted profit was likely to come in towards the bottom of market forecasts in the year to March 2017, amid investment in staff training and IT and a sharp slowdown in China, the retailer\u2019s biggest market. Announcing Burberry\u2019s annual results in May, Bailey acknowledged that the company needed to bring in more expertise to help improve performance. He would not comment directly on rumours that he was seeking a right-hand man or woman, but said: \u201cWe acknowledge that there\u2019s a lot going on in the company and there\u2019s great change \u2026 We have identified skills we need to beef up in the organisation.\u201d Smith\u2019s departure is likely to raise concerns about a further loss of top-level management expertise. It is understood that Burberry is considering whether to replace him or rejig its management structure as part of its existing plan to support Bailey. One source said: \u201cThere\u2019s time. No one is not coming into work on Monday. Any transition will be managed carefully.\u201d Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said the departure of Smith cleared the way for a potential restructure at Burberry that could bring in a digital and retail boss in a role similar to the one Ahrendts holds at Apple. \u201cBurberry needs to go through senior management adjustments, as the organisation based on Chris having a dual role does not seem ideal and results are under pressure. John Smith retiring opens the opportunity for further changes in senior responsibilities,\u201d said Solca. The company and Smith said his departure was not linked to any plans to hire a new retail boss. Bailey said: \u201cJohn has made a significant contribution to Burberry over the last seven years. I have personally valued and enjoyed John\u2019s partnership and I would like to thank John for everything he has brought to Burberry.\u201d The chairman, Sir John Peace, added: \u201cWe would like to thank John for his contribution to Burberry over the last seven years, first as a non-executive director and latterly as chief operating officer, and, in particular, for his success in driving digital growth and optimising the potential of our beauty and travel businesses.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Top FTSE 100 bosses landed pay rises of nearly \u00a3100m in 2015", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ten FTSE 100 leaders enjoyed combined pay rises worth nearly \u00a3100m last year, including a sixfold increase for Tony Pidgley, chairman of housing group Berkeley Homes. The figures drew fire from former business minister Vince Cable, trade union officials and excess pay campaigners, who pointed to the more modest pay increases handed to ordinary workers. The largest increase in terms of monetary value went to Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of global advertising group WPP, who experienced a shareholder revolt over his bumper pay deal this week. Sorrell\u2019s remuneration leapt from \u00a342.7m to \u00a370.4m last year, a 65% increase he defended by saying he reinvests the cash in WPP, which he founded. The biggest rise in percentage terms went to Berkeley Homes founder-chairman Tony Pidgley, whose total deal soared from \u00a33.8m in 2014 to \u00a323.3m in 2015, a rise of 520%, courtesy of a new bonus scheme. After Pidgley, Flemming Ornskov, the chief executive of medical group Shire, was handed the second-largest percentage rise, a near sixfold increase from \u00a32.5m to \u00a314.1m. The third largest rise was awarded to Sky\u2019s Jeremy Darroch, who more than trebled his pay to \u00a316.9m, followed by Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca, who more than doubled his package to just under \u00a34.9m. Seven of the top 10 saw their total pay packet at least double from one year to the next. The increases compare with the 2.9% growth in wages for the average UK worker reported in September last year, when the figure hit a six-year high. Cable, who introduced binding shareholder votes on executive pay and the standardised single figure for chief executives\u2019 pay, said remuneration remained a \u201ctoxic issue\u201d. He said the measures he introduced could only work \u201cif shareholders have the inclination to argue back, which they won\u2019t if you have a company dominated by one individual like Berkeley Homes or Sorrell\u2019s outfit which he built up as a private company\u201d. Cable, who failed in a bid to force companies to publish the ratio of their lowest paid staff to the highest, said firms should be required to consult employees about executive pay. Trade union officials backed calls for employees to be given a role in setting executive remuneration levels. \u201cThese are huge increases on already excessive salaries,\u201d said Paul Nowak, deputy general secretary of the TUC. \u201cWhen workers see only modest increases in their pay packets, it is particularly galling to see multimillionaires\u2019 pay skyrocket.\u201d \u201cBut complaining won\u2019t solve this problem. Ordinary workers need to be included on executive pay committees to add some common sense and reality to boardroom pay.\u201d Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said the increases showed there was a case for revisiting the \u201cpowerful\u201d idea of forcing firms to publish the ratio between executive remuneration and pay on the factory floor. \u201cThe message employees are getting from the top is that times are tough and they have to exercise restraint and manage costs in a competitive world. \u201cThen they look up from their work and see what people at the top are getting. The restraint they\u2019ve been urged to display themselves is badly lacking. \u201cWe think pay ratios are something that ought to be embraced.\u201d Other notable recipients of significant pay rises include Ross McEwan, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, which is still 72% owned by the government after its 2009 bailout. His remuneration more than doubled to \u00a33.78m for a year in which the bank reported its eighth straight annual loss, of nearly \u00a32bn. Reckitt Benckiser, the firm behind products such as Nurofen and Cillit Bang, nearly doubled boss Rakesh Kapoor\u2019s deal to \u00a323m thanks to a bonus scheme but the 81.5% rise only put him eighth place in percentage terms. AstraZeneca and Aviva pointed out that their pay figures for 2015 were inflated by bonuses that paid out for the first time. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the recipients of the biggest rises earn huge multiples of what the staff they employ earn, in some cases several hundreds of times more. Sorrell\u2019s \u00a370.4m deal means he earns more than 1,300 times the average WPP employee wage of \u00a353,251, based on company data showing it has 124,930 staff and total staff costs, including pensions and social security, of \u00a36.65bn. And the 34,700 staff at Reckitt Benckiser earn an average \u00a333,372, meaning 695 of them would have to club together to match chief executive Rakesh Kapoor\u2019s 2015 pay deal. \u2022Additional reporting by Darya Luganskaya \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2016 to correct a statement from Stefan Stern about executive pay.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s construction output bounced back in April and along with strong industrial production data painted a brighter picture of the economy than expected. The Office for National Statistics said construction output rose 2.5% in April from the previous month. This was the biggest monthly increase since January 2014 and surprised economists, who had expected 1.7% growth. However, the rise was not big enough to make up for March\u2019s 3.6% decline. The ONS said some of the rise may be linked to the seasonal adjustment effects around the timing of the Easter holidays this year. Business surveys have pointed to a slowdown in the UK economy in the run-up to the 23 June referendum on EU membership, particularly in the construction sector. A leave vote would hit the industry hard, as it relies heavily on migrant labour. The official data suggests the economic picture may be brighter, with industrial production growing at the fastest pace in almost four years in April. But output in the sector, which makes up 6% of the economy, fell 2.1% between February and April from the previous three months \u2013 the biggest contraction in just over three years. And new construction orders dropped 1.2% between January and March, the sharpest fall since spring 2014, according to the ONS. The breakdown of the figures showed that even though housebuilding in the private sector rose 5.8% from a year earlier, overall housebuilding was only marginally positive because of a near 21% slump in new public housing. Chris Williamson, chief economist at the survey compiling firm Markit, said: \u201cDig deeper and there\u2019s good reason to treat the better news with caution. The underlying trend in fact appears to be one of weakening output, albeit to some extent due to what will hopefully be temporary uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum.\u201d Britain\u2019s economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter from 0.6% in the previous quarter, and closely-watched surveys from Markit suggested growth eased further to just 0.2% in the second quarter of this year.",

      "bodyText": "An early exit of the England team from Euro 2016 would wipe \u00a36bn off the stock market in a single day, according to a finance expert. The European football tournament kicks off with France playing Romania at 9pm local time (8pm BST). Alex Edmans, a professor of finance at the London Business School, believes the effect of football results on the national mood is so strong that it can spill over into the stock market with impacts measured in billions of pounds. He said: \u201cMy research shows that a loss in a major football competition can have a profoundly negative effect on investor mood. Share prices are affected not only by fundamentals but also by emotions. Sports have huge effects on people\u2019s emotions.\u201d Edmans and his co-authors, from the University of Colorado and BI Norwegian Business School, investigated the link between 1,100 international football matches and stock returns in 39 countries in a paper entitled Sports Sentiment and Stock Returns. The results showed that being eliminated from a regional tournament like Euro 2016 led to the national stock market falling by 0.3% the next day. Edmans said: \u201cWhen applied to the UK stock market, this translates into a single-day loss of \u00a36bn.\u201d Guardian sports writers are predicting that Germany, France or Spain could reach the final, with England expected to get as far as the quarter-finals. There is no evidence, however, that there would be a boost to the London stock market were England to go further than expected. Somewhat surprisingly, the Sports Sentiment paper found no effect of a win in any sport, including cricket, rugby and ice hockey. Edmans said: \u201cOne reason could be that sports fans are notoriously over-optimistic about their team\u2019s prospects. If fans go into each game expecting they\u2019ll win, there\u2019s little effect if they do win, but they become depressed if they lose. \u201cAnother is the asymmetry of the competition. Winning an elimination game merely sends you into the next round, but losing leads to instant exit.\u201d",

Share prices are affected not only by fundamentals but also by emotions. Sports have huge effects on people\u2019s emotions.\u201d</p> <p>Edmans and his co-authors, from the University of Colorado and BI Norwegian Business School, investigated the link between 1,100 international football matches and stock returns in 39 countries in a paper entitled <a href=\"http://faculty.london.edu/aedmans/SteelJF.pdf\">Sports Sentiment and Stock Returns</a>. </p> <p>The results showed that being eliminated from a regional tournament like Euro 2016 led to the national stock market falling by 0.3% the next day.</p> <p>Edmans said: \u201cWhen applied to the UK stock market, this translates into a single-day loss of \u00a36bn.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/10/euro-2016-guardian-writers-predictions\">Guardian sports writers are predicting</a> that Germany, France or Spain could reach the final, with England expected to get as far as the quarter-finals. </p> <p>There is no evidence, however, that there would be a boost to the London stock market were England to go further than expected. Somewhat surprisingly, the Sports Sentiment paper found no effect of a win in any sport, including cricket, rugby and ice hockey.</p> <p>Edmans said: \u201cOne reason could be that sports fans are notoriously over-optimistic about their team\u2019s prospects. If fans go into each game expecting they\u2019ll win, there\u2019s little effect if they do win, but they become depressed if they lose. </p> <p>\u201cAnother is the asymmetry of the competition. Winning an elimination game merely sends you into the next round, but losing leads to instant exit.\u201d</p>",

Activists opposed to Australia\u2019s largest proposed export coal venture have been pressing the commonwealth on whether its $5bn infrastructure fund will be available to Adani to build a railway that was once in line for a state loan. But this week, the federal director of the Liberal party, Tony Nutt, wrote to the WWF Australia president, Dermot O\u2019Gorman, to say the government had ruled out funding the Indian conglomerate\u2019s $16bn, 60-year thermal coal project in north Queensland\u2019s Galilee basin. \u201cThe Australian government has already ruled out funding for Adani as any investment is up to the private company to make,\u201d Nutt said. A spokeswoman for Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS), Imogen Zevothen, said conservationists \u201cstrongly welcome this commitment from the Liberal party to rule out any public funding for Adani\u201d. \u201cThat should put the nail in the coffin for this project,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re aware, there hasn\u2019t been such an unambiguous statement before. \u201cThat\u2019s why we warmly welcome this very clear statement that there will be no taxpayer funding for this highly damaging project \u2013 damaging to the climate and damaging to the reef.\u201d The messages from the government have been mixed \u2013 the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told an activist last week there was \u201cno public money for Adani\u201d. But his office later told New Matilda it was still possible the independent board overseeing the $5bn Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) could grant Adani low-interest loans for the railway. This was in line with the position outlined by the minister for northern Australia, Josh Frydenberg, over the last nine months that while the Carmichael project was \u201ca commercial operation [that] needs to stand on its own feet\u201d, all investment decisions by the NAIF would be made by its board. Nutt was responding to requests from WWF and AMCS for information to compile a \u201cscorecard\u201d on major party policies around the Great Barrier Reef this election. Zevothen said this meant \u201cboth major parties have now ruled out any public funding for Adani\u201d after a similar commitment from the opposition leader, Bill Shorten. Adani has most key project approvals in place but has struggled to gain financial backing for the $16bn project amid a coal market slump and what it said were delays caused by legal challenges from activists. It has argued that the project is crucial to increasing electricity supply to India. Conservationists say the emissions from burning up to 60m tonnes of coal a year would have a dire impact on efforts to limit global warming.",

A weaker oil price - Brent crude is down 1% at $51.38 - has hit commodity stocks, with BP down 3.6p at 370.55p as it unveiled a deal to merge its Norwegian assets with those of Det norske. Financial shares are also lower as investors seek havens for their cash, pushing bond yields close to negative territory. Barclays is 3.8p lower at 172.25p and Standard Chartered down 11.3p at 524.1p. Standard Life has dropped 6.9p to 323.7p as UBS cut its target price from 380p to 347p. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 73.41 points to 6158.48 after hitting a near six week high earlier on Tuesday. Downbeat comments from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi on Thursday, and billionaire investor George Soros warning of the risks of Brexit were among the factors weighing on investors\u2019 minds. A number of recent polls have shown the Leave campaign gaining ground or indeed leading the way. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: The FTSE 100 was firmly down in early trading after US and Asian markets retreated overnight on weakening oil and wider commodity prices and with Brexit uncertainty growing ahead of the EU referendum. Tesco has fallen 2.95p to 154.95p despite selling its Turkish business and Giraffe cafe chain. Sainsbury, which said its finance director John Rogers would become the chief executive of Argos-owner Home Retail when its takeover of the business is complete, is down 2.8p at 244.7p. Among the mid-caps recruitment group Hays has fallen 8.6p to 126.4p after Deutsche Bank issued a sell note with a 105p target price in a note on the staffing sector. PageGroup is 26.5p lower at 372.5p as Deutsche slashed its target price from 530p to 290p. Rival SThree is down 27p at 324p as it warned of more difficult market conditions in banking and finance in the UK and US. On staffing agencies Deutsche said: Staffing and recruitment companies have already de-rated and as such it is tempting to try and look through the downgrades, however, we believe it is too early to say that a downturn is \u201cin the price\u201d until the earnings downgrades have started to come through. We believe that slower US growth will be a precursor to weaker growth in other geographies. The US (JOLTS survey), UK, Japan and Germany all have job vacancies above their previous peak such that a de-rating of earnings growth seems sensible.",

A number of recent polls have shown the Leave campaign gaining ground or indeed leading the way. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The FTSE 100 was firmly down in early trading after US and Asian markets retreated overnight on weakening oil and wider commodity prices and with Brexit uncertainty growing ahead of the EU referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tesco</strong> has fallen 2.95p to 154.95p despite <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/10/tesco-sells-giraffe-chicken-king-boparan-harry-ramsdens\">selling its Turkish business and Giraffe cafe chain.</a></strong><strong> Sainsbury</strong>, which said its finance director John Rogers would become the chief executive of Argos-owner Home Retail<strong> </strong>when its takeover of the business is complete, is down 2.8p at 244.7p.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps recruitment group <strong>Hays</strong> has fallen 8.6p to 126.4p after Deutsche Bank issued a sell note with a 105p target price in a note on the staffing sector. <strong>PageGroup</strong> is 26.5p lower at 372.5p as Deutsche slashed its target price from 530p to 290p. Rival <strong>SThree</strong> is down 27p at 324p as it warned of more difficult market conditions in banking and finance in the UK and US. On staffing agencies Deutsche said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Staffing and recruitment companies have already de-rated and as such it is tempting to try and look through the downgrades, however, we believe it is too early to say that a downturn is \u201cin the price\u201d until the earnings downgrades have started to come through.</p> <p>We believe that slower US growth will be a precursor to weaker growth in other geographies. The US (JOLTS survey), UK, Japan and Germany all have job vacancies above their previous peak such that a de-rating of earnings growth seems sensible. </p> </blockquote>",

Home Retail\u2019s chief executive, John Walden, will step down. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, is scrutinising the \u00a31.4bn deal and both companies are confident it will be completed in the third quarter. As chief executive of Home Retail, Rogers will oversee the combination of Sainsbury\u2019s non-food business with Argos and the digital transformation of Home Retail. He will be based at Home Retail\u2019s headquarters in Milton Keynes. Rogers, who has been in his current role since 2010, is responsible for finance, group strategy, the online business, business development, procurement, property and Sainsbury\u2019s bank. He will be succeeded as Sainsbury\u2019s CFO by Ed Barker, the group\u2019s finance director, who joined from Burberry in 2008. Argos reported its strongest sales performance in two years on Thursday, but Home Retail also revealed it had set aside \u00a330m to compensate store card customers who were charged \u201cexcess fees\u201d. Returning to like-for-like sales growth for the first time in six quarters, Argos fared better than Sainsbury\u2019s, which reported an 0.8% slide in the last three months after cutting back on promotions and said the market remained tough.
