      "body": "<p>With US markets hitting new peaks, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> started the week on a positive note.</p> <p>The index finished 30.02 points higher at 6723.46, as investors continued to be buoyed by the prospect of the US Federal Reserve maintaining its economic stimulus programme. There was also optimism that China's recently announced economic reforms could support global growth.</p> <p>Among the risers <strong>J. Sainsbury</strong> added 2.5p to 411.5p as Shore Capital raised its recommendation from hold to buy. This is the first time the broker has put Sainsbury on its buy list for four years. Analysts Darren Shirley and Clive Black said:</p> <blockquote> Sainsbury's interim results were ahead of Shore Capital and market expectations, driven by a stronger-than-expected margin performance.

      "bodyText": "With US markets hitting new peaks, the FTSE 100 started the week on a positive note. The index finished 30.02 points higher at 6723.46, as investors continued to be buoyed by the prospect of the US Federal Reserve maintaining its economic stimulus programme. There was also optimism that China's recently announced economic reforms could support global growth. Among the risers J. Sainsbury added 2.5p to 411.5p as Shore Capital raised its recommendation from hold to buy. This is the first time the broker has put Sainsbury on its buy list for four years.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Collier, boss of hospital group BMI, has warned of a \"clear and immediate concern\" facing the indebted private healthcare business, which is battling to persuade competition regulators it is not making excessive profits. Despite revealing on Monday that top line operating profits for the year to September of \u00a357m, up from \u00a350m a year earlier, much of that sum was wiped out by \u00a340m of maintenance and other capital expenditure costs as well as close to \u00a310m of recurring interest bills on the group's borrowings. The looming crisis facing the group could have a serious impact on the NHS, which last year accounted for 33% of BMI's caseload, up from 29% for 2012. Together with rivals Spire and HCA, BMI has been targeted in provisional findings by the Competition Commission, with regulators indicating they intend to enforce a sell-off of up to 20 hospital sites. In September, the Guardian revealed the regulators were expected to revise down the disposal target to about 13, with an enforced sale of 10 sites likely to be imposed on BMI. The commission has been unsympathetic to BMI's stretched finances because its calculations do not make allowances for businesses which take on heavy borrowings or rental commitments. \"If the profits you make are wiped out by [onerous interest or rental costs] that doesn't remove the competition problem,\" one official said. Collier submitted his response to the commission earlier this month and will sit down with the regulator in a private meeting next Monday to further lay out his concerns. \"We continue to assess the potential impact of the proposed remedies \u2026 and we are very concerned about the significant detrimental impact they could have on patients and healthcare delivery in the UK.\"",

Independent inspections for the company \u2013 which owns Asda in the UK \u2013 found that 32 of its 200 factories required urgent work to fix serious failings, including one factory that was so unsafe it had to be shut down and another with an illegal eighth floor containing the staff canteen. Most of those factories have since carried out remedial work, but production is still temporarily halted at two factories, which have failed to make the improvements required for basic safety since the inspections started in May. The inspections were carried out after the Rana Plaza disaster in April, when more than 1,100 workers died and many more were injured after a factory collapsed. The problems emerged as Walmart published a list of 75 of the 200 factories that had been inspected and rated on electrical and building safety, from A, which would be a model factory, to D, the worst level. The paperwork did not give details of the problems at each factory, but Jay Jorgensen, the company's global compliance officer, said the worst problems included the factory with an additional floor and another with an extra building that it did not have paperwork for. Walmart had promised to publish a list of the factories it had inspected in June, but Jorgensen said the process had been delayed by civil unrest and difficulties in sourcing sufficient new materials, such as fire doors.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The \"one in, one out\" game of count the female bosses running blue chip British businesses continued on Monday when BT Group's Liv Garfield was unveiled as the new boss of the water company Severn Trent. Garfield, 38, who has been responsible for the \u00a32.5bn rollout of super-fast fibre broadband as boss of BT's Openreach division, will singlehandedly boost the number of women leading FTSE 100 companies by 25% when she takes up the role in spring 2014. Currently, there are just three other women running FTSE 100 companies: Carolyn McCall at easyJet, Angela Ahrendts at Burberry and Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco. A fourth will almost certainly join their ranks next month as newly-privatised Royal Mail, run by Canadian Moya Greene, joins the FTSE 100. However, Ahrendts is quitting Burberry in mid-2014 to join Apple, and is to be replaced by Christopher Bailey. Yorkshire-born Garfield \u2013 whose pay and bonus package at Severn Trent could reach \u00a32.4m a year \u2013 has built a strong reputation in business circles, serving as a non-executive director at Tesco and being named in September as one of the top 10 young high-flyers in Fortune Magazine's annual 40 under 40 list \u2013 making her the highest ranking Brit in the league table. Her appointment to run Severn Trent comes two and half years after Lord Davies set a goal for a quarter of the seats in the boardrooms of the UK's 100 largest firms to be held by women by 2015. At the time, women held 12.5% of the positions and there were 21 all-male boards, so FTSE boardrooms now being 19% female -\u2013 with just five all male boards \u2013 looks like a triumph. Most of the gains, though, have been achieved by companies hiring part-time non-executive directors \u2013 the area that Germany is now attempting to address via legislation \u2013 rather than full time executives such as Garfield. However, Helena Morrissey, the boss of City fund manager Newton Investment Management and founder of the 30% Club, which campaigns to bring more women onto boards, said quotas such as that proposed in Germany were not welcome: \"[Germany's move] is disappointing, unhelpful and unnecessary. Meaningful, sustainable change requires voluntary, business-led action. The sharp pick-up in the pace of change in the UK over the past three years shows that progress can and will be made once business leaders see this as mainstream to their success.\" The proportion of full-time female executive directors in FTSE 100 companies has reached just 6.1% \u2013 up from 5.5% when Davies set out his targets, partly because every addition seems to come just as another women drops off the list. When McCall, a former chief executive of Guardian Media Group, became a FTSE boss on the elevation of easyJet to the bluechip index earlier this year, her appointment came just as two other women \u2013 Dame Marjorie Scardino of Pearson and Cynthia Carroll of Anglo American \u2013 had just announced they were stepping down from their roles.",

At the time, women held 12.5% of the positions and there were 21 all-male boards, so FTSE boardrooms now being 19% female -\u2013 with just five all male boards \u2013 looks like a triumph.</p> <p>Most of the gains, though, have been achieved by companies hiring part-time non-executive directors \u2013 the area that Germany is now attempting to address via legislation \u2013 rather than full time executives such as Garfield.</p> <p>However, Helena Morrissey, the boss of City fund manager Newton Investment Management and founder of the 30% Club, which campaigns to bring more women onto boards, said quotas such as that proposed in Germany were not welcome: \"[Germany's move] is disappointing, unhelpful and unnecessary. Meaningful, sustainable change requires voluntary, business-led action. The sharp pick-up in the pace of change in the UK over the past three years shows that progress can and will be made once business leaders see this as mainstream to their success.\"</p> <p>The proportion of full-time female executive directors in FTSE 100 companies has reached just 6.1% \u2013 up from 5.5% when Davies set out his targets, partly because every addition seems to come just as another women drops off the list.</p> <p>When McCall, a former chief executive of Guardian Media Group, became a FTSE boss on the elevation of easyJet to the bluechip index <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/04/easyjet-fly-ftse-100\" title=\"\">earlier this year</a>, her appointment came just as two other women \u2013 Dame Marjorie Scardino of Pearson and Cynthia Carroll of Anglo American \u2013 had just announced they were stepping down from their roles.</p>",

However, the UK blue-chip index is still lagging behind some of its continental and US equivalents.</p> <p>The FTSE is still around 1.5% below the May highs, whereas the S&amp;P500 and DAX are 7% above their equivalent levels. The relative under-performances by the mining sector and financials have caused some drag for the FTSE in recent months, but if US strength continues it can surely only be a matter of time before the UK index sets fresh highs for the year.</p> <h2>US markets</h2> <p>Another day, another all-time high for the Dow Jones. The opening on Wall Street saw the Dow push through the 16,000 level, giving a year-to-date performance of 22%.</p> <p>These are impressive gains by any normal measure, and it can be tempting to feel that a top cannot be too far away. Many fingers have been burnt this year trying to predict that major turning point. But for now at least, with an accommodative central bank, it appears that investors are more afraid of missing out on gains than of losing in any immediate downturn.</p> <p>Some would see this sort of psychology as warning enough that the enthusiasm is starting to get out of hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJones_IG/statuses/402477083282407424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Here are the IG closing market comments: <a href=\"http://t.co/ja4x6dtD8K\">http://t.co/ja4x6dtD8K</a></p>&mdash; David Jones (@DavidJones_IG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJones_IG/statuses/402477083282407424\">November 18, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-528a4e89e4b0f15d741f60c0\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T17:40:17.837Z\">5.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European stock markets close higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f3425539-8777-4e87-91a9-df89e3d6a962\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/18/1384796384062/972273a4-305d-499c-a119-9954254b749d-460x275.jpeg\" alt=\"The curve of the German share price index DAX board, is pictured at the Frankfurt stock exchange November 18, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The DAX board at the Frankfurt stock exchange today.

There would be new property rights for farmers, and an easing of restrictions on where people can work.</p> <p>Beijing is also proposing a shakeup of how state-owned firms are run, and also wants to encourage partnerships between private firms and public ones.</p> <p><strong>Just the kind of initiatives to please the stock markets, in fact.</strong> But there's one serious caveat that might have been downplayed -- these are proposals, not new policies ready to be implemented.&#xa0;</p> <p>There's good analysis on this over on Bloomberg:&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-17/china-s-bold-contradictory-reform.html\"><strong>China\u2019s Bold, Contradictory Reform</strong></a></p> <p>Here'a a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The plan calls for results by 2020. Putting the ideas into effect will involve every level of government and multiple layers of China\u2019s labyrinthine bureaucracy. Liberalization threatens vested interests and will be met with resistance. Good results are by no means guaranteed.</p> <p>Another reason to withhold judgment is that the party statement undoubtedly envisions a more market-based economy -- yet not what one might call a normal country with a normal system of government. Its statement is rife with the contradictions that flow from this.</p> <p>The Communist Party frowns on what it calls contradictions, and it constantly dedicates itself to eliminating them more boldly -- but the anomalies it has in mind are labor disputes, street protests and \u201cemergencies on the Internet.\u201d The jarring tensions between state and liberty, state and market, and one-party rule and democracy are barely noted in the document, much less confronted or resolved.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T17:08:02.082Z\">at 5.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-528a4071e4b05b42ae1b6994\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T16:30:54.253Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Camilla Sutton</strong>, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, confirms that China's latest economic reform plans are pushing shares up in many markets.</p> <p>She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Risk appetite is strong... after details of China's reform prove more dramatic than expected, suggesting a focus on market liberalization and reforms in both the government role and the broader corporate structure.</p> </blockquote> <p>(<em>via Reuters</em>)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-528a3af9e4b02747f7fb8e5f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T16:08:55.222Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US dollar has lost ground against the euro today, dropping 0.2%, meaning \u20ac1 is now worth $1.3526.</p> <p>Again, the prospect of the Federal Reserve maintaining the flow of easy money is driving market sentiment.</p> <p><strong>Here's more from Christopher Vecchio&#xa0;</strong>of DailyFX:&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US Dollar continues to edge lower in the days after Federal Reserve Chairwoman nominee Janet Yellen\u2019s Senate testimony on Thursday, as the soon-to-be most powerful woman in the world made clear her intentions to keep monetary policy as loose as possible in the near-term.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-528a39cbe4b05b42ae1b698a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T16:04:54.101Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US investors have got one eye on the upcoming release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting, on Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>Those minutes will show how many Fed committee members see a case for tapering (cutting) its $85bn/month QE programme, and how many want to leave it alone for some time.</p> <p><strong>Michael Hewson of CMC Markets</strong> doesn't expect much new clarity, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the focus on the latest minutes it remains quite likely that they won\u2019t tell us too much that we don\u2019t already know given Janet Yellen\u2019s comments last week.

In 2011\u201312, higher public spending per person in Scotland was more than matched by higher revenues from activity in the North Sea.</p> <p>However, over the long-term, revenues from the North Sea will probably decline and official population projections suggest that the average age of the Scottish population will increase more rapidly than for the UK as a whole, putting greater upward pressure on many areas of public spending. As a result, to ensure long-run fiscal sustainability, an independent Scotland would need to cut public spending and/or increase other tax revenues more than would be required across the UK as a whole.<a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6952\"><strong>Read the full report here:</strong></a></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessbrammar/statuses/402376754779947008\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Wow, a pretty damning verdict on the economic viability of an independent scotland from the IFS.

      "bodyText": "Over on Wall Street - the Dow Jones has dropped back from its record high but is still clinging above the 16,000 mark. It's currently up 39 points at 16,006, a gain of 0.28%, and on track for a new closing high (although there's still three hours trading to go). Boeing remains the leading stock, up 2% after announcing plenty of new deals at the Dubai Airshow. As in Europe, banking shares are also up - with JP Morgan gaining 1.8% and Goldman Sachs up 1.6%. Here's our news story on the Dow's latest rally: Dow Jones industrial average crosses 16,000 for first time And that's a good moment to stop for the evening here in London. Back tomorrow for more. Until then, goodnight and thanks (as ever) for the comments. GW Here's David Jones of IG's closing market report: European markets It has been yet another positive session for European markets, with the German DAX hitting fresh all-time highs. The FTSE has had a more cautious start, but found its feet as the morning went on and soared through the 6700 level. However, the UK blue-chip index is still lagging behind some of its continental and US equivalents. The FTSE is still around 1.5% below the May highs, whereas the S&amp;P500 and DAX are 7% above their equivalent levels. The relative under-performances by the mining sector and financials have caused some drag for the FTSE in recent months, but if US strength continues it can surely only be a matter of time before the UK index sets fresh highs for the year. US markets Another day, another all-time high for the Dow Jones. The opening on Wall Street saw the Dow push through the 16,000 level, giving a year-to-date performance of 22%. These are impressive gains by any normal measure, and it can be tempting to feel that a top cannot be too far away. Many fingers have been burnt this year trying to predict that major turning point. But for now at least, with an accommodative central bank, it appears that investors are more afraid of missing out on gains than of losing in any immediate downturn. Some would see this sort of psychology as warning enough that the enthusiasm is starting to get out of hand. It's all over in Europe's stock markets, where the main indices have all risen on the back of the China rally. The German DAX is the stand-out performer, closing at a new record high as the new 'risk-on' mentality sparked by Beijing's plans sent shares up across the region. Peripheral bank stocks performed well, leading the risers in Milan and Madrid. Here's how it finished: FTSE 100: up 30 points at 6723, +0.45% German DAX: up 56 points at 9225, +0.6% French CAC: up 28 points at 4320, +0.66% Italian FTSE MIB: up 418 points at 19,105. +2.2% Spanish IBEX: up 87 points at 9,783, +0.9% The rally began softly enough, after shares in Hong Kong and Shanghai had rallied over 2%. But it gathered pace through the day, helped by the prospect of continued stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve. The gold price, meanwhile, is down around 1% - confirming that investors were less fearful today. Reaction to follow.... Back in Spain, King Juan Carlos's decision to scupper his own yacht in solidarity with those suffering from the financial crisis has rather backfired. From Barcelona, Stephen Burgen reported: King Juan Carlos' gesture of frugality earlier this year when he renounced his yacht has backfired after a court ruled that the crew were owed \u20ac1.2m (\u00a31m) in payment for illegal dismissal. The money will come from the Patrimonio Nacional, Spain's equivalent of the civil list. In short, the taxpayer will foot the bill. The 41.6-metre (137ft) yacht, called Fortuna, was moored in Mallorca and cost \u20ac21m. It was a gift from a consortium of businessmen in the Balearic islands, each of whom contributed \u20ac600,000. Now that the king has renounced the yacht, they plan to recoup some of their outlay by selling the vessel. More here, including details of the captain's not-inconsiderable salary: Spanish taxpayers pay price as king goes from have-yacht to have-not As I explained back at 8am GMT, China's government is proposing a raft of economic reforms, following last week's party meeting. The plan would see its financial sector more liberalised - giving the markets more control over interest rates and the cost of water, and energy supplies. There would be new property rights for farmers, and an easing of restrictions on where people can work. Beijing is also proposing a shakeup of how state-owned firms are run, and also wants to encourage partnerships between private firms and public ones. Just the kind of initiatives to please the stock markets, in fact. But there's one serious caveat that might have been downplayed -- these are proposals, not new policies ready to be implemented. There's good analysis on this over on Bloomberg: China\u2019s Bold, Contradictory Reform Here'a a flavour: The plan calls for results by 2020. Putting the ideas into effect will involve every level of government and multiple layers of China\u2019s labyrinthine bureaucracy. Liberalization threatens vested interests and will be met with resistance. Good results are by no means guaranteed. Another reason to withhold judgment is that the party statement undoubtedly envisions a more market-based economy -- yet not what one might call a normal country with a normal system of government. Its statement is rife with the contradictions that flow from this. The Communist Party frowns on what it calls contradictions, and it constantly dedicates itself to eliminating them more boldly -- but the anomalies it has in mind are labor disputes, street protests and \u201cemergencies on the Internet.\u201d The jarring tensions between state and liberty, state and market, and one-party rule and democracy are barely noted in the document, much less confronted or resolved. Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, confirms that China's latest economic reform plans are pushing shares up in many markets. She said: Risk appetite is strong... after details of China's reform prove more dramatic than expected, suggesting a focus on market liberalization and reforms in both the government role and the broader corporate structure. (via Reuters) The US dollar has lost ground against the euro today, dropping 0.2%, meaning \u20ac1 is now worth $1.3526. Again, the prospect of the Federal Reserve maintaining the flow of easy money is driving market sentiment. Here's more from Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX: The US Dollar continues to edge lower in the days after Federal Reserve Chairwoman nominee Janet Yellen\u2019s Senate testimony on Thursday, as the soon-to-be most powerful woman in the world made clear her intentions to keep monetary policy as loose as possible in the near-term. US investors have got one eye on the upcoming release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting, on Wednesday afternoon. Those minutes will show how many Fed committee members see a case for tapering (cutting) its $85bn/month QE programme, and how many want to leave it alone for some time. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets doesn't expect much new clarity, saying: Despite the focus on the latest minutes it remains quite likely that they won\u2019t tell us too much that we don\u2019t already know given Janet Yellen\u2019s comments last week. It might be more prudent to study the comments of the various FOMC members due to speak this week, including Dudley and Plosser later today, Evans tomorrow and James Bullard on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Stocks in focus include Boeing after the confirmation of 250 orders for its new 777 airliner at the Dubai air show with Emirates and Etihad the main buyers. Howard Marks, chairman ofOaktree Capital and an influential investor, isn't too impressed by the breathless reporting about the US stock indices hitting various round numbers. It means not a jot, he points out on Bloomberg TV. These numbers have no significance.... They do attract attention, but they don't mean anything. So what should we be thinking about? On a price/earnings measure (ie, what it costs to buy shares in US companies compared to the amount of money they're making), shares are up around 50% since 2011. That has brought P/E ratios back to around their historic post-war average. So, as Marks puts it, \"if you think they [those P/E averages] are still relevant, it means you think the market's reasonably priced\". And that's the 16,000 point question. In a world where economic growth has been scarcer recently, and where central banks will be keen to tighten monetary policy if the good times return, companies may face some tall hurdles in the years ahead... Marks says he believes US growth will be a little faster in 2014 than this year, but it don't reach levels where people actually feel wealthier. Here's a graph showing how the Dow Jones industrial average has risen by around a quarter in the last 12 months: It's been a pretty steady rise, apart from a couple of wobbles since the summer. They were usually prompted by the prospect of central banks tightening monetary policy. The punchbowl of easy money has had it usual effect, and it's not being taken away quite yet. Boeing is the biggest riser on the Dow Jones index, up almost 3% after it reported a $76bn deal to sell 150 777 mini-jumbos to the Emirates airline. If it feels like the US stock markets are hitting new record highs every few days, then you're right. Scarlet Fu, chief markets correspondent for Bloomberg Television, reports that one in every four trading days in 2013 has seen a new record high on the Dow Jones or the S&amp;P 500 (or both). The Dow is up 22% so far this year. What goes up.... The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new record high, jumping over the 16,000 points mark for the first time ever, at the start of trading on Wall Street. The Dow rose 61 points in early trading to hit 16,023, up 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 is also hitting new highs, up 2.48 points to 1,800.66. This is driving global stock markets their highest level in at least five years (the MSCI index of world shares hit its highest level since January 2008 this morning). Traders on Wall Street are reacting to speculation that the Federal Reserve will continue its $85bn/month stimulus programme for several months, before starting to wind it down (or taper it) Christopher Vecchio of Daily FX attributes the rally to incoming Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Last week, she told the Senate banking committee last week that the US economic recovery needed to be supported by the Fed. The rally in China's markets overnight, and in Europe today (details here) are also helping to push shares higher. Our old friend Bitcoin is romping higher today too. The virtual currency hit $600, just a fortnight after crunching through the $300 mark (live price here). The twists and turn of Bitcoin remain quite a mystery (to this bear of little brain, anyway), but it appears there may be a solid news hook to today's rally. The US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is due to hold a hearing on the implications of Bitcoin on law enforcement (following the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, accused of running the Silk Road online drugs marketplace). As Marketwatch explains, the FBI has told the committee that it has an open mind on Bitcoin: \u201cThe FBI\u2019s approach to virtual currencies is guided by a recognition that online-payment systems, both centralized and decentralized, offer legitimate financial services,\u201d Peter Kadzik, principal deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in a letter on Sunday. \u201cLike any financial service, virtual currency system of either type can be exploited by malicious actors, but centralized and decentralized online-payment systems can vary significantly in the types and degrees of illicit financial risk they pose.\u201d There's also speculation that stronger demand from China is pushing the price up (see City AM for more details). The usual caveat applies, though: IG Index is predicting a gentle start to trading on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average tipped to creep a little higher. Another (small) boost for the Irish economy as it prepares to exits its bailout programme next month, reports Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald: Two hi-tech Indian companies have announced they are creating 75 jobs between them in Dublin while 50 posts are also being established in the Irish capital by loyalty card company Value Nation. Synowledge has announced 35 positions as it establishes an international headquarters in Dublin while Aditi Technologies is setting up a European Services and Business Development Centre with the creation of 40 jobs. The move further enhances Dublin's reputation as the bridgehead for international hi-tech companies into the European market, says Henry. However.... There was a reminder over the weekend of the reasons behind Ireland's economic crash particularly its out-of control building and property speculation bubble during the Celtic Tiger years. It was reported that up to 40 so called 'ghost estates' will be demolished under the orders of Labour Minister for Housing Jan O'Sullivan. The empty estates which were built during the construction boom have come to symbolise the collapse of the Celtic Tiger economy. This morning's talks between the Greek government and the Troika (see 12.08pm) appear to have ended. A finance ministry spokesman is telling reporters in Athens that \"all issues\" were discussed, and that the government plans to present its 2014 budget to parliament on Thursday. Back in the stock markets, the German DAX has hit a new record high as European markets follow the overnight rally on the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets with their own rises. Investors continue to give China's new economic reforms a thumbs-up (see opening post for details). They are also cheered by the confident monthly report from the Bundesbank (see here) and the prospect of continued stimulus measures from the US central bank (yes, again...) It all adds up to another day of rising stock markets, as traders remain unconcerned that growth in the eurozone ground to a near-standstill in the last quarter. The DAX has risen 68 points, or 0.75%, to an all-time of 9,236, led by utilities giants RWE and E.ON (both benefitting from an upbeat analyst note from Exane BNP Paribas). Other European markets are also higher today, with financial shares leading the rally. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 32 points of 0.5% - lead by Aberdeen Asset management (up 15% after announcing strong results and the purchase of Scottish Widows this morning). Standard Chartered, RBS and Lloyds are up between 1.5% and 2%. Burberry shares are also in the FTSE risers, gaining 1.2%. It should benefit of Beijing can succeed in its goal of stimulating domestic consumption. As Alastair Winter of Daniel Stewart put it: They [China] are very serious about the switch to consumption... The Burberries of this world are laughing. Italy's FTSE MIB is the best performing index - up over 2%, led by its banks. Spain's IBEX is up 1.3% This means world stock markets are a new five year high, having hit their highest level since January 2008 at the start of trading (as measured by MSCI's daily snapshot of equities at 8am). Here's the situation across Europe (green = up today) It's the start of a busy week in Greece, as finance minister Yannis Stournaras sits down for another session of talks with the country's lenders. Relations between the Athens government and officials from the IMF/EC and ECB are increasingly strained, insiders say, with no agreement over how to address the fiscal gap in Greece's 2014 financial plans. That shortfall is currently seen at around \u20ac1.5bn, Kathimerini reckons, and it's not clear how it will be fixed. Greece's government insists that it cannot implement further austerity, while the Troika aren't convinced that the savings can come from structural reforms. Last Thursday, the eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) urged the Greeks to make more progress. As Athens correspondent Helena Smith explains: Finance minister Stournaras will today try to persuade visiting mission chiefs that next year's budget black hole can be fixed by applying structural reforms. The troika want more wage and pension cuts which many feel will simply tip Greeks over the edge given that they have lost 40% of their disposal income since start of crisis. Greece's government is due to present its 2014 budget to parliament on Thursday, while prime minister Samaras is visiting Germany on Friday to meet Angela Merkel. Analysts at Merrill Lynch are speculating that Greece's lenders may have to accept another haircut: On that Bundesbank report.... Confident stuff from the Bundesbank this morning. In its monthly report, the German central bank reported that: There's a good chance that the economic upturn in Germany will be further cemented in the coming months. It cited increased domestic demand, and an improved global economy. On monetary issues, the Bundesbank said that ECB's current expansive policy was 'justified', but cautioned that there could be dangers to financial stability in the medium to long-term. Interesting, given its boss Jens Weidmann wasn't in favour of this month's ECB rate cut. More on Reuters. Here's the key graph from the IFS's report into an Independent Scotland: The respected thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has been looking at the public finance aspects of an independent Scotland (writes Katie Allen) It believes that if Scotland were to break away it would need a significant cut in spending or increase in taxes, over and above that already announced by the UK government, in order to put its long-term public finances onto a sustainable footing. The IFS, perhaps best known for its meticulous dissection of the chancellor\u2019s budgets, says the scale of such fiscal tightening is likely to be greater than that required for the UK as a whole. The research, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), suggests that even under the most optimistic scenario, the long-run \u2018fiscal gap\u2019 in Scotland would be 1.9% of national income compared to 0.8% of national income for the UK as a whole. Gemma Tetlow, a programme director at the IFS and an author of the report comments: An independent Scotland would face even tougher choices than those faced by the UK over the longer term. In 2011\u201312, higher public spending per person in Scotland was more than matched by higher revenues from activity in the North Sea. However, over the long-term, revenues from the North Sea will probably decline and official population projections suggest that the average age of the Scottish population will increase more rapidly than for the UK as a whole, putting greater upward pressure on many areas of public spending. As a result, to ensure long-run fiscal sustainability, an independent Scotland would need to cut public spending and/or increase other tax revenues more than would be required across the UK as a whole.Read the full report here: Financial market players in the UK generally feel more optimistic about the economic outlook, according to the half-yearly Systemic Risk Survey just released by the Bank of England. But their fears around the current low interest rate environment as well as rising housing prices have increased. Economics reporter Katie Allen has the details: The perceived probability of a high-impact event in the UK financial system over both the short and medium term continued to fall over recent months and is at the lowest since the survey began at the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. According to the BoE\u2019s poll of risk managers at hedge funds, banks, insurers and other financial institutions, 55% (up 5 percentage points from May) now consider the probability low or very low over the next year, 16% (up 3 percentage points) between one and three years ahead. Confidence in the UK financial system has also risen with 18% (up 1 percentage point) completely confident or very confident in the stability of the UK financial system as a whole over the next three years, 78% fairly confident (up 8 percentage points) and only 4% not very confident (down 9 percentage points). And here are more key quotes from the report (online here): Perceptions of the two main risks to the UK financial system remain sovereign risk and the risk of an economic downturn, although citations of both have fallen. Concerns over sovereign risk continue to focus on Europe, but unsurprisingly given the uncertainty surrounding US debt ceiling negotiations that prevailed during the survey period, there was a sharp increase in concerns around US sovereign risk. For the second survey in succession, risk surrounding the low interest rate environment was the fastest growing, with 43% of respondents citing it, up 17 percentage points since May 2013. Over half of the responses emphasised risks around low rates, with the remainder referring to risks associated with a snapback in those low rates to more normal levels. Perceived risk around property prices also rose, being mentioned by 36% of respondents, up 11 percentage points since the previous survey. Concerns were concentrated almost exclusively on the residential market, where responses focused on the risk of a house price correction. [end] There is one piece of good news for Madrid residents - street cleaners voted yesterday to end a strike which began two weeks ago. Union and management reached an agreement after lengthy overnight negotiations, which began on Saturday after local government workers began dealing with the piles of rubbish that littered the Spanish capital. The strike began after the private firms who run cleaning and rubbish collection on Madrid's streets announced more than 1,100 job cuts and threatened to cut the pay of the remaining 5,000 employees. The deal hammered out over the weekend will save jobs, but mean wage cuts. as CNN reports: In the predawn deal on Sunday, management agreed not to lay off anyone; but in exchange, the workers will be subject to 1.5-month furloughs each year through 2017, equivalent to about a 9% salary reduction, Aguilar said. \"Under the circumstances, we achieved something good,\" said Francisco Aguilar [a local leader of the CGT union] on the unions' insistence on saving jobs in the economic crisis in Spain, which has a 25.9% jobless rate and 5.9 million people out of work. The youth jobless rate is 54%. Tourism officers and businesses had warned that the sight of refuse heaped up across the capital was harming Spain's image, as well as being most unpleasant for people on the streets. Our man in Barcelona, Stephen Burgen, reports that the Spanish population remain pessimistic about prospects despite seeing Spain from recession. A mea culpa from Goldman Sachs may raise spirits, though. Stephen writes: Despite a series of upbeat predictions from the Spanish government and a range of financial institutions, people on the ground see no reasons to be cheerful about the Spanish economic recovery. In a poll published in El Mundo newspaper, 88% of Spaniards say they have not personally witnessed any improvement, while 75% don\u2019t believe the country is exiting the crisis. Even supporters of the ruling Partido Pouplar show little sign of optimism, with 79% saying they have yet to spot any green shoots. Altogether, a mere 15% of those polled believe the recovery is at hand. To complicate matters further for the cash-strapped government, 69% of Spaniards are calling for tax cuts. Goldman Sachs is the latest financial institution to upgrade its forecasts for the Spanish economy. In a report titled \u201cMea culpa or mea maxima culpa?\u201d the bank admits there were errors in its previous assessment of the prospects for a Spanish recovery. In October 2012 it said that \u201cthe worst is still to come for Spain.\u201d Yves Mersch, Luxembourg central bank governor and member of the ECB's governing council, has declared that eurozone's economic woes are easing - despite growth slipping to just 0.1% in the last quarter. Reuters reports: The worst of the euro zone's economic troubles are behind it and the bloc can look to the future with confidence, European Central Bank Executive Board member Yves Mersch said on Monday. \"I think we should look to the future with confidence. I think there are reasons for that. I think the worst is behind us,\" Mersch said in a speech at the Euro Finance conference in Frankfurt. The Italian PM's speech (see last post) didn't impress Wolf Piccoli, managing director at Teneo Intelligence: On the political situation, economist Meg Greene reckons that Matteo Renzi, the charismatic centre-left mayor of Florence (and a key player in Enrico Letta's own Democratic Party) poses a greater threat to Letta's fortunes than those squabbling right-wingers. There's no dispute over Letta's warning about youth unemployment, though: Italian prime minister Enrico Letta has announced that his government will announce details of its new privatisation plans later this week. Speaking at a conference in Rome this morning, organised by the FT, Letta said he was confident that state asset sales would help Italy cut its deficit in 2014. He said next year would be a crucial time for reforms in Italy, whose economy has shrunk for the last nine quarters. Letta also acknowledged that Italy's young have suffered badly from the economic turmoil of recent years, calling its youth unemployment \"a nightmare\". Italian journalist Fab Goria has the key quotes: Letta also declared that his government was made more stable by the latest developments in Italian centre-right politics. Over the weekend, deputy PM Angelino Alfano announced that a group of right-leading MPs would break away from Silvio Berlusconi and form a new Centre-Right party. Alfano pledged to support Letta, which means the coalition should be secure even if/when Berlusconi leads his remaining supports into opposition. Britain's love affair with Prosecco continues apace, with Majestic Wine reporting a 39% jump in demand for Italian fizz in the six months to 30 September. Total like-for-like sales at Majestic were down 0.4% year-on-year, while profits are up 4.2% (2012 sales were helped by the Golden Jubilee, apparently). Prosecco sales are leading the way. Tough economic times must be driving some shoppers to more affordable bottles - you can get two bottles of Prosecco from Majestic at just \u00a36.99 each. Not that it's not rather glugable in its own right, of course (so I've heard, anyway...) At the top-end of the market, sales of bottles costing \u00a320 or more rose by 15.6%. CEO Steve Lewis is upbeat, saying: These results show we continue to make steady progress towards our strategic growth objectives and we are very well prepared for the peak Christmas trading period. In London, Aberdeen Asset Management shares are up 13% (leading the FTSE 100 risers), after agreeing a deal to buy Scottish Widows from Lloyds Banking Group. A 39% jump in pre-tax profits helped too. European stock markets remain near their highest levels in five years this morning. Aerospace group EADS shares are up 3% after announcing new deals at the Dubai air show, while Switzerland's Sonova jumped 6.6% after raising its profit guidance. In the UK corporate world, BT has lost perhaps its brightest rising star - Liv Garfield. Garfield, who championed and oversaw the rollout of BT's new high-speed fibre optic network as boss of BT Openreach, is leaving to join Severn Trent as CEO. Garfield's rather well respected in the City, having reached the top at a rather young age (she's 38). She came 10th in Fortune Magazine's \"40 under 40\", with this citation: As strategy director for BT, Garfield made the $4 billion case for building out fibre broadband to 19 million UK homes. Now, as CEO of BT\u2019s infrastructure division, she\u2019s doing it, managing more than 20,000 engineers. Recently named to the board of British megachain Tesco, she\u2019s said to be a contender one day for BT\u2019s top spot. Instead, she's going to take over at Severn Trent in early 2014, adding to the ranks of female bosses at Footsie firms (alongside EasyJet's Carolyn McCall and Imperial Tobacco's Alison Cooper, as Burberry's Angela Ahrendts is heading to Apple). Here's a nice interview with Garfield by The Press of York, in which she says her dream job would be to manage Everton Football Club (still time, Liv, still time....) Her biggest mistake? Buying a sports car before finding she was pregnant (she's got two sons). And here's some early reaction: The Chinese stock market rally has driven world markets to their highest levels since early 2008, Reuters reports: 18-Nov-2013 08:06 - MSCI'S WORLD SHARE INDEX HITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE JAN 2008 AFTER JUMP IN CHINA SHARES, REACHES 401.12 That's despite a calm start in Europe, where the FTSE 100 index is up a measly 1 point. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says European markets are trading: around break-even despite the China &amp; Hong Kong rally on wide-ranging reforms including the easing of the one-child policy, more private investment instate-controlled industries and more room for market forces in terms of pricing. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. China's stock markets have posted a decent rally today, as investors hailed details of the Beijing government's latest reform agenda. China's economic and social reforms sent shares on the Shanghai Composite index up by 2.8%. Shares have romped ahead in Hong Kong too, where the Hang Seng is up almost 3% in late trading. Details of the measures were released on Friday. Aanalysts saying President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang's plans are the boldest in decades, and will help China shift to a more western-style economy more reliant on services and domestic consumption. The reforms include: handing more control over the pricing of water, electricity and natural resources to the markets; liberalising the interest rate and currency regime; shaking up the welfare system to encourage labour movement; revamping the rules for stock market flotations; and relaxing the state's control on farmland. (check out CNBC's \"China\u2019s economic reforms: What you need to know\" for more) Stan Shamu of IG says the markets like the look it: After a slow start, markets have picked up momentum in Asia with China leading the way. China has been a focal point today as details from its Third Plenum have finally emerged. The four biggest changes are to the one child policy, the hukou policy (housing registration legislation), private investment and fiscal and tax laws. Different reforms have impacted different industries and the overall reaction today has turned out to be positive, with a sense of optimism that these reforms are for the better. The decision to relax China's controversial one-child policy also boosted shares, as the WSJ explains: Companies that make products for babies also shot higher after Beijing said that it would be relax the one-child policy that has been in place for more than three decades. Hengan International Group Co, a nappy producer, was the best performer on the Hang Seng Index with its 5.8% gain. Infant formula producer Biostime International Holdings rose 3.4%. Encouraging stuff. However, European investors aren't expected to share the rally - with the main markets expected to open pretty flat. Otherwise, it looks like a pretty quiet day... but I'll be tracking all action (such as we can find!) through the day.",

The money will come from the Patrimonio Nacional, Spain's equivalent of the civil list. In short, the taxpayer will foot the bill.

It was a gift from a consortium of businessmen in the Balearic islands, each of whom contributed \u20ac600,000. Now that the king has renounced the yacht, they plan to recoup some of their outlay by selling the vessel.

It is the latest in a string of UK acquisitions by the Canadian fund, whose private equity arm was one of more than 30 potential buyers of Burton's Biscuit Company, whose other brands include Cadbury Fingers and other Cadbury biscuits made under licence, Maryland Cookies and Lyons. Burton's employs more than 2,000 people in the UK and had sales of more than \u00a3333m in 2012, down from \u00a3341m a year earlier. The Burton's management team is to keep a substantial minority stake in the business. The deal is Teachers' second British acquisition in less than three weeks, after it agreed to buy the Busy Bees nursery chain in late October. As with Busy Bees, Teachers' thinks it can help Burton's to expand outside Britain. Jo Taylor, who heads Teachers' London office, said: \"We look forward to supporting Burton's outstanding management team to grow the business in the UK and further into overseas markets. There are also many strategic acquisitions to consider in those territories that can enhance these ambitious growth plans.\" Teachers', Canada's biggest single-profession pension fund with net assets of \u00a377bn, has invested more than \u00a34.3bn in the UK. Its British holdings also include Camelot, the National Lottery operator; Acorn, the special needs schools and fostering company; and stakes in Birmingham and Bristol airport and HS1, the high-speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel. Burton's, whose history dates back to the mid-19th century, is based in St Albans, Hertfordshire, and has factories in Llantarnam, Monmouthshire, as well as Edinburgh and Blackpool. The firm also has a chocolate refinery in Moreton, Merseyside. Last year, Burton's made 85% of its sales in the UK with Ireland accounting for a quarter of its international sales. Its second-biggest market outside the UK was France and it notched up sales in markets such as Scandinavia, Australia, the US and Canada. Ben Clarke, Burton's chief executive, said: \"We have met with over 30 different potential buyers. With their combination of extraordinary financial firepower, true partnership approach and global expertise, it is clear to me that [Teachers'] are the right partner for us.\" Burton's is owned by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and funds managed by the investment firm Apollo Global Management.

      "bodyText": "Sales of prosecco are bubbling over as the Italian sparkling wine replaces champagne as the drink for everyday celebrations and gatherings. Majestic Wine, the specialist retailer, said sales of prosecco were up by 39% in the six months to the end of September while champagne sales remained flat. The success of the Italian fizz contributed to a 4.2% rise in profits at Majestic to \u00a39.5m for the half year, as sales rose 3.3% to \u00a3130.2m. Steve Lewis, the chief executive, said: \"The growth of prosecco is a long-term trend but it has really stepped up this year. It's become a really social drink which is not just for celebrations but for drinking with friends and family on a Friday and Saturday night.\" Majestic Wine's sales reflect a pattern across the market with the number of bottles of prosecco sold in the year to October 65% higher than the previous year, according to market research firm Kantar World Panel. That came on top of last year's 9.6% increase. For the first time, Britons are drinking more prosecco than champagne as sales of the French drink slipped back 1.5% over the same period, on top of an 11.9% slide the year before. The amount of still wine sold has been virtually static for three years. Prosecco's popularity has partly been driven by price. At an average of just under \u00a310 a bottle, it is less than half the cost of a good champagne. \"It's an affordable luxury,\" said Lewis. While champagnes from Veuve Clicquot and Bollinger remain Majestic Wine's second and third most popular wines \u2013 behind a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc \u2013 sales of the French fizz were flat on last year. Customers switching from cheaper champagnes to prosecco have made it the retailer's fourth most popular wine. \"If they are going to buy champagne they buy a really good champagne,\" Lewis said. \"Champagne is still really important to us, it makes up 12% of our sales, but I think it is now a different market from prosecco. Champagne is about personal consumption for celebrations whereas prosecco is for every day.\" Lewis said many galleries and launch events now opt for prosecco over its French rival. For the UK as a whole, champagne sales have dived from \u00a3900m in 2008 to \u00a3599m last year and are expected to continue to fall in favour of cava and English sparkling wine as well as prosecco, according to market research firm Mintel. It said both these sparkling wines have benefited from \"increasing credibility and, crucially, typically cheaper price in relation to champagne\" while champagne's exclusivity has taken a knock from supermarket price-cutting at key times like Christmas. While prosecco sales are growing at the fastest pace, cava sales are far bigger overall, according to Mintel, accounting for around half of sparkling wine retail sales. In comparison, all the Italian sparkling wines, including prosecco, asti and frizzante, account for a third of sparkling wine sales.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management</strong> is leading the FTSE 100 with a 13% rise after its long awaited purchase of fund management group Scottish Widows from <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong>.</p> <p>With Australia's Macquarie waiting in the wings, there had been concerns Aberdeen could get caught up in a bidding war. But it has agreed a \u00a3660m cash and share deal with \u00a3100m deferred depending on future performance. As part of the agreement Aberdeen will manage assets on behalf of Lloyds, which is still 33% owned by the UK taxpayer.</p> <p>The purchase will make Aberdeen the biggest listed fund management group in Europe with assets of around \u00a3340bn.</p> <p>Aberdeen is issuing 132m new shares to Lloyds to pay the initial \u00a3560m, giving the banking group a 9.9% stake in the company. Lloyds has agreed to keep its initial shareholding for at least a year, but can gradually sell down its stake after that. Aberdeen's chief executive Martin Gilbert said:</p> <blockquote> We are confident that this transaction will deliver considerable additional value to our expanded client base and that this will therefore benefit our shareholders. <br> </blockquote> <p>Aberdeen also issued final results showing a 24% rise in revenues to \u00a31.07bn and a 39% increase in underlying profits to \u00a3482.7m.</p> <p>Aberdeen's shares have added 57.2p to 484p while Lloyds has climbed 0.68p to 76.06p. At Espirito Santo, analyst Phil Dobbin said the results looked strong and the Scottish Widows purchase seemed a good deal:</p> <blockquote> At its pre-close [Aberdeen] stated that pretax profit would be at the top of consensus, which at the time was in the mid \u00a3470m's. Profit has actually been reported at \u00a3482.7m, on an operating margin up to 45.4% from 40.6%. The dividend is reported at 16p, up 39%, which will be viewed positively given the announced Scottish Widows deal and we assume that the company will want to maintain dividend growth in the mid-teens going forward. <br> As rumoured Aberdeen will pay an initial \u00a3550m in shares [for Scottish Widow]. Lloyds will end up with a 9.9% holding. The deal is expected to be materially earnings enhancing in year one, will add distribution channels and bring a strategic relationship with Lloyds.

      "bodyText": "Aberdeen Asset Management is leading the FTSE 100 with a 13% rise after its long awaited purchase of fund management group Scottish Widows from Lloyds Banking Group. With Australia's Macquarie waiting in the wings, there had been concerns Aberdeen could get caught up in a bidding war. But it has agreed a \u00a3660m cash and share deal with \u00a3100m deferred depending on future performance. As part of the agreement Aberdeen will manage assets on behalf of Lloyds, which is still 33% owned by the UK taxpayer. The purchase will make Aberdeen the biggest listed fund management group in Europe with assets of around \u00a3340bn. Aberdeen is issuing 132m new shares to Lloyds to pay the initial \u00a3560m, giving the banking group a 9.9% stake in the company. Lloyds has agreed to keep its initial shareholding for at least a year, but can gradually sell down its stake after that. Aberdeen's chief executive Martin Gilbert said: We are confident that this transaction will deliver considerable additional value to our expanded client base and that this will therefore benefit our shareholders. Aberdeen also issued final results showing a 24% rise in revenues to \u00a31.07bn and a 39% increase in underlying profits to \u00a3482.7m. Aberdeen's shares have added 57.2p to 484p while Lloyds has climbed 0.68p to 76.06p. At Espirito Santo, analyst Phil Dobbin said the results looked strong and the Scottish Widows purchase seemed a good deal: At its pre-close [Aberdeen] stated that pretax profit would be at the top of consensus, which at the time was in the mid \u00a3470m's. Profit has actually been reported at \u00a3482.7m, on an operating margin up to 45.4% from 40.6%. The dividend is reported at 16p, up 39%, which will be viewed positively given the announced Scottish Widows deal and we assume that the company will want to maintain dividend growth in the mid-teens going forward. As rumoured Aberdeen will pay an initial \u00a3550m in shares [for Scottish Widow]. Lloyds will end up with a 9.9% holding. The deal is expected to be materially earnings enhancing in year one, will add distribution channels and bring a strategic relationship with Lloyds. The acquired business will be taken on a marginal operating margin of 55%. We view this as a positive set of figures at the operational level and a well-priced acquisition. Elsewhere Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 0.9p to 330.9p after saying it was in talks to sell its retail investor products and equity derivatives business.

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Executive pay increased by 14% last year to \u00a32.1m, with companies accused of making ever-larger share-based awards to deflect public scrutiny of directors' spiralling remuneration.</p> <p>While basic salaries rose 4.1% and annual bonuses fell by 8.8%, the total pay package for an average FTSE 100 director rose sharply through a 58% surge in the value of long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards being cashed in, according to a new report.</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said company directors were \"back to their old tricks\" by exploiting changes made in the wake of outrage over bonuses, so that their pay was increasing 20 times faster than that of the average worker.</p> <p>Latest labour market statistics show average annual wage increases of 0.7%.</p> <p>A majority of FTSE 100 directors receive long-term incentive plans whereby they get company shares that can be cashed in within three years.</p> <p>According to annual research from Income Data Services (IDS), part of Thomson Reuters, the median figure for such awards increased by 58% last year, from \u00a3764,462 to \u00a31,208,940. The more visible annual bonus figure dropped to \u00a3553,200.</p> <p>IDS prefers to cite median figures as more indicative of ongoing trends in directors' pay.

      "bodyText": "Executive pay increased by 14% last year to \u00a32.1m, with companies accused of making ever-larger share-based awards to deflect public scrutiny of directors' spiralling remuneration. While basic salaries rose 4.1% and annual bonuses fell by 8.8%, the total pay package for an average FTSE 100 director rose sharply through a 58% surge in the value of long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards being cashed in, according to a new report. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said company directors were \"back to their old tricks\" by exploiting changes made in the wake of outrage over bonuses, so that their pay was increasing 20 times faster than that of the average worker. Latest labour market statistics show average annual wage increases of 0.7%. A majority of FTSE 100 directors receive long-term incentive plans whereby they get company shares that can be cashed in within three years. According to annual research from Income Data Services (IDS), part of Thomson Reuters, the median figure for such awards increased by 58% last year, from \u00a3764,462 to \u00a31,208,940. The more visible annual bonus figure dropped to \u00a3553,200. IDS prefers to cite median figures as more indicative of ongoing trends in directors' pay. On other standard measures, the figures show an even more rapidly accelerating gap between top and average pay packets. A number of huge share awards at the top of the scale pushed the mean payout from LTIPs last year to \u00a32.57m.

      "bodyText": "More than 100,000 unproductive \"zombie firms\" surviving on low interest rates threaten Britain's economic recovery, according to a report from free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute. The institute claims that 108,000 heavily indebted firms, which generate only enough revenue to pay down interest at historically low rates, should either be allowed to go to the wall or be restructured. Its report says such zombie firms raise the costs of entry for more innovative companies. Banks that continue lending to such firms only undermine competitiveness by preventing workers and money finding their way to the companies of the future. Tom Papworth, senior fellow of the institute and the report's author, said: \"Low interest rates and bank forbearance represent a vast and badly targeted attempt to avoid dealing with the recession. Rather than solving our current crisis, they risk dooming the UK to a decade of stagnation.\" The report, sponsored by a private equity firm, says that a minority of zombie firms could be rescued with restructuring. Papworth said: \"We tend to see zombies as slow-moving and faintly laughable works of fiction. Economically, zombies are quite real and hugely damaging, and governments and entrepreneurs cannot simply walk away.\"",
