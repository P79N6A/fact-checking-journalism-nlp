      "bodyText": "The unwillingness of young graduates to move from their home regions is behind a marked drop in Britain\u2019s labour mobility since the turn of the millennium, a thinktank has said. A study by the Resolution Foundation showed that the share of the population prepared to switch both region and employer in 2016 had fallen from 0.8% to 0.6%. The thinktank said the decline was only partly the result of the deep financial and economic crisis of 2007-09 and came despite a number of factors \u2013 an increase in renting, a rise in the number of graduates and higher immigration \u2013 that would tend to make the country more mobile. It said the evidence was that the decline was being driven by the young, particularly young graduates, many of whom were giving up the chance of getting a pay rise by their reluctance to move. A person under 30 who moves job and employer secured an 11% boost to their wages, the Resolution Foundation said. The stay-at-home tendency among graduates coincided with an increase in the proportion of those with degrees doing non-graduate jobs and, according to the thinktank, was one possible explanation for Britain\u2019s dismal pay and productivity record over the past decade. In 2001, when 31% of graduates were doing jobs for which they were overqualified \u2013 1.8% of people with degrees moved region and employer. By 2016, only 1% of graduates moved region and employer, and 35.6% were doing non-graduate jobs. It said international migrants accounted for an increasing proportion of UK regional job-to-job moves \u2013 up from 8% to 24% over the past two decades \u2013 and warned the government it needed to be alive to the impact of Brexit on labour mobility. Stephen Clarke, a policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe Noman Tebbit notion that the unemployed should be getting on their bikes and travelling around looking for work is obviously outdated, but our thinking on job mobility in the UK has not really evolved much beyond it. With only 10% of those moving regions for jobs previously unemployed, the focus needs to be on why there has been a fall in the share of people already in work moving region and employer, a move that leaves the typical earner \u00a32,000 better off. \u201cJob mobility matters not just for the individual getting the pay rise but to our economy as a whole. On a basic level that\u2019s about avoiding labour shortages, but more importantly in an economy nearing full employment, ensuring the talent and potential of individuals and firms doesn\u2019t go to waste is essential to boosting productivity. \u201cBut not everyone can up sticks. Alongside encouraging more mobility among the minority of in-work people \u2013 such as young people and graduates \u2013 for whom it is often more feasible to move, we should be improving thinking on how people can move into jobs they are qualified for without uprooting their family\u2019s lives. That involves thinking not just about progression and employment, but housing and transport too.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brexit is being blamed for a decline in the number of job vacancies in the City and a drop in applications for key posts compared with last summer. According to headhunters Morgan McKinley there was an 11% slide in the number of City jobs in July, compared with a year ago, and a 33% fall in professionals seeking positions. Hakan Enver, Morgan McKinley\u2019s operations director for financial services, said: \u201cThe City is still haemorrhaging talent because of Brexit, and we risk losing jobs, too.\u201d The firm, however, points to a more upbeat trend in recent weeks with a month-on-month increase in City positions in July \u2013 a period when headhunters would not usually expect to be busy and experience a fall-off in applications for work. The number of vacancies was up 1% compared with June, while there were 12% more jobseekers. Enver said this may have been a reaction to fears that Brexit will end freedom of movement for EU nationals. \u201cNormally the City clocks out for July, but with the industry being swept from under them, people are scrambling to make the most of the time left in the EU,\u201d said Enver. Even so, he said there had been a change of language by City firms about their response to Brexit. \u201cEmployers and employees used to talk about \u2018if\u2019 they had to leave London. Now they\u2019re talking about \u2018when\u2019 they leave London,\u201d said Enver. The Bank of England asked 400 banks, insurers and major fund managers to provide details of their Brexit plans by 14 July. While the Bank has not published details of each firm\u2019s plans, some major employers have started to reveal how they will respond. Barclays and Bank of America are moving staff to Dublin, while Morgan Stanley has picked Frankfurt. JP Morgan has bought a landmark office block in Dublin that could house 1,000 staff, although its chief executive Jamie Dimon said last month that the number of job it moves would depend on demands from the remaining members of the EU.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Australian Council of Trade Unions has criticised a parliamentary report on the black economy, saying it fails to understand how serious wage theft is in Australia. It has called for an overhaul of the industrial relations framework, saying the government needs to make it easier for workers to recover stolen wages from their bosses. It says the so-called \u201cblack economy\u201d \u2013 which includes businesses and individuals operating outside the tax and regulatory system, that deal with cash and often avoid taxes \u2013 is contributing to gross inequality in Australia and works in favour of employers. It has rejected the parliamentary report\u2019s assertion that a key cause of Australia\u2019s black economy is an overly burdensome high tax and regulatory regime, saying the assertion is not supported by any evidence \u201cand is clearly ideologically driven\u201d. \u201cThe mechanisms offered to exploited workers to fight back through the current Australian industrial relations system are too complicated and are financially out of reach for most working people,\u201d the ACTU president, Ged Kearney, said. \u201cTo claw back stolen wages and superannuation, and fight exploitation, workers must spend hundreds of dollars as a starting figure and endure lengthy court proceedings. \u201cThis is a barrier for workers and it creates a perverse incentive to underpay workers and deny them access to their entitlements, safe in the knowledge that the likelihood of being caught and punished is much lower than the potential rewards. \u201cThe use and abuse of the shadow economy as a business model is a clear example of how the rules at work are broken.\u201d The black economy taskforce released its interim report in March, which found the most important determinants of the size of Australia\u2019s black economy were \u201chigh tax and regulatory burdens, and low profit margins, which place pressure on supply chain practices\u201d. It said social norms were the next important factor, with other factors including gaps in the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d, the availability of cash (and other non-traceable payment methods) and the risk of detection and penalties. But the ACTU has dismissed the assertion that high tax and regulatory burdens are to blame for Australia\u2019s cash economy. It says the real driver is the fact that the system is too hard for workers and their representatives to enforce laws and recover stolen wages. It says the Fair Work Act requires a lengthy and expensive process just to enforce employees\u2019 rights via legalistic court proceedings. \u201cThis creates a perverse incentive to underpay workers and denies them access to their entitlements, safe in the knowledge that the likelihood of being caught and punished is much lower than the potential rewards,\u201d the ACTU submission says. The ACTU submission to the black economy taskforce will be released on Tuesday. It says businesses should be heavily penalised for stealing from employees; businesses must be forced to pay payroll tax; sham contracting must be stopped; and multinational companies who pay no tax and underpay workers should never get government procurement contracts. \u201cThe ACTU is concerned that the interim report of the \u2018black economy taskforce\u2019 simply does not address exploitation and wage theft in detail,\u201d the submission says. \u201cA total of five lines were devoted to exploitation of workers in the interim black economy report and the taskforce to date has been found to be wanting in its understanding of the importance of this issue. \u201cIt needs to be much easier for workers and their representatives to enforce laws and recover stolen wages. The Fair Work Act currently requires a lengthy and expensive process just to enforce your rights via court proceedings.\u201d In 2012 the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated the black economy was around 1.5% of gross domestic product in Australia (roughly $25bn a year today), up from 1.3 % in 2001.",

The government said enhanced regulations, due to take effect in July 2018, would better protect an extra 10m UK package holidays booked over the internet. Launching a six-week consultation on the proposals, the consumer minister, Margot James, said: \u201cWhile consumer laws protect millions of holidaymakers from the fallout if a travel company goes into administration, the way we book holidays has changed significantly in recent years and it is important that regulations are updated to reflect this. \u201cOn average, UK households put aside \u00a3100 every month for their holidays. The proposals outlined in this consultation will ensure that an extra 22% of holidays can be booked online with holidaymakers safe in the knowledge that they will get their hard-earned money back if something does go wrong.\u201d The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), the industry body, said changes to the way trips were booked had created a gap in consumer rights. Its holiday habits report 2016 found that more than three-quarters of UK consumers now booked online. Half of holiday arrangements are not financially protected if a company ceases trading. Abta hopes that the changes will provide clearer and stronger protections for holidaymakers, ensuring people who book holidays online enjoy the same rights as those who book with a traditional travel agent. The government is calling for better information to be provided when booking, ensuring holidaymakers\u2019 rights to refunds are clearly set out, along with an extension to current protections to cover the millions of UK travellers who buy package holidays online. Ensuring the business that puts the package together is responsible for the entire holiday even if other firms are responsible for some components has also been suggested as part of the regulations. The new rules are part of the EU\u2019s package travel directive, which comes into force in July 2018. Alex Neill, a managing director of consumer organisation Which?, said: \u201cHolidaymakers should be able to book their trips without worrying about whether they will be protected if their travel agent, airline, or hotel goes bust. The government must make sure gaps in protection are addressed so that consumers have peace of mind however they book their package holiday\u201d. The protection for holidaymakers offered by the government-backed Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol) sometimes fails to cover people buying flights and hotels separately. Last summer, the collapse of budget tour operator LowCostHolidays left 110,000 holidaymakers out of pocket and highlighted how travellers were left vulnerable by booking through websites that appeared to be in the UK but were in fact based overseas so not under the Atol umbrella.",

The Competition and Markets Authority, rightly, is taking a long hard look a merger between the two biggest players in their respective corners of the grocery market.

The agency cited 53,700 breaches and called the failings \u201cserious and systemic\u201d. The board of CBA initially reacted by blaming a software glitch. It docked a few executive bonuses but, even as the deputy governor of the central bank was making pointed criticisms, backed its man. It is only now that reality has dawned \u2013 sort of. Narev will depart by the end of June next year but chair Catherine Livingstone declined to make a link to the money-laundering affair; presumably she would then have to explain why he could yet serve another 10 months. Instead, there was some standard guff about succession planning. Would a big UK or US bank have handled things more decisively? One likes to think so but remember that no senior heads rolled at HSBC after its own money-laundering episode in 2012. At Wells Fargo in the US, chief executive John Stumpf only departed after a scandal involving bogus accounts when he was humbled by a senate committee.

      "bodyText": "Fines, legal bills and the cost of compensating mistreated customers reached \u00a3264bn for 20 of the world\u2019s biggest banks over the five years to 2016, according to new research that raises doubts about efforts by the major financial services players to restore trust in the sector. This figure is higher than in the previous five-year period \u2013 when the costs amounted to \u00a3252bn \u2013 and is up 32% on the period 2008-12, the first time the data was collated by the CCP Research Foundation, one of the few bodies that analyses the \u201cconduct costs\u201d of banks. The report said the data showed that 10 years on from the onset of the financial crisis, the consequences of misconduct continue to hang over the banking sector. The latest analysis shows that in 2016 the total amount put aside by the banks surveyed rose to more than \u00a328.6bn \u2013 higher than in the previous year when there had been a fall from a peak of \u00a363bn in 2014. Chris Stears, research director of the foundation, writes in the latest report: \u201cTrust in, and the trustworthiness of, the banks must surely correlate to, and be conditional on, banks\u2019 conduct costs. And persistent level of conduct cost provisioning is worrying. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether or not the provisions will crystallise in 2017 [or later] and what effect this will have on the aggregated level of conduct costs.\u201d Two UK high street banks \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 are in the top five of banks with the biggest conduct costs. RBS set aside extra provisions for fines and legal costs largely related to a forthcoming penalty from the US Department of Justice for mis-selling toxic bonds in the run-up to the financial crisis. That residential mortgage bond securitisation mis-selling scandal is responsible for \u00a366bn of the costs incurred during the five-year period and the single largest factor, according to the foundation. The payment protection insurance scandal, which is the main reason Lloyds Banking Group is in the list, caused the banks to set aside \u00a327bn during the period. Lloyds has set aside more than \u00a317bn to tackle the mis-selling of PPI. Roger McCormick, managing director of the foundation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that the long-running sorry tale of payments and provisions for PPI must come to an end eventually although UK banks made additional provisions for PPI mis-selling of more than \u00a31.5bn midway through 2017.\u201d The foundation uses five-year rolling periods to try to provide a long-term analysis of the costs that banks face to rectify past mistakes, a major theme of the last 10 years, when they were also hit by penalties for rigging foreign exchange markets and interest rates (Libor). \u201cAs has been the case since the first table, we find ourselves wondering when, if ever, the level of conduct costs will start to decrease,\u201d said McCormick. He noted that the 2016 figures showed a rapid decline in fines from the Financial Conduct Authority, which issued fines worth \u00a3819m in the first six months of 2015 alone, as a result of the market-rigging scandals. Top of the table are major US banks Bank of America, which dominates the table because of its previous bill for the toxic bond mis-selling scandal, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley. The figures include money set aside for future penalties by the 20 banks and fines and other costs they have incurred to tackle regulatory and legal claims. Stears said there would not be zero conduct costs but added: \u201cThe question is at what average level will these costs settle? And, moreover, is that level acceptable to the banks, their shareholders and the public?\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is now apparent that the issue of inequality is the economic topic of 2017. One of the clearest signs of the problem is how the national economic pie is split up \u2013 the latest GDP figures show the share of national income going to employees at 50-year lows. A recent study by the IMF looks at why less of the economic pie is going to workers \u2013 and finds that while global forces are at play, the drop in union membership is a significant factor. The fall in the share of national income going to workers is neither a new thing, nor something which is unique to Australian workers. Indeed, in its April Work Economic Outlook the IMF devoted a chapter to the issue. It found that the share of national income going to labour had fallen during the 1970s and 1980s, levelled off somewhat in the 1990s and then fell again in the first decade of this century: Australia is certainly not excluded from this experience. The decline in the share of income going to Australian workers is in line, and possibly even worse, than in the USA and Canada over the past 45 years: This has real consequences, because declines in the share of income going to labour is quite solidly linked to rises in inequality: The reasoning is pretty obvious \u2013 wages are more evenly spread across households, whereas income that comes via capital (profits from investments) is more concentrated at the higher end of the income scale. But the question is: why has the share of income going to labour fallen across advanced economies, and what is to blame? To answer this question, the IMF has recently released another paper which looks at the issue with relation to the USA. Rather than look across different advanced economies, this paper looks across different industries within the USA to see whether the fall in the share of income going to labour is due to industry-specific factors, or perhaps because of the changing nature of work \u2013 such as workers going from high paying jobs to lower paying ones. While the USA\u2019s economy is different in size and make-up from Australia\u2019s, there are enough similarities that make for a good comparison. The paper found that three main factors caused the decline in labour share of income, and they would be familiar to many Australian workers. First, the paper found that the causes were not industry-specific or geographical, but that \u201cthe decline in the labor share [was] common across most states and industries, with varying degrees\u201d. This means the fall of income going to labour was not because people had shifted to lower paying work in lower paid areas of the country, but that the decline occurred in all industries \u2013 even high paying ones. The biggest factor was \u201ctechnological change\u201d \u2013 mostly from automation of routine tasks. The rise of robots can not only reduce the need for labour in certain jobs, it also redistributes the income from the worker to the employer. The second biggest factor was that of globalisation. Perhaps surprisingly, here the authors are not talking about the ability to offshore work. Indeed, they found there was no link between the level of offshoring and declining labour share of income. What was important was the competition the industry faced from imports and also the level with which the industry was dependent upon imports to make its products. And the final factor was the fall in unionisation. More important than the impact of technological change and trade, the link between the decline in unionisation and the decline in labour\u2019s share of income was \u201chighly statistically significant\u201d and contributed around 19% of the fall in the labour share of income \u2013 roughly the same as that contributed by import competition. The paper noted that in the USA, the number of private sector workers who are union members has dropped by 19% since the early 2000s. Such a drop has also occurred in Australia. Since 2011, the number of private-sector workers in a trade union has dropped 14%: But the drop among public-sector workers has been even larger \u2013 down 18% since 2011. This has seen the percentage of public-sector workers in a union fall from 43% in 2011 to 39% in 2016: And the decline is but part of a very long-term trend. It is scarcely hard to credit that in 1990, 40% of all Australian workers were in a union, compared to just 15% now: That fall in the number of workers represented by a union represents a decrease in the ability for workers to bargain effectively for pay rises. The paper notes that in the USA, the premium on wages in the private sector for union workers is around 20%. The report in some ways is depressing reading for workers. Given the economic benefits of technological improvement and trade, introducing polices to restrict such a thing in the name of improving workers\u2019 incomes would be woefully misguided. Some factors however do have positive impact \u2013 the big one being education. The study found that \u201clabour share declined less (or increased more) in industries that experienced a larger increase in the average education and experience of its workforce\u201d. But while this would suggest increasing the skills of workers and encouraging people to stay in school or go on to further study is important, the report highlights the massive tidal wave of economic forces against which workers are battling. It noted that to completely offset the drag on labour income that comes via the technological change of automation, average schooling in the USA would need to increase by about 2.5 times more than it has since the early 2000s. The forces of economic change and globalisation are here to stay, and while this report finds that policies which encourage education and the improvement of worker skills will improve workers\u2019 share of income and help in the fight against rising inequality, it also makes clear, that the fastest and easiest solution is to join a union.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s exclusive talks on a \u00a3130m takeover of grocery wholesale group Nisa have ground to a halt over fears of intervention by competition authorities. The exclusive talks ended late last week after the Competition and Markets Authority expressed serious concerns about a similar, but much larger, merger between Tesco and the grocery wholesaler Booker. An insider said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s has decided to pause discussions with Nisa until it better understands how the CMA would review any deal.\u201d The CMA referred the Tesco deal for an in-depth competition investigation in July and published full details of its \u201ctheories of harm\u201d this month. The initial findings of the investigation are not expected until October. But the CMA said the \u00a33.7bn merger could potentially damage competition in 350 neighbourhoods as it suggested there was no clear distinction between chains owned directly by Tesco and the Budgens, Londis and Premier outlets it would become a major supplier to after the takeover of Booker. Sainsbury\u2019s is understood to remain interested in Nisa \u2013 which buys and distributes groceries for thousands of small independent stores, many of which operate under its brand name \u2013 and had not been put off by due diligence carried out in recent months. But sources said Nisa had also reopened talks with the Co-op, which had previously expressed an interest in a deal. Nisa\u2019s chairman, Peter Hartley, wrote to the group\u2019s owner members on Monday saying Sainsbury\u2019s was still interested in potentially making an offer for the company but did not feel ready to do so until there was \u201cgreater clarity over the evolving regulatory and competition considerations\u201d. He added: \u201cAnother party that had previously submitted a bid for your company has reaffirmed its interest in making an offer for Nisa and we are discussing this with them. \u201cOur sector continues to change and evolve at pace, many of these changes will shape the convenience sector for the next decade and beyond. The board of Nisa continues to review any serious incoming queries and offers in the best interest of its members.\u201d Nisa, which is owned by its shopkeeper members who must vote to approve any deal, hired bankers this year to advise on its strategic options in light of the proposed Tesco-Booker alliance, which marked a potential major shift in UK convenience store retailing. It has kicked off a rush for consolidation in a highly complex market. Earlier this month, Morrisons signed a wholesale supply agreement with McColl\u2019s, the chain that makes up about 35% of Nisa\u2019s business. That deal will see McColl\u2019s gradually withdraw from Nisa over the next year. Insiders said the Morrisons deal had not been a factor in Sainsbury\u2019s decision not to make a bid for Nisa. It has been suggested that, while it made up a big proportion of sales, the contract was not a major profit driver. Changing habits have shoppers move away from a weekly binge at big supermarkets towards picking up groceries in small local stores as and when they need them. But about 80% of the UK\u2019s 41,000-plus convenience stores are independent or belong to buying groups such as Nisa or Costcutter, leaving major supermarkets out of this growth sector. Only Nisa remains owned by its shopkeeper members, who have a say over its running, including executive pay, rules governing the proportion of stock that members must buy centrally, and the price of goods. Its 1,400 member shareholders own between one and 250 shares out of almost 60,000 in total. Members, more than 70% of whom must be in favour for any deal to go ahead, have expressed disquiet over the potential Sainsbury\u2019s deal which they believe would diminish their independence and control over their supply chain. One industry source said: \u201cIt could be that Sainsbury\u2019s has read the runes that the membership is not happy about that transaction. They would rather remain a mutual.\u201d Both Sainsbury\u2019s and Nisa declined to comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of a London telecoms company has been fired after it alleged that he had been lying about his true identity for at least 17 years and was on the run from US police. Oozi Cats, 56, was dismissed on Monday by Aim-listed Telit Communications after the company\u2019s private investigators found that he was in fact Uzi Katz, named by Boston\u2019s district court as a \u201cfugitive defendant\u201d wanted in connection with an alleged 1990s property scam. Telit, which has lost more than half of its stock market value over the past week, said there was considerable anger that Cats had sought to hide his past from the company he had worked at since 2000. Cats, who has earned \u00a318m from Telit since 2009 and is understood to live at the company\u2019s expense in a villa on the grounds of a 12th-century castle on the outskirts of Rome, did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers said to be representing Cats also failed to respond to requests for comment. \u201cIt is a source of considerable anger to the board that the historical indictment against Oozi Cats was never disclosed to them or previous members of the board and that they have only been made aware of its existence through third parties,\u201d Telit said in a statement. The company, which supplies technologies for the Internet of Things, where items such as fridges and cars are connected to the internet, said investigators at the law firm CMS had found that the evidence showed \u201can indictment was issued against Oozi Cats in the US and this fact was knowingly withheld from advisers\u201d. Questions about Cats\u2019s real identity were raised last week by the financial blog Share Prophets and Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano, which had spotted that Cats and Katz (and their respective wives, both called Ruth Katz) appeared to share the same birthday. The company\u2019s shares rose sharply on the news of Cats\u2019s exit, before falling back, but they still closed up nearly 6% at 131p. The shares had been changing hands at more than 250p before a profit warning and the revelation of the identity allegations last week. Cats is alleged to have fled the US in 1991 or 1992 after he was accused of being involved in a scheme of buying and quickly reselling properties (flipping) to take out mortgages with escalated value. Cats, an Israeli citizen, describes himself as the founder and chief executive of Telit. The company, which has drafted in a crisis management firm, has deleted Cats\u2019s profile from its website. He has been suspended since an emergency board meeting last Tuesday. Telit listed on the Aim market, which has been hit by several scandals, in 2005. A spokesman for Aim declined to comment. Earlier this year, the company boasted that it had secured an order from the electric carmaker Tesla. Telit, which described Cats\u2019s departure as \u201ca difficult situation\u201d, said the finance director, Yosi Fait, would continue as interim chief executive and three independent non-executive directors would be appointed to the board. Fait will conduct a review of the company\u2019s activities and cost base. The company rejected concerns about its financial health raised before the Cats allegations. \u201cThe board is also aware of additional speculation from third parties relating to Telit\u2019s financial condition, trading performance and business relationships, and has considered that speculation in detail,\u201d it said. \u201cThe board confirms that there is no substance to the speculative and accusatory articles that have been published and that it stands behind the group\u2019s audited accounts to 31 December 2016, and the most recently published interim statement.\u201d Cats sold \u00a324m of stock in May soon after the shares hit a record high of 375p, and bought back shares last week at 171p, increasing his stake to more than 12%.",

    "webTitle": "Ryanair calls for airport crackdown on alcohol sales", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair has called for a crackdown on alcohol sales at British airports after claiming that airlines are saddled with the consequences of passengers getting drunk before flights. Europe\u2019s biggest short-haul airline has proposed a ban on early morning sales of alcohol in bars and restaurants, and limiting the number of drinks sold per boarding pass. The call comes after figures showed a spike in alcohol-related arrests at airports or in the air, while a major survey of cabin crew found most had witnessed drunken and disruptive behaviour on board. A code of conduct was introduced in 2016 in an attempt to combat anti-social behaviour by passengers, after the Civil Aviation Authority reported a 600% increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2012 and 2016, mostly alcohol-related. But with the code apparently having little effect, Ryanair urged airports to go further, urging a ban on serving all alcohol in bars and restaurants before 10am, and ensuring boarding cards are produced for purchasing alcoholic drinks, which would be capped at two drinks per passenger. Ryanair accused airports of profiting from allowing limitless drinking in terminals. The carrier\u2019s marketing director, Kenny Jacobs, said: \u201cIt\u2019s completely unfair that airports can profit from the unlimited sale of alcohol to passengers and leave the airlines to deal with the safety consequences. \u201cThis is a particular problem during flight delays when airports apply no limit to the sale of alcohol in airside bars and restaurants. This is an issue which the airports must now address and we are calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, particularly with early morning flights and when flights are delayed.\u201d Passengers are banned from consuming duty-free purchases on most flights. Ryanair has gone further by stopping passengers on certain routes to Spain from Glasgow and Manchester from bringing duty-free alcohol on board. Jacobs added: \u201cWe operate strict guidelines for the carriage of customers who are disruptive or appear to be under the influence of alcohol. Given that all our flights are short-haul, very little alcohol is actually sold on board, so it\u2019s incumbent on the airports to introduce these preventative measures to curb excessive drinking and the problems it creates, rather than allowing passengers to drink to excess before their flights.\u201d The airline\u2019s call came after a survey of 4,000 cabin crew by the Unite trade union found that 87% had witnessed drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports or departing flights \u2013 the majority since the code of conduct was introduced last year. The union said it showed the need for the code to be strengthened, with tougher penalties for disruptive behaviour. A quarter of crew said they believed the drunken passengers they saw had threatened flight safety. More than half of those surveyed said they had suffered verbal abuse as a result. Unite called for an action plan to \u201cstem the tide of drunken and disruptive behaviour\u201d. Arrests for drunken behaviour on flights or at UK airports have gone up by 50% in the past year, according to statistics obtained by BBC1\u2019s Panorama. Police forces covering major airports reported a total of 387 arrests in the year to February 2017, compared with 255 in the previous 12 months. The CAA Air Navigation Order makes it an offence to board an aircraft while drunk. In its draft aviation strategy published last month, the government said it would continue to work with the industry to consider other possible solutions.",

      "bodyText": "One of the world\u2019s wealthiest men has been detained after appearing in court in Israel during a police investigation into allegations of fraud, forgery and money laundering. Beny Steinmetz was remanded for four days after being detained and questioned along with five other prominent businessmen who are also under investigation. The diamond miner was detained last December and placed under house arrest while police investigated allegations that he had arranged for bribes to be paid so that his company, Beny Steinmetz Group Resources (BSGR), could secure half the rights to a lucrative iron ore deposit in the west African country of Guinea. The latest police investigation is understood to concern allegations that contracts were forged in order to move and launder money. Appearing in court in the city of Rishon LeZion, Steinmetz complained that he was the victim of a \u201cpolitical war\u201d that he claimed was being financed by the investor and philanthropist George Soros. Steinmetz was remanded in custody after the senior investigating officer, Avshalom Ahrak, told the court that police feared the tycoon would interfere with their investigation if he was released. A spokesman for BSGR had no comment to make. The other suspects include David Granot, the chief executive of the Israeli telecoms corporation Bezeq, and Tal Silberstein, a former consultant to the former Israeli premier Ehud Barak and to the Austrian chancellor, Christian Kern. When arrested last December, Steinmetz was placed under house arrest while police investigated allegations that he had arranged for bribes to be paid so that BSGR could secure half the rights to a the iron ore deposit in Guinea. Steinmetz was also obliged to surrender his Israeli and French passports, and he was told that he could not leave Israel for 180 days. The deal has been under investigation in the US, Switzerland and Guinea, as well as Israel. Steinmetz and BSGR claim to have won the right to extract iron ore in Guinea in return for a pledge to invest $165m (\u00a3127m) in an exploration programme in the Simandou region of the country in 2008. The company announced 18 months later that it had sold half its stake for $2.5bn. Israeli authorities investigated the claim that Steinmetz, along with a number of other Israelis, acquired the asset by paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes to senior public officials in Guinea. Steinmetz and BSGR deny the allegation, which they say concerns an \u201cobsolete\u201d matter. On Monday, Israeli police issued a statement that said those detained were suspected of having \u201cacted together and methodically with the prime suspect in order to create and present fictitious contracts and deals ... on a foreign country in order to transfer funds and launder money\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a round up of what has been a fairly calm day after last week\u2019s North Korea- inspired uncertainties. There was some mixed economic news across the globe. In Japan, the country\u2019s GDP grew at 4% on an annualised basis in the second quarter, compared to expectations of 2.5% growth. But eurozone industrial production disappointed, falling by 0.6% in June compared to the 0.5% decline analysts had been expecting. And in Portugal, GDP growth fell from 1% in the first quarter to 0.2% in the second, albeit it grew by 2.8% on an annualised basis. But stock markets recovered some ground, on the basis that no news is good news as far as any repeat of last week\u2019s intemperate rhetoric from North Korea and the US was concerned. The FTSE 100 is up 0.47%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.16% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.85%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open just over 100 points higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for - among other things - the UK inflation figures. The Bundesbank has been widely believed to be one of those pushing for the ECB to get on with easing its QE programme. But a speech by German central bank director Andreas Dombret in South Africa suggests it remains supportive of ECB policy. Reuters reports: The European Central Bank\u2019s easy-money policy is \u201cvery much justified\u201d because a recovery in euro zone inflation remains muted, Andreas Dombret, a director at Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, said on Monday. Dombret\u2019s comments suggest the Bundesbank - which has long criticised the ECB ultra-easy policy of massive bond purchases and sub-zero interest rates - would be unlikely to push for an abrupt tightening when rate setters meet again in the autumn. \u201cThe signs of a sustained turnaround in terms of inflation are muted, so far,\u201d Dombret said in a speech in Pretoria, South Africa. \u201cThere is therefore a broad consensus on the whole that an expansionary monetary policy is very much justified.\u201d Dombret said views differed among ECB rate setters on the degree of support. \u201cWhere perspectives do differ, though, is on how strongly the ECB should step on the monetary policy pedal and what instruments it should use,\u201d he said. ECB policymakers are due to discuss the future of their 2.3 trillion euros ($2.71 trillion) bond-buying programme, with a decision expected in October. Market expectations are for an extension of the programme, albeit at a lower pace than the current 60 billion euros per month. As we mentioned before, there has been some pressure on the European Central Bank to ease off on its quantitative easing and low interest rate programme. But the weaker EU industrial production figures and the dip in Portuguese second quarter growth add to the idea this may not happen in the immediate future: Things may be calmer in the markets at the moment but that could change suddenly if the rhetoric from North Korea or the US flares up again. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: Risk appetite is slowly returning to the markets on Monday, with no further escalation between the US and North Korea incentivising a gradual move back towards \u201criskier\u201d assets. I don\u2019t think this signifies a belief that relations between the two countries will suddenly improve, it\u2019s more a case of no news being good news and that will likely continue for as long as it lasts. The problem is that both sides can be rather unpredictable so things could escalate at any point and trigger another dash for safety. Gold, the yen and the Swiss franc may be coming off their highs at the moment but I\u2019m not convinced it will last. It seems this collective \u2013 and possibly temporary \u2013 sigh of relief that we\u2019re seeing is once again overshadowing the economic news that we had overnight, with Japanese GDP figures smashing expectations while numbers from China \u2013 retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment \u2013 were less encouraging. The safe haven status of the yen appears to be driving today\u2019s moves, rather than the data itself, with the currency down against its peers as traders unwind some of last week\u2019s positions. Gold is also coming off its highs, having come close to $1,300 on Friday \u2013 peaking just above $1,190 \u2013 before once again running into resistance and dropping more than half a percentage point today. Should tensions between the two countries ramp up once again, I\u2019m not sure that $1,300 level will hold for long though, which would see it return to the levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of the US election when markets temporarily went into strong risk aversion mode. Back with Portugal: As European markets continue to recover, Wall Street is forecast to open in positive territory, with the futures suggesting a near 100 initial rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With little to disrupt it the market-wide rebound continued this Monday, investors \u2013 for the moment at least \u2013 putting their nuclear fears to one side. Though it\u2019s still lagging its Eurozone peers, the FTSE managed to widen its gains to more than half a percent this morning, pushing the index back towards 7350. Luckily its commodity stocks are yet to pay too much attention to the losses seen by Brent Crude and copper; the black stuff slipped under $52 per barrel, while the metal dropped 0.7%, following a trio of data-misses from China overnight. The DAX and CAC remained at the front of the pack as lunchtime approached, rising 1.1% and 1% respectively. Both were aided by the euro\u2019s slight dip; though the currency is up 0.1% against the pound, sending sterling below \u20ac1.10 in the process, it fell 0.2% against the dollar after the Eurozone-wide industrial production reading came in at a worse than forecast -0.6%. Looking to this afternoon and the Dow Jones is all set to join in with the early in the week recovery. The Dow futures are pointing to an 100 point rise once the bell rings on Wall Street; that would still leave the US index the wrong side of 22000, but with only 30 or so points needed to close the gap. There\u2019s not a lot going on beyond that, especially since investors appear to be ignoring the events in Charlottesville, meaning the day\u2019s gains may go unchallenged. News from Portugal, where GDP grew by 2.8% year on year in the second quarter, the same level as the previous three months. The quarter on quarter increase however was 0.2%, down from 1% in the first quarter, according to the statistics office. Domestic demand remained strong but exports of goods and services continued to be weak. Despite the weaker than expected eurozone industrial production figures, there is no need to worry too much, says ING Bank economist Bert Colijn: The recovery of Eurozone industry remains somewhat cautious as strong growth in May has been followed by a 0.6% drop in June. Most indicators point to accelerating growth in production, but data for June suggests that any acceleration from the trend of recent years has yet to happen. We see the Eurozone boom of 2017 everywhere except in the industrial production numbers. While the growth in new orders for manufacturing has been well above 6% YoY for several months now, industrial production has dropped back to 2.6% YoY growth, which is not much better than what has been seen since 2014. It is somewhat disappointing that production has yet to recover to its pre-crisis level. With the start of the crisis now ten years ago, industrial production is still 6.5% below its peak. After this lost decade for Eurozone industry, a stronger recovery could be expected. Production data is notoriously volatile and subject to revisions, so a break in trend often only emerges after a few months of data. Due to strength in orders and businesses noting strong improvements in production, it seems that an improved trend for production is still in the cards. This would indicate that the surprising growth in the Eurozone could continue in the second half of the year. But while a weaker June reading actually makes an acceleration in the third quarter easier, the manufacturing PMI fell to a six-month low in July. This false start to the quarter was also seen in other surveys, which could mean that 3Q GDP will be a touch weaker than the first half of the year, but that would still lead to a healthy 2% annual GDP growth rate for 2017. No need to become pessimistic about the Eurozone just yet. The fall in European stocks is not just due to the worries about the growing tension between the US and North Korea, says David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB: Whilst the selling seen in stocks in the past week was widely attributed to the US-N.Korea story there has in fact been a fairly prolonged period of declines for European indices. The Eurostoxx for instance made a 2017 peak back in May and has since fallen by more than 7% to last week\u2019s low. The market now trades back at a similar level to where it was prior to the 1st round of the French election, after which Macron\u2019s progression sparked a strong move to the upside as the seeming avoidance of a populist party gaining power sparked a sharp rally in stocks. Whilst it is tempting to feel that the current weakness will now cease as the prospect of a nuclear war seemingly recedes, there were other factors weighing on the Eurostoxx - such as the local currency appreciation - that will likely persist. Markets continue to recover some ground on hopes that the tensions between the US and North Korea have eased. The FTSE 100 is now up 0.5%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up more than 1% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.9%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European equity markets appear to have left the fears of late last week behind, with investors coming out of their defensive positions to move back into riskier assets. Chinese involvement in the recent spat between North Korea and the US has been one of the biggest calming influences, highlighting that for the US to go to war with North Korea it must first go through China. However, with China moving to implement a ban on whole host of North Korean products (such as coal, lead, and fish), it is clear that it is aware that something needs to be done to reign in the rebellious neighbours. Today has precious few major economic releases out of Europe and the US, with traders instead focusing on the shift out of havens, while preparing for a busy week ahead. Those havens, which were in demand last week among the uncertainty, are out of favour now, with gold down around $8 an ounce at $1281: Meanwhile the weaker than expected Chinese data earlier has seen oil slip back, with Brent crude down 0.5% at $51.8 a barrel, and also kept the lid on metal prices. Some underwhelming data from Europe. Industrial production in the eurozone fell by 0.6% in June, slightly worse than the 0.5% decline analysts had been expecting. But it rose 2.6% on an annualised basis. In the wider EU it fell by 0.5% but rose 2.8% year on year. This compares with a 1.2% rise in May for both areas. The statistics office Eurostat said the decline was due to \u201cproduction of capital goods falling by 1.9%, durable consumer goods by 1.2%, non-durable consumer goods by 0.4% and intermediate goods by 0.3%, while production of energy rose by 1.8% \u201c The positive Japanese data is good news for the country\u2019s central bank, says Yann Quelenn at Swissquote Bank: Japan\u2019s growth came in much higher than forecasted at 1% q/q versus 0.6% for the second quarter. Looking back, this release is the best data in the last two and a half years. It also represents the sixth consecutive quarter of positive GDP growth. Consumer spending has largely improved and helped spur on the good data. Indeed, spending rose 0.9% from Q1 and beat the estimate of 0.5% for the quarter. Consumer spending has traditionally been the weakest point of the Japanese economy. This is maybe changing, but a string of data will be needed to confirm this trend. Recent fundamentals are good news for the Bank of Japan, which is still the only major central bank not able to hint about further tightening. For the time being, good numbers must at some point translate into inflation. Nationwide inflation stands at 0.4% y/y \u2013 way below the inflation target of 2% \u2013 and this despite the country\u2019s Abenomics policies and massive quantitative easing. The BoJ monetary policy still cannot be considered as a success. The only true gains have been in stock market, where the Nikkei 225 increased by 16% over the last 12 months. Currency-wise, the yen is weakening against the dollar and remains under pressure for further appreciation. Geopolitical tensions and market uncertainties may trigger a risk-off move towards yen again. This is the curse of being a safe haven. However that does mean..... Back with the better than expected Japanese growth figures: In another sign of the calmer mood at the start of the new week, the VIX volatility index has fallen back after last week hitting its highest level since President Trump was elected. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: All is relatively calm, all is relatively quiet on the geopolitical front and long may that last. Markets are, as a result, trying to get back to biz-as-usual. Yields are slightly higher in bond-land, equity indices finding their feet, bitcoin making new highs seemingly ad infinitum. President Trump has problems everywhere - from the tensions with North Korea to the death of a woman at a weekend anti-racism rally - and his economic plans could also be in trouble. That\u2019s the view of S&amp;P Global ratings, which says Trump could struggle to meet economic growth targets. In a new report it says: After the failure of the Republican plan to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, S&amp;P Global Ratings believes the prospects for the administration to work with lawmakers to enact its promised pro-growth plans are, in a word, dim, said an article published today, titled \u201cThe Departed: Can U.S. Lawmakers Spur GDP Growth When They Return?.\u201d \u201cWe no longer believe the federal government will be able to push through even a small infrastructure-spending package--much less the $1 trillion the White House has suggested,\u201d said U.S. Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino. We still expect a small tax cut of $500 billion, rather than true tax reform, to be passed early next year as midterm elections approach. S&amp;P global has argued that permanence is key to making tax reform effective, which would require bipartisan support. \u201cWith U.S. economic growth stuck at around 2% and as the baby boomers retire, the administration\u2019s plans to cut immigration would likely put the U.S. on the path to even slower rates of economic growth,\u201d said Ms. Bovino. Hard-tariff policies could provoke a messy scenario in which the U.S.\u2019s trade partners could retaliate in some way. But a limited restriction, which we think seems more likely at this point, may be more symbolic than a meaningful hit to aggregate flows. We expect the current expansionary period--now in its ninth year and the third-longest since World War II--to continue into 2018--with little help from Uncle Sam--albeit at a modest pace. As expected, shares are moving ahead in early trading as some of the volatility of the past week eases. The FTSE 100 is up 0.25%, with Standard Life up 2% as it completes its merger with Aberdeen. France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.4%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.57% and Germany\u2019s Dax has opened 0.7% better. Konstantinos Anthis at ADS Securities said: There is strong fundamental backing behind the major equity markets - with the low interest rates policies being the key catalyst - so stock traders will probably find the opportunity to re-establish their long bets at lower prices after the recent pullback. The eurozone industrial production figures could show the effects of the recent strength of the euro. The single currency has benefitted from weakness elsewhere, particularly in the dollar, but this is causing a problem for the European Central Bank. President Mario Draghi is under pressure to begin easing the central bank\u2019s quantitative easing and low interest rate policy, but a stronger euro makes that more tricky. Commenting on today\u2019s expected data, Dave Madden at CMC Markets said: The consensus is for a reading of -0.4% and 2.9% on a month-on-month basis and on a year-on-year basis respectively. The relative strength of the euro is hitting the region, and traders want to see if that is still the case. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u2019s market turmoil in the wake of growing tensions and belligerent rhetoric between North Korea and the US, the week looks like starting on a calmer note. As Kathleen Brooks at City Index put it: The fact that we didn\u2019t see an escalation in the rhetoric from either side over the weekend could be enough to trigger a recovery after last week\u2019s risk selloff, and keep the markets focused on the economic fundamentals. President Trump of course now has some rather pressing domestic concerns to deal with after a woman was killed at an anti-racism rally over the weekend. As for the economic fundamentals, there has already been some positive news from Japan in the form of forecast-beating growth figures. The country\u2019s second quarter GDP grew by 1% quarter on quarter or 4% in annualised terms, which was higher than the 2.5% expected. Economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: That makes Japan the fastest growing economy in the G7 this quarter by our reckoning and may re-start the chatter about the Bank of Japan\u2019s eventual QQE [Qualitative Monetary Easing] exit strategy.... This was not one of those flukey one-offs that was caused by a surge in inventories that will be worked down in coming quarters, or one of those random spikes caused by exports and imports growing out of synch. Although it is usually exactly the wrong thing to respond to volatile Japanese GDP data by revising full year forecasts, arithmetically, it is going to be hard for us to see only the 1.2% for 2017 we currently have pencilled in, and an upgrade now seems extremely likely. Elsewhere Chinese retail sales and industrial production rose by 10.4% and 6.4% respectively in July, but this was slightly below analyst forecasts. Even so the Nikkei 225 is up around 0.98% and the Hang Seng is 1.16% better, as investors focussed on the Japanese data. European markets are also forecast to open higher: It is a thin day for economic data otherwise. The agenda: 10 BST Eurozone Industrial Production figures",

Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Risk appetite is slowly returning to the markets on Monday, with no further escalation between the US and North Korea incentivising a gradual move back towards \u201criskier\u201d assets.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think this signifies a belief that relations between the two countries will suddenly improve, it\u2019s more a case of no news being good news and that will likely continue for as long as it lasts. The problem is that both sides can be rather unpredictable so things could escalate at any point and trigger another dash for safety. Gold, the yen and the Swiss franc may be coming off their highs at the moment but I\u2019m not convinced it will last.</p> <p>It seems this collective \u2013 and possibly temporary \u2013 sigh of relief that we\u2019re seeing is once again overshadowing the economic news that we had overnight, with Japanese GDP figures smashing expectations while numbers from China \u2013 retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment \u2013 were less encouraging. The safe haven status of the yen appears to be driving today\u2019s moves, rather than the data itself, with the currency down against its peers as traders unwind some of last week\u2019s positions.</p> <p>Gold is also coming off its highs, having come close to $1,300 on Friday \u2013 peaking just above $1,190 \u2013 before once again running into resistance and dropping more than half a percentage point today. Should tensions between the two countries ramp up once again, I\u2019m not sure that $1,300 level will hold for long though, which would see it return to the levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of the US election when markets temporarily went into strong risk aversion mode.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59917eb9e4b07d1140960ed6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-14T10:43:12.428Z\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Portugal:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/anaa_luis/status/897042075400667136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Portugal growth figures for Q2 of +0.2%  qoq and +2.8% yoy are out, very much in line with our forecast. +2.4% expected for the full year</p>&mdash; Ana Lu\u00eds Andrade (@anaa_luis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anaa_luis/status/897042075400667136\">August 14, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599179ade4b0cf3b87d682c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-14T10:24:24.136Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As European markets continue to recover, Wall Street is forecast to open in positive territory, with the futures suggesting a near 100 initial rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Both were aided by the euro\u2019s slight dip; though the currency is up 0.1% against the pound, sending sterling below \u20ac1.10 in the process, it fell 0.2% against the dollar after the Eurozone-wide industrial production reading came in at a worse than forecast -0.6%.</p> <p>Looking to this afternoon and the Dow Jones is all set to join in with the early in the week recovery.

Most indicators point to accelerating growth in production, but data for June suggests that any acceleration from the trend of recent years has yet to happen.</p> <p>We see the Eurozone boom of 2017 everywhere except in the industrial production numbers. While the growth in new orders for manufacturing has been well above 6% YoY for several months now, industrial production has dropped back to 2.6% YoY growth, which is not much better than what has been seen since 2014. It is somewhat disappointing that production has yet to recover to its pre-crisis level. With the start of the crisis now ten years ago, industrial production is still 6.5% below its peak. After this lost decade for Eurozone industry, a stronger recovery could be expected. Production data is notoriously volatile and subject to revisions, so a break in trend often only emerges after a few months of data.</p> <p>Due to strength in orders and businesses noting strong improvements in production, it seems that an improved trend for production is still in the cards. This would indicate that the surprising growth in the Eurozone could continue in the second half of the year. But while a weaker June reading actually makes an acceleration in the third quarter easier, the manufacturing PMI fell to a six-month low in July. This false start to the quarter was also seen in other surveys, which could mean that 3Q GDP will be a touch weaker than the first half of the year, but that would still lead to a healthy 2% annual GDP growth rate for 2017.

The country\u2019s second quarter GDP grew by 1% quarter on quarter or 4% in annualised terms, which was higher than the 2.5% expected.

      "bodyText": "The squeeze on cash-strapped British households is expected to be illustrated this week byofficial figures likely to show that inflation picked up last month, outstripping growth in pay packets. City economists are forecasting that the consumer price index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in July, up from 2.6% in June. The figures will be released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday, followed by labour market data the next day which are expected to show wage growth stagnated while unemployment continued to fall. Inflation is expected to resume its upward path following June\u2019s surprise slowdown, when weaker global oil prices pushed down the cost of petrol and diesel, providing some respite for consumers. However, in May, inflation had hit a four-year high of 2.9%. Coupled with low pay growth, the rising cost of living means real wages are falling, heaping pressure on households. Consumers are using their credit cards to fund spending and the Bank of England has expressed alarm about the increase in personal debt. Tuesday\u2019s update from the ONS will bring important news for commuters because July\u2019s retail price index (RPI) will be used to calculate rail fares for the year ahead. RPI, a separate inflation measure, is expected to have risen at an annual rate of 3.5% in July, the same rate as in June. Inflation has remained well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target \u2013 measured against CPI \u2013 after starting to rise last year following the Brexit vote, which triggered a sharp drop in the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Inflation was just 0.3% in May 2016, a month before the referendum. Analysts are pointing to higher utility prices in July, following gas and electricity tariff hikes by EDF in late June, while food and furniture prices have risen steadily on the back of the fall in sterling. Philip Shaw, the chief economist at Investec, pointed to a further fall in petrol prices and the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges across the EU in mid-June as keeping inflation in check. He forecasts inflation will stick at 2.6% in July, before rising gently in coming months to 3%. Alan Clarke, the head of European fixed income strategy at Scotiabank, is predicting inflation of 2.8%, partly due to food prices which have been rising in recent months in sharp contrast to this time last year, when the supermarket price war was still raging. He said: \u201cFood price falls came to a fairly abrupt end in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, particularly on the back of the sharp fall in the exchange rate. Indeed, food prices have risen for seven of the last eight months \u2013 with last month being the exception. \u201cOverall, we view last month\u2019s downward adjustment in inflation as temporary and the peak in inflation is yet to be reached.\u201d The Bank of England is predicting inflation will reach a peak of 3% in October. In its latest predictions for the UK economy published last week, the central bank raised its inflation forecasts for the months ahead and cut the growth outlook for this year and next. It also downgraded its predictions for wage growth, as it warned that uncertainty surrounding Brexit had discouraged some firms from awarding pay rises. Wage growth has been lagging behind price rises and this is expected to continue in coming months. Economists are predicting that average weekly earnings grew by 1.8% year-on-year in the three months to June, the same figure as last time, with regular pay stripping out bonuses similarly static at 2%. Despite a slowdown in UK economic growth this year, unemployment has been falling. The jobless rate is forecast to have dipped to 4.4% in the three months to June from 4.5%. Shaw said: \u201cAt some stage, we expect employment to slow and the jobless rate to nudge up. But for now, other survey evidence suggests continued forward momentum.\u201d Basic pay rises in the UK are expected to come in at 1% in the third quarter, a survey of more than 1,000 employers predicts. The report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the Adecco Group also suggests that employment will grow again strongly. The balance of employers who expect to increase staff levels and those who plan to reduce them between July and September shows an increase from +20 to +27 during the past three months. However, while the labour market remains buoyant, basic pay award expectations for the next 12 months remain at just 1%, down from average pay deals of 1.5% in the first half of the year. Factors include poor productivity growth and an influx of EU workers, ex-welfare claimants and 50- to 64-year-olds into the workforce. However, future migration trends appear highly uncertain, the report said. Almost a quarter of private sector firms cite delivering the national living wage as a brake on pay growth; a fifth cite uncertainty over access to the single market, and another fifth point to the government\u2019s auto-enrolment pensions scheme as a challenge. In the public sector, nearly three-quarters of employers say that government-imposed pay restraint is why they cannot match the inflation target of 2% in their next pay award. Pay expectations among employees have also weakened from last year.",

      "body": "<p>The squeeze on cash-strapped British households is expected to be illustrated this week byofficial figures likely to show that inflation picked up last month, outstripping growth in pay packets.</p> <p>City economists are forecasting that the consumer price index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in July, up from 2.6% in June. The figures will be released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday, followed by labour market data the next day which are expected to show wage growth stagnated while unemployment continued to fall.</p> <p>Inflation is expected to resume its upward path following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/18/uk-inflation-falls-first-time-9-months-fuel-prices\">June\u2019s surprise slowdown</a>, when weaker global oil prices pushed down the cost of petrol and diesel, providing some respite for consumers. However, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/13/uk-inflation-rises-faster-than-expected-four-year-high\">in May, inflation had hit a four-year high of 2.9%</a>.</p> <p>Coupled with low pay growth, the rising cost of living means real wages are falling, heaping pressure on households. Consumers are using their credit cards to fund spending and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/24/bank-of-england-household-debt-bank-credit-card-car-loans\">Bank of England has expressed alarm about the increase in personal debt</a>.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s update from the ONS will bring important news for commuters because July\u2019s retail price index (RPI) will be used to calculate rail fares for the year ahead. RPI, a separate inflation measure, is expected to have risen at an annual rate of 3.5% in July, the same rate as in June.</p> <p>Inflation has remained well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target \u2013 measured against CPI \u2013 after starting to rise last year following the Brexit vote, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">triggered a sharp drop</a> in the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/01/weak-pound-boosts-uk-manufacturing-steep-import-cost-rise\">goods imported from abroad</a>. Inflation was just <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/14/uk-inflation-unchanged-in-may-hotels-transport-clothes\">0.3% in May 2016</a>, a month before the referendum.</p> <p>Analysts are pointing to higher utility prices in July, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/12/edf-customers-price-rise-electricity-gas-energy\">gas and electricity tariff hikes by EDF</a> in late June, while food and furniture prices have risen steadily on the back of the fall in sterling. </p> <p> Philip Shaw, the chief economist at Investec, pointed to a further fall in petrol prices and the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges across the EU in mid-June as keeping inflation in check. He forecasts inflation will stick at 2.6% in July, before rising gently in coming months to 3%.</p> <p>Alan Clarke, the head of European fixed income strategy at Scotiabank, is predicting inflation of 2.8%, partly due to food prices which have been rising in recent months in sharp contrast to this time last year, when the supermarket price war was still raging.</p> <p>He said: \u201cFood price falls came to a fairly abrupt end in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, particularly on the back of the sharp fall in the exchange rate. Indeed, food prices have risen for seven of the last eight months \u2013 with last month being the exception.</p> <p>\u201cOverall, we view last month\u2019s downward adjustment in inflation as temporary and the peak in inflation is yet to be reached.\u201d </p> <p>The Bank of England is predicting inflation will reach a peak of 3% in October.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/03/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-despite-inflation-fears\">In its latest predictions for the UK economy published last week</a>, the central bank raised its inflation forecasts for the months ahead and cut the growth outlook for this year and next. It also downgraded its predictions for wage growth, as it warned that uncertainty surrounding Brexit had discouraged some firms from awarding pay rises.</p> <p>Wage growth has been lagging behind price rises and this is expected to continue in coming months. Economists are predicting that average weekly earnings grew by 1.8% year-on-year in the three months to June, the same figure as last time, with regular pay stripping out bonuses similarly static at 2%.</p> <p>Despite a slowdown in UK economic growth this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/12/uk-pay-squeeze-real-wages-tuc-unemployment-ons-figures\">unemployment has been falling</a>. The jobless rate is forecast to have dipped to 4.4% in the three months to June from 4.5%. Shaw said: \u201cAt some stage, we expect employment to slow and the jobless rate to nudge up. But for now, other survey evidence suggests continued forward momentum.\u201d</p> <p>Basic pay rises in the UK are expected to come in at 1% in the third quarter, a survey of more than 1,000 employers predicts.</p> <p>The report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the Adecco Group also suggests that employment will grow again strongly.
