      "bodyText": "A drop in commodity prices on concerns about Chinese growth helped push UK markets lower, while elsewhere there was a fairly mixed performance. There was little help from Wall Street which slipped back after its recent record breaking runs. The US tax reforms saw investors ditch technology shares in favour of financial and consumer companies which were more likely to directly benefit from the changes. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 11.47 points or 0.16% at 7327.50 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.08% to 13,048.54 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.26% lower at 5375.53 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.24% to 22,416.31 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.03% at 10,211.3 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.54% to 730.43 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 36 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. And here\u2019s a positive snapshot of the global economy from Markit: The pound is likely to fall quite a bit further if Brexit talks break down, says Capital Economics, but the extent of the currency\u2019s decline since the referendum might limit the damage. Overall the consultancy believes a favourable deal is still the most likely outcome, which should give some support to sterling. Capital Economics\u2019 Oliver Jones says: We think that a transitional deal which largely preserves the status quo will eventually be reached, and a favourable agreement on the future trading relationship will ultimately be struck too. Given how investors are positioned, signs that such an arrangement is likely might not give sterling much of a lift. But we think that progress towards this type of deal would help the UK economy to hold up better than most expect. We suspect that this would prompt the Bank of England to raise rates by more than is discounted in markets, which would probably support sterling. Admittedly, we forecast that sterling will weaken a little against the dollar in 2018 as the Fed tightens by even more relative to investors\u2019 expectations. But we project that sterling will strengthen against most other major currencies. Following the weaker than expected US service sector surveys, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost its early gains and dipped slightly into the red. The ISM\u2019s Anthony Nieves said: \u201cThe rate of growth has lessened in the non-manufacturing sector after two very strong months of growth. Comments from the survey respondents indicate that the economy and sector will continue to grow for the remainder of the year.\u201d And here are some of the comments from the ISM report: \u201cDomestic business is strong, with positive growth indicators for 2018 from both internal sources and client feedback.\u201d (Management of Companies &amp; Support Services) \u201cConstruction labor continues to be constrained in the West.\u201d (Construction) \u201cSteady; no material changes.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cWe continue to struggle with understanding the [potential] changes to the Affordable Care Act, and are trying to be flexible in how we respond. Also, Hurricane Maria has affected some of our pharmaceutical supplies.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cMixed bag of goods for November 2017. Typical seasonal increases for specific braising cuts of beef as the holidays approach. Some volatility on produce items such as brussel sprouts. Expect cream to spike due to holiday season.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201cBusiness seems to be leveling off. Attribute this to the holiday season that is approaching.\u201d (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u201cBusiness is strong, but not as strong as Q3.\u201d (Retail Trade) \u201cBookings would suggest a strong run to the end of the year.\u201d (Wholesale Trade) And confirmation of a slowdown in the US service sector last month. After the decline in the Markit service sector survey, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing PMI has fallen from 60.1 in October to 57.4. This is below expectations of a level of 59. Business activity, prices paid, employment and new orders were all weaker. The first of two US service sector surveys shows a slightly larger than expected fall in November. The Markit final service sector PMI has come in at 54.5, down from 55.3 in October and below the initial estimate of 54.7. This is the lowest reading since June. The rival ISM survey is due shortly. Following the US trade data and ahead of the latest service sector surveys, US markets continue to be influenced by the Republican tax bill. Investors are moving out of technology stocks - which have been hitting new records throughout the year - and into sectors which should directly benefit from the tax measures. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 34 points or 0.17% after Monday\u2019s record breaking run (even though the Dow came off its best levels as the trading day progressed). But the Nasdaq Composite technology index opened down 0.24% while the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said of the current trends: A major sector rotation is taking place. Money is coming out of technology sector and moving in those sectors which are going to be the beneficiary of the US tax overhaul. Hence, we have seen massive inflow of funds in the financial and consumer discretionary sector and while energy sector has experienced outflow. And over to Bitcoin, which continues to defy gravity: The cryptocurrency has hit a high of $11,850 so far today before slipping back to $11,803. Back with UK car sales, and here is our report by Angela Monagham: UK sales of new cars fell for an eighth consecutive month in November as economic uncertainty and a sharp fall in demand for diesel cars weighed on demand. Sales slumped by 11.2% last month to 163,541 vehicles, putting the industry on course for the first drop in annual sales since 2011. New car sales in the first 11 months of 2017 were down by 5% at 2.39m. The November decline was driven by a 30.6% fall in diesel sales according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which more than offset a 5% rise in petrol and 33% rise in alternatively fuelled vehicles. Companies cut back on new cars the most, with business registrations slumping by 33.6%. Private registrations fell by 5.1%, while fleet registrations dropped by 14.4%. \u201cAn eighth month of decline in the new car market is a major concern, with falling business and consumer confidence exacerbated by ongoing anti-diesel messages from government,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the industry trade body. The full story is here: Newsflash: America\u2019s trade deficit has widened to a nine-month high - a move that won\u2019t please Donald Trump. The gap between what the US imports and exports jumped by 8.6% to $48.7bn in October, the Commerce Department says. That\u2019s the biggest monthly trade deficit since January, and $1.2bn more than economists had expected. It\u2019s partly due to rising oil, which have pushed up the cost of importing crude into America. The fall in the pound\u2019s value is supporting shares in London today. The FTSE 100 is the only European stock index that hasn\u2019t lost ground - as investors ponder Brexit, and the prospect of US tax reforms. Chris Weston of IG says: \u201cThe two overarching macro themes the market honed in on overnight have been the response from European and U.S. traders to the Senate passing its tax plan and that no deal has yet been formally reached in the Brexit negotiations,\u201d Over in Greece, thousands of protestors have taken to the streets to denounce the leftist-led government\u2019s attempts to clamp down on the ability of unions to call strike action. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Marching through Athens to parliament, protestors accused prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 administration of treachery, saying the right to strike had been won \u201cwith blood and sweat.\u201d Demonstrating outside the ministry of labour unionists attempted to smash windows in what witnesses described as an \u201corgy of fury\u201d over the measure. The reform had been part of the policy package finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos had agreed with debt-stricken Greece\u2019s bailout creditors to conclude a compliance review that was approved by peers at Monday\u2019s euro group. But the reaction has been furious and swift. With public sector employees and communist aligned unionists announcing immediate work stoppages nationwide, the labour ministry was forced into an embarrassing U-turn declaring late last night that it would amend the regulations only hours after agreeing them. The alacrity and force with which unionists have reacted has highlighted the friction the government will face in enforcing reforms that have also provoked deep unease within the ranks of the ruling Syriza party. Just hours earlier, Tsakalotos had announced in Brussels: \u201cGreece is really now turning the corner and I think there is a general acceptance that we are turning the corner.\u201d David Davis, Britain\u2019s secretary of state for exiting the EU, is answering an urgent question on the Brexit talks in parliament. Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics live blog has full details: Former transport secretary Andrew Adonis says rail passengers should blame the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote for pushing up fares. As explained earlier, the rail fares increase is linked to the retail prices index, which has been pushed up by the rising cost of imports. Lord Adonis says this means people face paying more simply to get to work (which wasn\u2019t on the voting paper on June 23rd 2016): \u201cCommuters are feeling the Brexit squeeze already, as the rise in inflation has pushed up rail fares in their highest increase for five years. \u201cThere is no doubting the impact of the plunge in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote on people\u2019s spending power. And now the Government\u2019s extreme Brexit plans, and its continued inability to make progress in the negotiations, is causing deep uncertainty and keeping our currency weak. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The Bank of England has admitted to warning UK courts to expect a deluge of insurer applications ahead of Brexit. The BoE tipped off the High Court, but kept this move private to avoid spooking policyholders - and triggering an even bigger rush to m\u2019learned friends. Now, though, it believes the situation is under control - so we\u2019re allowed to know about it. Press Association has the details: Minutes from a November meeting of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) show that members were given \u201cearly estimates\u201d around the number of policyholders that would be impacted if insurers lost permission to collect premiums and pay out claims on cross-border contracts after Brexit. It is the latest revelation around Brexit preparations being made by both the UK Government and regulators as banks, asset managers and insurers prepare for the loss of passporting rights which currently grant cross-border access throughout the EU. In light of the potential \u201crisks\u201d, the committee was told insurers were planning to either transfer contacts to new entities or gain new permissions for existing operations, a process that could take between 12 to 18 months. \u201cGiven the volume of these applications was expected to be three to five times the normal level, there was a risk that transfers would not be completed in time,\u201d the FPC said. The minutes (online here) have more details. The slowdown in UK service sector growth is weighing on the pound. Sterling is currently down 0.5% at $1.3405, as traders watch for any signs of Brexit progress. William Anderson Jones, head of UK corporate dealing at RationalFX, says: The Brexit woes were coupled with disappointing services data for November further deepening the losses and putting further downward pressure on the pound. Despite recent manufacturing and construction figures both beating previous estimates, the service PMI, although fuelled with optimism, missed expectations. Analysts have pointed out that Brexit related uncertainty and its effect on UK firms is leading cause of the sharp downtrend, painting a bleak picture of a dominant sector. Investors and pound traders are now looking towards the next big deadline at the December 14th-15th EU Summit where the EU is set to give its verdict on whether Britain can progress to discussing their future relationship. The pound will be in focus for investors over the coming days and there may be more optimism amongst investors ahead of the December EU Summit next week, however, further political doubt could signal more uncertainty for the currency.\u201d Theresa May is engaged on a high-speed diplomatic drive to resolve the Irish border crisis. But there\u2019s no sign of a breakthrough yet. Instead, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has argued that the UK should remain \u2018aligned\u2019 with the customs union -- that might solve the Irish border problem, but it won\u2019t please the hard-line Brexit wing. In another worrying signal, growth in the UK service sector has slowed unexpectedly. Data firm Markit reports that the growth in business activity weakened in November, having hit a six-month high in October. Job creation was also subdued. Firms were also hit by rising costs, with energy, food and salaries all going up. In response, bosses hiked their own prices -- which is bad news for consumers. This dragged the UK service sector PMI down to 53.8, from 55.6 in October. That\u2019s still over the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Chris Williamson of Markit says Brexit (yes again!) was one factor hitting the service sector (which makes up around three-quarters of the UK economy: \u201cUncertainty about the economic outlook, linked commonly to Brexit worries, continued to permeate the business mood in November. However, for now, the survey data indicate that a sufficient degree of optimism in pockets of the economy, notably financial services, tourism, manufacturing and house building, is helping the economy as a whole to sustain steady growth. Alex Buttle, director at car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, fears that next year will be tough for the car industry. The solution? More support for the electric car industry. Buttle says: \u201cPetrol sales were up last month and the year to date and AFV registrations saw another month of double digit growth, as the electric and hybrid revolution continues to gather pace. \u201cThe Government needs to take note, and put its full backing behind AFV progression by offering more incentives for the consumer. \u201cWhen it taxed diesels in the Budget, it hit the car industry in one area but didn\u2019t go far enough in other areas. AFV is the future and more needs to be done to encourage car owners to switch. \u201cThe new car industry will go into 2018 a lot less healthy than it started the year. And with household finances likely to be stretched even more next year, there will be very little incentive for consumers to buy new. Environmental campaigners were disappointed that chancellor Philip Hammond didn\u2019t announce a diesel scrappage scheme in last month\u2019s budget, to encourage drivers to move to electric.... So far this year, sales of Vauxhall cars are down 22%. They\u2019ve sold 181,834 vehicles to UK customers since the start of 2017, down from 233,881 in January-November 2016. That helps explain why PSA Group, its parent company, is cutting 400 jobs at Ellesmere Port in the North West of England. The Ford Focus hung onto its position as Britain\u2019s most popular car in November: But.... sales of Ford vehicles did fall by 17% year-on-year in November. Among other major manufacturers, BMW sales fell by 16%, Audi dropped by 6.6%, Mercedes-Benz gained 6%, Volkswagen lost 2%, and Vauxhall sales slumped by 35%. Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association (which represents car dealers), has welcomed the jump in electric car sales. We are pleased to see the continued increase in market share of AFVs, up 33.1% in November. The continued commitment from the Government to support the uptake of electric vehicles is extremely encouraging but we also call on the Government to do more to clarify the diesel issue.\u201d The uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is hurting car sales, warns Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance. He says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures highlight both the cyclical and structural market challenges that the motor industry faced in November, which sees the eighth consecutive month of car registrations being in decline. Brexit is having an obvious impact on the market as a whole as consumer confidence remains low. Some of the consumers who are shunning diesel cars are buying electric models instead. Sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles jumped by a third in November, from 6,661 to 8,867 units. That\u2019s 5.4% of the market, up from 3.6% a year ago. This chart, from the SMMT, confirms that UK car sales are down 5% so far this year, led by a slump in demand for diesel. Breaking: UK car sales slumped by over 11% in November, led by a startling decline in diesel sales. This confirm that demand has now fallen for eight months in a row, putting the sector on track for its first annual decline since 2011. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports that car registrations shrank by 11.2% in November to 163,541 units. Companies cut back the most, with business registrations slumping by 33.6%. Private registrations declined by 5.1%, while fleet registrations dropped by 14.4%. Sales of petrol sales did rise by 5%, but that wasn\u2019t enough to counter a 30% slump in demand for diesels. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, says the slump is a big worry. He blames politicians for not doing more to help diesel manufacturers, following the emissions scandal which rocked the industry and shocked consumers. Hawes says: \u201cAn eighth month of decline in the new car market is a major concern, with falling business and consumer confidence exacerbated by ongoing anti-diesel messages from government. Diesel remains the right choice for many drivers, not least because of its fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions. The decision to tax the latest low emission diesels is a step backwards and will only discourage drivers from trading in their older, more polluting cars. Given fleet renewal is the fastest way to improve air quality, penalising the latest, cleanest diesels is counterproductive and will have detrimental environmental and economic consequences.\u201d More details to follow.... The European economy has enjoyed another strong month, according to new data which shows that services sector and manufacturing output is growing fast. The eurozone composite PMI, calculated by data firm Markit reports, has jumped to 57.5 for November from 56.0 in October. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since April 2011. Firms report that new orders rose strongly, encouraging them to take on more staff. Another satisfied customer: It\u2019s another dark morning for UK sub-prime lender Provident Financial. Shares in Provident have plunged by almost 20%, after it warned investors that it was being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the City watchdog). The FCA is investigating Provident\u2019s car financing unit, Moneybarn, over how it decided whether its loans to people with bad credit histories were affordable, and how it treated customers in financial distress. This follows two profit warnings already this year, and the sudden death of executive chair Manjit Wolstenholme last month. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the Moneybarn probe \u201cadds to the woes for the embattled lender and is another headache for management at the worst time\u201d. Britain\u2019s rail passengers continue to fume about the prospect of next year\u2019s fare hike: The pound is coming under pressure this morning. It\u2019s already shed more than half a cent against the US dollar to $1.341, having traded over $1.35 on Monday. Traders are blaming the latest Brexit crisis; Theresa May is looking more vulnerable today after the Democratic Union Party pulled the rug from under her plan to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Unions have slammed the looming hike in UK rail fares, arguing that passengers aren\u2019t getting a good deal. RMT union general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cThese fare increases are another kick in the teeth for British passengers who will still be left paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on rammed-out, unreliable trains where private profit comes before public safety. The news hasn\u2019t been well-received by passengers either, judging by the reaction on social media: While car sales are falling, the cost of travelling on Britain\u2019s rail network is going up! Fares are being hiked by an average of 3.4%, in line with last August\u2019s retail price index (one measure of inflation). That\u2019s another blow to rail passengers, as average wages are only rising by around 2.2%. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham explains: Rail fares will rise by 3.4% in January \u2013 the largest increase for five years, train companies have announced. Fares for all journeys in 2018 have been published, showing an average rise slightly below the 3.6% set by the government in August for regulated fares, which include season tickets. Rail operators said it showed the industry was attempting to keep down the cost of travel. Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for the train companies and Network Rail, said: \u201cAlongside investment from the public and private sectors, money from fares is underpinning the partnership railway\u2019s long-term plan to change and improve.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s car industry has suffered another month of declining sales, as economic uncertainty and the diesel crisis hit demand for new motors. Industry figures due out this morning are expected to show that sales slumped in November, possibly by as much as 11%. Such a sharp decline would crush any lingering hopes that the market could avoid its first annual decline since 2011. Diesel sales are expected to bear the brunt of the decline, as the recent emissions scandal continues to hit confidence.. As Reuters explains: New car registrations in Britain fell by around 11% in November, the eighth consecutive month that sales have declined, according to preliminary numbers from an industry body. The sales have reflected caution among consumers faced by arise in inflation since the Brexit vote in 2016 and weak wage growth, as well as concerns that the government would clamp down on diesel vehicles to curb pollution. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders were expected to show diesel car sales fell sharply again. Britain will increase tax on diesel cars that do not meet more stringent emissions standards, finance minister Philip Hammond said last month. Also coming up today.... Data firm Markit is publishing its PMI reports for the world\u2019s service sector companies. They\u2019re likely to show solid growth in Europe and the UK, as CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson explains: Starting with Europe we have the latest services PMI\u2019s from Spain, Italy, France and Germany. It is expected that we\u2019ll see improvements across the board with readings of 55.2, 53.4, 60.2 and 54.9, with France outperforming strongly from an October number of 57.3. On the data front, having seen two decent numbers on manufacturing and construction PMI\u2019s for November, it is hoped that today\u2019s services number will complete a nice hat-trick, though expectations are for a bit of a slowdown from Octobers 55.6 to a number in the region of 55.2. European stock markets are expected to inch higher, after the US Dow Jones index hit another record high last night. Tech shares did fall yesterday, though, But the pound could be volatile, after Theresa May\u2019s attempts to pull off a Brexit breakthrough yesterday floundered on the rocks of opposition from Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s landowners have emerged as the biggest winners from the country\u2019s largest yearly increase in national wealth on record, sitting on assets accounting for more than half of the net worth of nearly \u00a310tn. The UK\u2019s wealth rose by \u00a3803bn over the course of last year to stand at \u00a39.8tn at the end of 2016, driven by a sharp increase in the value of land, contributing to the biggest annual rise since records began in 1995, according to the Office for National Statistics. The value of land has increased more than fivefold over that period, outstripping the increase in the worth of the properties overlying it. The value of the country\u2019s wealth \u2013 as measured by assets accumulated by households, businesses and the state - has risen steadily over the past two decades, barring small setbacks during the financial crisis which have now been left well behind. Total land value has recovered from a fall of almost \u00a31tn recorded in 2008 amid a crash in house prices during the credit crunch, recovering to its pre-crisis peak in 2014 and rising by \u00a3280bn over the course of 2016 to stand at \u00a35tn at the end of last year. According to a 2010 report for Country Life, a third of Britain\u2019s land still belongs to the aristocracy, while some of the oldest families in the country have held onto their land for several centuries. Some of the most famous noble landowners include the Duke of Westminster, who owns large chunks of Mayfair and Belgravia in London. The Queen\u2019s Crown Estate owns most of Regent Street and swaths of St James\u2019s, as well as thousands of acres of farmland, forests and coastline. There are also vast tracts of land owned by the government, including areas controlled by the Forestry commission, which is thought to be the country\u2019s biggest land manager, with about 900,000 hectares. The ONS analysis measures the total net worth of the country by estimating the market value of financial assets, such as loans, and non-financial assets, such as land and dwellings. The figures show households and non-profit institutions such as churches, trade unions and social and cultural organisations account for the vast majority of the nation\u2019s wealth. The statisticians estimate the net worth attributable to central government stood at negative \u00a31.2tn as a consequence of borrowing to fund the budget deficit. The stark illustration of the gains made by land owners come days after Tony Blair endorsed the idea of a new \u201cland value tax\u201d put forward in Labour\u2019s last manifesto to help solve the country\u2019s housing crisis. The former Labour prime minister said the new tax \u2013 which would be a levy on underlying land rather than property on it \u2013 should replace council tax and business rates to create a \u201cfairer and more rational system of property taxation\u201d. Blair said the new tax, which sees the value of underlying land taxed rather than property, should replace council tax and business rates to create a \u201cfairer and more rational system of property taxation\u201d. Philip Hammond placed a stamp duty cut for first time buyers and more money for housebuilding at the heart of the budget last month, pledging to boost the number of new homes built to 300,000 a year on average by the mid-2020s \u2013 up from 217,000 last year \u2013 in the \u201cbiggest annual increase in housing supply since 1970\u201d. The chancellor also said he would do more to tackle land banking \u2013 where housing developers sit on land waiting for its value to increase before selling properties for higher prices \u2013 with a promise to reform planning rules. Conservative grandee Oliver Letwin, who was David Cameron\u2019s head of policy, will also review the gap between planning permissions and housing starts on behalf of the government. Letwin\u2019s panel will provide an interim report in time for the Spring statement next year, which Hammond could use as grounding to intervene in the market should it find land being withheld for commercial reasons, rather than technical ones. There are as many as 270,000 residential planning permissions unbuilt in London alone. Hammond has said that options open to the government could include compulsory purchase powers. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "EU blacklist names 17 tax havens and puts Caymans and Jersey on notice", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The EU has named and shamed 17 countries in its first ever tax haven blacklist and put a further 47 on notice, including British overseas territories and the crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, in an attempt to clamp down on the estimated \u00a3506bn lost to aggressive avoidance every year. The move was hailed as a vital \u201cfirst step\u201d but the failure of the member states to agree on any sanctions for those on the blacklist provoked the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Pierre Moscovici, to concede it was as yet \u201can insufficient response\u201d. The blacklist includes South Korea, Mongolia, Namibia, Panama, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Guam, the US territory in the Pacific, also features on the blacklist, in a move that is unlikely to endear Brussels to Donald Trump\u2019s White House. The EU said the countries failed to match up to international standards and had not offered sufficient commitments that they would change their ways during talks in the months leading up to publication of the list. Of the jurisdictions with links to the UK \u2013 Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, along with Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man \u2013 have been placed on a so-called \u201cgrey list\u201d who have committed to reform their tax structures to ensure, for example, that firms are not simply using their 0% corporate tax rates to shield their profits. It is understood the British government tried and failed to ensure those jurisdictions would not be screened by the EU\u2019s tax experts but was overruled. A further eight jurisdictions affected by recent hurricanes will be addressed in February. Namibia was the only country on the blacklist who made no effort at all to correspond with the EU\u2019s tax experts on the European council\u2019s code of conduct (COC) group when issues were raised with the country\u2019s government. The others on the blacklist are: American Samoa, Barbados, Grenada, Macau, the Marshall Islands, Palau, St Lucia, Samoa and Tunisia. The blacklist will be linked to EU legislation so that jurisdictions implicated will not be eligible for funds from the bloc except where it is to aid development. However, hopes that the member states would come to an agreement on further sanctions, including a withholding tax on money going to the listed countries, were dashed at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels. Moscovici called on the member states to individually devise sanctions. \u201cThis list represents substantial progress. Its very existence is an important step forward. But because it is the first EU list, it remains an insufficient response to the scale of tax evasion worldwide. \u201cI therefore call on the finance ministers to avoid any naivety on commitments. The countries that have taken commitments must change their tax laws as soon as possible. I also call on ministers to agree quickly on dissuasive national sanctions. We must do everything we can to keep up the pressure on all of these countries. We must not accept unfair tax competition and opacity.\u201d The former French minister for the economy, added: \u201cEurope has taken a step forward, but the fight against tax havens must continue unabated. In order to do this, I expect the member states to set a precise timetable: in three months\u2019 time, we will have to examine the situation of the countries affected by hurricanes. \u201cIn six months\u2019 time, we will have to review all the commitments made. Tax havens must not slip off Europe\u2019s radar screen. Countries that are not on the blacklist will only be fully off the hook once they have fulfilled their commitments. \u201cAs a European citizen, I share the expectations of those who hoped for more. I say to them, let us take this list for what it is: a first step. And let us keep up the pressure together, on the Member States and on third countries.\u201d Developed countries on the \u201cgrey list\u201d have until the end of 2018 to deliver on their commitments to reform while developing countries have been given an additional year before they will be put on the blacklist. The UK Treasury said: \u201cToday\u2019s publication marks an important step in our ongoing efforts to tackle tax avoidance and evasion internationally. This is clearly working, as over 40 jurisdictions have made significant commitments to reform as part of this process. For those that are on today\u2019s list, we hope that this increased scrutiny and the potential for counter-measures will lead them to reconsider their approach.\u201d However, Aurore Chardonnet, Oxfam\u2019s EU policy adviser on inequality and tax, voiced concerns that the bloc had so far picked only on smaller countries. She said: \u201cIt is disturbing to see mostly small countries on the EU blacklist, while the most notorious tax havens got away on the \u2018grey list\u2019. The EU has to make sure governments on the grey list follow up on their commitments, or else they must be blacklisted. \u201cUrgent tax reforms are also needed inside the EU. If the EU were to apply its own criteria to member states, even four EU countries would be blacklisted. As long as tax havens remain at the heart of the EU, it is hard to believe that they will push for further reforms by countries on the \u2018grey list\u2019 or agree on strong sanctions.\u201d The UK shadow Treasury minister, Anneliese Dodds MP, said: \u201cIt is disappointing to see UK overseas territories and crown dependencies mentioned as \u2018on notice\u2019 from the EU in its tax haven blacklist. The British government said back in April that it would require Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies to produce registers of beneficial ownership which would be accessible to HMRC. \u201cAlthough some have complied, other have not. Just as the UK\u2019s own beneficial ownership register has been criticised for apparently missing some companies which it should include, so here we see a case of faulty implementation by the British government and a lack of political will to prioritise stopping tax dodging. \u201cI should add that the British government has not earned itself many allies by trying to protect certain jurisdictions during this process. Ultimately it is in the interests of all to have more tax transparency and action against money laundering and aggressive tax avoidance.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Consumers face the sharpest increase in prices charged by services firms in almost a decade, according to a survey, as a range of businesses from hotels to IT companies seek to protect profits against rising costs since the EU referendum. According to a survey from the data firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), companies in the services industries \u2013 such as hotels and restaurants, IT, financial services, transport and communications \u2013 blamed the weak pound since the Brexit vote for forcing them to drive up prices in November at the fastest pace since February 2008. That was the the second-fastest rise seen since the survey began in 1996. The snapshot of the largest sector in the economy will worry consumers already caught by weak wage growth and rising inflation. It comes as businesses begin to focus on protecting their profits by passing on higher costs for food, fuel and salaries. The warning comes as business activity in November grew at a slower pace than in October, amid a slight slowdown in new work available to services firms. The rate of staff hiring was also the slowest since March as a result of the rising cost of imported goods and subdued confidence due to mounting economic uncertainty. The closely watched Markit/Cips UK Services PMI (pdf) slipped from its six-month peak in October of 55.6 to 53.8 in November, missing economists expectations for a result of 55. The latest reading signalled a solid increase in the biggest sector of the UK economy, but showed the rate of expansion was slightly slower than the average for this year. It was the 16th consecutive month that the index was above the 50 mark, which separates economic growth from contraction. The warning for higher prices charged to customers will confirm the reasons for the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate hike last month, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said the reading supported the Bank\u2019s \u201csombre conclusion\u201d that rising prices can accompany even modest rates of economic growth. Threadneedle Street raised interest rates for the first time in a decade in November, up from 0.25% to 0.5%, as the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney said the vote to leave the EU had constrained the speed at which the UK could grow before prices begin to spiral. The UK recorded a growth rate of 0.4% in the three months to September, much lower than the US and eurozone during the same period. Service sector companies reported an uptick in business and consumer spending in the November PMI survey, although some firms noted that stretched budgets and uncertainty as a consequence of Brexit had acted as a brake on growth. The report follows improvements for the smaller manufacturing and construction sectors this week, which combine to suggest that the UK economy may be running at a growth rate of about 0.4% or 0.5% in the final quarter of the year, according to Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the Capital Economics consultancy. She said that inflation fuelled by a weak pound would gradually fade, putting consumer spending on a firmer footing. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the slower pace of growth came as a disappointment after the improved performances for both manufacturing and construction. Still, for now, he said the survey data indicates a \u201csufficient degree of optimism in pockets of the economy, notably financial services, tourism, manufacturing and house building\u201d. \u201cDespite the weaker service sector expansion, the latest survey data indicate that the economy is on course to enjoy robust growth in the fourth quarter,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK sales of new cars fell for an eighth consecutive month in November as economic uncertainty and a sharp fall in demand for diesel cars weighed on demand. Sales slumped by 11.2% last month to 163,541 vehicles, putting the industry on course for the first drop in annual sales since 2011. New car sales in the first 11 months of 2017 were down by 5% at 2.39m. The November decline was driven by a 30.6% fall in diesel sales according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which more than offset a 5% rise in petrol and 33% rise in alternatively fuelled vehicles. Companies cut back on new cars the most, with business registrations slumping by 33.6%. Private registrations fell by 5.1%, while fleet registrations dropped by 14.4%. \u201cAn eighth month of decline in the new car market is a major concern, with falling business and consumer confidence exacerbated by ongoing anti-diesel messages from government,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the industry trade body. \u201cDiesel remains the right choice for many drivers, not least because of its fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions. The decision to tax the latest low emission diesels is a step backwards and will only discourage drivers from trading in their older, more polluting cars. \u201cGiven fleet renewal is the fastest way to improve air quality, penalising the latest, cleanest diesels is counterproductive and will have detrimental environmental and economic consequences.\u201d Chris Bosworth, the director of strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, said the November slump in sales also reflected uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future outside the EU, which is making consumers more reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. \u201cBrexit is having an obvious impact on the market as a whole as consumer confidence remains low,\u201d he said. Household finances are under pressure from falling real pay, as prices rise faster than wages following the sharp fall in the value of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote in June 2016. Falling demand for new cars ends five years of growth in the market, fuelled by cheap finance deals and compensation payouts where payment protection insurance was mis-sold. The new car industry in the UK is now lagging behind the rest of Europe, where car sales are rising. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Provident Financial\u2019s share price has fallen more than 10% after the the City watchdog revealed it has launched an investigation into Moneybarn, a company controlled by the subprime lender that provides car loans to people with poor credit history. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will focus on how Moneybarn decides whether applicants can really afford its loans, and on how it treats customers who fall into financial difficulty. Provident shares have fallen sharply since the beginning of 2017. It has issued two profit warnings, parted company with its chief executive and cancelled a dividend for shareholders. Last month it announced Manjit Wolstenholme, its executive chairman, had died suddenly aged 53. Shares in Bradford-based Provident Financial fell nearly 20% in early trading after it announced the investigation and said it would work with the watchdog. The share price later recovered, closing down just over 10% at 790.5p. It said: \u201cThe Provident Financial group aims to act responsibly in all its relationships, and to play a positive role in the communities it serves. \u201cThe company will work collaboratively with the FCA to investigate the remaining concerns and resolve any outstanding related issues as soon as practicable.\u201d The FCA has been monitoring Moneybarn since it authorised the loans company to conduct consumer credit activities in June 2016 and Provident Financial, known as \u201cthe Provvy\u201d, said Moneybarn had already \u201cmade a number of process improvements, including to the way it deals with future loan terminations\u201d. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said the investigation signalled \u201cmore trouble at the Provvy\u201d. \u201c[The FCA investigation] adds to the woes for the embattled lender and is another headache for management at the worst time,\u201d Wilson said. Provident Financial has about 2.5m customers, and grew rapidly in the years after the financial crisis, stepping in to offer credit to people who could not secure loans from banks as they became more wary of risky lending. Earlier this year it announced changes to its 130-year-old business model of sending self-employed sales agents door to door, offering loans and collecting debts, in favour of making greater use of technology. The then chief executive, Peter Crook, unveiled plans to replace 4,500 sales agents with 2,500 full-time \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d (CEMs), who would be connected to head office via iPads, with their time managed more efficiently as a result of analytical software. The CEMs were given iPads but were sent to the wrong addresses, or the correct ones at the wrong time, and were unable to make sales or collect payments. As a result, debt collection rates fell sharply, from 90% in 2016 to just 57%, before recovering slightly to 65% in September. Wilson said: \u201cThe real question is whether it can get its core doorstep lending business back in shape. On that front the outlook is very uncertain. \u201cWhile the numbers are showing some small improvement, the \u2018fix\u2019 in the home credit business retains the employed operating model which has been the source of the problems as agents have left in droves to rivals. The employment of 300 part-time collection managers \u2013 largely from the old agent base \u2013 was an admission that the new model is flawed.\u201d The FCA declined to comment on the investigation. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Palmer &amp; Harvey\u2019s pension deficit more than doubled over the past 10 years to \u00a380m, as shareholders and some directors took about \u00a370m in dividends from the heavily indebted and loss-making convenience store supplier. The company, which went into administration last week with the loss of 2,500 jobs and a further 900 at risk, was owned by dozens of private individuals via a complex web of equity and loans. Shareholders received more than \u00a38m a year in dividends even as the company made losses of more than \u00a310m a year, a Guardian investigation revealed last week. The company supplied 90,000 stores, including 50,000 independents, which are now struggling to secure stocks of tobacco and groceries at one of the busiest times of the year. Since it fell into administration, P&amp;H\u2019s pension scheme, which has 2,500 members, is being assessed for entry into the pensions lifeboat, an industry-funded scheme set up by the government. Future retirees are only guaranteed 90% of their expected benefits under the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). However, anyone already collecting their pension at P&amp;H will still get their benefits in full. It is understood that the pension deficit under the PPF assessment is \u00a380m, as first reported by the Daily Mail. The Guardian has established that this is a rise of more than \u00a350m from the deficit level in 2007, the year before a management-led buyout which saddled P&amp;H with new debts and a large annual dividend. One well-informed source said that the pension deficit increase had been most marked in the past five to six years. Frank Field MP, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee, said he would be looking into events at P&amp;H and prepare a report for parliament. Field has written to the Pensions Regulator asking whether a recovery plan is in place. He also wrote to the chair of the group\u2019s pension fund trustees on Monday asking whether they had challenged the group\u2019s dividend policy and how the company\u2019s board had justified these payments. He said the committee was examining whether it was necessary to introduce further legislation that would give the Pensions Regulator more power to prevent shareholders extracting cash from companies that had a pension deficit. \u201cCompanies pension schemes are being left vulnerable and falling into PPF while directors are walking off with huge sums of money before the crisis becomes public. We have to revamp the regulator so they are given, and then use, the powers to say \u2018we have a hold on that money\u2019.\u201d Accounts for Palmer &amp; Harvey (Holdings), one of the group\u2019s parent companies, show a pension deficit of \u00a35.3m in 2016, down from \u00a310.5m a year before but up from \u00a31.45m in 2009. This accounting estimate is based on less conservative estimates about the likely future liabilities and asset performance than the PPF. A PPF spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware that Palmer &amp; Harvey has gone into administration. As a result, we expect that the pension scheme will enter the PPF assessment period, and members can be reassured that we are there to protect them.\u201d P&amp;H was bought by its management team in 2008 in a deal that valued the company at \u00a3345m. The deal was largely funded by debt. P&amp;H has paid out more than \u00a380m in bank interest charges since 2008 on top of about \u00a370m in dividends to shareholders. P&amp;H (2008), the wholesaler\u2019s parent company, paid out more than \u00a38m a year in dividends since 2009 to its shareholders despite making losses of about \u00a310m a year or more in all but one year, 2014. From 2005, companies have been able to seek clearance for buyouts from the Pensions Regulator, protecting directors from action to secure additional money for the fund in future. It is not clear whether P&amp;H\u2019s owners did so and the regulator declined to comment. \u2022This article was amended on 5 December 2017 to clarify that anyone already collecting their pension at P&amp;H will still get their benefits in full.",

Rich people, hit by a collapse in art pricesafter the 2007-2008 financial crisis, have returned to the market, according to high end estate agent Knight Frank.

However, confidence seems to have returned to the art market in 2017, highlighted spectacularly by the recent record-breaking sale of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Salvator Mundi for $450m [\u00a3333m]. Contemporary artists like Basquiat are also seeing higher and higher prices paid for their works.\u201d Shirley said the record sum paid for Salvator Mundi was a spectacular one-off \u201cbut there are plenty selling for $50m, $100m, $200m \u2013 the confidence is definitely back\u201d. Rich art buyers are most interested in modern contemporary art, according to Knight Frank, with works by Andy Warhol and Lucian Freud attracting considerable attention. Shirley said most buyers are from North America or Europe, but wealthy Chinese are increasingly interested in western art. \u201cAs the developing world becomes more mature, and people send their children to school in the UK they start to become more exposed to art and become wine connoisseurs,\u201d he said.

The Japanese airline said on Tuesday it had invested $10m (\u00a37.4m) in Boom Supersonic, a Denver-based startup aiming to build a new generation of supersonic jets promising 3.5-hour flights from London to New York for an \u201caffordable\u201d $5,000 return as soon as 2025. As part of the deal, JAL has an option to pre-order 20 of the Boom aircraft, which it could use on routes from Tokyo to the west coast of the US and Canada. Currently a flight from San Francisco to Tokyo takes 11 hours \u2013 a Boom aircraft flying at Mach 2.2 could in theory make the journey in half the time. \u201cWe are very proud to be working with Boom on the possible advancement in the commercial aviation industry,\u201d said Yoshiharu Ueki, the president of JAL. \u201cThrough this partnership, we hope to contribute to the future of supersonic travel with the intent of providing more time to our valued passengers while emphasising flight safety.\u201d Blake Scholl, the founder and chief executive of Boom Supersonic, said the company had been secretly working with JAL for more than a year to understand more about the dynamics of commercial flight operations. \u201cOur goal is to develop an airliner that will be a great addition to any international airline\u2019s fleet.\u201d Branson\u2019s Spaceship company is already working with Boom on the development of the supersonic jets, which are expected to have 45-55 business class seats. Branson has the rights to the first 10 Boom aircraft produced. Scholl, a pilot and former Amazon executive, has said his Boom will be \u201cbetter than Concorde\u201d and commercial flights could be up and running as soon as 2025. While several other companies, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, are developing new supersonic jets, Scholl said his plan was likely to beat them to the market as it does not require any new technology for regulator approval. \u201cThink about for a moment the families that are separated because of the long flights. Think about the trips not taken because when you add up the lost hours, the trip just doesn\u2019t feel worth it,\u201d he said at the Dubai Airshow last month. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to be on the Forbes\u2019 list to be able to fly, it will cost about the same as flying business class today. The ultimate goal is to make supersonic affordable for anyone who flies.\u201d Scholl said he started the project because he was \u201csad that I never got to fly on Concorde\u201d. \u201cI waited but no one was doing it, so I decided to,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately I want people to be able to get anywhere in the world in five hours for $100. To get there you have to improve fuel efficiency, but step-by-step supersonic air travel will become available for everyone. \u201cThis is supersonic passenger air travel, no bullshit, and it\u2019s actually affordable.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than one in six people working on housebuilding sites across Britain come from other EU countries, rising to half of site workers in London, according to a new report. A survey of 37,000 housebuilding workers across Britain shows 17.7% are from the EU. More than half of those come from Romania, with 12% from Poland and almost 10% from Ireland. In London, where housing demand is at its most acute, some building skills are dominated by EU workers, with more than 70% of carpenters, 63% of demolition and groundworks workers, 61% of general labourers, 54% of plasterers, painters and decorators, 44% of bricklayers and nearly 40% of roofers hailing from other EU countries. Nationwide, 15% of bricklayers , 25% of general labourers and almost 18% of finishing trades, which include plasterers, painters and decorators, come from the EU. The survey by the Home Builders Federation (HBF) on more than 1,000 housebuilding sites, underlines the extent of UK sites\u2019 reliance on overseas workers. The federation said its report was the first extensive survey of the sector and showed that builders would need continued access to skilled EU workers following Brexit to deliver the government\u2019s target of building 300,000 homes a year. The federation is lobbying the government for a special permit system (similar to the mooted barista visas) that would allow housebuilders to recruit workers from abroad after 2019 to ramp up construction from the 217,00 homes built last year. In the capital, 56% of workers in the housebuilding sector are from outside the UK and 49.5% are EU nationals. Of those, half come from Romania, 8.5% from Bulgaria, and 6.4% from Poland. The federation said that although tens of thousands of UK-born workers have been recruited and trained in recent years, training took time and would not be enough to meet demand. It said that with an ageing UK workforce, the reliance on EU nationals was likely to grow. About 70% of overseas workers are in their 20s or 30s compared with just over 50% of their UK colleagues. Federation spokesman Steve Turner said: \u201cWe needed evidence that demonstrates housebuilding should be treated as a special case; hopefully this quite clearly demonstrates that it is a special case and heavily reliant on EU labour.\u201d However, the survey shows that most EU housebuilding site workers intend to stay in Britain. Fewer than 7% of EU nationals surveyed said they were not intending to stay in the UK industry. Stewart Baseley, the federation\u2019s executive chairman, said: \u201cThe results of this census clearly demonstrate the reliance the industry currently has on non-UK workers. Output is up a massive 74% in recent years but achieving the very challenging targets set by government will require further big increases in workforce capacity. \u201cWhile the industry is investing heavily in recruiting and training young people leaving our schools, colleges and universities, continued access to overseas workers is absolutely essential.\u201d More than 217,000 new homes were built across the UK last year \u2013 15% more than in the previous year but still well short of the government\u2019s target of 300,000 homes a year. In London, 39,600 homes were built, the highest number since the 1930s. The new London plan published last week set a target for 65,000 new homes a year although the government has indicated the figure should be 72,000 to meet housing needs.",

More than half of those come from Romania, with 12% from Poland and almost 10% from Ireland.</p> <p>In London, where housing demand is at its most acute, some building skills are dominated by EU workers, with more than 70% of carpenters, 63% of demolition and groundworks workers, 61% of general labourers, 54% of plasterers, painters and decorators, 44% of bricklayers and nearly 40% of roofers hailing from other EU countries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/15/single-market-exit-brexit-uk-construction-sector-lose-175000-eu-workers\">Single market exit: UK construction 'could lose 175,000 EU workers'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nationwide, 15% of bricklayers , 25% of general labourers and almost 18% of finishing trades, which include plasterers, painters and decorators, come from the EU.</p> <p>The survey by the Home Builders Federation (HBF) on more than 1,000 housebuilding sites, underlines the extent of UK sites\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/15/single-market-exit-brexit-uk-construction-sector-lose-175000-eu-workers\">reliance on overseas workers</a>.

About 70% of overseas workers are in their 20s or 30s compared with just over 50% of their UK colleagues.</p> <p>Federation spokesman Steve Turner said: \u201cWe needed evidence that demonstrates housebuilding should be treated as a special case; hopefully this quite clearly demonstrates that it is a special case and heavily reliant on EU labour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2017-12-04T14:56:13/embed.html\" data-alt=\"% of non-UK workers in London by trade\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2017-12-04T14:56:13/embed.html\">% of non-UK workers in London by trade</a> </figure>  <p>However, the survey shows that most EU housebuilding site workers intend to stay in Britain.

      "bodyText": "Companies would not be forced to appoint workers to their boards and instead be allowed to choose how they intend to heed the views of employees, according to proposals to overhaul boardroom rules. The proposals, to be published on Tuesday, appear to confirm that Theresa May\u2019s pledge to put workers on boards \u2013 made during her campaign last year to become Conservative party leader \u2013 has been abandoned. Within three months she had started to water down the pledge, while in August the government offered three potential options to give employees a voice in the boardroom. The government said it would ask the Financial Reporting Council \u2013 the accountancy regulator that oversees the corporate governance code for all listed stock market companies \u2013 to consult on the three options. A consultation published by the FRC includes all three options \u2013 to assign a non-executive director to represent employees, to create an employee advisory council or to nominate a director from the workforce. While it does not list other options, it means that the City corporate code will include a provision for employees\u2019 voices to be heard in the boardroom. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said it was \u201cgood that the code recognises the key role workers\u2019 voices play within businesses\u201d. \u201cThe next step is for the corporate governance code to recognise the important role that unions play in the long-term success of companies,\u201d she added. The code operates across stock market listed companies and operates on a \u201ccomply or explain\u201d basis so that companies which ignore its provisions must provide an explanation. The consultation \u2013 open until February \u2013 also includes plans that would require firms to publish their gender balance, building upon recommendations in the review by Sir Philip Hampton and Dame Helen Alexander, who died in August, in to boardroom diversity. The FRC is proposing that these figures include the first layer of management below the board \u2013 and their direct reports \u2013 and goes further than suggested by including all companies and not just the 350 biggest listings on the stock market. It does not propose similar disclosure on ethnicity but asks for views on whether it should encourage the release of more information on this issue. The FRC\u2019s latest proposals would also mean that companies which have a 20% vote against their remuneration report would have to explain how they intend to discuss the dissent with shareholders. Sir Win Bischoff, chair of the FRC, said: \u201cAt this crucial time and as the country approaches Brexit, a revised code will be essential to restoring trust in business, attracting investment and ensuring the long-term success of companies for ... wider society.\u201d",
