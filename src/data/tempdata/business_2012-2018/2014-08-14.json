      "bodyText": "A Barclays document sent to shareholders has laid bare the full extent of the bank's legal woes, ranging from continuing court tussles over rigging interest rates to allegations of ripping off its own clients. As the bank battles to restore its tarnished reputation, the investor prospectus makes clear it faces multimillion-pound payouts and years of costly litigation. Although the prospectus was published as part of a \u00a360bn programme of bond sales, more than 10% of the 146-page document is devoted to \"risk factors\" \u2013 or wrongdoing, whether alleged or proven. The prospectus, first spotted by the FT's Alphaville columnist, contains few new charges, but will make uncomfortable reading for Barclays shareholders who this year staged a protest against the board's decision to pay out \u00a32.4bn in bonuses at a time of shrinking profits. One of the biggest cases centres on a $1.25bn claim for damages against Barclays and nine other banks for manipulating Libor, the benchmark interest rates that determine the cost of credit for borrowers across the globe. Smaller lenders have banded together to seek damages, arguing that artificially low Libor rates depressed their income. Barclays, which has already paid \u00a3290m to US regulators and \u00a360m to the UK after admitting its role in manipulating Libor, is battling similar class actions for alleged manipulation of the equivalent rates for the euro and yen. The document also details the $280m settlement Barclays paid in April to the giant US federal home loan finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after allegations of selling faulty mortgage-backed securities during the US housing bubble. Allegations of rigging electricity markets in California and of not publishing key information on the UK stock market give a flavour of the variety of legal battles Barclays is fighting. But the biggest headache for the bank's chief executive, Antony Jenkins, is the allegation that Barclays ripped off its own customers in its so-called dark pool, a private trading platform that allows investors to remain anonymous until trades are completed. Allegations of \"fraud and deceit\" have been levelled at the bank by the New York attorney general since Jenkins began his clean-up. Barclays has defended itself against the accusations and said the charge sheet contained \"clear and substantial errors\". The final bill is impossible to calculate, as in many cases Barclays states it is unable to estimate potential fines or damages. However, the bank did say that it did not expect the cases to have \"a material impact\", implying it does not expect a hit on profits.",

    "webTitle": "France calls on ECB to act as eurozone growth grinds to a halt", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "France piled pressure on the European Central Bank to do more to boost growth on Thursday after news that economic activity across the 18-nation single currency area came to a halt in the second quarter. With France registering zero growth for a second successive quarter, Michel Sapin, the country's finance minister, halved his growth forecast for this year, abandoned the deficit reduction target and said it was up to the Frankfurt-based ECB to respond to an \"exceptional situation of weak growth and weak inflation across the eurozone\". Sapin's demand came as the latest figures from Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, showed that problems in the single currency's Big Three economies \u2013 Germany, France and Italy \u2013 resulted in no increase in eurozone gross domestic product in the three months to June. That compares with an increase of 0.2% in the first quarter. But financial markets saw no immediate prospect of the ECB launching its own money creation (quantitative easing) programme until next year at the earliest, amid concerns that countries such as France and Italy would row back on structural reform if fresh growth-boosting stimulus policies were introduced. The interest rate \u2013 or yield \u2013 on 10-year German bonds briefly fell below 1% for the first time as dealers anticipated a protracted period of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates. Markets already knew that Italian output had contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter but were surprised by a similar-sized fall in Germany, which was hurt by a more challenging climate for its key export sector. France made it clear it blamed foot-dragging on the part of the ECB for the failure of the eurozone's second-biggest economy as it reduced its growth forecast for 2014 from 1% to 0.5% and ditched the 1.7% forecast for 2015, saying it would not expand by much more than 1%. Francois Hollande's government had negotiated special dispensation from Brussels to run a budget deficit of 3.8% of GDP this year rather than 3%, but Sapin said it was the ECB's fault that this would not be hit. \"We must adapt the pace of deficit reduction to the exceptional situation ... of growth that is too weak everywhere in Europe and the exceptional situation of inflation that is too weak across Europe,\" Sapin told Europe 1 radio. He also used an article in Le Monde to urge the ECB to do more to combat the threat of deflation and to reduce the level of the euro. \"The truth is that, as a direct consequence of sluggish growth and insufficient inflation, France will not meet its public deficit target this year despite a complete control of spending.\" Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said pressure was mounting on Mario Draghi, the ECB president. \"Draghi is involved in a game of brinkmanship. It is not fiscal austerity but evidence of structural reform that he is looking for before he considers sanctioning European style QE, especially from Italy and France. \"However, structural reforms do not happen overnight and, as the case for QE strengthens, any delay will have a disproportionate impact on the pace of recovery in the rest of Europe.\" Some of the smaller economies on the periphery of the eurozone \u2013 including Spain and Portugal \u2013 recorded solid growth in the second quarter, and the Netherlands bounced back from a weak first quarter to expand by 0.5%. But Germany, France and Italy between them account for two-thirds of eurozone GDP and dragged down the overall growth figure. The annual rate of growth fell from 0.9% in the first quarter to 0.7% in the second quarter. Markets had been expecting growth in the second quarter to be 0.1% or 0.2%, but said the fresh setback to the eurozone raised the prospect of a triple-dip recession. The eurozone suffered a sharp contraction in 2008-09 and then had a second, milder downturn from which it only finally emerged during 2013. The figures released by Eurostat covered a period before the recent deterioration in ties between the European Union and Russia over the Ukraine, which has led to tit-for-tat sanctions and falling business confidence in Germany. Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said: \"A stalling of economic growth in the second quarter raises concerns that the euro area is sliding back into a triple-dip recession. Many, including the European Central Bank, point to survey data suggesting such fears are overplayed, and that growth will revive as previously announced stimulus takes effect. But the weakness of economic growth will certainly fuel louder calls for the ECB to do more to reinvigorate growth across the single currency area.\" Peter Vanden Houte, economist at ING, said: \"Today's figures show that the upturn remains too weak to withstand external shocks, meaning that GDP growth will probably remain stuck in stop-and-go mode. It now looks very likely that GDP growth for the whole of 2014 will remain below 1.0%.\"",

For the first time since 2008 \u2013 a year before the outbreak of its worst financial crisis in modern times \u2013 the economy has made its smallest contraction ever, shrinking by 0.2 percent in the first quarter, it\u2019s slowest annual pace in six years and the best hope yet that the country may finally be emerging from its worst ever recession.</p> <p>And for a country where trickle-down economics begins with tourism there is more good news: Greece appears to have become the hottest tourist destination on the continent of Europe with arrivals more than meeting target goals, according to the Confederation of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE). </p> <p>Despite a drop in tourists from Russia and the Ukraine, Greece is well on track to hosting 19 million holiday-makers this year (21.5 million if visitors on cruise ships are taken into account), by far the highest record ever. Revenues are predicted to reach 13 billion euro or just over 17 percent of gross national output. Andreas Andreadis, who heads SETE, said arrivals from January to July had shot up by 16.5 percent, compared to the same period last year, a major incentive for growth. Leading airports showed double-digit increases with Athens posting a 31% rise and Kalamata and Mykonos (new landing grounds for Ryan Air and Easy Jet) showing increases of 39.9% and 62.5 percent respectively.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53ecb952e4b0f5010eedd7ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-14T13:35:44.285Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets have largely recovered from this morning\u2019s dip. </p> <ul> <li>FTSE 100 up 0.45%, or 30 points at 6687<br></li> <li>Germany DAX up 0.4%<br></li> <li>France CAC up 0.3%<br></li> <li>Italy FTSE MIB up 0.3%<br></li> <li>Spain IBEX down 0.1%<br></li> </ul> <p>And with that we\u2019ll close the blog for the day.

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: By all accounts it\u2019s been a great week for figures in Greece. For the first time since 2008 \u2013 a year before the outbreak of its worst financial crisis in modern times \u2013 the economy has made its smallest contraction ever, shrinking by 0.2 percent in the first quarter, it\u2019s slowest annual pace in six years and the best hope yet that the country may finally be emerging from its worst ever recession. And for a country where trickle-down economics begins with tourism there is more good news: Greece appears to have become the hottest tourist destination on the continent of Europe with arrivals more than meeting target goals, according to the Confederation of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE). Despite a drop in tourists from Russia and the Ukraine, Greece is well on track to hosting 19 million holiday-makers this year (21.5 million if visitors on cruise ships are taken into account), by far the highest record ever. Revenues are predicted to reach 13 billion euro or just over 17 percent of gross national output. Andreas Andreadis, who heads SETE, said arrivals from January to July had shot up by 16.5 percent, compared to the same period last year, a major incentive for growth. Leading airports showed double-digit increases with Athens posting a 31% rise and Kalamata and Mykonos (new landing grounds for Ryan Air and Easy Jet) showing increases of 39.9% and 62.5 percent respectively. Markets have largely recovered from this morning\u2019s dip. FTSE 100 up 0.45%, or 30 points at 6687 Germany DAX up 0.4% France CAC up 0.3% Italy FTSE MIB up 0.3% Spain IBEX down 0.1% And with that we\u2019ll close the blog for the day. Thanks for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning. A handy map to guide you through the GDP data out today, courtesy of the Guardian\u2019s graphics team. (Jo Moulds taking over from Graeme briefly) Europe\u2019s faltering recovery has taken a blow after growth in the region ground to a halt in the last quarter. Eurozone GDP was flat in the April-June quarter, compared to January-March, as its three largest members all struggled. Germany suffered an unexpected 0.2% contraction, matching Italy which fell back into recession. France\u2019s GDP was unchanged for the second quarter running, dashing hopes of a modest return to growth. [round-up here] There was better news in the \u2018periphery\u2019, with Portugal and Spain both growing by 0.6% in Q2. The Netherlands grew by 0.5%, and there are also hopes that Greece\u2019s downturn is over. Our news story is here: Eurozone growth splutters to a halt as crisis enters new phase Full rolling coverage starts here. And here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s analysis: Eurozone can learn from George Osborne and Bank of England stimulus Fears are growing that the euro area risks sinking into a new recession. Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, says: \u201cA stalling of economic growth in the second quarter raises concerns that the euro area is sliding back into a triple dip recession. Many, including the European Central Bank, point to survey data suggesting such fears are overplayed, and that growth will revive as previously announced stimulus take effect. But the weakness of economic growth will certainly fuel louder calls for the ECB to do more to reinvigorate growth across the single currency area.\u201d Could the eurozone be dragged deeper into a lost decade? Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe Generale, sums up the problems: Too little growth to stop the debt snowball, a vicious cycle of fiscal austerity and lack of aggregate demand staying in place and dooming Europe to Japanification. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, agrees pressure is mounting on ECB chief Mario Draghi: Draghi is involved in a game of brinkmanship. It is not fiscal austerity but evidence of structural reform that he is looking for before he considers sanctioning European style QE, especially from Italy and France. However, structural reforms do not happen overnight, and as the case for QE strengthens, any delay will have a disproportionate impact on the pace of recovery in the rest of Europe. The weak data forced France to admit that it won\u2019t hit its goal of lowering its deficit to 3.8% of GDP this year. Finance minister Michel Sapin halved its growth forecast in 2014 to 0.5%, from 1%, and pleaded for leniency: \u201cEuropean policies must be refocused by adapting the pace of deficit reduction to the current economic environment\u201d. And even more money has flooded into German and French government debt, driving down the yield on 10-year German bunds below 1% for the first time ever. That shows investors are bracing for weak growth, and perhaps a QE programme. Thank you for the many excellent comments this morning. Here\u2019s a selection: Back in the stock markets, and Europe\u2019s leading indices have recovered their early falls, despite the grim GDP data. The FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC are all up around 0.5%. The rally comes as Russian president Vladimir Putin pledged that Russia would do \u201ceverything in our power\u201d to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine. As flagged up earlier, the eurozone suffered a double-dose of bad news this morning - with inflation hitting just 0.4%, its lowest level since 2009. As this graph shows, Europe\u2019s economy faltered three years ago as the debt crisis exploded. It recovered after that crisis eased, but hopes of a sustained bounce-back have faltered: There is more chance of Germany suffering a recession this year than adding the European Championship trophy to the World Cup it secured last month in Brazil: Here\u2019s Paddy Power\u2019s latest odds: Will Germany have two consecutive quarters of negative growth in 2014? 7/4 Yes 2/5 No Will the Eurozone area have two consecutive quarters of negative growth in 2014? 5/6 Yes 5/6 No Germany to win Euro 2016 3/1 Here\u2019s a phrase you don\u2019t read every day on the Guardian.... \u201cGive George Osborne some credit.\u201d Why, exactly? Because the chancellor had enough gumption to abandon his goal of eliminating Britain\u2019s budget deficit in this parliament, once it became abundantly clear that the plan was off course. As Larry Elliott, our economics editor, argues, Europe should take note: Want to understand what\u2019s happening in the eurozone? Then think back a couple of years to the early years of the UK\u2019s coalition government. That was the time when the British economy was flatlining. Sure, there were periods when activity expanded. But the recovery never really gained traction and was vulnerable to unexpected shocks. Sometimes these were external \u2013 as with the eurozone\u2019s debt crisis; sometimes they were internal \u2013 as with ill-timed and excessive austerity. The upshot was that the recovery never really got going until the Bank of England stepped in with its Funding for Lending Scheme and put some oomph back into the housing market. Now take a look at the eurozone. Here too, the economy is struggling to gain traction. Here too, it is extremely sensitive to shocks, the latest of which is the threat of a full-scale confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. Here too, there has been far too much austerity far too soon..... To read on, click here: Eurozone can learn from George Osborne and Bank of England stimulus Today\u2019s weak data has not hurt the euro. It\u2019s hovering around $1.337 against the US dollar, and 80.1p against the pound. But Jonathan Wilks, head of foreign exchange dealing at Investec Corporate and Institutional Treasury, reckons the single currency could weaken, hurting British firms who export to the eurozone. He says: \u201cThe euro may not have moved immediately in response to the disappointing economic data from France and Germany but if speculation about further central bank stimulus is correct, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see a longer term weakening trend for the currency. \u201cAs the economies of the UK and continental Europe increasingly uncouple, the opposite is likely for sterling when interest rates finally increase, creating a headache for anyone exporting to the European market. Profits are already being eroded by the strength of the pound, with many companies already having to restate their forecasts. Given the dynamics in play at the moment it would be unwise to bet against more of the same in the next reporting season.\u201d Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s news story on today\u2019s disappointing GDP figures: Eurozone growth splutters to a halt as crisis enters new phase It includes this warning, from Chris Williamson, economist at Markit: \u201cA stalling of economic growth in the second quarter raises concerns that the euro area is sliding back into a triple dip recession. Many, including the European Central Bank, point to survey data suggesting such fears are overplayed, and that growth will revive as previously announced stimulus take effect. But the weakness of economic growth will certainly fuel louder calls for the ECB to do more to reinvigorate growth across the single currency area.\u201d Quarter-on-quarter growth data can be erratic, so we should also look at the year-on-year figures for a broader view. And Alberto Nardelli, our incoming data editor, has even colour-coded the latest data (green = growth; purple/pink = contraction). Here\u2019s a round-up of all the latest growth/contraction figures for the EU (I\u2019ve excluded countries who haven\u2019t reported GDP for the second quarter yet). Belgium: +0.1% quarter-on-quarter Bulgaria: +0.5% Czech Republic: 0.0 Germany: -0.2% Estonia: +0.5% Spain: + 0.6% France: 0.0% Italy: -0.2% Cyprus: -0.3% Latvia: +1.0% Lithuania: +0.7% Hungary: +0.8% Netherlands: +0.5 Austria: +0.2% Poland: +0.6% Portugal: +0.6% Romania: -1.0% Slovakia: +0.6% Finland: +0.1% Sweden: +0.2% United Kingdom: +0.8% Which all adds up to zero growth in the eurozone, and 0.2% growth in the EU. Two years after calming the eurozone crisis by pledging to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro, ECB chief Mario Draghi is under pressure again to revive growth and fend off deflation. Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. says \u201call eyes are on Draghi to take further action to boost liquidity\u201d Even Europe\u2019s biggest economies are showing signs of trouble, which is dragging on corporate earnings. Italy has fallen back into recession, while more forward looking data points to an ongoing slowdown in both France and Germany, triggering the euro to hit an 11 month low.... Draghi is involved in a game of brinkmanship. It is not fiscal austerity but evidence of structural reform that he is looking for before he considers sanctioning European style QE, especially from Italy and France. However, structural reforms do not happen overnight, and as the case for QE strengthens, any delay will have a disproportionate impact on the pace of recovery in the rest of Europe. The pressure on Draghi is mounting. \u201cThe euro zone is staring recession in the face once more,\u201d warns Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown, after seeing that growth stuttered to a halt last quarter. He also believes that the weakness in Germany\u2019s economy could melt the country\u2019s opposition to quantitative easing* in the eurozone (* - creating new money to buy government bonds and hopefully stimulate growth) Brettell says: This exceptionally weak data increases the pressure on Mario Draghi to make good his pledge to \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d and finally embark on a quantitative easing programme. Indeed the French finance minister has released a statement urging the ECB chief to act. Ideally Draghi would have liked breathing space to see if the measures introduced in June have the desired effect, but in truth today\u2019s dreadful data calls for urgent action to prevent the euro zone slipping into a Japan-style cycle of stagnation and deflation. The most severe problems in the euro zone have so far been limited to the periphery, with the core remaining in relative good health, but the last few months have seen something of a shift. Some peripheral economies are now registering decent GDP growth (Portugal beat forecasts with 0.6% in Q2 and Spain is growing at the same rate), whilst the core looks in increasing trouble. Germany has always been a notable opponent to quantitative easing \u2013 Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann said this week that the responsibility for stimulating growth lies with individual member states rather than the ECB - but perhaps today\u2019s shock GDP contraction will lead to a softening in this stance. Cyprus remains in recession, but the pace of the downturn in the austerity-gripped country has eased. Cyprus\u2019s GDP fell by another 0.3% in Q2, compared with a 0.6% fall in January-March. Its economy has shrunk by 2.5% over the last year. We also have confirmation that the eurozone slipped closer to deflation last month. The euro area consumer prices index rose by just 0.4% in July, the lowest rate since October 2009. Prices are falling in five EU countries \u2013 Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Slovakia, and were flat in Italy, Estonia and Poland. While the eurozone stagnated, the wider European Union grew by 0.2% in April-June. That\u2019s partly thanks to the UK, which recorded a 0.8% rise in GDP. Eurostat\u2019s report is here. It includes this chart, showing how the US economy outpaced Europe in Q2, with growth of around 1%. Breaking: The Eurozone economy stagnated in the second quarter of the year, confirming fears over the strength of the recovery. Eurostat reports that GDP across the euro area was flat in the April-June quarter, as growth ground to a halt. The economy was dragged back by the shock contraction in Germany, where the economy shrank by 0.2%. The ongoing malaise in France, which has stagnated since the start of the year, is also holding back the recovery. As we have tracked for the last few hours, this morning\u2019s growth data has painted a rather dire picture for the euro area. Portugal and the Netherlands, along with Spain last week, were rare highlights. OK, it\u2019s nearly time to find out how the overall eurozone economy performed in the second quarter of 2014. Economists had predicted that GDP would only rise by 0.1%. But that was before we learned that Germany had contracted by 0.2%, and that France was still stagnating..... Portugal\u2019s INE statistics body says an \u201cincrease in Exports of Goods and Services\u201d helped the country post 0.6% growth last quarter. On an annual basis, GDP is up by 0.8% -- pulled back by the contraction in the first quarter. There will be sighs of relief in Lisbon, as Portugal\u2019s economy returns to growth after a bad start to the year. Portuguese GDP rose by 0.6% in April-June, beating forecasts of 0.5%. That follows the 0.6% contraction in January-March. This means Portugal has joined Spain and Slovakia as the fastest-growing countries in the euro area (I think). Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe Generale, sums up the problem in Europe: Too little growth to stop the debt snowball, a vicious cycle of fiscal austerity and lack of aggregate demand staying in place and dooming Europe to Japanification. A rise in exports helped Bulgaria to grow by 0.5% during the last quarter. On an annual basis, GDP rose by 1.6%. The surge of money into German government bonds has driven the interest rate, or yield, on 10-year bunds below the 1% mark for the first time ever. French government has also rallied in value, pushing down the yield on its 10-year debt to just 1.392%. Such low yields are a sign that investors expect weak growth, and low inflation, in the euro area for a while. Decent growth figures from Poland -- its economy grew by 3.2% over the last year. The winners and losers so far: Slovakia\u2019s economy expanded by 0.6% during the last quarter. That matches Spain\u2019s growth rate during the quarter (Spanish GDP was released a couple of weeks ago). France\u2019s declaration today that it will miss its deficit targets isn\u2019t a surprise, but is an important moment. So says city analyst Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. The Netherlands has returned to growth, in a much-needed boost for the eurozone after a bruising morning. The Dutch economy grew by 0.5% in the April-June quarter, its statistics office reports. And the contraction in the first three months of the year has also been revised up, to a 0.4% drop in GDP from 0.6% initially (partly due to a drop in energy use during the mild winter) Interesting point: Investors in Paris and Frankfurt are not impressed by today\u2019s data. France\u2019s CAC 40 index of leading shares has fallen by 0.35%, or 14 points, in early trading to 4180. The German DAX lost 26 points, or 0.3%, to 9172. Austria has outpaced Germany. Austrian GDP rose by 0.2% in the April-June quarter. Not a great performance, but better than many neighbours. Wolfgang Munchau of EuroIntelligence says today\u2019s figures from Germany and France are \u201cabsolutely awful\u201d -- putting the eurozone \u201conce again on the brink of recession\u201d. Ferdinand Fichtner, economist at Germany\u2019s DIW thinktank, says: (via Reuters): \u201cThe German economy may have slipped into a slight recession due to crises.\u201d To be an official recession, German GDP would also have to fall during the current quarter. The escalating tensions between the West and Moscow (which has banned many food imports) makes that more likely. Bad news from Romania, though. It\u2019s annual growth rate has more than halved in the last three months, to +1.2% from 3.4% in Q1. Finally some good news, from Hungary. Its economy grew by 3.9% over the last 12 months, up from 3.5% in the first quarter of 2014. That\u2019s the fastest annual rate since 2006. (Quarter-on-quarter data isn\u2019t available). Sovereign bond expert Nick Spiro is alarmed by the state of the eurozone economy right now: Lots more growth data to come this morning, from smaller countries across the European Union. The Wall Street Journal has helpfully rounded up the details 08:00 Slovakia, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania 08:30 Netherlands 09:00 Poland, Bulgaria 09:30 Portugal 10:00 Euro zone As well as halving France\u2019s growth forecast in 2014 to just 0.5%, finance minister Michel Sapin also urged the European Central Bank to use \u201call available means to fight deflation and bring euro to more competitive level\u201d, in his op-ed piece in Le Monde today. The ECB has already promised to flood the euro banking sector with another \u20ac400bn in cheap liquidity, to encourage small business lending. But critics are certain to seize on today\u2019s disappointing growth in Germany and France as proof that it must go further, and embrace full-blown quantitative easing (buying government bonds and securities with new money). ECB chief Mario Draghi has said QE is an option. But he\u2019s also repeatedly urged eurozone leaders to crack on with economic reforms to stimulate growth. Not an area where France has excelled. It\u2019s been a double-whammy of bad eurozone news so far, says analysts at French BNP Paribas: We learned last week that Italy, Europe\u2019s third largest economy, has fallen back into recession with GDP dropping by 0.2% during the second quarter With Germany also shrinking, and France stagnating, there are worries that the wider eurozone growth figure (10am BST) could be a disappointment too. The interest rate, or yield, on German debt has hit a new record low this morning after this morning\u2019s disappointing (no)growth figures. The yield on 10-year bunds slumped to just 1.022% -- the lowest rate of return on record. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, blames Germany\u2019s shrinking economy on its domestic market and its eurozone neighbours, rather than geopolitics. He says: Contrary to a common belief, the stagnation is not so much the result of crisis in the Ukraine and European sanctions on Russia but it\u2019s rather homemade. Or better: homemade and Eurozone-made. The reversal of the mild-weather-effect on the construction sector, an unusual amount of holidays in May combined with ongoing problems in France and Italy should have been the main drivers of the slowdown of the German economy. He doesn\u2019t believe Germany is losing its position as the euro powerhouse, though: As long as the second and third largest Eurozone economies (France and Italy) are struggling to accelerate their reform pace, the German economy will remain the Eurozone\u2019s main growth engine. More here: The end of the Wirtschaftswunder? A reminder of how Germany\u2019s economy had performed over the last two years. Germany\u2019s Federal Statistics Office says the 0.2% contraction is mainly due to a disappointing performance on foreign trade and investment. Especially in the construction sector (which may be slowing down after benefitting from a mild winter). The shock contraction in Germany is certain to fuel concerns that Europe\u2019s recovery is coming off the rails. Is Germany finally feeling the impact of the wider problems in the eurozone, having outperformed its neighbours last year? The really worrying thing is that this data covers April-June, before recent sanctions against Russia \u2013 a major trade partner for Germany \u2013 would have bitten (A survey on Tuesday showed that economic confidence in Germany tumbled in July as the Ukraine crisis escalated) Breaking: The German economy has contracted, in a serious blow to the eurozone economy. German GDP fell by 0.2% in the last quarter, the first drop since 2012. That\u2019s worse than expected -- many economists had predicted that Germany would have stagnated. And in another hit, growth in the first quarter of 2014 has also been revised down, from 0.8% to 0.7%. Details to follow... It\u2019s official -- France expects to miss its growth targets, and its deficit targets, this year. France\u2019s finance minister Michel Sapin made the admission in an opinion piece in the Le Monde newspaper this morning. He writes: \u201cThe truth is that, as a direct consequence of sluggish growth and insufficient inflation, France will not meet its public deficit target this year despite a complete control of spending,\u201d Sapin, of course, would already have known that France\u2019s economy had not expanded in the last quarter. On Bloomberg TV, UBS currency strategist Beat Siegenthaler says he\u2019s not surprised that the French economy has failed to grow again, given its well-documented weakness. He\u2019s more concerned about how Germany performed, given its close links to Russia. We get the German GDP figure in a few minutes.... So why has France stagnated again? Today\u2019s GDP report shows that companies slashed their investment again, with \u201cgross fixed capital formation\u201d shrinking by 1.1% between April and June. French companies also struggled, with exports unchanged. Imports also fell back to +0.4%, from 0.6% in Q1. \u201cConsequently, the foreign trade balance contributed negatively to activity,\u201d INSEE says. Household consumption did increase, though, by 0.5%. The full report is here. Breaking News: France\u2019s economy failed to expand in the last quarter. INSEE, the statistics body, has reported that French GDP was unchanged in the three months between April and June. That\u2019s a nasty shock - economists had expected a small expansion. It\u2019s the second quarter of stagnation in a row -- as Europe\u2019s second largest economy struggles to grow. It\u2019s a bad start to Eurozone GDP Day -- with Germany\u2019s GDP reading due in under 20 minutes.... Good morning. We\u2019re about to find out how well the eurozone economy performed in the last quarter, and it may not be pretty. Today\u2019s the day when the first estimates of GDP across the single currency for April-June are released. Results Day for eurozone politicians and policymakers, perhaps. And the results could be rather unimpressive, reigniting fears over the health of the euro area. Economists believe that Germany, the powerhouse of the region, has faltered after a strong start to 2014. It could even have contracted. And France is unlikely to have dragged itself out of its economic malaise -- with growth of just 0.1% expected. The overall eurozone may also have grown by as little as 0.1% too, following the rather limp 0.2% expansion in the first quarter. Not enough to propel Europe forwards. As Claus Vistesen, chief euro zone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, put it to CNBC: \u201cGrowth in the euro area is perilously low, and vulnerable to even slight setbacks in sentiment. At the current rate, growth is far too low and uncertain to make a meaningful difference to a still high unemployment rate and too high debt levels.\u201d We get France\u2019s GDP figure first, followed by Germany at 7am BST. Then a flood of other countries at regular intervals until 10am, when the overall eurozone growth figure is released. I\u2019ll be tracking all the details, reaction and analysis, though the morning.",

My husband often does not know what is in our bank account, flies off on work, spends a large amount of money on dinner and drinks, and then leaves me scrimping on grocery bills. </p> <p>Does that make me a bully if I check our balance and warn him if his spending is going over the budget? You know, we also have rent and food to pay for, and only one bank account between us, of which I am the larger earner. My husband should feel ashamed if he blows our budget on expensive meals or jeans. Just as I should feel ashamed if I go out on a shopping spree that prevents us from buying food.

Instead, quite a number of you insisted that keeping track of your partner\u2019s expenses was simply budgeting and being financially responsible. It\u2019s not bullying, it\u2019s vigilance Adam: \u201cHaving disagreements about spending in a relationship is hardly bullying, it is natural and unavoidable and has happened since the dawn of money.\u201d Rebecca: \u201cI thought it was called teaching financial responsibility.\u201d Sean: \u201cFamilies should work together to maintain a budget, often one spouse is more reckless than the other, that\u2019s not bullying, that\u2019s being responsible.\u201d Sarah: \u201cFinancial bullying?! Sharing a life together and a bank account means both parties get to be involved in spending decisions.\u201d Nicole: \u201cMy husband knows how much money I spend. From a certain amount, I always ask him, if he\u2019s OK with it. I won\u2019t call it \u2018financial bullying\u2019, I call it \u2018living together\u2019.

The company said only in its statement that it was confident of raising \u00a33bn in funding for the combined group, \"assuming the retention of Parsons Brinckerhoff\".</p> <p>The statement came as Carillion posted a 5% rise in pre-tax profits for the first half to \u00a367.5m. Revenues slipped 5% to \u00a31.9bn as the company continued the process it began in 2010 to reduce the size of its UK construction business.</p> <p>Carillion trumpeted the fact it won \u00a33.2bn of new orders and probable orders in the first half.

      "bodyText": "Construction company Carillion has renewed its attempts to woo Balfour Beatty shareholders by dangling the prospect of an additional 8.5p dividend, if they agree to a merger. Balfour Beatty, the UK's largest construction company, said the proposed \u00a33bn merger deal was still too risky, as Carillion's plans to shrink its UK construction business would incur significant costs but not necessarily generate any value for the combined group. Carillion said it \"continues to believe in the powerful strategic logic and financial benefits of a merger and is therefore continuing to consider its position\". It proposed an additional cash dividend (or equivalent) of 8.5p per Balfour Beatty share, worth a total of \u00a359m. \"This would be in addition to the final 2014 dividend they would be entitled to receive as shareholders in the enlarged group,\" it said. Carillion insisted this was not an offer and said \"there can be no certainty that any transaction will proceed\". It reserved the right to vary the mix of cash and shares offered. The company now has a week to modify its approach before a put-up or shut-up deadline of 5pm next Thursday.it reported that pre-tax profits for the first six months of the year had more than halved to \u00a322m. Anthony Codling at said Parsons Brinckerhoff was \"the jewel in the crown\", as the consulting trade is seen as a more reliable source of income, compared with the more volatile construction business. Carillion chief executive Richard Howson would not be drawn on whether he was willing to budge on this point. The company said only in its statement that it was confident of raising \u00a33bn in funding for the combined group, \"assuming the retention of Parsons Brinckerhoff\". The statement came as Carillion posted a 5% rise in pre-tax profits for the first half to \u00a367.5m. Revenues slipped 5% to \u00a31.9bn as the company continued the process it began in 2010 to reduce the size of its UK construction business. Carillion trumpeted the fact it won \u00a33.2bn of new orders and probable orders in the first half. Howson said the economic climate was \"a lot better\" than it has been for the past two years. \"There are more opportunities in quite a number of sectors across the UK, particularly in infrastructure, rail and highways; there's investment in quite a number of airports, which we see opportunities in. All the signs, in terms of an improved economic climate, are there,\" Howson said.",

Last month, the unemployment rate reached 6.1% (trend), meaning it had risen one percentage point since May 2012. While the unemployment rate rising one percentage point is not an unknown phenomenon, what is unusual is the time it has taken. Since the ABS began recording monthly labour force figures in February 1978, there have been five periods when the trend unemployment rate has risen at least one percentage point before falling: the 1981-82 recession, the 1991 recession, the Asian financial crisis of 2000, the GFC, and the current period.

And so we have this situation where employment continues to deteriorate, but not in such a way that would have politicians suggesting anything needs to be done.

If, for example, the participation rate had stayed the same as it was 25 months ago, the unemployment rate would not have risen 1 percentage point, it would have risen 1.7 percentage points and would now be 6.8%: You always need to be a bit careful suggesting what the unemployment rate would be if participation was a certain number as it involves using an arbitrary point in time to set it at, and it also forgets that participation generally does rise and fall with employment growth.
