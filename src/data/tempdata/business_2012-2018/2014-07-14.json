      "bodyText": "A blockbuster \u00a331bn takeover of the London-listed drug company Shire by US rival AbbVie came a step closer on Monday, after Shire's board announced it would back the deal despite concerns over its controversial tax structure. AbbVie has indicated that shifting its tax domicile from the US to the UK is a key part of the logic behind the proposed takeover. The drive to escape a punitive US tax regime, echoing proposals by American peer Pfizer during its failed \u00a369bn attempt to acquire Britain's AstraZeneca earlier this year, had alarmed the Shire board when it rebuffed an AbbVie approach last month. However, those concerns appeared to have abated on Monday when Shire said it would recommend a proposal \u2013 the fifth that AbbVie has made \u2013 that valued the rare-diseases specialist at \u00a353.20 a share. Shire said: \"The board of Shire has indicated to AbbVie that it would be willing to recommend an offer at the level of the revised proposal to Shire shareholders subject to satisfactory resolution of the other terms of the offer.\" Shire, best known for drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and rare diseases, is an attractive target for AbbVie, which is looking to diversify its product range as well as reduce its tax bill. AbbVie's Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug accounts for 60% of sales but loses patent protection at the end of 2016. If the takeover goes ahead, Illinois-based AbbVie would move its legal address to the UK, cutting its effective corporate tax rate from 22% to 13% by 2016. Analysts at Barclays estimated the move would provide an estimated $1.3bn (\u00a3760m) in tax savings by 2020. In a statement last month, the Shire board said AbbVie's tax proposals were risky, amid mounting political opposition in the US to so-called corporate inversions, where companies move their head office abroad to make tax savings. The board said it \"had concerns regarding the execution risks associated with the proposed [tax] inversion structure, as AbbVie would redomicile in the UK for tax purposes\". Shire's opposition has weakened amid pressure from shareholders, who have called for talks. One analyst said Shire was one of the few outstanding targets for US firms seeking an inversion deal in the wake of the failed Pfizer pursuit. Alistair Campbell, at banking group Berenberg, said there were few other British drugmakers that would suit a tax inversion takeover because shareholders in the target company must own at least 20% of the merged group after the deal is completed. Under the terms of the AbbVie proposal, Shire shareholders would own 25% of the combined firms. \"You can't go for small companies,\" he said. \"Glaxo is too big, Astra has had an approach from Pfizer and Shire has now gone.\" Hull-based Smith &amp; Nephew, Europe's largest maker of artificial joints, has also been seen as a possible target. But US-based rival Stryker has said it would not bid for the company after reports linking it with a deal circulated in May. Elsewhere, Sweden's Meda rejected an improved takeover offer from US generic drugmaker Mylan in April, which could have helped reduce taxes. A takeover of Shire is unlikely to incite the political and public furore that erupted over Pfizer's courtship of AstraZeneca. Shire was founded in the UK, but is managed in Boston, headquartered in Dublin and generates most of its sales in the US. It employs fewer than 500 people in the UK \u2013 out of a 5,000-strong workforce \u2013 and has a small research and development staff in Britain. AstraZeneca, has 2,000 R&amp;D employees in the UK alone and Pfizer's pledge to secure R&amp;D jobs in the wake of a takeover was not enough to quell political opposition to its proposals. The AstraZeneca row prompted ministers to draw up proposals that would see foreign companies hit with penalties if they broke promises over jobs and investment once they had taken over a UK business. Cable said: \"There will be cases where there are vital national interests, in this case large-scale investment of R&amp;D. The question is how you protect it. What the government did then [during Pfizer 's proposed takeover] was to engage in negotiations to seek assurances. Where we now have to strengthen that is to make sure that with any commitments made there is no wriggle room.\" Shares in Shire closed up 0.7% at \u00a349.03.",

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that average incomes for people in their 20s fell by 13% between 2007/08 and 2012/13, compared with an average fall for all workers of 10%, and only 7% for 31- to 59-year-olds.

The IFS examined the DWP's Households Average Income study in tandem with the Office for National Statistics' labour force survey to arrive at the new figures. It found that young workers able to get on the housing ladder were cushioned by ultra low interest rates. A quarter forced to live at home with heir parents also had higher than average disposable incomes, though the need for parental subsidies is likely an indication of the low pay rates and often insecure working practices on offer to younger workers. Poor children have also suffered since the financial crash and through the recession that followed. The IFS said the official measure of child deprivation rose by 300,000 children in 2012\u201313, and has generally been on an upwards trajectory since 2007\u201308. Child deprivation is highest in London, which also has the highest rate of income poverty, once its higher housing costs are taken into account.",

The ECB president did warn that Europe's recovery could suffer if the euro strengthened. And he declared that quantitative easing was squarely in the middle of the ECB's mandate -- hours after the IMF urged him to consider it. And the oddest moment came when Draghi insisted he plans to stay at the ECB. Apparently there's a rumour in the German media that he was considering leaving: G'nite. GW Time for a quick catch-up: The International Monetary Fund has renewed its call for the eurozone to embark on quantitative easing, warning that the recovery is too fragile. IMF staff also argued that a new asset-purchase scheme would drive up growth and inflation. But they also suggested that it could potentially cause the euro to strengthen again other currencies \u2013 not what Europe needs... The warning came hours after fresh data showed industrial production in the eurozone slid by 1.1% during May. That suggests the sector may shrink in the last quarter \u2013 which would suggest the recovery is faltering, analysts warned. In the corporate world, US firm AbbVie made another attempt to take over UK drugs firm Shire, after increasing its offer again, to \u00a331.3bn. Analysts believe it's a fair price. But shares in Shire closed up 0.6% at \u00a349.03, shy of the new offer of \u00a353.20 per share, showing that it's not a done deal yet.... And Citigroup agreed a $7bn settlement to close an investigation into its mortgage-securities business before the financial crash, which wiped out its profits for the last quarter. The US Attorney General warned that the deal does not indemnify Citi employees from possible legal action in future. Europe's stock markets bounced back from last week's losses, with the FTSE 100 rising 0.8%. Here's Nick Fletcher's closing market report: FTSE 100 buoyed by Shire deal and Citigroup figures Portugal's Espirito Santo conglomerate remains under pressure tonight - shares in Bancl Espirito Santo fell another 8%, and the yield on one set of bonds rose to around 10%. In the UK, the new chairman of Wonga has vowed to clean up its image. The elderly puppets used in its TV adverts are the first to go.... And the Farnborough Air Show has begun, with Russia's delegation being frozen out over the Ukraine crisis.... ...and the prime minister announcing \u00a31.1bn of new defence orders, before having a peek inside the cockpit of an Airbus A35: Reminder, Mario Draghi is appearing at the European Parliament tonight, from 6.30pm BST (7.30pm CET). It might be webcast here(if I find a better link I\"ll post it in the blog). And I might update the blog once Draghi has spoken..... #promisespromises Otherwise, back tomorrow.... Goodnight. GW Britain's blue-chip stock index has posted its biggest one day gain since the start of July. The FTSE 100 closed up 55 points, or +0.85%, at 6746, as City traders shrugged off last week's worries about a crash. The German DAX rose 1.2%, and the French CAC gained 0.8%. Chris Beauchamp, Market analyst at IG, says Citigroup's good results (excluding that $7bn hit) helped shares bounce back: And so another stock market dip appears to have been consigned to the dustbin of history. On Bastille Day traders across the globe have displayed a little of the ardour that so animated those that stormed the infamous prison, while banishing any thoughts of beleaguered Portuguese banks to the back of their mind. Shire\u2019s coy dalliance with AbbVie has resulted in the UK firm agreeing to a takeover, and it seems that all concerned are quite contented with the outcome. And that's all the excuse I need to post a few photos from Paris: Pressure continues to build on Portugal's Espirito Santo conglomerate. Tomorrow, we'll find out whether one of its divisions will repay a \u20ac897m loan made three months ago by Portugal Telecom. That transaction has already hurt relations between PT and its Brazilian partners, who didn't know about it. Theres also suggestions that PT did know that Espirito Santo was in difficulties, but made the loan anyway. More here. And its bank, Banco Espirito Santo, has now seen its share price fall almost 8% today. Its bonds have also fallen in value, driving up the yield on notes that mature in 2023 to almost 10% this afternoon. That suggests bond traders are more worried that it might restructure its debts, despite its new management team being rushed in. Incidentally, the IMF report comes just hours before Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, appears before the European parliament to answer MEP's questions. Draghi has shown irritation before at the Fund's habit of offering advice to the ECB, so tonight's hearing could be quite punchy...... Eurozone is weak and risks falling into deflation, IMF report warns The International Monetary Fund has also warned that the euro could actually rise in value if the European Central Bank launched a quantitative easing programme to fight deflation. Two senior IMF staffers, Reza Moghadam and Ranjit Teja, have examined whether the European Central Bank should move into QE, and start buying assets with new money. Their blogpost is here. In it, they suggest QE would stimulate the eurozone's growth rate, saying: QE is not a panacea or substitute for reforms. But it can push up inflation by raising consumption and investment across the euro area. QE, they note, is the last weapon in the ECB's monetary toolkit: QE could improve the supply of bank credit, they suggest (by pushing the value of assets on bank balance sheets), and also increase demand for credit (by raising growth expectations). Moghadam and Teji see little immediate risk from encouraging more risk taking; anyway, banks have macro-prudential powers if needed. QE could push down eurozone government bond yields, they suggest (as happened in Japan). And it could make households feel wealthier, by pushing European shares up - having lagged behind Wall Street since the crisis. But what would it mean for the euro, which is already uncomfortably high? It would probably push down its value, the IMF says. But it might have the opposite effect.... Moghadam and Teji write: On the currency, QE would likely weaken the euro. Insofar as this raises demand and traded goods prices, it helps tackle the threat from low inflation. This could be an important channel. But depreciation is not inevitable: rising asset prices/economic prospects due to QE may draw capital and appreciate the euro. And that would not help the ECB stimulate inflation, as imports would become cheaper..... The IMF statement is online here. These quotes from the IMF's report into the eurozone sums up the situation: \u201cThe recovery is weak and uneven. Inflation has been too low for too long, financial markets are still fragmented, and structural gaps persist: these hinder rebalancing and substantial reductions in debt and unemployment.\u201d \u201cWeakness in banks\u2019 balance sheets and uncertainty about their quality are contributing to fragmentation, constraining the ability and willingness of banks to support credit and investment.\u201d \u201cRisks to growth are still tilted to the downside. With limited policy space in the near term, further negative shocks \u2013 either domestic or external \u2013 could undermine financial market sentiment, halt the recovery, and push the economy into lower inflation and even deflation.\u201d The IMF is also warning that the eurozone isn't in a good state to shrug off any further shocks, and urged politicians to resist further austerity: 15:00 - IMF SAYS FURTHER NEGATIVE SHOCKS COULD SOUR MARKET SENTIMENT, HALT RECOVERY, BRING DEFLATION TO EURO ZONE 15:00 - IMF SAYS ANY NEGATIVE GROWTH SHOCKS IN EURO ZONE SHOULD NOT TRIGGER ADDITIONAL AUSTERITY 15:00 - IMF SAYS EURO ZONE NEEDS TO SUPPORT DEMAND, COMPLETE BANKING UNION, ADVANCE STRUCTURAL REFORMS Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the recovery in the eurozone is weak and risks falling into deflation, and cut its growth forecast for this year. My colleague Katie Allen has the details of the IMF's latest mission to the eurozone: The International Monetary Fund has just released its latest report into the state of the eurozone and it will make daunting reading for policymakers in the single currency bloc. The Washington-based fund is calling for a raft of actions to shore up the eurozone as it highlights a recovery that is \u201cneither robust nor sufficiently strong\u201d and says the \u201ceuro-skeptic\u201d outcome of recent European election outcome poses an additional threat to the single market. And here are the IMF's key points: The eurozone recovery is weak, its financial markets remain too fragmented and the region risks falling into deflation. Urgent action is needed to repair bank balance sheets and to step up reforms to boost employment. Moves on low inflation from the European Central Bank are welcome but the ECB should be ready to embark on quantitative easing should inflation stay \u201ctoo low\u201d. The IMF predicts a long haul ahead. Growth was expected to accelerate only a little next year, to 1.5% from 1.1% in 2014 \u2013 a slight downgrade from April\u2019s prediction of 1.2% growth this year. That outlook compares with the IMF\u2019s forecast for the UK economy to grow 2.9% this year and for the US to expand 2%. Inflation in the eurozone was seen remaining below the ECB\u2019s target of around 2%. The IMF predicts inflation of 0.7% this year and 1.2% in 2015. More details and reaction to follow.... Goldman Sachs shares are pushing the Dow up, as traders react to Citigroup's results (rather than its ropey World Cup predictions) DING: The Dow just hit a new all-time intraday high: Over in New York, shares are rallying in early trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 135 points, or 0.8%, to 17079, mirroring today's gains in Europe, where the FTSE 100 is up 67 points, or 1%. Citigroup's results appear to have cheered Wall Street. Profits would have been up, if the bank hadn't agreed a $7bn settlement to resolve the investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities. City analysts who dared to predict how the World Cup would play out are feeling a little embarrassed today. Goldman Sachs, for example, boldly predicted Brazil would lift the trophy -- and even after rejigging its forecasts for the knock-out section it reckoned the Netherlands would finish runners-up. But fair play to Goldman -- they've 'fessed up on Twitter: I'm sure the German team appreciate the gesture - once they've finished posting selfies with chancellor Merkel, that is.... Here's another photo from the Farnborough Air Show, of prime minister David Cameron meeting staff from UK firm Avingtrans. Cameron also announced \u00a31.1bn of fresh defence spending, including \u00a3300m for better radars for Britain's Typhoon fighters, and \u00a3800m in new intelligence kit (as previewed this morning) The Cold War may be over, but Russian delegates at the Farnborough International Air Show were still given the cold shoulder today. In a rare move, the British government decided not to issue Russia's delegation with invitations this year, following events in Ukraine and Crimea: A government spokesperson explained; \"The government has also taken clear action to remove Russia from the list of countries eligible to use open general export licences, in order to discourage Russian attendance at [the show] ... No foreign government representatives attending [Farnborough] as guests of [the UK government] will be escorted around the Russian pavilion by officials.\" This prompted Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin ordered the country's delegation to pull out . He tweeted: More here: Russia withdraws delegates from Farnborough air show But as these photos show, Russian ministers have managed to meet some journalists at a chalet run by state-owned firm Rostec. Despite the diplomatic tensions, Russian arms companies are still demonstrating at the show. That includes Rosoboronexport, the Russian state-owned arms firm that supplied attack helicopters and grenade launchers to the Syrian regime. David Cameron under fire as Syrian regime arms supplier visits UK airshow Traders in New York reckon that AbbVie's shares will fall around 1.8% when trading begins in one hour, after it upped its offer for UK drugs firm Shire to \u00a331.30bn this morning. Shire's shares are still up in London, gaining around 1.5% to \u00a349.42. That's around 3% below AbbVie's new offer, of \u00a351.30 per share, showing some doubt that the deal will go through. As explained this morning - Shire's board is now indicating that it could support the deal, but the 'tax-inversion' plan could be scuppered by politicians in Washington. Citi shares are rising in pre-market trading as Wall Street traders digest its results: Citigroup is releasing its latest earnings report right now.... And the top line is that the bank achieved earnings of $1.24 per share in the last quarter. That's ahead of forecasts (analysts had expected $1.05 per share) But that falls to just $0.03 per share once the $7bn cost of settling its mortgage-securities probe is included. Citi is also reporting that total revenues declined to $19.34bn in the quarter, down from $20.49bn a year ago. Back in the UK, energy producer Drax is celebrating a win at the high court. Judges overturned the British government's recent decision not to include one of Drax's units at its Yorkshire coal plant in a biomass subsidy scheme. Shares in Drax jumped 5% following the news, which should help the company convert the polluting plant from burning coal to wood pellets. It appears that Citi employees could still face legal action, even though the bank has just settled its account with US authorities. Reuter has snapped a statement from the US Attorney General: US ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS DOJ ANNOUNCES CIVIL RESOLUTION WITH CITIGROUP TOTALING $7 BLN IN FINES, INCLUDING A CIVIL PENALTY OF $4 BLN U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS SETTLEMENT WITH CITIGROUP RELATED TO SALE OF SECURITIES THAT WERE BACKED BY TOXIC LOANS US ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS CITI TRIED TO HID THE DEFECTS OF THE INCREASINGLY RISKY LOANS THEY WERE SECURITIZING US ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS SETTLEMENT DOES NOT ABSOLVE CITIGROUP OR ITS EMPLOYEES FROM FACING ANY POSSIBLE CRIMINAL CHARGES IN THE FUTURE US ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS \"UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS SETTLEMENT, THE BANK HAS ADMITTED TO ITS MISDEEDS IN GREAT DETAIL\" Michael Corbat, Citigroup's CEO, says the \"comprehensive\" $7bn settlement means Citi has resolved all the civil investigations related to its mortgage-backed securities business before the crash. Corbat is now looking forwards: We believe that this settlement is in the best interests of our shareholders, and allows us to move forward and to focus on the future, not the past.\u201d Just in: US bank Citi has agreed to a $7bn package of fines and compensation to resolve a probe into its mortgage-backed securities business. The settlement relates to allegations that Citi misled investors by selling securities linked to toxic loans in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The bank will pay $4.5bn fines, and provide $2.5bn in \"consumer relief\" to settle the charges. City said it will take a $3.8bn pre-tax charge to help cover the penalty. More to follow... Andy Haste's arrival at Wonga comes as another payday lender, called Dollar, is forced to return \u00a3700,000 to its customers. The City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, said that Dollar, which traded as The Money Shop, had not carried out proper checks to ensure that its borrowers could repay their loans. It must now contact customers to arrange refunds, or to cut their outstanding balances. Sounds like Andy Haste has got off to a good start at Wonga: The new chairman of Wonga has hit the ground running, pledging to consign its frankly unsettling puppets to the bin: More here: Cuddly puppets axed as Wonga attempts big clean-up Cuddly??!! Wonga has just named a new chairman -- experienced City figure Andy Haste. And Haste, the former boss of insurance group RSA, has declared that his priority is to turn the controversial payday lender into a smaller and less profitable business, at least in the short term. Haste's appointment fills a void at Wonga following the departure of founder Errol Damelin. The payday loans industry has been rocked by political criticism and increased regulatory scrutiny in recent months, and Haste warned that changes must be made at Wonga to repair its reputation. He says: This is a sector that is necessarily undergoing significant change and Wonga will change with it in order to have a sustainable future. My challenge is to lead that process of change at Wonga to ensure that the business operates responsibly while providing an effective and reliable service for our customers Haste added... We will become a more customer focused, and inevitably in the near term, a smaller and less profitable business. However, we are determined to make the necessary changes and serve our customers in the right way, to repair our reputation and become a business with a long-term future and an accepted place in the financial services industry.\u201d Wonga's shareholders say Haste was \"the outstanding choice\", and he does bring some City gravitas to the lender. He is currently the senior independent director of ITV plc and the senior independent deputy chairman of Lloyd\u2019s. He's going to be busy..... And here's Reuters' take on this morning's industrial output figures (details start here): Eurozone industrial production dropped sharply in May with the energy sector the only one to thrive, data showed on Monday, highlighting the fragile state of the bloc's recovery. Output in the 18 countries sharing the euro dropped 1.1% on the month in May, following a 0.7% rise in April, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected a 1.2% monthly fall in May. Compared with the same period in 2013, factory gate output grew in line with market expectations by 0.5% after a 1.4% rise in April. The month-on-month decline was led by a 2.4% fall in production of intermediate goods - such as parts used for cars. There was a 2.2% drop in the production of non-durable items such as food or cosmetics.The energy sector was the only one to grow, showing a 3% increase after a 1.2% growth in April. Industrial production in the euro zone's three biggest economies - Germany, France and Italy - fell month-on-month. Germany saw the biggest drop since May 2013 with a 1.4% fall.France, with a 1.3% decline, recorded the steepest fall in production since June 2013 and Italy's production registered its worst performance since November 2012 with a 1.2% drop. Germany's faltering economy has cast further doubt over the euro zone's prospects for recovery this year, with no other big country strong enough to pick up the slack. And here's a chart from Credit Suisse, predicting that the eurozone recovery may have slowed in the second quarter of 2014. (the thin line tracks various economic data, the thick line shows the actual path of GDP) That's worrying, especially as growth in the first quarter was rather unimpressive - rising by just 0.2%. Europe's manufacturing sector may actually have contracted in the April-June quarter, given the 1.1% slump in eurozone industrial output in May. So fears Howard Archer, chief economist of IHS Global Insight. He says today's data dents hopes that the eurozone recovery accelerated in the second quarter of the year. There is now a grave danger that the sector contracted in the second quarter thereby limiting Eurozone GDP growth. He adds that Eurozone manufacturing sector is facing \"a tough task to generate and sustain meaningful expansion\" adding: While May\u2019s 1.1% month-on-month drop in Eurozone industrial production likely overstates the sector\u2019s weakness, it is notable that the latest survey evidence has indicated a loss of momentum although it does still point to expanding activity. As if Portugal didn't have enough to worry about, it also suffered the biggest drop in industrial output during May -- down 3.6% month-on-month. Sweden and Denmark were close behind, helping to drag industrial output across the wider European Union down by 1.1% in May. Eurostat reports: The largest decreases in industrial production were registered in Portugal (-3.6%), Sweden (-3.2%) and Denmark (-2.1%), and the highest increases in Romania (+2.6%), Lithuania (+1.6%) and the Netherlands (+1.1%). Eurostat has also revised down its estimate for industrial production in April to +0.7% month-on-month, down from 0.8%. Fears that Europe's economy slowed down in May have been backed up by the latest Eurozone production figures, which show a sharp fall in output. Industrial output across the euro area fell by 1.1% month-on-month in May, which means output was just 0.5% higher than a year ago. Eurostat reported that the production of intermediate goods fell by 2.4%; non-durable consumer goods was down by 2.2%. Durable consumer goods production fell by 1.8% and capital goods (heavy duty machinery) dropped by 0.5%. Last week we learned that manufacturing output fell in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands during May - Eurostat's figures hammer home that it wasn't a great month for the eurozone economy. Details and reaction to follow.... Ah... Banco Espirito Santo's shares have been pushed down today because Espirito Santo Financial Group has cut its stake from 25% to 20.1%: Back to the main event of the morning, the Shire/AbbVie takeover battle. Gordon Hamilton, head of Healthcare M&amp;A at Cavendish Corporate Finance, reckons the latest offer, valuing Shire at \u00a331.3bn, should succeed. Hamilton also reckons a deal wouldn't face the political obstacles that helped to scupper Pfizer's takeover bid for AstraZeneca this year. He says: \u201cPrice seems fair, just a shame it needed five bids to get to this stage. Good outcome for both companies and it\u2019s less controversial than Pfizer\u2019s abortive bid for AstraZeneca as Shire does not have the large UK workforce and R&amp;D base.\u201d As fastFT points out, Portuguese bonds are also rallying because prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho insisted on Friday night that Portugal's taxpayers won't bail Espirito Santo out. Over in Portugal, the fears swirling around Banco Espirito Santo (BES) have eased after it announced new management are taking over shortly. Portugal's government's debt, which was hit last week, has rallied in value this morning. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Portuguese bonds has fallen to 3.8%, from 3.9% on Friday night. That shows that investors see Portugal's debt as less risky. The rally came after BES announced that it has fast-tracked the arrival of its new executive team, as representatives of the Espirito Santo team leave the board. Bank of Portugal had ordered BES to accelerate the management changes, as Reuters explains: Espirito Santo Financial Group, which holds a 25% stake in BES, has previously named respected economist Vitor Bento to be the new chief executive of the bank and Joao Moreira Rato, who heads Portugal's IGCP debt agency, to be the chief financial officer. Jose Honorio becomes deputy CEO. The three replace the Espirito Santo family members, including its patriarch Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, who had agreed to resign earlier. A shareholder meeting set for July 31 is yet to ratify the appointments, BES said. But after an early rally, shares in Banco Espirito Santo are down around 2.3% this morning. Europe's main stock markets have risen this morning, with Shire helping to pull the London stock market up by 28 points, or 0.4%. And Germany's DAX is leading the way, up 0.5% after last night's World Cup triumph. With little on the calendar today, investors are waiting to hear what Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen says when she testifies to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. And there's still speculation that stock markets will dip in the months ahead, as the Fed ends its bond-buying stimulus programme. Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart, explains: Overall, it seems as if the big players are starting to draw in their horns for a while, especially now that the Fed really seems determined to complete the taper by October. There may be insufficient grounds for major further gains but a collapse also seems unlikely, even with Europe stagnating. A correction seems the logical outcome and it should carry on over the next few weeks. Once again, I would commend personalised \u2018stress tests\u2019 of existing holdings and even more so of new purchases. Better a correction now than in a few months\u2019 time but falls of 10% or more are very possible. Here's our news story about this morning's developments: AbbVie's raised proposal for Shire gets board backing AbbVie's plans to 'invert' its tax home into the UK (details) could be a sticking point in the talks with Shire, reckons Helen Thomas of the Wall Street Journal. \"Reverse break fees\" are paid to the target company (Shire) by the predator, if a deal collapses. In this case, there is the danger that US politicians manage to block American companies from shifting their tax base abroad. A bill is currently going through Congress would prevent tax inversion unless foreign shareholders own 50% of the new company instead of the current 20%. AbbVie's proposal is that Shire shareholder would own 25% of the new company. No wonder Shire's shares are trading below the offer price..... Shire has risen to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard at the start of trading. Shares in Shire jumped by 3% to \u00a350.15, in early deals. That's still slightly below AbbVie's new offer of \u00a351.20 each, suggesting a small degree of caution that the deal will go through, even though Shire is 'willing' to recommend it. In other takeover news, Swiss chocolate firm Lindt &amp; Sprungli has agreeed a deal to buy US confectionary maker Russell Stover Candies. The deal means Lindt &amp; Sprungli, maker of those chocolate bunnies, will become the third biggest chocolate manufacturer in America. We don't actually have a price for the deal. But Ernst Tanner, Lindt &amp; Spr\u00fcngli chairman, says it's the \"biggest and most important strategic acquisition to date in Lindt &amp; Spr\u00fcngli's history\". More here. So why does AbbVie, a biopharmaceutical company based in Chicago, want to take over Shire? All pharmaceutical firms are under pressure to consolidate, given rising pressure from generic drugs providers and government spending squeezes. AbbVie is heavily reliant on its rheumatoid arthritis treatment, Humira. Buying Shire would broaden its product base (Shire's biggest selling drug, Vyvanse, is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). But that's only part of the story... AbbVie also wants to move its tax base out of the US to the UK, to benefit from the lower corporation tax rate. This 'tax inversion' is causing ructions in Washington, where a group of senators has proposed a bill to prevent American firms from dodging the US taxman. AbbVie's new takeover offer is 9% higher than Shire's closing price last Friday night, of \u00a348.98. This \u00a353.20/share bid is actually the fifth proposal from AbbVie - it began by offering \u00a346.11/share in June. Shire's management had rejected all previous offers, forcing AbbVie to keep upping its offer. Some breaking news: Shire, the UK pharmaceuticals firm, has moved closer to being taken over by US rival AbbVie. Shire has just told the City that it sought, and received, a new proposal from AbbVie over the weekend, having rejected several previous bids in recent weeks. AbbVie is now prepared to pay \u00a353.20 per share for Shire (in cash and shares) valuing the company at \u00a331.3bn, I reckon. And that's enough to get Shire to the negotiating table. It told shareholders that: The Board of Shire has indicated to AbbVie that it would be willing to recommend an offer at the level of the Revised Proposal to Shire shareholders subject to satisfactory resolution of the other terms of the offer. Accordingly, the Board is in detailed discussions with AbbVie in relation to these terms. Some Shire investors have been pushing the company to engage with AbbVie in recent days. So while this isn't a done deal yet, it looks like Shire could soon become the latest UK firm to be taken over. Details and reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. It looks like a quiet start to the week -- European stock markets are expected to inch up when trading begins, after last week's losses. Investors will still be watching events in Portugal closely, with Banco Espirito Santo under pressure to install new management quickly after fears over its financial state rocked the markets. Banco Espirito Santo told to accelerate management changes after bank's health warning rocks markets We'll get a new clue as to whether the eurozone economy slowed down this string, with the latest eurozone industrial production data for May (due at 10am BST). The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa will be gathering in Brazil for the BRICS summit, which formally kicks off tomorrow. I'll be tracking all the main developments through the day.....",

As the vote on independence approaches, a report shows that a notional index of 100 Scottish companies currently listed on the London Stock Exchange would have grown by 5.7% in real terms (with dividends reinvested) since 1955. But it would have been outperformed by stocks from the rest of the UK, which rose 6.8% over the same period. The difference is due to the predominance of financial companies in the \"Scotsie 100\", and in particular the near collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS in the banking crisis. Without this, it would have outperformed the UK index by a small margin. The report, by the London Business School and consultancy Walbrook Economics, uses the location of a company's headquarters to judge whether it is Scottish or not. Apart from financial companies such as banks and investment trusts, the Scotsie index is dominated by utilities, and oil and gas companies. The largest are energy business SSE, insurer Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, FTSE100 engineer Weir Group and Aggreko, the generator manufacturer. The research was driven by the question of whether Scotland should set up its own stock exchange \u2013 something which existed until 1973 \u2013 as other countries have done after gaining independence. If all Scotsie 100 stocks chose to list on a new Scottish bourse, it would rank 28th in the world. This, says the report, is the same as the Scottish football team's post-World Cup Fifa ranking. But the report concludes: \"It will be a tough challenge to attract the Scotsie 100 companies away from the large liquid international London exchange on which they are already listed along with their FTSE imprimatur. It would make more sense for Scotland to continue to rely for its stock market services on the LSE and AIM.\" Paul Marsh, of London Business School, said there was uncertainty over the terms of separating from the UK in the event of a yes vote in the 18 September referendum. But he added: \"We believe that investors in Scotsie 100 stocks should not be unduly concerned, nor should they be making contingency plans to rebalance their portfolios. \"To some extent, they are protected by the fact that both companies and individuals can re-domicile if necessary. There would also be a period of at least 18 months during which the terms of separation are negotiated. They can afford to wait and see.\"",

The impact on operations is often minimal, with manufacturing activities and the markets in which it operates remaining unchanged.

    "webTitle": "Russia withdraws delegates from Farnborough air show", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Russia's deputy prime minister has told his country's defence delegates to withdraw from the Farnborough International Airshow and return home after being snubbed by the British government over the Ukraine conflict. The diplomatic incident came at the opening of the aerospace and defence industry's major sales fair in Hampshire and followed the UK government's efforts to actively discourage Russian attendance at the show. This year's event is marked by high-profile visits from cabinet members including David Cameron who attended the opening day yesterday. In a post on his twitter feed, Dmitry Rogozin, who heads Russia's defence sector as deputy prime minister, said: \"I recommend our delegation to wind up its participation in the show and return home.\" The UK government traditionally invites representatives from selected foreign governments to attend Farnborough as its guests, but this year said: \"Due to Russian actions in Ukraine, no representatives from the Russian government have been issued [government] invitations to Farnborough.\" It added: \"The government has also taken clear action to remove Russia from the list of countries eligible to use open general export licences, in order to discourage Russian attendance at [the show] \u2026 no foreign government representatives attending [Farnborough] as guests of [the government] will be escorted around the Russian pavilion by officials.\" At Farnborough, however, representatives of the Russian state-owned arms firm Rosoboronexport appeared to be ignoring Rogozin's outburst and the hostility of the British government. One Rosoboronexport representative, who did not want to be named, said: \"We saw [the Rogozin tweet]. We have not had an order [to leave] so we stay.\" He added that the show had been as busy \"as normal\" for the company. While Russian government officials may have struggled to enter the show, its state-owned defence companies have not been barred from exhibiting at the privately owned event and were out in force. They ranged from Rosoboronexport, which supplied attack helicopters and grenade launchers to Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, to the United Aircraft Corporation, which makes the MiG fighter jet, and Sputnik Insurance Centre, which says it is \"one of the leading Russian insurers of rocket and space equipment\". British officials are not taking their guests to meet Russian companies, although that did not appear to have cut off meetings between Russian representatives and other governments. The Guardian witnessed a four-strong delegation dressed in South African armed forces uniforms being escorted to the Rosoboronexport chalet on Farnborough airfield. According to the Rosoboronexport website, the company is \"the exclusive state intermediary, entitled to supply the world market with the whole range of permitted arms exports and military equipment made by the enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia\". Rosoboronexport has provided the Syrian government with the bulk of the tanks, fighters, missiles and helicopters used in a civil war that has claimed more than 170,000 lives, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Russians at the show complain that the UK declined visa requests for government officials and delegates from commercial companies, meaning they are not only barred from the airfield but also cannot enter the country and attend the side meetings that take place during the evenings at surrounding hotels. A Home Office spokesman would not say whether the UK government had declined visa requests from Russian delegates. He said: \"Every visa application is considered in line with the immigration rules and on its individual merits.\" A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: \"Farnborough International Airshow is a commercial event run by Farnborough International Ltd. The government plays no part in determining which companies are invited to exhibit. It is a commercial matter for the organisers to whom they sell exhibition space\". On Monday, Cameron announced that Britain will invest \u00a31.1bn in defence equipment such as surveillance aircraft, to enable it to better respond to threats including terrorism and cyber attacks. Britain has cut defence spending by about 8% over the last four years. However, the new investment, which is being funded from savings made by the Ministry of Defence, includes \u00a3800m for intelligence and surveillance equipment. The UK government action does not affect Russian businesses exhibiting at the show. This year a Russian state-owned arms firm, which supplied attack helicopters and grenade launchers to the Syrian regime, is exhibiting fighter jets. The Farnborough show is a major biennial event in the aerospace industry, in which official defence delegations study the latest military hardware and huge companies compete for sales. Each year the airline groups Boeing and Airbus compete not just for new orders but also for which company can make the most noteworthy announcements. Airbus landed the first blow in that traditional battle on Monday with the launch of its eagerly awaited, fuel-efficient upgrade to its long-haul A330 passenger jet, the A330neo. The plane, which is viewed as a direct competitor to Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and is powered by British Rolls-Royce engines, cuts fuel consumption by 14% per seat, according to Airbus. Deliveries of the revamped aircraft start in late 2017. The Airbus Group chief executive, Tom Enders, vowed to \"keep the A330 flying high for many more years to come\". Airbus has sold about 1,300 A330s since its launch in 1993, of which the vast majority are still in service. Airbus estimates that the A330neo could sell more than 1,000 units. In the absence of new technologies or revolutionary materials \u2013 such as lightweight carbon composites used in the new fuel-efficient planes \u2013 the launch of a brand new passenger jet is not envisaged for a further five to seven years. This has forced Airbus and Boeing to modernise current models, such as the US group's 777X, a new version of its jumbo jet that seats between 350 and 450 passengers. Airbus and Boeing are also revamping their medium-haul A320 and 737 planes, respectively. Airbus also announced that International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, had converted 20 A320neo options into a firm order, for delivery in 2018 and 2019. IAG indicated that it had received a substantial discount on each plane's list price of about $103m (\u00a360m).",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The controversial cuddly puppets used in advertising by payday lender Wonga are being axed a part of a clean-up operation by its newly appointed chairman to improve the firm's reputation. Andy Haste, a former executive of blue-chip insurance companies, started his \u00a3500,000-a-year job as Wonga chairman on Monday with a blunt message that the company needed to change. \"Wonga has understandably faced criticism and we know we need to repair our reputation and regain our right to be an accepted part of the financial service sector,\" he said. As well as eye-watering interest rates that can be equivalent to an annual 5,853%, Wonga has been accused of using cute puppets and catchy tunes in adverts aired during primetime children's TV. \"The puppets are going and I think that is right,\" said Haste. \"I am very aware of the criticism there has been of our advertising and marketing, which is one of my priorities to review.\" Insisting it was \"not just about the puppets\", he said: \"We will be reviewing how we go to market across the piste, not just on TV.\" Haste, a 52-year-old City veteran who has led the centuries-old RSA insurance company as well as its rival AXA Sunlife, was a surprise choice for Wonga, founded in 2006 to offer short-term credit at sky-high rates. The UK's biggest payday lender has been without a permanent chief executive or chairman since its co-founder Errol Damelin quit as chairman in June last month. Damelin's departure, seven months after he stood down as chief executive, came just before the financial regulator ordered the payday lender to pay \u00a32.6m in compensation for misleading customers by issuing letters to struggling borrowers under the name of fake legal firms. The Financial Conduct Authority said Wonga had been guilty of \"unfair and misleading debt collection practices\" after it emerged the lender had made up the companies to threaten legal action against customers. The Law Society has called for a criminal investigation but Haste said Wonga had not been contacted by police. \"As of today we are not under criminal investigation and our whole focus is working with our regulator to pay compensation to customers in a timely manner.\" Wonga has also been attacked for \"legal loansharking\", uniting MP Stella Creasy and the Archbishop of Canterbury in condemnation of the high cost of its loans. Last week the Church of England announced it had ended its indirect investment in Wonga, a holding that had \"embarrassed\" and \"irritated\" the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who had said he wanted to \"compete Wonga out of existence\" by boosting credit unions. Asked whether Wonga could ever become a firm the Church would choose to invest in, Haste said: \"I would be absolutely very happy to meet with the archbishop or anyone on his team to discuss those issues, to hear their concerns, to outline the programme of change we have at Wonga and where appropriate make changes as a result.\" Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: \"Cartoon characters promoting payday lending send the wrong message to borrowers. Years of debt are not cuddly or jovial, but instead are tough and distressing. It is good that one of the biggest payday lenders has come to its senses.\" The company declined to confirm whether it will end its sponsorship of Newcastle United football team. A spokesman said: \"I don't want to prejudge the chairman. It is day one and we continue to be a proud sponsor of Newcastle United.\" Wonga has never disclosed how much it paid to have its name emblazoned on Newcastle's black and white shirts, but the four-year deal that began in the 2013-14 season is thought to be worth \u00a38m. Haste expects Wonga's business and profits to shrink when a new cap on the industry's charges \u2013 to be announced on Tuesday \u2013 comes into force. \"It is inevitable and understandable and accepted by our shareholders that in the near term we will likely be a smaller and less profitable business.\" The expected restrictions on overall charges, including interest rates and fees, are part of a wider clampdown on payday lenders that began this month with restrictions on the number of times loans can be rolled over or extended, and rules preventing firms making more than two unsuccessful attempts to take cash directly from customer's bank accounts. Many smaller payday lenders have already been forced out of the market because tougher regulation has made it harder and more expensive to operate. Haste said the company's priorities included a review of customers to ensure it is only lending to people \"who can reasonably afford to repay their loans\", and ensuring transparent lending, which he said would \"lead to a tightening of Wonga's lending criteria\". He said Wonga, which operates in nine countries with 4 million customers, could increase its profits in the medium term by repairing its reputation.",

Ireland's finance minister, Michael Noonan, welcomed Pym's appointment to AIB in what he said was an important time for the bank as it continues on the road to recovery. \"Mr Pym has a wealth of experience in the UK banking sector and I am confident that he we will prove to be a strong Chairman of AIB Group plc,\" Noonan said. Pym said: \"I look forward to contributing to the progress that has already been made in rebuilding a strong bank. Irish taxpayers have made considerable sacrifices in supporting the banking system and I am very conscious of my responsibilities in that regard.\" The Co-Op Bank has yet to find a replacement for Pym, but said the search was underway. Dennis Holt, the bank's senior independent director, is ready to stand in as interim chair when Pym stands down in October.",

      "bodyText": "America's biggest banks will update investors this week amid expectations that the financial services sector has been hit once more by lacklustre lending, poor trading and the soaring cost of legal expenses tied to a series of fines and investigations. The six largest US banks \u2013 Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo \u2013 are expected to show quarterly revenue declined by 5.6% from the previous year, according to the analyst estimates. Profits are expected to drop as banks face a tough comparison with a strong second quarter last year. The results come as regulators are negotiating settlements with some of the banks and continue to investigate others over a variety of issues. Citigroup, which reports on Friday, is believed to be close to a $7bn (\u00a34.1bn) settlement over the sale of risky mortgages in the runup to the financial crisis. The justice department reached a similar agreement with JP Morgan, reporting Tuesday, last year. The justice department is also in talks with Bank of America about alleged wrongdoing in its mortgage business ahead of the crisis. The talks with the bank, which reports on Wednesday, have apparently stalled. Reuters reported earlier this month that the attorney general, Eric Holder, had refused to meet Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan because the two sides remain too far apart. Alongside legal woes the banks are also experiencing continued problems on their trading desks, once the main driver of growth, now held back by new regulations aimed at tamping down excessive risk taking and lack of appetite among investors. Foreign exchange and fixed income trading revenues have fallen at the investment banks this year. Bond trading income declined by 11% at Goldman Sachs in the first quarter and investors will be watching closely for signs of improvement when the bank reports on Tuesday. Wells Fargo, the US's biggest lender, kicked off the latest bank results reporting season last Friday. The bank has never been a big trader and has instead concentrated on commercial and consumer lending. It also managed to avoid the regulatory woes of its rivals. Wells posted a 3.8% rise in net income, ahead of expectations, but investors were disappointed by a slip in lending profitability and a slowdown in its cost-cutting programme. A bank analyst at FBR Capital Markets, Paul Miller, described Wells' results as so-so but said there were still many positive signs in its business and it was likely to outperform its peers. \"I don't think the banks can earn what they are expected to earn relative to their valuations,\" he said. Miller said investors had largely discounted the fines some of the banks still face and were more interested in what they were likely to do in 2016 than their historic problems. He added that the banks' fixed income and equity desks were still performing poorly and the still sluggish economy remained a drag on the sector. \"What they need is jobs, jobs, jobs,\" he said. \"They need the economy to pick up.\"",
