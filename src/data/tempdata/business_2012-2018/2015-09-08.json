      "bodyText": "Big employers at this autumn\u2019s graduate recruitment fairs are under pressure to attract more female applicants as new figures show that only 42% of hires to big training schemes are women \u2013 even though almost 60% of graduates are female. The Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) said the proportion of female hires to graduate schemes had not improved in the last five years. That was despite a majority of big graduate employers running schemes to improve gender diversity, said the association, whose 300 members include BT, the Bank of England, Nestl\u00e9 and Tesco. \u201cGender diversity is an issue which requires more of our attention. Although our data cannot explain why women aren\u2019t securing more graduate placements, it indicates there is more to be done to attract female graduates who in turn need to make the most of the opportunities available,\u201d said AGR chief executive Stephen Isherwood. \u201cThe message for our members is actively encouraging more women to apply.\u201d The report, based on responses from 205 employers which offered a total of more than 24,000 graduate vacancies over the last year, suggested graduate salaries are rising. Average graduate salaries are up 3.7% from last year, rising from \u00a327,000 to \u00a328,000. The median salary after three years on the job was up by 4.5% to \u00a335,000. There was also fresh evidence on Tuesday that a significant proportion of university leavers are going into lower-skilled jobs. Government figures on young graduates in England showed the proportion in high-skilled work had fallen markedly over the last decade. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) said 57% of graduates aged 21-30 were in high-skilled employment in the second quarter of this year. That compares with 63% in 2006. The latest high-skilled employment figures mean the remaining 43% of young graduates were either unemployed, economically inactive or in jobs not classified as high-skilled. The TUC described the figures as another worrying signal about the nature of the UK\u2019s labour market. \u201cThis is more evidence that the UK economy is shifting towards low-skill, low-productivity work. Without a new approach the investment and innovation that modern economies need will all take place abroad,\u201d the TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said. But BIS said that graduates and postgraduates still had higher employment rates, higher average salaries and were more likely to work in high-skilled jobs than non-graduates. It also reported that at 4.4%, the unemployment rate for young graduates was the lowest for a second quarter of the year since 2008, just before the financial crisis. The jobless rate for young non-graduates was 9.5%. \u201cToday\u2019s figures continue to show the significant benefits of a degree for young people. Graduates under 30 are enjoying falling rates of unemployment and record earnings, on average,\u201d said a spokesman for the department. Isherwood at the AGR said graduates who gained work experience during their degrees, looked beyond London for jobs and prepared well for interviews had good prospects. \u201cI think things are looking bright for graduates. If you are a graduate you are more likely to be in work and you are more likely to be in better paid work,\u201d he said. Growth in graduate vacancies was broad-based over the last year but some sectors in particular ramped up their recruitment, notably accounting and professional services, the public sector and engineering and industrial firms, the AGR said. \u201cAbout half of AGR members don\u2019t fill all their vacancies. In areas like IT and engineering they struggle the most. Often what they find is candidates who have the right technical skills but not the soft skills,\u201d said Isherwood. The annual survey also suggested graduates were staying with their training scheme providers. \u201cDespite the perception that all graduates are job-hoppers, graduates stay with our employer members for an average of five years. What\u2019s more, only 6% leave in their first year on the job,\u201d said Isherwood.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "United Airlines chief executive officer Jeff Smisek stepped down \u201ceffective immediately\u201d on Tuesday with the airline citing an ongoing federal corruption investigation into the company. The airline is under investigation over whether it improperly sought to influence officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in a scandal that has embarrassed Republican presidential hopeful Chris Christie. United also announced that its executive vice president of communications and government affairs and its senior vice president of corporate and government affairs had stepped down. The investigation has focused on apparent favors for the chairman of the Port Authority, David Samson, who allegedly asked Smisek to reopen what Bloomberg characterized as \u201ca money-losing route\u201d from Newark to Columbia, South Carolina, near Samson\u2019s weekend home in Aiken. Newark, a hub for United and doubly important after its merger with Continental Airlines, has seen expansions including a $600m lengthening of the local railroad line, the Path train. Samson resigned last year after a scandal around lane closures on the Fort Lee bridge that also embroiled New Jersey governor Christie. Samson also resigned from his own law firm, Wolff &amp; Samson, in April after heightened scrutiny around the firm during the Port Authority investigation. In a regulatory filing, United said: \u201cThe company and certain of its executive officers and employees have received federal grand jury subpoenas requesting records and testimony related to certain individuals formerly associated with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and related operations of the Company.\u201d According to the filing, Smisek will receive a payment of $4.875m as severance, in addition to a portion of his performance bonuses received in 2013, 2014 and 2015, which are still outstanding. He will also remain eligible for his bonus this year. In exchange, he is subject to a non-disparagement clause and a two-year-long non-competition agreement in his termination deal. He will also \u201chold in strict confidence any confidential information related to the companies\u201d. The company said it would be able to \u201cclawback\u201d its severance payments if Smisek is convicted or pleads guilty to any crime involving \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d related to his service at the company. Smisek will be replaced by Oscar Munoz, who has served on the board of directors for United Continental Holdings, Inc since 2010, and is an experienced executive who most recently served as president and chief operating officer of CSX Corporation. United is cooperating with the government\u2019s investigation, it added. During the Q&amp;A portion of a conference call with investors Monday afternoon, executive vice president and general counsel for United Brett Hart reiterated that the company would not answer any questions on the topic. He added that \u201call of our disclosures were appropriate\u201d and said that the federal investigation was ongoing, as well as United\u2019s own internal investigation. \u201cIt is truly a privilege to serve as United\u2019s CEO. United has an incredible opportunity for improving an experience that is essential to the vitality of global business and to the personal lives of millions of people, for innovation, and for earnings growth,\u201d Munoz said in a statement. \u201cIn my years serving on the board, I have been impressed by the dedication and skill of my new coworkers. Together, we will make United the top-performing airline.\u201d Munoz will continue to serve on United\u2019s board of directors. Henry L Meyer III, United\u2019s lead independent director, will serve as non-executive chairman of the board of directors.",

    "webTitle": "Strong eurozone figures rally global markets after China gloom", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global markets yesterday shrugged off a big fall in China\u2019s monthly imports after figures showed the eurozone economy strengthened this year. The better than expected figures for the 19-member currency bloc sent the FTSE 100 up 71 points to 6,146 while the New York Dow Jones index soared almost 300 points by 6pm UK time on Tuesday. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, was also its strongest performer after an improved picture for GDP growth was bettered by record high imports and exports in July. \u201cThe German data is offering some relief that the European recovery remains on track and German exports are not impacted too much by the emerging market turmoil,\u201d said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets. Only the Japanese nikkei was a faller among major exchanges, slipping 2.43%, as traders feared the China slowdown would take a heavy toll on Tokyo\u2019s export industries. The price of oil moved higher in tandem with metals prices, though remained well below prices achieved before a stream of negative figures from China sent world markets into a spin. Figures from Goldman Sachs showed that some of the stability achieved in the subsequent months came from the 1.5tn yuan (\u00a3172bn) buying spree by Beijing, much of it on smaller company shares. The Chinese authorities spent about 600bn yuan in August alone. Beijing has also imposed a raft of measures to prevent excessive speculation by individual traders, acting on their own behalf, who dominate the Shanghai market. In a signal that regulators believe more needs to be done, they said a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism, which would kick in to stop wild swings on its turbulent stock markets, was close to being implemented. According to draft regulation, trading would be suspended for 30 minutes if the market rose or fell by 5%. If the index went up or down by 7% or more, trading would be suspended for the day. The mechanism could only be triggered once a day. \u201cCircuit breaker in both directions will be conducive to curbing excessive transactions and reining in market fluctuations,\u201d the draft from the securities regulator said. China\u2019s foreign trade dropped 9.7% in August, with customs data showing that exports for August were down 6.1% but imports fell 14.3%. The figures, which follow a similar slump in July, raised more questions about the pace at which the world\u2019s second-biggest economy was slowing and added to concerns about its contribution to global growth. In the first eight months of this year, imports were down 14.6% and exports fell 1.6%. However, Chinese stocks rose as some analysts calculated the data could lead to further policy easing in the coming months. Shanghai\u2019s composite index recovered from a poor start and finished up almost 3%. Eurozone GDP growth, which has suffered a series of setbacks since the financial crash, grew in the second quarter after it was adjusted upwards to 0.4% from 0.3%. The first quarter was revised from 0.4% to 0.52%. Analysis of the figures showed that improvement was due to a surge in exports, which was driven by the falling value of the euro against the dollar and contributed a 0.3-point increase to quarterly growth. Germany\u2019s trade was 2.4% higher at \u20ac103bn (\u00a375bn) adding another \u20ac25bn to the country\u2019s trade surplus, a record high. The ING economist, Carsten Brzeski, said the weak euro helped boost exports, especially to the US, which became Germany\u2019s single most important trading partner in the first half. There was also a silver lining to the disappointing Chinese import data for August, as some analysts saw it as a sign that China\u2019s authorities would do more to support the economy. \u201c(There is some) hope that you\u2019ve got a lot more stimulus on the way from China,\u201d said Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG. Alongside the billions of yuan Beijing has thrown at its stock market to prevent a further collapse, the People\u2019s Bank of China has spent huge sums from its foreign exchange reserves, the world\u2019s largest, propping up the currency following a surprise currency devaluation. According to figures released earlier this week, the bank\u2019s reserves dropped by almost $94bn (\u00a361bn) in August to $3.5tn. Additional reporting by Luna Lin",

If the index went up or down by 7% or more, trading would be suspended for the day.</p> <p>The mechanism could only be triggered once a day. \u201cCircuit breaker in both directions will be conducive to curbing excessive transactions and reining in market fluctuations,\u201d the draft from the securities regulator said.</p> <p>China\u2019s foreign trade dropped 9.7% in August, with customs data showing that exports for August were down 6.1% but imports fell 14.3%.</p> <p>The figures, which follow a similar slump in July, raised more questions about the pace at which the world\u2019s second-biggest economy was slowing and added to concerns about its contribution to global growth. In the first eight months of this year, imports were down 14.6% and exports fell 1.6%.<br></p> <p>However, Chinese stocks rose as some analysts calculated the data could lead to further policy easing in the coming months. Shanghai\u2019s composite index recovered from a poor start and finished up almost 3%. </p> <p>Eurozone GDP growth, which has suffered a series of setbacks since the financial crash, grew in the second quarter after it was adjusted upwards to 0.4% from 0.3%. The first quarter was revised from 0.4% to 0.52%.<br><br>Analysis of the figures showed that improvement was due to a surge in exports, which was driven by the falling value of the euro against the dollar and contributed a 0.3-point increase to quarterly growth. </p> <p>Germany\u2019s trade was 2.4% higher at \u20ac103bn (\u00a375bn) adding another \u20ac25bn to the country\u2019s trade surplus, a record high.</p> <p>The ING economist, Carsten Brzeski, said the weak euro helped boost exports, especially to the US, which became Germany\u2019s single most important trading partner in the first half.</p> <p>There was also a silver lining to the disappointing Chinese import data for August, as some analysts saw it as a sign that China\u2019s authorities would do more to support the economy. </p> <p>\u201c(There is some) hope that you\u2019ve got a lot more stimulus on the way from China,\u201d said Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG. </p> <p>Alongside the billions of yuan Beijing has thrown at its stock market to prevent a further collapse, the People\u2019s Bank of China has spent huge sums from its foreign exchange reserves, the world\u2019s largest, propping up the currency following a surprise currency devaluation.</p> <p>According to figures released earlier this week, the bank\u2019s reserves dropped by almost $94bn (\u00a361bn) in August to $3.5tn. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Luna Lin</em><br></p>",

Voting against the re-election of Mike Ashley, the company\u2019s founder, deputy chairman and 55% owner, is obviously a doomed cause. But it may draw attention to the many failings of the non-executive directors. Here are a few lowlights from a long list: First, allowing the company to punt on Tesco shares via a put-option agreement with Goldman Sachs. Ashley should risk his own cash, not shareholders\u2019, on such adventures. The risible explanation was that Sports Direct, which operates a few shops within Tesco stores, wished to reflect its \u201cgrowing relationship\u201d with the supermarket chain. Nonsense. Tesco couldn\u2019t give a damn about the bet. Second, the board\u2019s failure to appoint a finance director for 18 months. Even hedge fund Odey, a long-term shareholder, reckoned the vacuum put too much power in Ashley\u2019s hands. When it finally acted, Sports Direct turned to the 35-year-old financial controller on an \u201cacting\u201d basis. Third, the current cheeky attempt to change the bonus targets. The original hurdle for top-line profits for 2016 was \u00a3480m but this has been deemed \u201cunreasonably challenging\u201d and \u00a3420m proposed instead. Whatever the board says about the failure of acquisitions to materialise, this looks a blatant attempt to move the goalposts \u2013 \u201cunacceptable by UK standards,\u201d says Royal London, rightly. Fourth, chairman Keith Hellawell\u2019s confession to a parliamentary inquiry that he was unaware of two months of negotiations over the future of a subsidiary that ended up being placed in administration. If the chairman is in the dark on such matters, what\u2019s he doing there? The best way for the managers of our pensions to tell Sports Direct\u2019s board to improve its game is to follow Royal London\u2019s other lead by voting against the non-executive directors. New voting rules, introduced in the past year, are designed to give minority shareholders greater powers of protest. The regulatory reform is terribly modest \u2013 but if fund managers won\u2019t use them at Sports Direct today, why bother at all? Quids in? You thought investment bankers were a rapacious bunch who can\u2019t see further than their next fat fee? Nonsense, they\u2019re public-spirited folk who happily work for the government for less than the price of a London bus ticket. \u201cA rather extraordinary arrangement,\u201d concluded Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, on learning that Goldman Sachs and UBS have been charging a pound a time to help sell chunks of the part-privatised banks. It turns out the state has paid \u00a315 when, for a different client, the bill might have been \u00a338m. Tyrie should do more than arch his eyebrow. The practice of charging below-par fees to government is well established but it\u2019s far from clear what the investment banks hope to gain in return. We can guess, however. It may be designed to discourage Westminster from probing too deeply into the City\u2019s gouging of commercial clients. Underwriting of rights issues, for example, is an exercise in charging princely sums for shouldering minimal risk. There\u2019s a subject worthy of another look. Costa Coffee froth The \u201cnational living wage\u201d represents a \u201csubstantial\u201d cost increase, says Whitbread, owner of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn. Really?

Chief executive Andy Harrison can apply \u201cselective\u201d price increases if he wishes but, please, after a year in which Costa made a return on capital of 46%, don\u2019t expect the customers to be sympathetic.",

      "bodyText": "European markets have now closed and it\u2019s time for a quick summary to finish off a day that saw some good news from the eurozone (with the notable exception of France), renewed hopes of Chinese stimulus after its imports fell again and warnings about pricier lattes. Here is how things looked at the close for the European bourses, helped by that news this morning that eurozone GDP increased by 0.4% in the April-June period, not the 0.3% first estimated three weeks ago. As reported earlier, the top loser on the FTSE 100 was Whitbread, after the owner of Costa coffee shops and Premier Inn hotels said it expected to cut spending and increase some prices to counter the \u201csubstantial\u201d cost of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, as it posted slowing second-quarter sales. Over on Wall Street, shares are also higher as traders return from the long Labor Day weekend. On commodity markets, copper has climbed to a four-week high as US traders caught up with announcements about mine closures made on Monday that look set to dampen supply. Oil prices are also higher, up 3.7% to $49.4 for a barrel of Brent crude, but that was not enough to wipe away a 6% drop in Monday\u2019s session. On Wednesday, the UK will be in focus early on with official figures due out on industrial production and on trade in July. They will be scrutinised for clues as to how the Bank of England\u2019s committee of interest rate setters is feeling about the UK outlook ahead of their latest policy announcement on Thursday. No-one expects a hike, but minutes from the meeting, also released on Thursday at noon, are expected to show at least one of the nine monetary policy committee members voting for a rise from the current 0.5% record low. Ahead of the data, here\u2019s a little reminder of where the various sectors of the UK economy stand relative to their pre-crisis peaks. The vast service industry, which covers a host of activities from hairdressing to banking, is the only part of the economy in which output has exceeded pre-downturn levels. Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, says the industrial production data, and the breakdown on the manufacturing sector, could well bring more downbeat news on the nature of the UK recovery: The UK economy looks to be firmly in two speed mode with the services sector looking to be expanding solidly whilst manufacturers suffer a tougher ride, dragged down, in particular, by sterling strength. On that note, the export figures in Wednesday\u2019s trade data will also be studied for signs the strong pound and shaky business confidence from the eurozone to China are hurting overseas sales. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and the comments, as ever. We will be back in the morning to cover whatever stock market swings the next session brings for China, those UK figures and other business and economics news from around the world. Talking of Whitbread\u2019s complaints about the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, the chancellor has been answering questions about his new minimum pay rates this afternoon. Osborne, announced a bumper pay increase in July, with the current \u00a36.50 minimum wage set to rise to \u00a37.20 for those aged over 25 from next April. The rate will grow steadily over the following four years to about \u00a39.35 an hour. Osborne is currently appearing in front of the Lords economic affairs committee where there have been questions about changes and their potential impact on employers and employees. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering the committee hearing in his politics live blog, but here\u2019s a flavour of the exchange on the \u201cnational living wage\u201d - which, by the way, is not to be confused with the (higher) living wage as advocated by the Living Wage Foundation and paid by some employers. Q: How will you ensure people losing money from the cuts to tax credits have time to get used to their lower income? Osborne says he is proposing a compact to the country. To business, he is saying their taxes will be low, but they have to pay higher wages. And to families he is saying welfare will be less generous, but wages will be higher. He says current welfare spending is unsustainable. Ramping up tax credits in a way that made them unaffordable was irresponsible. Originally they were supposed to cost less than \u00a31bn. But they ended up costing \u00a330bn. Q: How will the social care sector be able to cope with the higher national minimum wage? Osborne says he is aware of this issue. He plans to address it in the spending review. Osborne has also been responding to questions about plans to build new nuclear power generating capacity at the Hinkley Point power station. He said told the committee: \u201cI am pretty confident that we are going to be able to do a deal, but we are still in the negotiations.\u201d The FTSE 100 has now closed and has managed to clock up another day of gains. Building on Monday\u2019s mosest o.5% rise, the index of London-listed bluechips has ended today\u2019s session up another 1.2%, or 72 points, at 6,146.1. Traders say this morning\u2019s upgraded growth figures for the eurozone brought a much needed boost to market sentiment after the turmoil of recent weeks. Glencore was the top riser as investors continued to welcome Monday\u2019s announcement of a big shake-up and debt-slashing plans from the commodities trading platform and mining company. Glencore shares closed up 4.4% at 136p. Whitbread, the coffee and hotels chain, was the biggest loser of the day. The shares lost 1.6% to \u00a346.36 after it said expected to cut spending and increase some prices to counter the \u201csubstantial\u201d cost of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, as it posted slowing second-quarter sales. Although the Dow hogs the headlines, the S&amp;P 500 is a better measure of the health of the US stock market. And it\u2019s gained 1.5% today, meaning the index has burst back out of correction territory (defined as being 10% below the recent high). That underlines that US investors are less gloomy; partly on hopes of more Chinese stimulus measures to shore up its economy. We should remember that US stocks fell pretty heavily on Friday, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets points out: The near 2% surge in US markets is mostly a bounce back from Friday\u2019s sell-off but weak Chinese trade data possibly sets the tone for more stimulus from China. The logic is that the PBOC won\u2019t want to rock markets with one-off currency devaluation. More likely, China will be more incremental in weakening the exchange rate with more cuts to bank reserves and interest rates if the economy still shows signs of slowing. Shares of Apple jumped over 2.5% on the open, taking the tech sector higher with it, though in a notable sign of weakness, shares of Twitter and Netflix were both trading lower. Here are the stocks leading the rally in New York today: The wave of optimism on Wall Street has pushed every share on the Dow Jones industrial average higher, after one hour\u2019s trading. The Dow is up around 235 points, or 1.46%, while the tech stock-heavy Nasdaq has gained almost 2%. Traders are taking heart that the Chinese stock market didn\u2019t crash while they were away for Labor Day on Monday (reminder, the Shanghai Composite index jumped by 3% today). And although today\u2019s trade data was ugly, that raises the chances that central bankers will maintain very loose monetary policy for longer. And that\u2019s invariably good for stock prices. Markus Huber, a senior analyst at Peregrine &amp; Black, says fears of a Chinese implosion have eased: \u201cWith volatility having receded somewhat during the past few days it appears that investors have been reassessing the potential negative fallout from the slowdown in China.\u201d European stock markets are also holding onto their earlier gains, with around 45 minutes trading to go. And they\u2019re back! Moscow\u2019s bourse is up and running again, and the stock market has dipped slightly. No word on what caused the outage, though. Moscow\u2019s stock market is nearly ready to open after that glitch: Shares on Wall Street are rising at the start of trading, as New York traders catch up with events since the weekend. The Dow Jones jumped by 304 pints, or nearly 2%, with talk that today\u2019s weak Chinese trade figures might prompt more stimulus measure from Beijing. Microsoft, Apple, Walmart and Intel are among the big names gaining 2%, in the first session after Monday\u2019s Labor Day break. Back in Greece, anti-austerity rebels have won the support of the legendary leftist Manolis Glezos in what some say will be a major endorsement for the anti-euro Popular Unity party. Helena Smith reports Glezos, whose first act of resistance was to remove the Swastika from the Acropolis days after German soldiers marched into Athens in 1941, has finally broken his silence announcing he will back the MPs who rebelled against Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras after he caved into the demands of creditors. In a speech aired in the last 20 mins as Popular Unity leader Panagiotis Lafazanis addressed reporters at the country\u2019s annual trade fair, Glezos said the time had come to \u201copen the door so that visions and hope can pass.\u201d \u201cHistory is now calling on citizens to take fate their hand,\u201d added the nonagenarian appealing to \u201cold fighters\u201d who had been on the frontline of battles for freedom and justice to join the party. \u201cThese elections are decisive, they provide the opportunity for the rotten status quo to be destroyed and for the fighter to prove himself.\u201d Glezos\u2019 decision to back the dissidents will be tough for Tsipras whom he mentored during his early days in office. The move comes as Popular Unity launches its tongue-in-cheek TV adverts, with Lafazanis heading to the National Mint to get Grexit underway. Here\u2019s one for the daredevil bond traders among you - Iraq is getting ready to issue sovereign debt for the first time in nine years. Officials from the Iraqi government will meet with City bankers on Thursday to gauge interest. They want to raise funds to cover its budget deficit, triggered by the cost of fighting Islamic State militants and the falling oil price. Reuters says the roadshow should be successful, but at a price... Despite the political risks in Iraq, its status as OPEC\u2019s second biggest oil producer is expected to ensure buyers for its debt; its huge southern oil fields have not been directly touched by the fighting, and it has embarked on an ambitious multi-year plan to raise crude output. Baghdad is expected to pay a high price for its borrowing, however; Iraq\u2019s outstanding US dollar bond maturing in 2028 is trading at a yield of 10.37%. It\u2019s a tricky time for Iraq to be selling debt, given the shake-out in the emerging markets. Staff at the Moscow stock exchange are racing to restart trading using a back-up system, CNBC reports: Moscow\u2019s stock market appears to have suffered an unexpected problem. Trading on the bourse was temporarily suspended a few minutes ago, with reports of an \u201cemergency situation\u201d. FastFT reckon it\u2019s due to a fault with network equipment at the exchange\u2019s data centre, leaving people unable to trade shares, bonds, currencies or derivatives. The MICEX index had risen by around 1.2% before the sudden halt. European stock markets have pushed higher today, thanks to the upgraded eurozone growth figures. Germany\u2019s record-breaking trade figures also cheered investors, following the news of China\u2019s slumping imports. This has driven the German DAX up over 2%, with other markets close behind: Wall Street is expected to gain around 1.5% when trading begins, in an hour\u2019s time. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, market analyst at London Capital Group, says traders are anticipating further stimulus measures from central banker, especially given China\u2019s weakness. Following further contraction in Chinese trade terms in August, the European and the US stock indices painted the equity picture in green on strengthening belief that central banks\u2019 would not dare taking their hands off the blurry financial markets in the immediate future. Almost every poll in Greece now shows former ruling Syriza neck and neck with centre right New Democracy. And as the snap ballot on September 20 draws nearer, uglier, as our correspondent Helena Smith explains: There were extraordinary scenes this morning on state-run TV between erstwhile Syriza minister Panos Skourletis and the New Democracy MP Manolis Kefaloyiannis. Accused of being \u201ca liar and ignoramus\u201d by Skourletis, the conservative shot back: You are stupid. I have studied at the London School of Economics, what shit have you done?\u201d In protest, Skourletis then interrupted the morning chat show by fleeing the studio. If that wasn\u2019t enough, former Syriza cadre and president of the parliament Zoe Konstantopoulou has upped the ante by accusing former prime minister Alexis Tsipras of destroying Syriza by embracing policies it had vowed to oppose. The fiery Konstantopoulou, who has now thrown her weight behind the breakaway Popular Unity party, challenged her former friend and comrade to a debate. Thus far, there has been no response from the Syriza leader. Konstantopoulou may have her detractors but she is as sharp as a whip and, without doubt, one of parliament\u2019s most articulate MPs. With just 12 days until the Greek general election, political parties are releasing unusually light-hearted TV ads. A prime example is the 37-second \u2018campaign\u2019 trailer put out by the anti- austerity anti-euro group Popular Unity this morning. It shows leader Panagiotis Lafazanis hailing a taxi, and asking to be driven straight to the National Mint -- to start work producing fresh drachma. Very droll.... Behind the winning (?) smile, Lafazanis\u2019s message is that Popular Unity can extract Greece from its current bailout deal: That message worked well for Alexis Tsipras in January\u2019s election; implementing the promise proved harder than he expected, though. Timo del Carpio, European economist at RBC Capital Markets, sees \u201crather encouraging\u201d signs in today\u2019s GDP figures: As we had expected, private consumption provided an important impulse behind the recovery in the second quarter of 2015 (as it has for the last nine quarters). But this time around, it was also accompanied by a measurable boost from net trade, which added +0.3pp to top-line growth. At first glance this might seem somewhat out of whack with the signs of weakness in certain emerging market trading partners. However, we think it is consistent with the view that, in the short-term, that weakness should be offset by the growing recovery in other advanced economies. However, eurozone companies did cut back on investment last quarter. This \u2018gross fixed capital formation\u2019 is still around 15% below its pre-crisis levels. Today\u2019s growth data is \u201ca double dose of modest good news\u201d for the eurozone, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He points out that year-on-year eurozone growth hit a four-year high of 1.5% in the second quarter, up from from 1.2% in the first thee months of 2015. Archer explains that the drama over Greece\u2019s bailout this summer may have held back growth: The euro and oil prices remained at highly supportive levels to Eurozone growth in the second quarter, although they were above their first quarter lows. However, the Eurozone\u2019s ability to kick on may well have been hampered by heightened uncertainty weighing down on business and consumer confidence as the Greek crisis came to a head and concerns over global growth increased. Even with today\u2019s upward revisions, the eurozone\u2019s growth rate remains somewhat modest. Growth rates of 0.5% in Q1, and 0.4% in Q2, are still modest by international standards, especially given the boost from cheap energy prices and the ECB\u2019s QE programme. Today\u2019s data revisions show the eurozone\u2019s recovery is on stronger foundations, argues Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi. More good news: The eurozone\u2019s growth in the first three month of 2015 has also been revised higher, from 0.4% to 0.5%. The eurozone is growing faster than thought, after statistics body Eurostat revised its GDP figures for the last quarter. GDP increased by 0.4% in the April-June period, not the 0.3% first estimated three weeks ago. It\u2019s partly due to stronger growth in Italy, whose growth rate was revised up from 0.2% to 0.3%. It\u2019s a much-need dose of good news for the euro area, five days after the European Central Bank cut its growth forecasts. It may calm some worries over Europe\u2019s ability to withstand a slowdown in emerging markets as China tries to rebalance its economy. However, France remains a big concern, reporting no growth during the quarter. Eurostat reports that household spending drove the recovery, by increasing by 0.4% in the eurozone. Trade also made a positive contribution, with exports up by 1.6% and imports up by 1%. Reaction to follow.... Germany is calming some of the worries about China, by reporting record-breaking trade figures for July. Seasonally adjusted German exports climbed by 2.4% month-on-month, to \u20ac103.4bn, while imports grew 2.2% to \u20ac80.6bn. That\u2019s the biggest readings since 1991 (after reunification) when the survey began, and much stronger than economists expected. More here. Back in the UK, hotels and coffee chain Whitbread has warned it may raise prices to cover the cost of implementing the new \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Chancellor George Osborne announced in July\u2019s budget that the \u00a36.50 minimum wage (for over 25s) will rise to \u00a37.20 from next April, and reach \u00a39.35 an hour by 2010. This means a \u201csubstantial cost increase\u201d, Whitbread told investors this morning, meaning it will increase prices, cut costs and increase productivity. \u00a37.20 per hour works out at just under \u00a315,000 per year (before tax), so low-paid Whitbread employees won\u2019t be buying many racehorses next year. Some customers might even welcome the change: Whitbread isn\u2019t alone, though; all UK companies must be making the same calculations. Recruitment firm Manpower has warned today that firms could try to dodge paying workers more, by taking on younger or self-employed workers, who are not entitled to the living wage. The decline in China\u2019s imports will have serious consequences for other countries, points out FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunug: The China trade figures released overnight continued to highlight further weakness in the China economy, with both exports and imports declining. The continual decline in imports suggests that China is shifting away from an import dependent nation to one which is encouraging consumers to look more within the domestic market for its products and services. This change in approach will translate to further weakness for economies that have become dependent on demand from China. Iron ore imports contracted by around 14% last month; bad news for mining giants in Australia and Brazil. Fact of the morning: Beijing has now spent some $236bn supporting its stock market since June. That\u2019s according to Goldman Sachs analysts, who say China\u2019s \u201cNational Team\u201d pumped $94bn into shares in August alone, in an attempt to manage the selloff. China also banned large shareholders from ditching their assets, and ordered state-owned companies to buy shares - and still saw the market plunge last month. In the City, shares in insurance firm Amlin have surged by 32% after Japan\u2019s Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance announced a \u00a33.46bn takeover deal. Amlin shares are trading at 655p, close to the 670p offer price, suggesting the deal is expected to go through. Bloomberg reckons that the announcement sent sterling rallying against the yen. Traders may be calculate that more Japanese firms will start buying up foreign assets, in a search for growth. Another wild day\u2019s trading in Shanghai has ended, with the stock market up 3%. Quite a turnaround. European stock markets aren\u2019t too bothered by the Chinese trade data. The main indices are all up around 1% in early trading: Maybe investors have already \u2018priced in\u2019 the slowdown: Over to Tony Cross of TrustNet: It\u2019s been another positive start for trade in London this morning with traders clearly not feeling too unnerved by those weaker than expected trade figures out of China. Perhaps most worrying is the 13% slump in imports, but with commodity prices seeming to have found something of a floor of late, many mining stocks are once again floating towards the upper end of the index. China has found an innovative way of preventing any more Black Mondays - close the stock market when shares fall (or rise) too much, and send everyone home. From Shanghai, Jennifer Duggan reports: China is planning a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism to prevent any further losses on its volatile stock markets as both of the country\u2019s leading indexes continued to slide. According to draft regulation, trading would be suspended for 30 minutes when the market rose or fell by 5%. If the index went up or down by 7% or more, trading would be suspended for the day. The mechanism could only be triggered once a day. \u201cCircuit breaker in both directions will be conducive to curbing excessive transactions and reining in market fluctuations,\u201d the draft from the securities regulator said. Full story here: Economists are concerned by the fall in Chinese imports and exports last month. Ma Guangyuan, an independent Chinese economist, says the economic picture is deteriorating. \u201cThe August data followed the trend set in July. Now the global slowdown has very much become a reality.\u201d (via the FT) The fateful decision to allow the yuan to weaken last month hasn\u2019t boosted Chinese exporters yet. As Liu Xuezhi, a Shanghai-based macro-economy analyst at China\u2019s Bank of Communications, says: \u201cChina is set to miss its export growth target for this year, and there will be no help from the external demand side for economic growth.\u201d (via Bloomberg) Emerging market currencies are also weakening today, as fears of a Chinese slowdown reverberate. The Malaysian ringgit has hit a new 17-year low against the US dollar today, amid concerns that American interest rates could soon rise . Investors in Tokyo baulked at the Chinese trade data too. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell by 2.4% by the close of trading, as nervous traders pushed up the value of the yen (which hurts exporters). That means the index has lost all its gains this year. The Shanghai stock market dropped into the red after today\u2019s trade data was released. Curiously, though, it\u2019s now rallying in late trading, suggesting the Chinese authorities may be intervening.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. If you\u2019re not worried about the China\u2019s economy yet, it might be time to start. The latest trade data, released earlier today, underline that the country\u2019s economy is weakening, sending fresh ripples through the financial sector Imports into China slumped by 13.8% (in dollar terms) year-on-year, while exports were 5.5% lower. That suggests weakening activity within the Chinese economy, and sluggish global demand too. No wonder Biejing trimmed its growth forecast for 2015 over the weekend, from 7.4% to 7.3%. Perhaps that\u2019s still too optimistic. European markets might inch a little higher at the open, and Wall Street is expected to jump after yesterday\u2019s Labor Day holiday. Not much in the economics calendar today, beyond the second estimate of eurozone GDP at 10am. We\u2019ll also be watching political developments in Greece, ahead of the election on September 20.",

And to families he is saying welfare will be less generous, but wages will be higher.</p> <p>He says current welfare spending is unsustainable.</p> <p>Ramping up tax credits in a way that made them unaffordable was irresponsible. Originally they were supposed to cost less than \u00a31bn. But they ended up costing \u00a330bn.</p> <p><em>Q: How will the social care sector be able to cope with the higher national minimum wage?</em></p> <p>Osborne says he is aware of this issue.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House builder Berkeley Group has been rebuked by shareholders over its pay policy, with about a fifth of independent investors failing to back a scheme that handed the firm\u2019s boss more than \u00a323m last year. About 14.5% of shareholders directly opposed the remuneration report at the annual meeting in Stoke D\u2019Abernon, Surrey, with a further 4% withholding their vote. However, if the directors\u2019 near 10% stake in the builder is excluded, 20% of shareholders declined to support the plan that led to chairman Tony Pidgley being paid \u00a323.3m. The payment to Pidgley was part of a \u00a342m bonus payout shared by the top five executives at Berkeley, who appear to be set for one of the biggest pay awards handed out by a UK-listed company. Last year\u2019s packages represent the start of a series of payouts to the company\u2019s top executives, that could total \u00a3500m in the next six years. A company spokesman said: \u201cBerkeley\u2019s policy is to reward success over the long term. These awards reflect the value delivered to shareholders through a total shareholder return of 400% over the past five years and 500% over the past 10 years.\u201d Pidgley, who was adopted from Barnardos by travellers when he was four and spent his early years living in a disused railway carriage, co-founded Berkeley nearly 30 years ago. He has since built a fortune estimated to be worth about \u00a3212m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List (paywall), which makes him one of the UK\u2019s wealthiest business executives. The Berkeley vote came after weeks of comment about the size of the pay packets being awarded to directors of the UK\u2019s largest housebuilders, all of which seem to be riding a booming market. Pidgley told investors the market was being buoyed by \u201ca stable operating environment, supported by a decisive general election result in May\u201d. He said demand was being driven by a \u201ccombination of good demand fundamentals, the lack of supply of good quality new homes in London and the south of England, continued low interest rates and a growing economy\u201d. In a trading update, Berkeley confirmed it was on track to meet its earnings target of \u00a32bn during the next three years. Pidgley\u2019s optimistic mood was mirrored by Steve Morgan, chairman of Redrow and of Wolverhampton Wanderers football club, as the rival builder announced record annual results, with profits up by more than 50%. Morgan said: \u201cFor the first time in our history, we generated turnover in excess of \u00a31bn, up 33% on last year. We built and sold over 4,000 homes across the UK last year, up 12% from the year before and around 42% more than in 2013. Pre-tax profits also reached record levels, up 53% as we saw the benefit from our early site acquisitions post the downturn.\u201d The government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme remained \u201ca major driver for the industry to increase output\u201d, he said, stating that 40% \u2013 or 1,374 \u2013 of the company\u2019s private legal completions during the year took advantage of the scheme, up from 1,023 (35%) last year. Berkeley and Redrow shares were up about 2% after their positive statements.",

However, if the directors\u2019 near 10% stake in the builder is excluded, 20% of shareholders declined to support the plan that led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/10/berkeley-boss-gets-232m-payout-after-companys-profits-soar-by-42\">chairman Tony Pidgley being paid \u00a323.3m</a>.</p> <p>The payment to Pidgley was part of a \u00a342m bonus payout shared by the top five executives at Berkeley, who appear to be set for one of the biggest pay awards handed out by a UK-listed company. Last year\u2019s packages represent the start of a series of payouts to the company\u2019s top executives, that could total \u00a3500m in the next six years.</p> <p>A company spokesman said: \u201cBerkeley\u2019s policy is to reward success over the long term.

He has since built a fortune estimated to be worth about \u00a3212m, according to <a href=\"http://features.thesundaytimes.co.uk/richlist/2015/live/richlist/view/1/950/name/asc/\">the Sunday Times Rich List </a>(paywall), which makes him one of the UK\u2019s wealthiest business executives.</p> <p>The Berkeley vote came after weeks of comment about the size of the pay packets being awarded to directors of the UK\u2019s largest housebuilders, all of which seem to be riding a booming market.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/berkeley-grp-hlds--bkg-/rns/interim-management-statement/201509080700223390Y/\">Pidgley told investors</a> the market was being buoyed by \u201ca stable operating environment, supported by a decisive general election result in May\u201d. He said demand was being driven by a \u201ccombination of good demand fundamentals, the lack of supply of good quality new homes in London and the south of England, continued low interest rates and a growing economy\u201d.</p> <p>In a trading update, Berkeley confirmed it was on track to meet its earnings target of \u00a32bn during the next three years.</p> <p>Pidgley\u2019s optimistic mood was mirrored by Steve Morgan, chairman of Redrow and of Wolverhampton Wanderers football club, as the rival builder announced record annual results, with profits up by more than 50%.</p> <p>Morgan said: \u201cFor the first time in our history, we generated turnover in excess of \u00a31bn, up 33% on last year. We built and sold over 4,000 homes across the UK last year, up 12% from the year before and around 42% more than in 2013. Pre-tax profits also reached record levels, up 53% as we saw the benefit from our early site acquisitions post the downturn.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme remained \u201ca major driver for the industry to increase output\u201d, he said, stating that 40% \u2013 or 1,374 \u2013 of the company\u2019s private legal completions during the year took advantage of the scheme, up from 1,023 (35%) last year.</p> <p>Berkeley and Redrow shares were up about 2% after their positive statements.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The company established by the Treasury to hold the taxpayers\u2019 stakes in RBS and Lloyds has been warned to remain \u201cultra-vigilant\u201d after it was revealed some of the City\u2019s biggest investment banks \u2013 including Goldman Sachs and UBS \u2013 are charging the government a \u00a31 fee for work that would normally cost tens of millions of pounds. Representatives of UK Financial Investments told the Treasury select committee it had paid just \u00a315 for help and advice related to the sale of shares in Lloyds Banking Group and RBS which would normally have cost around \u00a338m. Oliver Holbourn, head of market investments at UKFI, said some City firms had even offered to pay the government to work on its privatisations. The banks, however, eventually concluded that such arrangements could be an offence under the US foreign corrupt practices act. Holbourn\u2019s revelations prompted concern among committee MPs about the banks\u2019 motivation. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, described the token \u00a31 fees as a \u201crather extraordinary arrangement\u201d. Another Conservative MP, Chris Philp, warned UKFI to proceed with caution: \u201cI\u2019ve never encountered an outfit like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley acting in a charitable manner,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease be ultra-vigilant.\u201d . James Leigh-Pemberton, the boss of UKFI, said he assumed the banks worked for \u00a31 because of the cache associated with such high-profile work. He said they benefited from \u201cthe franchise value of being appointed to work for an agency of the UK government and the size of transaction\u201d. Steve Baker, another Conservative MP on the committee, said UKFI needed to give clear answers about where the investment banking advisers are making money, given the low fees. \u201cI feel sure that many of my constituents would join me in regarding in the utmost astonishment that the same organisations that have been fined for repeat rapacious misconduct are now the jolly good chaps we imagine from the past and now charging just \u00a31 for their services\u201d. However, Mark Garnier, a Conservative MP, said the fee was a rare cause for celebration. Goldman Sachs refused to comment on why it was charging only \u00a31 for its services. UKFI\u2019s annual report lists expenses and fees for asset disposals in the last financial year \u2013 before the RBS shares were sold off in August \u2013 of \u00a31.1m. It is unclear what this refers to. The UKFI officials were appearing before the committee for the first time since the government starting selling off shares in RBS. The sell-off got underway despitea looming fine on the bank, which could total up to \u00a38bn \u2013 from the US department of justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for the way RBS sold mortgage bonds in the US before the 2008 banking crisis. RBS has set aside \u00a32.1bn to cover the FHFA tranche of the penalty, which is not expected to be enough to cover the total cost. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, asked whether UKFI wanted the Treasury to try to stop US taxpayers taking money off UK taxpayers. He said: \u201cIf I were in your position I\u2019d be saying what is the British embassy for if it is not for trying to get RBS off this fine.\u201d UKFI boss Leigh-Pemberton said \u201ccertainty and resolution of this issue at the earliest opportunity is highly desirable but certainty and resolution at any price is not\u201d. He justified the RBS sell-off \u2013 at a \u00a31bn loss to the taxpayer \u2013 on the basis that if more shares were available to private investors it would make the bank a more attractive proposition. He acknowledged speculation in RBS shares had risen ahead of the sell-off but said this had not affected the 330p price achieved for the government. There had been a 12m increase in the number of shares sold short \u2013 a process by which hedge funds sell shares in the hope they will make a profit when the share price falls \u2013 compared with a more usual 26m to 28m.",

      "bodyText": "Justin King, the former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, has confirmed he is joining Terra Firma in his first major role since leaving the supermarket chain. King will become vice-chairman and head of portfolio businesses at the private equity firm, which owns Odeon &amp; UCI Cinemas Group and Wyevale garden centres. Terra Firma, which is led by the tax exile Guy Hands, suffered a major setback in 2011 when the record label EMI was taken over by Citigroup, its main creditor, after a bruising legal battle. Hands is seeking more than \u00a32bn in damages from the bank, with a trial scheduled for next year in the UK. King, who is thought to have taken a shareholding in Terra Firma, will be given the task of revitalising the company. He will provide it with a high-profile name to help raise new funds for major deals, as well as run its businesses. Hands, the chairman and chief investment officer of Terra Firma, said it was a \u201cgreat fit for both sides\u201d. \u201cTerra Firma has been transforming businesses for over 20 years and currently has a diverse portfolio of businesses in various stages of development. Justin has turned around and run businesses in various sectors,\u201d he said. King ran Sainsbury\u2019s for a decade until last year and is credited with turning the retailer around. It was suffering from tumbling sales and profits when he took over, but saw its like-for-like sales rise for nine consecutive years under his leadership. King, who also worked for Marks &amp; Spencer, Asda and Mars, said he was delighted to be joining Terra Firma. The role is his first full-time job since leaving Sainsbury\u2019s and means he follows in the footsteps of the former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, who is also working in private equity with the US firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice. He has already taken advisory roles with Manor Marussia Formula One team Grand Prix and 2 Sisters Food Group, the owner of Fox\u2019s Biscuits. He is also leading a review of Thomas Cook\u2019s customer and welfare practices after the death of two children on one of its holidays. King said: \u201cI am looking forward to working with Guy and the team and to playing my part in Terra Firma\u2019s hands-on approach to transforming businesses.\u201d He joins Terra Firma despite describing tax as \u201cfirst and foremost a moral issue\u201d in a speech last year. Hands has been based in Guernsey for tax reasons since 2009, making him arguably the City of London\u2019s highest-profile tax exile. He and his wife Julie are estimated to be worth \u00a3250m.",

The chancellor, George Osborne, announced a bumper pay increase in July, with the current \u00a36.50 minimum wage set to rise to \u00a37.20 for those aged over 25 from next April. The rate will grow steadily over the following four years to about \u00a39.35 an hour. Whitbread said on Tuesday it was developing plans to mitigate the \u201csubstantial cost increase\u201d and would announce details of its plans at its half-year results on 20 October. One of Britain\u2019s largest recruiters, Manpower, said in a report that the changes are sending shockwaves through the job market as employers seek ways to minimise the extra costs. Employers are attempting to avoid paying the new rate by using groups of self-employed workers or focusing recruitment on younger people, according to Manpower. Others had put a block on new recruitment altogether, it said. Manpower said its survey of 2,100 employers suggested many were scaling back recruitment plans for the rest of the year, with some blaming the new minimum pay rates . Whitbread said group like-for-like sales grew by 3.3% in the 11 weeks to 13 August, slowing from growth of 4.3% in its first quarter, though Whitbread said it remained on track to meet full-year expectations. Underlying sales at Premier Inn rose 4.3% in the period, compared with 6.3% first-quarter growth, with new openings helping total sales rise 11.6%. Total Costa sales grew 16.2%, with sales at UK stores open over a year up 4% against strong comparatives and softer than expected trade in August.",

      "bodyText": "China is planning a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism to prevent any further losses on its volatile stock markets. According to draft regulation, trading would be suspended for 30 minutes when the market rose or fell by 5%. If the index went up or down by 7% or more, trading would be suspended for the day. The mechanism could only be triggered once a day. \u201cCircuit breaker in both directions will be conducive to curbing excessive transactions and reining in market fluctuations,\u201d the draft from the securities regulator said. It is the latest in a string of measures introduced by the Chinese authorities as they continue to grapple with wild fluctuations in the share market, which have fallen by 40% since June. There were more jitters on Tuesday after figures showed that China\u2019s foreign trade dropped 9.7% in August. Customs data showed that exports for August were down 6.1% but imports fell a whopping 14.3%, raising more questions about the strength of the country\u2019s economy. In the first 8 months of this year, imports were down 14.6% while exports fell 1.6%. However, Shanghai\u2019s Composite index recovered from a poor start on Tuesday and was up more than 2% in afternoon trading. The Shenzhen Component index and Hang Seng in Hong Kong were also up strongly. In Japan, the Nikkei index closed down 2.43% while the Kospi index settled at 0.24% in Korea. It was a better day in Australia where the S&amp;P/ASX200 closed up 1.69% at 5,115 points on news of possible takeovers in the energy sector. According to Tuesday\u2019s draft plan, the circuit-breaker mechanism would help prevent \u201cexcessive reactions of investors\u201d. China\u2019s stock market investors are mostly individual investors which can lead to panic selling. Yang Delong, chief strategy analyst at the Southern Fund, said the idea showed \u201cthe government\u2019s good intentions\u201d. \u201cThe introduction of the circuit-breaker aims at preventing future market plunges and stabilising the market. The A-share market has seen violent plunges recently, and with the circuit breaker mechanism investors would have a cooling period before taking irrational actions.\u201d The stock exchanges were soliciting public opinions on the plan and the public have until 21 September to comment. In another bid to stabilise the markets, it was announced that Chinese investors who hold their stock for over a year will be exempt from a 5% dividend tax. The ministry of finance said in a joint statement with the taxation authority and the securities regulator on Monday that if investors sold a stock after holding it for a month or less, they would be liable for a 20% payment of income tax on the dividend they receive. Investors who held a stock for between one month and a year would pay a 10% to encourage long-term investment instead of the short selling of stocks. On Sunday, China\u2019s securities regulator said that the country\u2019s stock markets had stabilised and that market transactions are now normal for the most part. In a comment to the state news agency Xinhua, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said: \u201cGains on the stock market had been too rapid and large, forming stock market bubbles, therefore subsequent plunges and adjustments were inevitable.\u201d Additional reporting by Luna Lin",
