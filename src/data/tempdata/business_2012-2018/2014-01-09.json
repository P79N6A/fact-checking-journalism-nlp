      "bodyText": "A wave of gloom swept over the high street as three of the UK's biggest retailers admitted that profits would be hit by poor Christmas sales. Tesco, Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer all blamed heavy discounting, a squeeze on shoppers' spending power and unseasonal autumn weather for falling underlying sales and lower than hoped for profit margins. The barrage of poor figures also highlighted a changing retail world in which shoppers are increasingly purchasing online and buying their groceries in small convenience stores or at discounters such as Aldi or Lidl. IGD, the grocery industry research group, said that 50% of shoppers bought something in a food discounter in December. Sales have gone into reverse at large out of town stores as shoppers increasingly choose to buy little and often close to home, which helps cut down on waste and save petrol. Shares in Morrisons sank nearly 8% to 234p as the Bradford-based chain surprised the City, bringing forward its Christmas trading update and warning profits would be at the bottom end of City forecasts. The update showed a dramatic 5.6% decline in sales at established branches in the crucial six weeks to 5 January. The supermarket blamed a variety of factors for its dire performance, from shoppers choosing to spend more at discounters to its lack of an online grocery service, too few convenience stores and poor IT systems, which left it struggling to fight increasingly sophisticated promotions from rivals. The drop came despite help from food inflation and a 0.5% boost to underlying sales as a result of Morrisons opening its stores on Boxing Day and New Year's Day for the first time. Its chief executive, Dalton Philips, said about half the fall in sales was linked to shoppers choosing to spend more money at discounters' stores than ever before at Christmas. \"People are being economically squeezed so they are not trading up and they are splitting their shopping basket among different stores,\" he said. \"They have been buying their confectionery from one store and their wine from another store this year. It's a big shift.\" Tesco, Britain's biggest supermarket chain, also revealed worse-than-expected Christmas sales, down by 2.4% in the UK, when gains from new space and petrol sales were excluded . \"Clearly Christmas was disappointing,\" said its chief executive, Philip Clarke. The retailer admitted that profits would come in as much as \u00a3150m below expectations set only last month after a tough end to the year. Clarke said online and convenience store revenue had risen, but the group's out-of-town superstores had suffered falling sales. He said: \"It's tough because the market is tough and consumers are still feeling they don't have as much to spend.\" He said Tesco had taken action to limit price increases in the past six weeks and hinted that the company's profit margin of 5.2%, previously seen as a line in the sand, might come down. Tesco and Morrisons performed markedly worse than rival Sainsbury's, but all have been battered by the discounters. Andrew Stevens, a retail analyst at Verdict Research, said the poor performance of the major grocers put the strength of Britain's economic recovery in doubt. He added: \"The emergence of discounters as a bigger threat than many anticipated has meant the UK's largest grocers have emerged into 2014 with battle scars and nothing much to show for the fight.\" M&amp;S said it had suffered its 10th quarter of declining like-for-like clothing and homewares sales, and it is now three years since the chain has seen underlying growth in its general merchandise business. It was forced into almost unprecedented discounting on key seasonal items such as knitwear in the week before Christmas. The poor sales came despite chief executive Marc Bolland's efforts to revamp clothing with a new management team, refurbished stores and huge investment in IT and logistics operations. Bolland blamed unusually warm weather in October for the underlying sales fall and improved business in the final weeks before Christmas, helped by big discounts, could not make up the lost ground. He accused other retailers of kicking off a price war in December, forcing M&amp;S to offer discounts of up to 30% on clothing in the week before Christmas Day. Rival Debenhams unveiled a profit warning last week after it discounted aggressively in the runup to Christmas, although clothing and homewares store Next \u2013 which refused to join in the price-cutting until Boxing Day \u2013 had a strong festive season . Total UK sales rose 1.5%, helped by a 1.6% rise in underlying sales of food, as M&amp;S took a bigger share of the market over the festive season. But even the increase in M&amp;S food sales was less than City analysts had expected. Finance director Alan Stewart said: \"Clearly our food business was a winner and had a very strong performance. Market expectations were higher but that was because it was a bit of a surprise that the market as a whole got worse.\" Analysts said there was a sense of relief that trading hadn't been worse, but still trimmed their profit forecasts by about \u00a320m to an average of \u00a3630m \u2013 down from \u00a31bn in 2008. The poor Christmas trading figures are not helpful for the bosses of Morrisons, Tesco and M&amp;S who are all under pressure to revive their businesses amid heavy competition in a tough and rapidly changing market. All three yesterday insisted they had the right strategy in place and merely needed more time. Bolland, whose position at the top of M&amp;S has been questioned by some shareholders for several months, said: \"We are [heading] in the right direction. It is hard to get there but I take every quarter on the chin if need be because the company needs to go in the direction it is going.\" But Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said the retailers could not blame their woes entirely on problems in the market. \"I don't buy into the idea that all the factors were outside their control.\" He pointed to the success of Aldi and Lidl as well as Waitrose, the Co-op and M&amp;S's food over Christmas. Convenience store group Nisa also revealed strong Christmas sales, up 15.3% in December on the previous year. Mike Dennis, an analyst at Cantor, said Tesco's performance was particularly poor given that, 21 months into a \u00a31bn turnaround plan, it had introduced a new price matching promotion, refurbished more than 100 stores and given a high-profile relaunch to its premium food range, Tesco Finest. \"Our view is that management still has a lot of explaining to do over the poor relative UK sales performance,\" he said. \"Tesco has been unable to differentiate itself from the competition.\" Marks &amp; Spencer Christmas sales update: Food: +1.6% Fashion and home: -2.1% Chief executive: Marc Bolland, since 2010 Turnover 2013: \u00a310bn Profit 2013: \u00a3580m Stockmarket value: \u00a37.2bn Share price: 465p The problems: \u2022 Fashions don't appeal to enough shoppers \u2022 Aging customers \u2022 IT and distribution behind the times \u2022 Food is doing well, but Christmas sales were below City expectations as shoppers watched their spending Tesco Christmas sales update: UK supermarkets: -2.4% Chief executive: Philip Clarke (since 2011) Turnover 2013: \u00a365bn (worldwide) Profit 2013: \u00a33.7bn Stockmarket value: \u00a326.5bn Share price 325p The problems: \u2022 Shopping habits changing rapidly: customers deserting big stores for convenience shops and going online \u2022 Losing cash-strapped customers to discounters \u2022 Stores need a makeover \u2022 Numerous problems with overseas stores too Morrisons Christmas sales update: -5.6% Chief executive: Dalton Philips (since 2010) Turnover 2013: \u00a318bn Profit 2013: \u00a3897m Stockmarket value: \u00a36bn Share price: 233p The problems: \u2022 Late into online grocery shopping (starts Friday) \u2022 Late into convenience stores - Morrisons only has 85, compared to 1,500 Tesco Express outlets \u2022 Very limited non-food ranges \u2022 No clear position in the market",

Shares in Britain's two biggest betting chains dropped by 7% and 9% respectively on Thursday after the prime minister promised he would \"get to grips\" with problem gambling. Cameron said he \"absolutely shares the concerns\" raised by Ed Miliband over the \"epidemic\" of fixed-odds betting terminals. The machines, which have been dubbed the \"crack cocaine of gambling\" by campaigners, are a major moneyspinner for gambling companies. They account for around \u00a31.6bn of the industry's in-store takings of \u00a33bn, according to research group Mintel. Labour lost a Commons motion calling for local councils to be given more powers to limit the high stakes fruit machines, but Cameron said the government would make an announcement after the publication of a key report into the issue. \"There are problems with the betting and gambling industry and we need to look at them,\" Cameron said on Wednesday. \"If we work together we can probably sort it out.\" Analysts at Barclays downgraded their recommendations on both William Hill and Ladbrokes, warning that the \"negative news-flow will weigh on the sector\". \"Regulatory change has always been the key driver of sentiment toward the gambling sector,\" Barclays said in note. Barclays estimates that Ladbrokes has the greatest dependence on FOBTs. Terminals account for around 40% of the company's earnings, compared with 26% for William Hill before interest and tax, the bank said.",

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank sent the euro tumbling on world markets after it warned that the 18-member currency zone may need further support to prevent a Japanese-style period of stagnation. The ECB president, Mario Draghi, said persistently high unemployment, falling inflation and difficult lending conditions were harming the recovery, and the ECB stood ready to use all the tools available to maintain confidence and growth. Speaking as the central bank kept interest rates at 0.25% on Thursday, he said the ECB would consider printing money as well as other measures should there be a further deterioration in the availability of credit or another drop in inflation. \"The governing council strongly emphasises that it will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for as long as necessary,\" he said. The warning came as the UK economy appeared to be moving strongly in the opposite direction and concerns that it will soon overheat. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee kept base interest rates steady at 0.5% at its January meeting but an increasing number of analysts called on the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, to prepare for a rate rise as early as the summer. Carney has signalled his intention to keep rates at ultra-low levels until the recovery is assured, which Threadneedle Street believes will be mid-2015 at the earliest. But the unexpectedly sharp rise in gross domestic product over the last year and the speed with which employers are adding jobs has convinced many economists that rates should rise earlier. Recruitment agencies reported that job creation surged in December. Pay rates for new staff also rose at the fastest pace for six years, according to a survey by Markit for the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation and KPMG. The survey data suggested that unemployment will continue to drop sharply, possibly falling through the Bank's 7% unemployment rate threshold in early 2014, and that a return to real wages growth is in sight this year. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief European economist, said the Bank's forecast for unemployment to fall to 7% late this year already looked out of date. Wage rises, however, remained well below the 2.1% inflation rate, rising at 0.9% a year in November. Britain's booming economy still remains 2% below its peak and manufacturing, which the government has promoted and is which growing strongly, is 9% below levels in 2008. But over the last year it has outstripped rivals to be one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world. Draghi said a Japanese-style period of stagnation that brings with it falling prices and a decline in consumer demand has yet to arrive, but the ECB must be ready to play a part in boosting confidence in the financial system and broader eurozone economy. \"Right now, we don't see deflation,\" he said. \"By and large we don't see a deflation in the Japanese sense of the 1990s.\" France has become a major worry for eurozone policymakers after figures for December appeared to show it slipping back into recession. Greece's industrial slump has also deepened and unemployment reached a record high, according to data yesterday, highlighting the ravages of a six-year recession even as the debt-laden economy shows tentative signs of a recovery elsewhere. The jobless rate rose slightly to a record 27.8% in October while industrial output contracted in November for a fifth consecutive month, by 6.1%. Nevertheless, Draghi said confidence was gradually returning to the eurozone economy and the central bank's very accommodative monetary policy stance was finally finding its way into the real economy. He stopped short of saying the eurozone crisis is over. \"The recovery is there but it's weak, it's modest and as I said many times, it's fragile, meaning that there are several risks, from financial to economic to geopolitical to political risks, that could undermine easily this recovery,\" he said.",

Like for like sales slid 5.6% in the 6 weeks to January and highlighted the catching up this particular food retailer has to do in catching up its peers in the on-line space as well as the smaller convenience stores that seem to be appearing with increasing regularity on our high streets from&#xa0;<strong>Tesco</strong>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<strong>Sainsbury</strong>. A price downgrade from Panmure Gordon hasn\u2019t helped its cause either.</p> <p><strong>Marks and Spencer\u2019s&#xa0;</strong>food offering has once again come to its rescue, while its general merchandising operation once again showed a fall in like for like sales, the tenth quarter in a row we\u2019ve seen a decline here. While CEO Mr Bolland appears to have the confidence of a lot of the major shareholders for now, the fact that we are almost three years in to the company\u2019s turnaround plan will raise some major concerns from other shareholders who don\u2019t seem to see any silver lining on this side of the business. Nevertheless the shares have rebounded to the top of the FTSE100 on relief that the numbers weren\u2019t as bad as was feared initially after the heavy discounting seen in the pre-Christmas trading period, and an&#xa0;<strong>upgrade to \u201cbuy\u201d from Investec.</strong></p> <p><strong>Tesco</strong>&#xa0;continues to get squeezed from above and below by smaller peers like Waitrose and Marks and Spencer in the premier part of the food space, while also feeling the effects from the budget side in the form of Lidl and Aldi. The problem being the number one grocer in the UK is that you find that you have to run that little bit faster simply to stand still and for now it is even struggling to do that, particularly at a time when consumers are much more cash conscious.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52cec8c1e4b0cdc977609d57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-09T16:11:47.948Z\">4.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is on track to close at its lowest level of the year.

Wages are rising too slowly, and inflation is not a problem, Kern argues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWhile the decision to hold interest rates and QE was widely expected, it is concerning that there is increased clamour in the media and among some city analysts for an early increase in interest rates. We believe that the MPC\u2019s forward guidance strategy continues to be beneficial for UK businesses. Although economic growth is stronger than most people envisaged a few months ago, there is still no evidence that the time is ripe to tighten policy, given that earnings are below 1% and inflation at just over 2%.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the MPC has not issued an accompanying statement, it has said in the past that the 7% threshold is not a target and is unlikely to trigger early interest rate rises. Businesses are also concerned with inflation, so the MPC must remain committed to its 2% target. It is important to avoid premature steps that could snuff out the recovery before it is on firmer ground.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Kern may be thinking of this well-argued piece in the FT by Chris Giles:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9bde12ca-77ba-11e3-807e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2pnvjxoz4\">It is time for Carney to consider raising interest rates</a></h2> <p>In it, the FT's economics editor explains how Carney's forward guidance may be unravelling, given the surprising recovery in the jobless rate since it was introduced.&#xa0;Here's a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Carrying on regardless of the data is no way to run monetary policy.

They have largely reacted by trying to copy the competition \u2013 for instance discounting products because others have, or offering product lines which don\u2019t match their core image.</p> <p>They have also ignored basic consumer psychology by discounting in the lead up to Christmas. One of the basic rules of consumer behaviour is that people are willing to pay far more before Christmas than afterwards. This is partially due to what psychologists call hyperbolic discounting \u2013 the willingness to pay more now than to have to wait and pay less later. By copying competitors and discounting too quickly, the retailers were not able to take advantage of this very profitable quirk of consumer psychology.</p> <p>The big companies have been resting on their laurels. This means while they are trying to change things around the fringe, they may have overlooked the reason that customers go to them in the first place \u2013 for good value in the case of Tesco or for quality in the case of M&amp;S.</p> <p>Finally, these retailers have not made enough out of their large chain of stores. Successful retailers like John Lewis use their stores not just as a space to shift goods, but as a place which communicates their core messages and reinforces their values. This means consumers can go there for information and to look at goods, and then order online. In contrast, going into the average Tesco is a depressing experience most people avoid if they can.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-09T10:17:04.002Z\">at 10.17am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52ce770be4b0d6d0996582fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-09T10:16:47.955Z\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/421222529139617792\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Grecovery&amp;src=hash\">#Grecovery</a> theme gets yet another set back as industrial production falls by 6.1% on a year ago <a href=\"http://t.co/xUtrI3gxGr\">http://t.co/xUtrI3gxGr</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Greece&amp;src=hash\">#Greece</a></p>&mdash; Shaun Richards (@notayesmansecon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/421222529139617792\">January 9, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52ce7417e4b0d6d0996582fa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-09T10:10:03.423Z\">10.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone economic confidence rises</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-618a3e22-1d23-42a5-9477-a7a9f14a86a4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389263310535/5f463c9b-982e-4892-81b1-85044bfce96f-460x242.png\" alt=\"EU and eurozone economic confidence\" width=\"460\" height=\"242\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: EC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is Europe turning the corner?&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Economic confidence in the eurozone rose in December, according to an European Commission survey just released.

      "bodyText": "And that's all until the morning. A reminder of the key points: \u2022 European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi has warned that the eurozone crisis not over, given the weak recovery and record unemployment levels. Faced with weak inflation, the ECB strengthened its forward guidance, promising \"firmly\" to keep monetary policy accommodative for as long as needed. At a sometimes light-hearted press conference, Draghi also warned that inflation will remain below target for at least the next two years and promised to take further action if needed to stimulate the economy. See 3.15pm for a full round-up. \u2022 Earlier the ECB, and the Bank of England, had both decided to leave interest rates unchanged and also not launch any fresh stimulus programmes. \u2022 Some economists believe the BoE will soon have to raise rates, but business leaders say it should stick to its position that the UK economy is too weak. \u2022 Over in France, the audit office head has warned that its national debt is at danger levels \u2022 While in the UK, Morrisons and Tesco have emerged as clear losers from the Christmas trading period. Marks &amp; Spencer reported that clothing sales had tumbled again, but got a better reception from the City. There's a round-up here. while full coverage of how the news broke at 7am starts here, and there's an explanation of what went wrong here. \u2022 Greece's unemployment rate hit a new record high. \u2022 Ireland's borrowing costs have fallen below the UK's Goodnight, and thanks for the comments (as ever!). GW European stock markets have closed, and the big three indices all ended in the red. In Britain, Morrisons dragged the FTSE 100 index down, while the French market was hit by the warning over its national debt levels (see previous post). FTSE 100: down 30 points at 6691, -0.45% German DAX: down 76 points at 9421, -0.8% French CAC: down 35 points at 4225, -0.8% Spanish IBEX: down 19 points at 10234, - 0.19% Italian FTSE MIB: up 66 points at 19503, +0.34% David Madden, market analyst at IG, says Mario Draghi's more serious comments also hit optimism in the City: Equities drifted lower as Mario Draghi fails to convince the market that he can save the eurozone from sinking into the abyss..... Mr Draghi tried to reassure the market he has a few cards up his sleeve, but actions speak louder than words. And we didn't get much action today. The head of France's national audit office has added to the growing pressure on Francois Hollande by warning that the country's debt levels are approaching the danger zone. Didier Migaud said in a speech that the French national debt hit 93.4% of GDP, warning: \"The level that's been reached has put our country in a danger zone. \"Efforts undertaken so far are not sufficient to get out.\" Migaud, president of the independent Cour des Comptes body, also warned that France will face higher borrowing costs when the economic recovery picks up. Reuters has the full story: France's national debt stood at 90.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2012. The government expects the debt burden to peak this year at 95.1 percent of GDP. \"What wasn't done in 2011, 2012 and 2013 only adds to the extra distance that will have to be travelled in the coming years,\" Migaud said. \"This extra distance won't be the least demanding - quite the contrary.\" Despite the growing debt mountain, French bonds, which are among the most liquid in the world, have found firm demand from investors seeking richer yields than those offered on their low-risk German equivalents.Yet even though France benefits from low borrowing costs, servicing France's debt costs the state about \u20ac50bn ($68bn) annually, equivalent to about 2.5% of national output. Migaud said a one percentage point increase in interest rates would add 2 billion euros to the state's debt service costs in the first year and \u20ac15bn in the tenth year afterwards. Despite record levels of debt, France enjoyed its lowest borrowing costs on record last year with an average interest rate of only 1.54% on its medium and long-term debt issued in 2013. In its first bond auction of the year, France sold \u20ac8.3bn of long-term debt on Thursday, drawing strong investor demand. President Francois Hollande's Socialist government plans to make savings of \u20ac15bn this year with \u20ac9bn coming from the central state and 6 billion euros from the social security system. Migaud said that the priority should be on making savings in social services, describing France as unique among European countries for the deficits its social welfare system has consistently run over the last 20 years. Worth noting that economists disagree about what stage a national debt becomes unsustainable, especially after errors were found in the well-known research paper by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. We started the day with unexpectedly bad news from Morrisons, weak sales from Tesco and another quarter of falling clothing sales at M&amp;S. The day ends with Morrisons leading the FTSE 100 fallers (down almost 8%), M&amp;S topping the risers (+3%) and Tesco down around 1.2%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sums up the day: The opportunism of Morrisons in trying to slip out its bad news at the same time as Tesco and M&amp;S appears to have backfired spectacularly as its shares got pummelled lower to levels last seen in October 2008. Like for like sales slid 5.6% in the 6 weeks to January and highlighted the catching up this particular food retailer has to do in catching up its peers in the on-line space as well as the smaller convenience stores that seem to be appearing with increasing regularity on our high streets from Tesco and Sainsbury. A price downgrade from Panmure Gordon hasn\u2019t helped its cause either. Marks and Spencer\u2019s food offering has once again come to its rescue, while its general merchandising operation once again showed a fall in like for like sales, the tenth quarter in a row we\u2019ve seen a decline here. While CEO Mr Bolland appears to have the confidence of a lot of the major shareholders for now, the fact that we are almost three years in to the company\u2019s turnaround plan will raise some major concerns from other shareholders who don\u2019t seem to see any silver lining on this side of the business. Nevertheless the shares have rebounded to the top of the FTSE100 on relief that the numbers weren\u2019t as bad as was feared initially after the heavy discounting seen in the pre-Christmas trading period, and an upgrade to \u201cbuy\u201d from Investec. Tesco continues to get squeezed from above and below by smaller peers like Waitrose and Marks and Spencer in the premier part of the food space, while also feeling the effects from the budget side in the form of Lidl and Aldi. The problem being the number one grocer in the UK is that you find that you have to run that little bit faster simply to stand still and for now it is even struggling to do that, particularly at a time when consumers are much more cash conscious. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is on track to close at its lowest level of the year. It's down 31 points, or 0.5%, in late trading, dragged down by Morrison (-8% after its mini profit warning this morning). ING's Carsten Brzeski says that the European Central Bank has \" stepped up its verbal power, stressing its determination to act again\" at today's press conference. He also explains the different stimulus measures which the ECB could take: In our view, it looks as if the ECB is trying to build a tailor-made toolbox with different tools for different situations. In our view, there are three main triggers for further ECB action in the coming months: i) unwarranted money market tightening; ii) a faltering of the recovery; and iii) a stronger euro exchange rate. Obviously, these three factors would have a deflationary impact on the Eurozone economy. Tackling these three problems would indeed require different instruments: (conditional) liquidity for the money market, funding for lending and/or QE for the economy and a negative deposit rate for the exchange rate (or a combination of all three). Well, that was entertaining. European Central Bank watchers sometimes joke about whether good Good Mario or Bad Mario will turn up to the monthly press conference. Occasionally we get Super Mario - notably after the ECB single-handedly calmed the eurozone crisis with his OMT bond-buying programme. Today we were treated to Merry Mario, joking about the difference between perverse and perverted, and happily declaring that the ECB can't run out of money. But beyond the levity, the message from the ECB is that inflation is going to lurk below its 2% target for at least the next two years. That's why the central bank has \"firmly\" reiterated its pledge to keep accommodative monetary policies for some time. Here's the new guidance (emphasis mine): Against this background, the Governing Council strongly emphasises that it will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for as long as necessary, which will assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. Accordingly, we firmly reiterate our forward guidance that we continue to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. The other key points are Draghi's warning that the eurozone crisis is not over. Here's the key quote: \"I'd be very cautious about saying that, be very, very cautious... The recovery is there but it's weak, it's modest and as I said many times, it's fragile meaning that there are several risks from financial to economic to geopolitical to political risks that could undermine easily this recovery.\" And on the weak recovery, he warned: \"The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions.\" Other interesting points were Draghi's defence of Germany's trade surplus, arguing that attempting to rein in its exports would not help the rest of Europe. And his insistence that Europe is not repeating the mistakes that drove Japan into a deflationary spiral. But while Mario Draghi repeatedly said the ECB was ready to act, he didn't really explain what it might do. And finally, a question about whether any governing council members voted for an interest rate cut today. Draghi replies that the discussions focused on potential risks to the recovery. Back to serious stuff, with a question about the Asset Quality Review. Draghi says that these important new stress tests will treat eurozone government debt as risk-free -- as laid out under the Basel rules. There has been talk that the ECB is worried about those banks who have gorged themselves on their own sovereign debt. More levity in Frankfurt, after Mario Draghi is asked about his comments last month that Germans have a perverse fear of inflation. Draghi turns to dictionary corner, joking that \"there is a difference between perverse and perverted\" (take note, younger readers) Perverse, he says means \"persistent in error, different from what is reasonable\". And Draghi adds that he understands the concerns of savers and hopes they will share in the economic recovery which the ECB is striving for. A journalist asks whether the ECB can ever run out of money. Draghi gives a little chortle, and says that \"technically, no....we cannot run out of money\". So we have ample resources for coping with all our emergencies. Draghi insists that Europe is not plunging into a Japanese-style deflation crisis. He says the ECB's governing council asks itself \"are we close to Japan? And the asnwer is no, we are not, for several reasons\". Those reasons are: 1) The ECB took decisive action at a very early stage 2) The condition of bank balance sheets is not as bad as in the 1990s in Japan..and the asset quality review will help to build confidence and clean up bad debts 3) Inflation expectations are still firmly anchored -- people believe that inflation will come back Draghi just defended Germany's large trade surplus, and criticised those who say its strong exports are hurting the eurozone. Asked whether he agrees with US treasury Jack Lew that certain countries should do more to help their neighbours, Draghi cites a quote from Abraham Lincoln that you don't make the weak stronger by making the strong weaker. I have never understood the idea that making Germany weaker would make other countries in the eurozone stronger, or that undermining the elements that made Europe great would help its weaker members, he added. Asked about the prospect of the ECB publishing its minutes, Draghi says the Bank wants to be even more transparent. But not recklessly, so it is still reflecting on the issue. We must be the jealous guardians of the independence of our members, says Draghi, putting on his more serious face. The ECB has hardened its forward guidance precisely because the recovery is fragile, he adds. Is the eurozone crisis over, given the recent recovery in the bonds of Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece....? Draghi says NO. It is premature to say this crisis is over, he says. Look at the unemployment figures -- more than 12% of adults are out of work. The only good news is that the jobless rate has stopped rising in recent months, but it's too high. There is, finally, an economic recovery, but it is weak and fragile. It is vulnerable to risks. How long can the ECB put up with inflation below 1%? Draghi says that inflation will be on the low side of 2% for at least two years. We will act if we have reason to think the medium-term assessment has changed for the worse. On the drop in inflation in December, Draghi says it was generally expected, and partly due to technical changes in the German data. January's data won't be distorted, he adds. Claire Jones of the FT asks for more details on the instruments that the ECB could use -- could full-blown quantitative easing be used. Draghi merely reiterates that the ECB has a range of options. The euro has fallen to a one-year low against the pound after Mario Draghi's comments this afternoon -- it's down 0.24% at 82.33p. Mario Draghi's opening statement is online here: Introductory statement to the press conference And here's the section on forward guidance, in which the ECB hardened up its pledge to maintain accommodative monetary policy. The change is that this time, it uses the words \"strongly\" and \"firmly\": Against this background, the Governing Council strongly emphasises that it will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for as long as necessary, which will assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. Accordingly, we firmly reiterate our forward guidance that we continue to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. As previously stated, this expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. With regard to money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance, we are monitoring developments closely and are ready to consider all available instruments. Overall, we remain determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation and to take further decisive action if required. (here's December's statement, for comparison) The WSJ wants details of the instruments which the ECB could use -- Draghi says that everything permitted by EU treaties is on the table. Onto questions: The ECB changed the wording of its comments about forward guidance on interest rates - have they hardened it up? YES, Mario Draghi replies. We have strengthened our forward guidance to address two issues, the signs of tightening in the short-term money markets, and the worsening inflation outlook in the medium term, he explains. That's what our firmer language is addressing. An ongoing tightening of money market rates or worsening of inflation outlook could force us to act, he added. He adde that the ECB would consider \"all possible instruments\" to tackle these to contingencies . Loan dynamics remain weak, Draghi adds, due to the business cycle, the task of balance sheet adjustment, and credit risks.... On inflation (which fell last month). Draghi suggests that the risks are 'broadly balanced' (commodity prices could push it up; weak growth could push it down). Inflation will remain around current levels for the coming months, he says. Francesco Papadia, a former ECB senior executive, says Draghi is warning the low inflation will remain for some time... Recent economic indicators have suggested a gradual recovery is continuing in the euro area, says Mario Draghi. There has also been an overall improvement in financial markets since summer 2012 (when Draghi dramatically changed the landscape by promising to do whatever it takes to defend the euro) The ECB stands ready to take \"further decisive action\" if needed, says Draghi: Mario Draghi reiterates the ECB's forward guidance, that it expects to maintain a high degree of accommodative monetary policy for some time - ie, rates will remain at their present or lower levels. Mario Draghi looks pretty upbeat as he reads out the ECB's statement. He explains that the governing council left interest unchanged because the latest economic conditions back up its view of the state of the eurozone economy. Underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued.... monetary and credit dynamics remain subdued...inflation expectations are firmly anchored. Such a constellation suggests we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, before then rising towards the ECB's target of close to, but below 2%. And we're off -- Mario Draghi begins by welcoming Latvia to the eurozone (it joined at midnight on January 1st) The European Central Bank press conference is about to start in Frankfurt - it's being streamed live here, and also on Bloomberg TV. And with the ECB sitting on its hands this month, Nomura economist Nick Matthews reckons president Mario Draghi will reiterate that it could act if needed, at this afternoon's press conference. He said: We expect President Draghi to continue to emphasise that the ECB is ready and able to act if required,\" We also expect the ECB to say there are a number of instruments available, though we do not expect them to single out any one at this stage. Carl Astorri, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, has welcomed the Bank of England's decision to leave rates unchanged: \u201cWith unemployment still above the 7% threshold given by forward guidance, today\u2019s decision by the Bank of England to maintain rates at 0.5% came as no surprise. However, it will not be long until the threshold is reached, so the MPC will soon have to reassess its approach to forward guidance, probably as early as next month\u2019s Inflation Report. \u201cAlthough the recovery is strengthening and unemployment is falling, it is still too soon to raise rates. There are only very tentative signs that the recovery is broadening out towards exports and business investment and the MPC will want to see both on a surer footing before it moves. And with inflation belatedly falling back, it has time to let this happen.\u201d ING economist Carsten Brzeski points out that the European Central Bank rarely changes monetary policy at its first meeting of the year: The European Central Bank has also voted to leave borrowing costs unchanged across the eurozone at their current record lows. The headline rate remains at 0.25% The deposit facility rate (what it pays banks on their deposits at the ECB) remains at 0.0% The marginal lending rate (what banks pay to borrow overnight from the ECB) remains at 0.75% Mario Draghi, the ECB president, will give a press conference at 1.30pm GMT to explain the decision to the Frankfurt press pack. (if you like the picture above - you'll love this: European Central Bank graffiti - in pictures) Next up, the European Central Bank's interest rate decision, in 9 minutes time.... Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank reckons the Bank of England should quietly abandon its forward guidance on interest rates, having been caught out by the recovery in the UK unemployment market. Wood writes: The BoE seems to be leaving it until the February Inflation Report (12 February) to decide what to do with guidance. It today left policy on hold and did not issue a statement. The BoE has sounded very dovish over the past few months. But business surveys are booming and signal tightening capacity. Unemployment will likely fall to the 7.0% threshold in the next couple of months. When the BoE initially introduced guidance, less than six months ago, it saw only a 50% chance of unemployment reaching 7.0% by mid-2016. In our view, the BoE should now let forward guidance wither. Changing the target to 6.5% would make \"a mockery\" of the whole process, he adds, concluding that UK interest rates will probably rise in around a year's time: Wages are weak now, but the labour market is tightening fast and recruitment difficulties are showing up. A housing boom is forming, and the BoE\u2019s credit rationing tools are unlikely to be able to control that forever. We expect the first rate hike in Q1 2015. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is worried that pressure is mounting on the Bank of England to raise rates earlier than it has indicated. He has urged Governor Carney and crew to stick to their guns --that the UK economy is too weak to handle a rate rise. Wages are rising too slowly, and inflation is not a problem, Kern argues: \u201cWhile the decision to hold interest rates and QE was widely expected, it is concerning that there is increased clamour in the media and among some city analysts for an early increase in interest rates. We believe that the MPC\u2019s forward guidance strategy continues to be beneficial for UK businesses. Although economic growth is stronger than most people envisaged a few months ago, there is still no evidence that the time is ripe to tighten policy, given that earnings are below 1% and inflation at just over 2%. \u201cAlthough the MPC has not issued an accompanying statement, it has said in the past that the 7% threshold is not a target and is unlikely to trigger early interest rate rises. Businesses are also concerned with inflation, so the MPC must remain committed to its 2% target. It is important to avoid premature steps that could snuff out the recovery before it is on firmer ground.\u201d Kern may be thinking of this well-argued piece in the FT by Chris Giles: It is time for Carney to consider raising interest rates In it, the FT's economics editor explains how Carney's forward guidance may be unravelling, given the surprising recovery in the jobless rate since it was introduced. Here's a flavour: Carrying on regardless of the data is no way to run monetary policy. Instead, the BoE should be true to its word and undertake a thorough consideration of a rate rise alongside its quarterly forecasts in its February inflation report. Today's highly predictable decision means UK interest rates have been pegged at the current record low of 0.5% since March 2009. With the UK economy picking up, but unemployment still over Bank of England's 7% target, there was no chance of a rate rise today. The only frisson of excitement was whether governor Mark Carney would issue a statement to either reiterate his forward guidance (no rate rise while the jobless rate is over 7%) or to tweak it (perhaps scrubbing out 7% and writing 6.5% instead) He did neither. And that gave the pound a tiny lift (it's up 0.1% against the US dollar). Attention is now turning to Frankfurt -- where the European Central Bank will announce its own decision on monetary policy at 12.45 GMT. The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. Its Monetary Policy Committee also voted not to launch any additional stimulus measures, leaving its QE programme unchanged at \u00a3375bn. Not a surprise. And there's no statement from the BoE either. FastFT explains why Irish borrowing costs are now below the UK's: (see also our earlier post) Ireland's successful debt sale earlier this year has reinforced the belief that it is firmly on the mend, pushing its bond yields lower and lower. The UK's economic tidings are also markedly better, but that is leading investors to speculate that the Bank of England could raise interest rates as early as this year, and spurring many to pull money out of government bonds. Heads-up.... nearly time for the Bank of England's monthly decision on monetary policy. The BoE isn't expected to make any changes to interest rates or its QE bond-buying programme, of course.... One for the history books -- Ireland's borrowing costs have fallen below Britain's today, as the Republic continued to return to normality after its bailout programme. It's now very slightly cheaper for Dublin to borrow for five years than for London, according to the price at which five-year bonds were changing hands today. Quite a moment -- at a time when the borrowing costs of other eurozone countries has also fallen to much lower rates. For example, Spanish 10-year bonds are yielding just 3.7% -- have flirted with the 'danger zone' above 7% in the summer of 2012. The UK's equivalent 10-year bonds are yielding almost 3%. This latest record high in Greek unemployment is a slap in the face for the country's prime minister, argues crisis watcher Yiannis Mouzakis. Antonis Samaras has insisted that the Greek economy will finally pull out of recession in 2014, but it's unclear whether that will deliver any balm to the labour market. Data released yesterday showed that the eurozone jobless rate has been stuck at 12.1% since last spring, even though its economy has been growing ever since. Greece's jobless rate jumped more sharply in October if you don't adjust for seasonal factors (ie the decline in tourism in October), as this graph shows: Greece's unemployment agony has plumbed new depths, the day after Athens proudly took on the EU presidency amid much talk about how the eurozone crisis was easing. Elstat has announced that the Greek unemployment rate climbed to 27.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in October 2013. September's rate has also been revised higher, to 27.7% (from 27.4%). In October there 3,597,779 people in work,1,387,520 out of work, and a further 3,360,513 classed as inactive. Greece's long-running austerity programme has driven unemployment across the country soaring -- up by 200% since the financial crisis began, as this chart shows: The youth unemployment rate remains particularly awful - it's now 57.9%, up from 56% a year ago. With Greece's industrial production falling by 6.1% in November, there's no sign in today's data that the much-heralded Greek recovery has kicked off. Today's EC economic sentiment data (see here) also shows that confidence is returning to the weaker parts of the eurozone, flags up Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole: All the data's here, by the way. My colleague Sarah Butler has analysed Tesco's unimpressive Christmas trading figures - here's her story: Tesco admitted on Thursday that its profits would come in as much as \u00a3150m below expectations set down only last month after a tough end to the year for mainstream grocery retailers. Britain's biggest supermarket chain revealed a worse than expected 2.4% fall in sales excluding petrol at stores open for more than a year in the six weeks to 4 January. Underlying sales continued to fall in all Tesco's major overseas markets, contributing to a fall of 2.8% in like-for-like sales for the group over the period. Analysts had expected sales to fall by up to 2%. Tesco warns profits will be lower than expected as Christmas sales disappoint Back to this morning's Christmas turkeys rading figures. Andre Spicer, Professor of Organisational Behaviour at Cass Business School, has criticised the likes of M&amp;S, Tesco and Morrisons for making four big mistakes. He says they are guilty of copying the competition, ignoring basic consumer psychology, resting on their laurels and not making enough of their retail foot print. Spicer writes: The big retailers which announced disappointing results today find themselves caught in a disappearing middle \u2013 between higher end retailers like John Lewis and discounters like Aldi. They have largely reacted by trying to copy the competition \u2013 for instance discounting products because others have, or offering product lines which don\u2019t match their core image. They have also ignored basic consumer psychology by discounting in the lead up to Christmas. One of the basic rules of consumer behaviour is that people are willing to pay far more before Christmas than afterwards. This is partially due to what psychologists call hyperbolic discounting \u2013 the willingness to pay more now than to have to wait and pay less later. By copying competitors and discounting too quickly, the retailers were not able to take advantage of this very profitable quirk of consumer psychology. The big companies have been resting on their laurels. This means while they are trying to change things around the fringe, they may have overlooked the reason that customers go to them in the first place \u2013 for good value in the case of Tesco or for quality in the case of M&amp;S. Finally, these retailers have not made enough out of their large chain of stores. Successful retailers like John Lewis use their stores not just as a space to shift goods, but as a place which communicates their core messages and reinforces their values. This means consumers can go there for information and to look at goods, and then order online. In contrast, going into the average Tesco is a depressing experience most people avoid if they can. Is Europe turning the corner? Economic confidence in the eurozone rose in December, according to an European Commission survey just released. It hit 100 last month, up from 98.4 in November, a stronger reading than expected. Consumers are less worried too -- with the consumer sentiment index up to minus 13.6, from minus 15.4 in November. However, separate data suggests that Greece's factories still haven't hit bottom. Industrial production was down by 6.1% year-on-year in November. Although British firms exported more to Germany, France and the Netherlands in November, there was no improvement in exports to China: And as this graph shows, Britain's trade gap actually deteriorated as the economy recovered last summer: The ONS data is here (pdf). UK firms exported an extra \u00a3600m of goods to its fellow EU members in November. They sold an extra \u00a3500m into Britain, taking EU imports to a record high. The ONS said:. In November 2013, exports of goods to countries within the European Union (EU) increased by \u00a30.6 billion to \u00a312.8 billion. Over the same period imports from the EU increased by \u00a30.5 billion to \u00a319.2 billion, a record high. Just in: Britain's trade gap with the rest of the world has narrowed to its lowest level since August, but continues to show a large deficit. The UK's total trade balance in goods and services came in at -\u00a33.238 in November, down from October's -\u00a33.496. The good deficit (showing the value of physical goods crossing into and out of the UK) fell to \u00a39.44bn, from \u00a39.65bn, partly balanced out by a \u00a36.2bn surplus on services. Exports of goods to the EU rose , as the eurozone crisis eased. Details to follow.... Marc Bolland's upbeat talk this morning (he told Radio 4 that Marks' clothing operation is improving, and assured financial hacks that shareholders support him ) has reassured the City - M&amp;S shares are now up 3.5% this morning. The 0.2% drop in like-for-like sales in the last quarter wasn't as bad as some analyst had expected. Still, as the Indie's Simon Neville points out, M&amp;S is still battling to get its general merchandise arm performing as well as its food operation. Here's our news story on this morning's triple-whammy of retail news: Dire day for UK high street as retailers reveal poor Christmas trading Morrisons issues profit warning while Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer post worse-than-expected sales In other City news, Standard Chartered Bank has announced a surprise boardroom shake-up, with two senior executives leaving the Bank. Finance director, Richard Meddings, and the head of its consumer bank, Steve Bertamini, will depart by March and June respectively, as part of a restructuring that will merge its wholesale and consumer banking divisions. Meddings' departure is a particular surprise - he had been seen as a possible CEO in waiting.... Back to M&amp;S's conference call, where my colleague Sean Farrell tried to persuade Marc Bolland to name and shame the retailer who began the pre-Christmas discounting: D for Departing chief financial officer, perhaps...... Bolland also hailed the 4.1% jump in M&amp;S food sales over the last three months. Veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb says Morrison's will grab the attention after its unscheduled, poor, results today, but M&amp;S and Tesco have also disappointed: Poor old Dalton Phillips and Morrison\u2019s have grabbed the headlines today with a mini-profit warning, after terrible Xmas trading (which will provide some cover for the beleaguered Phil Clarke and Marc Bolland), but the fact is that full-year profit forecasts will be edging down on Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer as well, after poor Xmas trading. Regarding the \"mini-profit warning\" -- strictly speaking, its profits will be \"towards the bottom of the range\" of expectations, rather than missing them altogether. Marks &amp; Spencer CEO Marc Bolland has denied that it provoked the rash of discounting that swept the UK retail sector, in the run-up to Christmas. Bolland is making the comments on a conference call now -- claiming M&amp;S was less promotional than the rest of the market. M&amp;S's reaction included a one-day sale on clothing on the final Saturday before Christmas. Bolland is also telling the press pack that he has the full support of shareholder. My colleague Sean Farrell tweets: Morrisons and Tesco are among the big fallers on the FTSE 100, at the start of trading in London. Morrisons is being pummelled after its unexpected profit warning, with shares diving by over 5% to 239p. Tesco aren't far behind, down 3% at 318p, after reporting a 2.4% drop in UK sales over Christmas. Marks &amp; Spencer were down over 1%, but have now turned positive (up 0.3%). Its figures are the best of the three today (with sales down just 0.2% in the last quarter, and up 1% over Christmas). Shore Capital, the City firm, have downgraded Tesco from a \"buy\" to a \"hold\", after digesting this morning's Christmas statement. It warned that: We need more confidence in the robustness of Tesco\u2019s forecasts. We need to see stronger evidence of recovery in the UK. Without the above we cannot see the promise of strong FCF [free cash flow] generation, as anticipated and aspired, emerging. The headline (bad) number from Tesco this morning was that like-for-like sales in the UK were down 2.4% in the last six weeks. Its international division also struggled, with comparable sales sliding 2.8% Here's the UK performance in more detail: And here's how Reuters sums it up: Tesco, the world's third biggest retailer, posted another heavy drop in underlying sales in its main British market in the Christmas trading period, adding to pressure on management to end a run of poor results. The firm, which trails France's Carrefour and U.S. No. 1 Wal-Mart in annual sales, is 21 months into a turnaround plan for its main UK business that has seen over 1 billion pounds ($1.65 billion) invested in store revamps, more staff, new product ranges and pricing initiatives. Despite the changes the firm said on Thursday sales at British stores open over a year, excluding fuel and VAT sales tax, had fallen 2.4 percent in the six weeks to Jan. 4, towards the lower end of expectations. Analysts had forecast a range of down 0.5-2.5 percent and a third quarter decline of 1.5 percent. Tesco said it expected to report a full year group trading profit within the range of current market expectations, which it said ranged between 3.16 billion pounds and 3.41 billion pounds. Trading improved in Europe but remained difficult in Asia. \"We continued to invest in the most compelling offer for the tens of millions of customers who chose to shop with us this Christmas, but further weakness in the grocery market as a whole continued to impact our performance in the UK,\" Chief Executive Philip Clarke said. Financial analysts Company Watch have dubbed M&amp;S a \"Big deli selling occasional knickers\" after the high street chain reported strong food sales. Bryan Roberts, Kantar Retail's Insights Director, say it's \"more of the same\" from M&amp;S: Food continues to trundle on in an impressive fashion, no doubt benefitting from shoppers trading up over the festive period. General merchandise, however, struggles again, suffering from availability issues, hit and miss appeal, erratic and frustrating discounting and some frankly baffling marketing. There are some signs of green shoots of recovery in womenswear, but it is worth remembering that impressing London-based fashion journalists is a world away from winning the custom of busy, budget-conscious mums across the rest of the UK. Looks like M&amp;S did benefit from a late rush in Christmas shopping. General merchandise sales were up 1% in the eight weeks to Christmas Eve (although not enough, as Bolland admits, to hit its expectations for the quarter): Marks &amp; Spencer chief Marc Bolland has claimed that the company's general merchandise range is improving, after reporting another drop in clothing sales over the last three months. He told BBC Radio: The step-by-step approach to improve our general merchandise is slowly improving but we have always said that it will be step-by-step Our market share has been stabilised over the quarter and it has even been for womenswear slightly improved. City traders are preparing to punish M&amp;S and Morrisons following this morning's results, Bloomberg's Caroline Hyde flags up: You can see all three statements here: Morrisons Marks &amp; Spencer Tesco Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. A huge day for UK retailers has begun with a nasty profits warning from supermarket chain Morrisons, worse-than-expected sales figures from Tesco and another fall in clothing sales at Marks &amp; Spencer. Morrisons has shocked the City with an unexpected dose of gloom, rushing out its Christmas trading figures this morning. It's like-for-like sales slumped by 5.6% in the last six weeks -- which it is blaming on hard pressed consumers cutting back. The company's failure to nail its online shopping strategy over the last decade added to its woes. The City was already poised for weeks find out whether Tesco and M&amp;S had managed to defy tough trading conditions, and the initial picture is pretty poor. M&amp;S's clothing sales have fell by another 2.1% in the last thirteen weeks of 2013 - which is the 10th consecutive quarterly decline in a row. That took the shine right off a 1.6% rise in food sales, and dragged its overall like-for-like sales down by 0.2% in the last quarter. CEO Marc Bolland, who has been under fire for M&amp;S's performance, has already admitted that general merchandise sales were \" below our expectations\" And over at Tesco, the picture is no better. It's like-for-like sales fell by 2.4% in the last six weeks . Its CEO, Philip Clarke, said Tesco was suffering from further weakness in the grocery market as a whole continued to impact our performance in the UK. I'll be tracking all the details and reaction through the day, along with other key events....",

      "bodyText": "The role of commercial director of the much criticised public body overseeing the cleanup of Britain's old nuclear power stations has been axed amid a wider management shakeup. The exit of Sean Balmer, who has been at the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority for eight years, follows recent heavy criticism of the organisation's performance, particularly at Sellafield in Cumbria. John Clarke, the chief executive of the NDA, has scrapped the commercial director post and created three new positions on his executive team including one full-time job looking after Sellafield, the UK's largest atomic complex. The moves also follow the departure of the chief operating officer, Mark Lesinski, before Christmas and the planned exit at the end of March of the head of human resources, Jim McLaughlin. Clarke was subjected to ferocious criticism from politicians at a meeting of the Commons public accounts committee that expressed grave concerns over the estimated \u00a370bn cost to the taxpayer of work at Sellafield. The NDA boss appeared at before the committee alongside Tom Zarges, the boss of the NDA's private sector contractor Nuclear Management Partners (NMP) which has just been controversially reappointed to clean up Sellafield. Clarke insisted that the reappointment was the best way forward even though he admitted NMP had repeatedly failed to meet many of its targets, while Zarges said he was \"humbled and truly sorry\" for cost overruns and an expenses scandal. Clarke said the latest management changes would improve the performance of his organisation. \"It was always the case that the role of the NDA would change as the private sector takes a greater role in delivering our mission and it's important that the make-up of our executive team reflects that,\" he said. \"I'm confident that these changes will place us in good shape to face the challenges that lie ahead as we strive to accelerate the cleanup of the UK's nuclear legacy while delivering value for money for the taxpayer,\" he added. Clarke said that Peter Lutwyche, from Jacobs Engineering, would take on the Sellafield director role while David Vineall, from Tata Steel, would take over from McLaughlin in the spring. The NDA employs only 300 staff directly but is responsible for overseeing annual spending of over \u00a32bn on cleaning up the sites where nuclear power stations have ceased operation having come to the end of their working lives. The Sellafield facility, first used by the ministry of defence for making atom bombs, also includes Calder Hall which was Britain's first nuclear power plant, the THORP atomic fuel reprocessing plant and the Magnox nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.",

The pain is concentrated among the big-boy generalists in the middle, especially Tesco and Morrisons. Their out-of-town stores can't yet be described as white elephants but the grocery game has changed. All the growth in sales at big supermarket chains is coming via local convenience stores and home deliveries (fiddly for the retailer). All the decline is taking place in old-style big stores. Morrison's numbers illustrate the point. Without an online operation (it launches on Friday, with Ocado providing the mechanics) and with only a sprinkling of convenience stores, like-for-like sales plunged 5.6% in the Christmas quarter. Subtract price inflation of about 2.5% and the volume of goods being shifted by Morrisons is about 8% lighter than last Christmas, which was itself regarded a washout. The amazing part, though, is that chief executive Dalton Philips had warmed up his shareholders to expect improvement. Back in November, he forecast a return to like-for-like sales growth in Christmas quarter. That's an almighty miss \u2013 thus the profits warning and the 7.5% fall in Morrisons' share price. There is a long list of supplementary explanations, like Morrisons' lack of a smart loyalty scheme, but the basic fact is that the mass-market food retailers are being squeezed faster and harder by the discounters, and the online revolution, than they anticipated. Tesco, too, is confused on the forecasting front. Two years ago, when chief executive Philip Clarke launched his \u00a31bn \"Build a Better Tesco\" plan for the UK, he said the task would involve only a modest reduction in profit margins from 5.8% to 5.2%.

JP Morgan Cazenove's analyst thinks it means Tesco's profit margins in the UK will be 4.2% next year. When UK sales are \u00a343bn, a 1% difference in margins is a big deal. For all that, these are still well-financed companies capable of learning new tricks. A generation ago, they trounced the last set of discounters, such as Kwik Save. The current middle-class obsession with Aldi might fade if wages ever start to outstrip inflation again. That seems to the gist of the \"don't panic\" message to shareholders from the boardrooms of Tesco and Morrisons. Maybe it is justified. Maybe, once the online pill has been swallowed, the old order in the supermarket industry will look remarkably like the current setup. But lower profit margins all around are the way to bet.

      "bodyText": "Mukhtar Ablyazov, the Kazakh billionaire accused of stealing \u00a33bn who went on the run after being found guilty in Britain of lying to a court about his ownership of a \u00a317m mansion on London's \"billionaires' row\", will be extradited to Russia or Ukraine, a French court ruled. Ablyazov, 50, who is accused of embezzling \u00a33bn from the state-owned Kazakh bank BTA, was found guilty of contempt of court in London for trying to hide more than \u00a334m of assets, including Carlton House, his seven-bedroom home on The Bishops Avenue, and an \u00a318m 100-acre estate near Windsor called Oakland Park. A high court judge sentenced him to 22 months in prison in February 2012, but he fled the country before he could be jailed. Private detectives tracked him down last summer to a villa on the French Riviera by tailing his friend Olena Tischenko, a Ukrainian lawyer, from the Royal Courts of Justice in London to the south of France. The detectives, working for BTA, which he allegedly defrauded when he was chairman, followed her as she took a taxi to Heathrow airport and a flight to Nice. She was picked up by a chauffeur and driven in a white Land Rover to her home near Cannes where she switched cars to a grey Land Rover at 2.30am and drove to the six-bed Villa Neptune in Miramar on the coast between Nice and Marseille. Inside they spotted Ablyazov in his underwear. Ablyazov was transferred to a third villa, the Chemin de Castellaras in Mouans-Sartoux, where the private detectives called in a police helicopter and 12 gendarmes disguised as gardeners to storm the property and arrest him. Since then he has been in prison in Aix-en-Provence while the court decided whether to extradite him \u2013 he is wanted in Britain, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine. The court ruled on Thursday that Ablyazov, who had been granted political asylum in the UK in 2011, should be extradited to Ukraine or Russia, with a preference for Russia. Kazakhstan does not have an extradition treaty with France. Ablyazov denies the charges, which he claims are politically motivated. His lawyers said he would appeal against a \"patently flawed decision\" that \"drapes French justice in shame\". Peter Sahlas, who represents Ablyazov's family, said: \"This court wants to send Ablyazov, a refugee, straight to the very people he should be protected from. \"All human rights groups warn against his extradition over fears he will be tortured. Ultimately he will be sent to Kazakhstan and mistreated. \"He will not be able to get a fair trial \u2013 he will be tortured in Kazakhstan; he will be tortured in Ukraine; he will be tortured in Russia.\" Amnesty International said: \"Not only do we have fears that Ablyazov would not get a fair trial in Russia or Ukraine, there is the real danger that he will eventually end up in Kazakhstan, where he will be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.

      "bodyText": "First it was the Brics. For a while the Civets were in vogue. Now the Mints are the ones to watch. Confused? Well, once you know your acronyms it all becomes clear. The Brics are Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 four emerging economies lumped together in 2001 by Jim O'Neill, then at Goldman Sachs, to show that western investors needed to take notice of what was happening in the post-cold war global economy. Robert Ward, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, linked Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt and Turkey but the Civets never really took off. Now O'Neill is championing the Mints, a name first coined by the fund managers Fidelity, for what he thinks will be the second generation of emerging market pace-setters: Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey. The Mints share some common features. They all have big and growing populations with plentiful supplies of young workers. That should help them grow fast when ageing and shrinking populations will lead inexorably to slower growth rates in many developed countries (and China) over the coming decades. And they are nicely placed geographically to take advantage of large markets nearby, with Indonesia close to China, Turkey on the edge of the European Union and Mexico on America's doorstep. Nigeria's geographical advantages are less immediately obvious, although it does have the potential to become the hub of Africa's economy at a time when the continent is enjoying a sustained period of strong expansion. Strong growth in Asia has pushed up demand for the fuel and raw materials needed for industrialisation and three of the Mints \u2013 Mexico, Indonesia and Nigeria \u2013 are leading commodity producers. Of the four, only Nigeria is not already a member of the G20 group of developed and developing countries. Even so, financial markets are wary about treating what is actually a disparate group of countries as a bloc. If the Brics are now a bit old hat, it is in part because their reputations are a little tarnished. Western investors who piled into Bric stock markets expecting to make a packet have had their fingers burned and in recent years would have done better keeping their money at home. Only China has really lived up to the growth hype and is now the world's second biggest economy. But even then stock market performance has been weak and there are now concerns that attempts by Beijing to move to an economic model less dependent on credit will lead to a hard landing in 2014. At one point India looked likely to rival China as the emerging market powerhouse but it had a wretched 2013, suffering from high inflation, a rising current account deficit and a run on the rupee. Russia is seen as over-dependent on its oil and gas sector and unfriendly towards foreign investors; Brazil, like many other emerging economies, proved vulnerable to hot money flows. Tanweer Akram, economist at ING Investment Management, notes that investors pulled back from several emerging markets last year and are likely to be discriminating in the future, reducing exposure to \"countries that are vulnerable on the basis of current account deficit, inflation above target and muted growth\". Turkey and Indonesia are both countries where the bullish investor mood of a couple of years ago has been replaced by a more cautious approach. Of the two, Turkey is the more immediate concern, with the International Monetary Fund calling late last year for interest rates to be raised by 2.5 percentage points to tackle 8% inflation. Nigeria is seen as more attractive in part because it has shown strong growth despite its long-term structural problems: power shortages, corruption and a poor education system. The markets like the market-friendly reforms in Mexico and see it, rather than Brazil, as Latin America's best bet. Even so, Mexico's fortunes are closely linked to those of its powerful neighbour across the Rio Grande. In one sense, the very notion of Brics and Mints is helpful. It illustrates the way in which the economic balance of power has shifted from the developed to the developing world over the past 20 years and will continue to do so over the next 20. In Nigeria's case, it illustrates the possibility that the next \"tiger\" economies could well be in Africa. But it is well to remember that the countries are only grouped together because they make a neat acronym. They are all different; the suggestion that they are not is Colombia, Oman, Burundi, Botswana, Laos, Egypt, Romania, Sudan.",

      "bodyText": "Greggs emerged as a winner from Christmas trading but it will not be a happy new year for more than 400 of its employees who face losing their jobs. In a trading update, the bakery chain said underlying sales for the five weeks ending 4 January rose 3.1% in a return to growth after a difficult start to the year. But it said 300 branch staff were in line to lose their jobs because of a decision to scrap in-store bakeries at 79 branches. Another 110 non-branch jobs are also under threat in a proposed cull of managerial posts. \"Wherever possible we would look to offer existing vacancies to the employees who work in our in-store bakeries but anticipate that many will leave the business,\" Greggs said. Ronnie Draper, general secretary of the Bakers Food &amp; Allied Workers Union, said Greggs had never cut jobs on this scale before. \"It's come out of the blue. In the past the company has had profit warnings but we never expected this. It's devastating for the people who will be affected. We will look to save as many jobs as we can,\" Draper said. Most of the branches affected are former Bakers Oven stores in south-east England. Greggs bought Bakers Oven in 1994 and rebranded all the branches with the company name in 2008. Once the changes are made, all branches will get their goods from Greggs's regional bakery network. The company said it would work with trade union and employee representatives to \"refine and develop the proposals\". Greggs said the cuts would save \u00a36m a year from the middle of next year and \u00a32m this year after costs of \u00a39m for redundancy payments and write-offs on in-store baking equipment. The company's sales fell in the first half of the year, prompting it to scrap an experiment with cafes and to revamp its traditional branches offering baked food on the go. In the runup to Christmas staples such as sandwiches and pasties sold well and there was brisk business in \"festive bakes\" and mince pies, Greggs said. Roger Whiteside, the chief executive, said: \"I am encouraged by the improvement in trading that we achieved as we progressed through the year. As a result, full-year results should be in line with our previous expectations.\" Profit growth will be limited over the next two years by costs involved in reviving the business, Greggs said.",

      "standfirst": "Exports have reached record levels, but so have imports \u2013 and some economists say the recovery will only make the gap grow", 
      "body": "<p>Whatever happened to the UK's promised export boom? Well, exports are up and have reached record levels, but imports have also exceeded previous highs and a string of shockingly high deficits is roughly unchanged. We continue to import more than we export and are running a perpetual trade deficit.</p> <p>The UK has offset its trade deficit with income from abroad for some time. The legacy of empire is still enjoyed by many companies and investors, who own assets in foreign lands and repatriate the gains to the UK.</p> <p>This positive effect on our current account has waned sharply since the financial crash, however, and the future looks less rosy.</p> <p>Stephen King, HSBC's chief economist, is pained by the 5% deficit, which he argues should be down to zero or positive in the wake of a severe recession.</p> <p>His concern is that deficits grow in times of plenty as shoppers consume ever more imported goods. Much better to start from a position of equilibrium or even a positive balance before the situation worsens.</p> <p>A proper recession, one in which falling wages or mass unemploymentthat wipe out people's incomes in aggregate, cuts the import bill dramatically. It is a situation we can see in Greece, Spain and Portugal, where the dire economic and financial situations they find themselves in have at least improved the trade balance.</p> <p>The Keynesian response to the crisis in the UK adopted by Labour and partially maintained by the coalition supports employment and public services, but also has the unfortunate effect of maintaining high levels of imports. That's why the huge deficits run up by successive governments during and after the recession needed to be offset by a significant jump in exports.</p> <p>Despite a 25% fall in the value of sterling, the rise was only slight. There are plenty of competing explanations as to why. Our reliance on the EU, which apart from Germany has struggled to grow since 2008, is one of them. The propensity for exporters to jack up their prices rather than increase production in response to higher demand is another long-term problem.</p> <p>Both give little reason to hope that an economy that month on month runs a historically high deficit before the recovery has gained real momentum, and with imports rising further, can avoid a mini sterling crisis.</p> <p>Doomsayers argue Britain has 18 months to two years to find its export mojo before it becomes crystal clear a lower pound is needed. A lower pound would give exporters another boost and possibly close the deficit, but would also raise import prices and inflation.

      "bodyText": "Whatever happened to the UK's promised export boom? Well, exports are up and have reached record levels, but imports have also exceeded previous highs and a string of shockingly high deficits is roughly unchanged. We continue to import more than we export and are running a perpetual trade deficit. The UK has offset its trade deficit with income from abroad for some time. The legacy of empire is still enjoyed by many companies and investors, who own assets in foreign lands and repatriate the gains to the UK. This positive effect on our current account has waned sharply since the financial crash, however, and the future looks less rosy. Stephen King, HSBC's chief economist, is pained by the 5% deficit, which he argues should be down to zero or positive in the wake of a severe recession. His concern is that deficits grow in times of plenty as shoppers consume ever more imported goods. Much better to start from a position of equilibrium or even a positive balance before the situation worsens. A proper recession, one in which falling wages or mass unemploymentthat wipe out people's incomes in aggregate, cuts the import bill dramatically. It is a situation we can see in Greece, Spain and Portugal, where the dire economic and financial situations they find themselves in have at least improved the trade balance. The Keynesian response to the crisis in the UK adopted by Labour and partially maintained by the coalition supports employment and public services, but also has the unfortunate effect of maintaining high levels of imports. That's why the huge deficits run up by successive governments during and after the recession needed to be offset by a significant jump in exports. Despite a 25% fall in the value of sterling, the rise was only slight. There are plenty of competing explanations as to why. Our reliance on the EU, which apart from Germany has struggled to grow since 2008, is one of them. The propensity for exporters to jack up their prices rather than increase production in response to higher demand is another long-term problem. Both give little reason to hope that an economy that month on month runs a historically high deficit before the recovery has gained real momentum, and with imports rising further, can avoid a mini sterling crisis. Doomsayers argue Britain has 18 months to two years to find its export mojo before it becomes crystal clear a lower pound is needed. A lower pound would give exporters another boost and possibly close the deficit, but would also raise import prices and inflation. Higher inflation, coupled with a consumer boom that is largely based on extra borrowing, could force the Bank of England to jack up interest rates. Whatever supporters of higher rates argue, a swift and brutal reaction from the central bank is unwelcome and would bring the recovery to a juddering halt.",

      "bodyText": "Federal cabinet will consider offering Qantas a \"standby\" or emergency debt guarantee after a second ratings agency downgraded its credit rating to \"junk\" status on Thursday. It is understood the option, which may not require legislation, was discussed by cabinet in December and will be reconsidered in late January. The company, and some coalition backbenchers, have been lobbying for changes to the Qantas Sales Act to remove the requirement for majority Australian ownership and allow foreign investors to hold more than 49%. But the Labor party and the Greens have ruled out support for the amendment in the Senate, meaning it could not pass parliament before the new Senate sits in July. The Moody's downgrade came after Standard and Poors had already downgraded Qantas debt in December.

    "webTitle": "The rise and rise of Domino's Pizza", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ever-longer working hours, shrinking real incomes and the rise of the internet have made couch potatoes of many of us after a day's work \u2013 and that has been very good news for the pizza delivery business. Britain's biggest pizza delivery chain, Domino's \u2013 which has recently been opening nine new outlets a month and now has 777 shops \u2013 announced \"exceptionally strong\" UK sales on Wednesday for the three months to the end of December. Total sales were up nearly 16% to just over \u00a3170m, and, excluding new branches sales, rose 11%. The appeal of an American Hot Double Decadence pizza turning up at the front door after a quick phone call, or a few clicks on a mobile phone, seems unstoppable. Even in the depths of the 2009 recession Domino's boomed as cash-strapped consumers swapped restaurant meals for an evening in. Britain's Domino's habit started in 1985 with a single branch in Luton, Bedfordshire. A decade later there were 100 stores and in 1999 the company became the first home-delivery business to float on the London stock exchange's Aim market. Sales soared as the company tapped into greater demand for convenience and the popularity of simply staying in and watching telly. Sponsoring Saturday night TV shows such as Britain's Got Talent and Splash! only increased the temptation for customers. Such is the chain's ubiquity in the UK, it is easy to forget that Domino's is American. In 1960 Tom and James Monaghan opened their DomiNick's pizza delivery store in Ypsilanti, Michigan. A year later, Tom exchanged his Volkswagen Beetle for his brother's share of the business and set himself the goal of expanding to three stores. The rest is fast-food history. Monaghan expanded around the world using the franchising model. Domino's in the UK pays 2.7% of sales to Domino's US to use the brand. Individual store owners pay the UK company at least \u00a3280,000 for a licence upfront, plus a share of sales, and buy their ingredients from the company, prepared at three giant \"commissaries\" at Milton Keynes, Penrith in Cumbria and Naas in Ireland. Domino's has 26% of the UK pizza market, just ahead of the longer established Pizza Hut at 25% but with much greater dominance of the growing delivery market. Wayne Brown, an analyst at City brokers Canaccord Genuity, said Domino's dominance is down to \"first-mover advantage\" \u2013 it launched and rode the home-delivery wave earlier than anyone else. But it has also kept up with its customers, going online as far back as 1999, embracing social media and launching a smartphone app in 2010. \"It plays to how the customer is behaving. They are using devices for a whole range of reasons and Domino's is benefiting from that, as well as impulse purchasing and British people being time-poor.\" Domino's has also kept its delivery times quick, with a target of 30 minutes or less. But is it any good? With obesity levels rising in the UK, critics will point to the calories lurking in Domino's corrugated cardboard delivery boxes. A large cheese and tomato Dominator pizza contains 2,650 calories \u2013 more than a man's daily requirement. Peter Backman, head of food service consultants Horizons, said: \"I think it's all right. It's better than most of the competition and it's better than some of the stuff you can get in the supermarket. Even I order from Domino's, though not too often.\"",

    "webTitle": "Sainsbury's posts lowest sales growth for nine years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury's scaled back its sales expectations for the year on Wednesday after posting its slowest sales growth for nine years and warning that shoppers are cutting back on the amount of food they buy. The supermarket said sales, excluding new store openings and fuel, had inched up by just 0.2% in the 14 weeks to January, despite prices rising by some 2.5%. But finance director, John Rogers, said the chain had put in \"a strong performance in a difficult market\" that had seen more promotions than last year. The big supermarkets are facing multiple problems: shoppers are buying more online; making more shopping trips to convenience stores rather than big out-of-town superstores; and reacting to squeezed incomes by taking their custom to discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. Chief executive, Justin King, said: \"This must be the toughest backdrop there's ever been. It's tougher for customers today than it's been in a generation. \"The economy is in recovery and that's manifesting itself in more jobs, but the vast majority of people who have stayed in work have got less money in their pockets.\" He said he expected shoppers to remain cautious for \"quite a while\". While the three-monthly performance was better than analysts expected, shares in the grocer sank 2.4% to 360p as Sainsbury's said it was set to record underlying sales growth of just below 1% for its full year against its previous prediction of up to 1.5%. King admitted that Sainsbury's total rise in sales, excluding fuel, of 2.7% over the quarter was flattered by food price inflation and strong sales of general merchandise such as clothing as well as new store space. General merchandise, which also includes homewares, is more profitable than food sales and the better performance of those goods may help the chain raise its profit margins. Aldi, Lidl and the upmarket Waitrose chain all saw much bigger sales gains over Christmas, but King insisted Sainsbury's was now more competitive than ever on price and had not lost customers to either discounters or upmarket rivals. \"I think shoppers are buying a little bit less but a little bit better quality,\" he said pointing to a 10% increase in sales of Sainsbury's premium own-label range, Taste the Difference. Waitrose, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, revealed on Wednesday a 3.1% rise in underlying sales in the five weeks to Christmas Eve boosted by a 33% rise in online grocery sales. The Co-op, meanwhile, said it had seen a 1% rise in underlying sales at its grocery stores in the 13 weeks to 4 January, boosted by a bigger rise in sales at its small local stores. Upmarket Majestic Wine also revealed its Christmas results, with sales up 2.8%. Independent market share figures will not be released until next week, but Sainsbury's relative performance should become clearer on Thursday when Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, reveals its Christmas trading figures. Analysts expect Tesco to reveal like-for-like sales down by about 2%. Bryan Roberts, director at industry analysts Kantar Retail, said: \"The fact Sainsbury's has posted an increase of only 0.2% in like-for-like sales is indicative of a slowdown by the retailer. In context of the likely performance of major competitors and against last year's decent comparatives, however, this is another respectable showing. \"Although Sainsbury's is among the better placed supermarkets to cope with whatever the market throws at it, we retain concerns that its profitability will come under mounting pressure in 2014.\" All the food retailers to have reported performance so far have noted a late rush, promotions that were heavier than usual and strong performances online and in convenience stores. Mike Coupe, commercial director at Sainsbury's said: \"Christmas is always promotional but this year was like no other.\" He said several stores had brought forward promotions that they might usually have launched in January. He added that trading was particularly difficult in October and November as customers kept a tight rein on spending after splashing out over the unusually warm summer. Trading also suffered as Halloween and Bonfire Night, both of which usually boost sales at supermarkets as the nation prepares to party, were literally a \"wash out,\" according to Coupe, marred by rain in many parts of the country. King said Sainsbury's had been able to achieve its 36th consecutive quarter of underlying sales growth largely thanks to a strong December. The chain had its busiest ever week leading up to Christmas with more than 28m transactions.",

It's tougher for customers today than it's been in a generation.</p> <p>\"The economy is in recovery and that's manifesting itself in more jobs, but the vast majority of people who have stayed in work have got less money in their pockets.\" He said he expected shoppers to remain cautious for \"quite a while\".</p> <p>While the three-monthly performance was better than analysts expected, shares in the grocer sank 2.4% to 360p as Sainsbury's said it was set to record underlying sales growth of just below 1% for its full year against its previous prediction of up to 1.5%.</p> <p>King admitted that Sainsbury's total rise in sales, excluding fuel, of 2.7% over the quarter was flattered by food price inflation and strong sales of general merchandise such as clothing as well as new store space. General merchandise, which also includes homewares, is more profitable than food sales and the better performance of those goods may help the chain raise its profit margins.</p> <p>Aldi, Lidl and the upmarket Waitrose chain all saw much bigger sales gains over Christmas, but King insisted Sainsbury's was now more competitive than ever on price and had not lost customers to either discounters or upmarket rivals.</p> <p>\"I think shoppers are buying a little bit less but a little bit better quality,\" he said pointing to a 10% increase in sales of Sainsbury's premium own-label range, Taste the Difference.</p> <p>Waitrose, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, revealed on Wednesday a 3.1% rise in underlying sales in the five weeks to Christmas Eve boosted by a 33% rise in online grocery sales.</p> <p>The Co-op, meanwhile, said it had seen a 1% rise in underlying sales at its grocery stores in the 13 weeks to 4 January, boosted by a bigger rise in sales at its small local stores. Upmarket Majestic Wine also revealed its Christmas results, with sales up 2.8%.</p> <p>Independent market share figures will not be released until next week, but Sainsbury's relative performance should become clearer on Thursday when Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, reveals its Christmas trading figures. Analysts expect Tesco to reveal like-for-like sales down by about 2%.</p> <p>Bryan Roberts, director at industry analysts Kantar Retail, said: \"The fact Sainsbury's has posted an increase of only 0.2% in like-for-like sales is indicative of a slowdown by the retailer. In context of the likely performance of major competitors and against last year's decent comparatives, however, this is another respectable showing.</p> <p>\"Although Sainsbury's is among the better placed supermarkets to cope with whatever the market throws at it, we retain concerns that its profitability will come under mounting pressure in 2014.\"</p> <p>All the food retailers to have reported performance so far have noted a late rush, promotions that were heavier than usual and strong performances online and in convenience stores.</p> <p>Mike Coupe, commercial director at Sainsbury's said: \"Christmas is always promotional but this year was like no other.\" He said several stores had brought forward promotions that they might usually have launched in January.</p> <p>He added that trading was particularly difficult in October and November as customers kept a tight rein on spending after splashing out over the unusually warm summer.</p> <p>Trading also suffered as Halloween and Bonfire Night, both of which usually boost sales at supermarkets as the nation prepares to party, were literally a \"wash out,\" according to Coupe, marred by rain in many parts of the country.</p> <p>King said Sainsbury's had been able to achieve its 36th consecutive quarter of underlying sales growth largely thanks to a strong December. The chain had its busiest ever week leading up to Christmas with more than 28m transactions.</p>",
