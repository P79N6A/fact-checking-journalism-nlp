    "webTitle": "Mario Draghi hints at ECB rate cut to avoid deflation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi has reinforced expectations that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates or launch a bond-buying programme next month after admitting that \"pre-emptive action\" may be needed to head off deflation. The ECB is on guard against deflation and ready to act with conventional and targeted measures, while a broad asset-buying plan remains an option, the bank's governor said in a speech on Sunday. To guard against a drop in price expectations, \"more pre-emptive action may be warranted\", he said. Draghi's comments follow suggestions from other ECB policymakers that the bank is ready to act at its policy meeting on 5 June to counter low inflation and weak lending in the 18-country eurozone. Draghi said he expected inflation, which is running at 0.7%, to return slowly to the ECB's target of just under 2%. \"Our responsibility is nonetheless to be alert to the risks to this scenario that might emerge and prepared for action if they do,\" he said at the ECB's Forum on Central Banking in Portugal. \"What we need to be particularly watchful for at the moment is, in my view, the potential for a negative spiral to take hold between low inflation, falling inflation expectations and credit, in particular in stressed countries.\" Setting out policy options for different scenarios, Draghi said that should exchange rate or market developments result in an unwarranted tightening of monetary and financial conditions \"this would require adjustment of our conventional instruments\". Such instruments include interest rate cuts. There has been speculation that the ECB could impose negative interest rates in an effort to spur demand and introduce inflationary pressures into the eurozone. The ECB is preparing a package of policy options for its June meeting, including cuts in all its interest rates as well as targeted measures aimed at boosting lending to small- and mid-sized firms. Draghi indicated that full-blown, US-style quantitative easing \u2013 printing money to buy assets \u2013 remained an option for the ECB, saying a destabilising of inflation expectations \"would be the context for a broad-based asset purchase programme\". Draghi also referred to the reluctance of banks in some eurozone countries \u2013 particularly those on the periphery of the bloc \u2013 to issue loans as they repair their balance sheets. The recovery would bring growing demand for credit, Draghi said. \"And at this point, for monetary policy to produce its full effects there must be no binding constraints on credit supply through the banking system,\" he added. But he warned that credit demand may pick up faster than banks can repair their balance sheets and new capital markets can be developed to complement bank lending. \"If, in this context, availability of term funding is a limiting factor on loan origination, then monetary policy can play a bridging role,\" Draghi said. \"Term-funding of loans, be it on-balance sheet \u2013 that is, through refinancing operations \u2013 or off-balance sheet \u2013 that is, through purchases of asset-backed securities \u2013 could help reduce any drag on the recovery coming from temporary credit supply constraints.\" These comments suggested the ECB could deploy a long-term lending facility \u2013 or LTRO \u2013 providing banks with funds to lend on to businesses and households, or buy asset-backed securities (ABS) to support the provision of loans. ECB executive board member Yves Mersch said on Saturday there were signs credit demand in the euro area is beginning to pick up and that banks need to be strong enough to respond to that demand. Draghi said credit constraints were putting a brake on the recovery in stressed countries while the effects of an appreciating euro exchange rate would hold down eurozone inflation. \"There is a risk that disinflationary expectations take hold,\" he said. \"This may then cause households and firms to defer expenditure in a classic deflationary cycle.\" Draghi said after the ECB's May meeting that the governing council was \"comfortable with acting next time\" (at its policy meeting) but wanted to see updated economic projections from the bank's staff first. Since then data confirmed a slight increase in eurozone inflation in April to 0.7% from 0.5% the previous month, but it also showed that the eurozone economy grew less than expected at the start of the year",

      "body": "<p>Mario Draghi has reinforced expectations that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates or launch a bond-buying programme next month after admitting that \"pre-emptive action\" may be needed to head off deflation.</p> <p>The ECB is on guard against deflation and ready to act with conventional and targeted measures, while a broad asset-buying plan remains an option, the bank's governor said in a speech on Sunday. To guard against a drop in price expectations, \"more pre-emptive action may be warranted\", he said.</p> <p>Draghi's comments follow suggestions from other ECB policymakers that the bank is ready to act at its policy meeting on 5 June to counter low inflation and weak lending in the 18-country eurozone. Draghi said he expected inflation, which is running at 0.7%, to return slowly to the ECB's target of just under 2%.</p> <p>\"Our responsibility is nonetheless to be alert to the risks to this scenario that might emerge and prepared for action if they do,\" he said at the ECB's Forum on Central Banking in Portugal. \"What we need to be particularly watchful for at the moment is, in my view, the potential for a negative spiral to take hold between low inflation, falling inflation expectations and credit, in particular in stressed countries.\"</p> <p>Setting out policy options for different scenarios, Draghi said that should exchange rate or market developments result in an unwarranted tightening of monetary and financial conditions \"this would require adjustment of our conventional instruments\". Such instruments include interest rate cuts.</p> <p>There has been speculation that the ECB could impose negative interest rates in an effort to spur demand and introduce inflationary pressures into the eurozone.</p> <p>The ECB is preparing a package of policy options for its June meeting, including cuts in all its interest rates as well as targeted measures aimed at boosting lending to small- and mid-sized firms. Draghi indicated that full-blown, US-style quantitative easing \u2013 printing money to buy assets \u2013 remained an option for the ECB, saying a destabilising of inflation expectations \"would be the context for a broad-based asset purchase programme\".</p> <p>Draghi also referred to the reluctance of banks in some eurozone countries \u2013 particularly those on the periphery of the bloc \u2013 to issue loans as they repair their balance sheets. The recovery would bring growing demand for credit, Draghi said.</p> <p>\"And at this point, for monetary policy to produce its full effects there must be no binding constraints on credit supply through the banking system,\" he added.</p> <p>But he warned that credit demand may pick up faster than banks can repair their balance sheets and new capital markets can be developed to complement bank lending.</p> <p>\"If, in this context, availability of term funding is a limiting factor on loan origination, then monetary policy can play a bridging role,\" Draghi said. \"Term-funding of loans, be it on-balance sheet \u2013 that is, through refinancing operations \u2013 or off-balance sheet \u2013 that is, through purchases of asset-backed securities \u2013 could help reduce any drag on the recovery coming from temporary credit supply constraints.\"</p> <p>These comments suggested the ECB could deploy a long-term lending facility \u2013 or LTRO \u2013 providing banks with funds to lend on to businesses and households, or buy asset-backed securities (ABS) to support the provision of loans.</p> <p>ECB executive board member Yves Mersch said on Saturday there were signs credit demand in the euro area is beginning to pick up and that banks need to be strong enough to respond to that demand.</p> <p>Draghi said credit constraints were putting a brake on the recovery in stressed countries while the effects of an appreciating euro exchange rate would hold down eurozone inflation.</p> <p>\"There is a risk that disinflationary expectations take hold,\" he said. \"This may then cause households and firms to defer expenditure in a classic deflationary cycle.\"</p> <p>Draghi said after the ECB's May meeting that the governing council was \"comfortable with acting next time\" (at its policy meeting) but wanted to see updated economic projections from the bank's staff first.</p> <p>Since then data confirmed a slight increase in eurozone inflation in April to 0.7% from 0.5% the previous month, but it also showed that the eurozone economy grew less than expected at the start of the year</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Prime ministers, presidents, and chancellors from across Europe are to dine in Brussels on Tuesday evening, and digest the verdict from their respective disenchanted voters. Many will arrive as walking wounded, their credibility battered, their reputations bruised, their policies discredited. The president of France, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, led his Socialist party to a historic defeat on Sunday at the hands of the Front National, a party rooted in racism and antisemitism. David Cameron, a prime minister perhaps leading his country to breakup and then to exit from the European Union, arrives as the only Tory leader to take his party to third place in a national election. Antonis Samaras, Greece's conservative leader, comes to Brussels beaten by the young left-wing firebrand Alexis Tsipras and his anti-austerity Syriza movement. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the \"selfie\" prime minister of Denmark who has been tipped for a top EU job, saw her centre-left government badly hit by the nationalist anti-immigrant Danish People's party. Presiding over the dinner will be Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European council, anxiously wondering about his legacy and who, given the mess, will take over his job later this year. And at only his second EU summit, Matteo Renzi will be forgiven if his smile contrasts with the others' frowns. The young Italian centre-left leader who seems to be morphing into the George Clooney of European politics charmed his way to an improbable result on Sunday. Never elected prime minister of Italy, he took 40% of the vote to claim a mandate the other incumbents can only envy. It will be weeks before the dust settles on the political earthquake that has seen fundamental shifts in British, French, Greek and Danish politics, and wrought big changes in Scandinavia, Ireland, Spain and Italy. Already attempts are under way to play down the impact of the vote and to belittle the new class of 2014 as noisy, rude, and extremist, but also fractious and unable to hold together to get their anti-European way. But even if they struggle for cohesion, the incoming nationalists, neo-fascists, establishment baiters and hard leftists will make it trickier for the mainstream to push through its legislative agenda on everything from trade pacts with America to climate change to immigration policy to eurozone economic and fiscal integration. Cameron's free-market reform agenda may also fall victim to a parliament that will be more protectionist, more anti-American more pro-Russian, more supportive of bigger budgets and more spending. Almost a third of the new parliament, albeit a motley crew ranging from Greek fascists to Swedish nationalists to Flemish separatists to new Spanish leftwingers, will be broadly or fervently anti-EU. The establishment response is likely to be a Berlin-style grand coalition of mainstream Christian and social democrats, blithely ignoring the upstarts and pushing through their \"more Europe\" agenda. The problem is that the two big blocs make up a mere 53% of the new chamber, down from 61%, highlighting the erosion of centrist political appeal and the domination of politics by the centre-right and the centre-left. At the last election in 2009, the two big Spanish parties took 80% between them. On Sunday that collapsed to just under 50%. The other problem with grand coalitions is that when it comes to countering demagoguery and populism, they commonly become part of the problem rather than the solution. Deals and policies are stitched up behind the scenes, rubber-stamped by safe parliamentary majorities, leaving the only opposition to the anti-elitist movements hammering on the closed doors. The elections supplied what used to be called a Kodak moment, freezing a picture of European politics and exposing how what started as a banking disaster five years ago, then developed into a financial, debt and currency emergency, has come to roost as a political crisis, testing the competence of and confidence in European leadership. For Germany, the EU powerhouse, the two big causes for concern are the eurozone's second and third economies, France and Italy. Both countries are under the centre-left, both are struggling with parallel issues of loss of competitiveness, structural rigidity, high youth unemployment, poor public finances, a seeming inability to reform. Yet Renzi, the telegenic Italian prime minister, took on the Five-Star insurgents of Beppe Grillo with an avowedly and aggressive pro-European message. He routed them, while Hollande consolidated his reputation as France's least popular president ever and, for the French elite and the centre, led the country to a moment of shame. On a smaller scale, the pattern replicated itself in the Netherlands which has turned Eurosceptic in the past decade. The far-right Islam-baiter Geert Wilders did worse than expected, albeit not so badly on 13% and one seat down. But the anti-European hard-left Socialists defeated the co-governing Labour party. And the main winners were not the liberals of the prime minister, Mark Rutte, but his rival leftist liberals, D-66, who fought a strong pro-European campaign and prospered. With his talk of curbs on immigration, limits on freedom of movement in the EU and benefits tourism, Cameron sought to halt the march of Ukip. He failed to stop Nigel Farage. Sounding like Cameron last week, Nicolas Sarkozy, the former conservative French president, also sought to blunt the onslaught of the Front National by calling for immigration curbs, shelving the Schengen-free travel zone in Europe, and re-erecting national border controls. That failed, too. The centre-left government in Copenhagen also campaigned on pledges of cutting welfare benefits for east European immigrants only to see the anti-immigration nationalists of the Danish People's party triumph by almost doubling their vote. In France, Britain, Denmark and Greece it may be the first time that a European election has transformed national politics, supplying ample anguished subject matter for discussion over the canapes and fine wines in Brussels on Tuesday evening. There will also be polite but determined lobbying over who should head the EU executive this autumn. Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran EU insider and former Luxembourg prime minister who has been at the centre of EU politics since Maastricht, German unification, and the birth of the ill-fated single currency, appears to be the antithesis of the European zeitgeist. But, to Cameron's alarm, he is now the favourite to seal the deal as the parliament's centre-right candidate. Juncker's prospects will depend on whether German chancellor Angela Merkel opts to go for a consensus among the diners by selecting another candidate or throws her weight behind Juncker despite opposition from Britain, Hungary, and Holland. The leaders will play for time, saying they have to wait to see how the parliamentary arithmetic adds up, with frantic rival majority-building efforts under way, before they can take a position. On Tuesday evening Europe's leaders will issue pieties about the need for growth and jobs, divided about how to get there and looking over their shoulders.",

      "bodyText": "Pfizer has abandoned its attempt to buy British drugmaker AstraZeneca in the face of opposition from UK politicians, scientists and its target's boardroom. Shortly before it reached a 5pm \"put up or shut up\" deadline on Monday to turn its \u00a369bn approach into a formal bid, Pfizer bowed to the inevitable and conceded that its campaign to create the world's largest pharmaceutical business had failed. The US group's chief executive, Ian Read, insisted that AstraZeneca had been offered a fair price at \u00a355 a share \u2013 a figure that was rejected on 19 May as undervaluing the business. \"We continue to believe that our final proposal was compelling and represented full value for AstraZeneca based on the information that was available to us,\" said the British-born executive. Having declared its \u00a355 approach as final, Pfizer was unable to increase its offer under Takeover Panel rules, unless AstraZeneca shareholders forced the board to change its mind. However, investors failed to present a united front on the deal although a number of major shareholders expressed disappointment at the refusal of the AstraZeneca board to open formal discussions with Pfizer over the approach. AstraZeneca's share price, which has risen during the last six months of takeover talk, closed at \u00a342.28 on Friday. Under UK takeover rules, Pfizer cannot renew its advances for six months, although AstraZeneca could choose to initiate talks in three months' time. Leif Johansson, AstraZeneca's chairman, said: \"We welcome the opportunity to continue building on the momentum we have already demonstrated as an independent company. We are fully focused on the delivery of our strategy. We have attractive growth prospects and a rapidly progressing pipeline.\" Although Johansson spoke of the long-term prospects for AstraZeneca, last week he said the board would consider an offer of \u00a358.85 a share. Some shareholders, including AstraZeneca's largest investor, BlackRock asset management, have been urging the board to restart talks as soon as possible. The UK's largest trade union voiced fears that Pfizer could be back in as little as three months if AstraZeneca invites it to re-start talks. \"The government needs to use this time to intervene and put a public interest test in place for proposed takeovers of this size, just as other government's do, such as the French which has strengthened its powers to act to protect strategic industries,\" said Unite's assistant general secretary, Tony Burke. \"AstraZeneca's workforce expects shareholders to stand firm, respect their responsibilities and back the board's long term strategy. The future of vital life sciences in the UK and improvements in health are so much more important than the desire of one company to minimise its tax liabilities and wrangles over drug patents.\" Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca roused public anger on both sides of the Atlantic after the US firm admitted that tax savings were a key factor. Under a successful takeover, Pfizer would have relocated its tax base to the UK in order to escape the US's higher rate of corporation tax. Amid doubts over its motives, the American group's five-year guarantees on preserving British jobs, which included ensuring that 20% of the research and development workforce stays in the UK, were dismissed by politicians and leading scientists as inadequate. David Cameron said he was \"neutral\" about the proposed bid, which has brought accusations from Labour that the government has acted as a cheerleader for Pfizer. George Osborne has viewed the deal as an endorsement of a business-friendly tax regime which includes a tax break for drugs developed in the UK. Reacting to Pfizer's decision to walk away, Labour's shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, vowed on Monday that a Labour government would strengthen a public interest test to better protect Britain's science base. Under current rules ministerial intervention is restricted to issues of national security, media plurality and financial stability. \"While Labour was standing up for British jobs and British science throughout this takeover bid, David Cameron and his ministers were cheerleading for it when one of the primary motivations behind the deal was financial engineering,\" said Umunna. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, had warned that the takeover could endanger lives of cancer patients by delaying the development of new drugs. Soriot, who will showcase AstraZeneca's new pipeline of cancer drugs at a key industry conference on Friday, will now be under pressure to show shareholders that AstraZeneca can thrive as a stand-alone company.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thomas Piketty has accused the Financial Times of ridiculous and dishonest criticism of his economics book on inequality, which has become a publishing sensation. The French economist, whose 577-page tome Capital in the Twenty-First Century has become an unlikely must-read for business leaders and politicians alike, said it was ridiculous to suggest that his central thesis on rising inequality was incorrect. The controversy blew up when the FT accused Piketty of errors in transcribing numbers, as well as cherry-picking data or not using original sources. The newspaper concluded there was little evidence in Piketty's original sources to verify his theory that the richest were accumulating more wealth, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots in Europe and the United States. In an interview with the Agence France-Presse news agency, the economist said: \"The FT is being ridiculous because all of its contemporaries recognise that the biggest fortunes have grown faster.\" While the available data was imperfect, it did not undermine his central argument about widening inequality, he said. \"Where the Financial Times is being dishonest is to suggest that this changes things in the conclusions I make, when in fact it changes nothing. More recent studies only support my conclusions, by using different sources.\" Writing to the FT before the AFP interview, Piketty said he had put all his data online to encourage an open and transparent debate. \"I have no doubt that my historical data series can be improved and will be improved in the future \u2026 But I would be very surprised if any of the substantive conclusions about the long-run evolution of wealth distributions were much affected by these improvements.\" In his book Piketty draws on data spanning two centuries and 20 countries to show how the western world is reverting to levels of inequality last seen during the Belle Epoque period of 1871-1914. The findings have won him an audience with Barack Obama's economic advisers and a spot on the Amazon bestseller lists on both sides of the Atlantic. But it is the French economist's use of UK data that has proved most problematic for the Financial Times. Chris Giles, the FT's economics editor, who launched the FT's critique, has written that the book's \"problems\" are most acute for Britain, \"where Prof Piketty shows rising concentrations of wealth among the richest since 1980, when his source data does not\". While Piketty cited a figure showing the top 10% of the UK population held 71% of national wealth, a survey by the Office for National Statistics put the figure at 44%. Piketty dismissed the ONS survey as \"very low quality\". The FT has said Piketty seemed rather unaware of UK data. The newspaper has rejected Piketty's accusations that its work is ridiculous and dishonest. It also defended the ONS Wealth and Assets survey, describing it as exactly the same type of survey \u2013 but with a much larger sample size \u2013 as the data Piketty preferred to use in his book for the US. While claims against Piketty have garnered much gloating on Twitter, he has won support from the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman. \"Anyone imagining that the whole notion of rising wealth inequality has been refuted is almost surely going to be disappointed,\" Krugman wrote on his New York Times blog.",

Margie Osmond, the association\u2019s chief executive, told Guardian Australia the rules were different in every state, and Victoria was the only one that had it right. \u201cVictoria has probably the best legislation in the country \u2013 they are deregulated,\u201d she said. \u201cThey simply say when you can\u2019t shop \u2013 that is, Good Friday, Christmas Day, and a half day Anzac Day. The sky has not fallen in.\u201d She said the Australian retail sector was undergoing \u201cmassive structural change\u201d and the vast bulk of the changes centred on what consumers want, when they want to shop and how. \u201cIt\u2019s really important in a modern environment to respond to that. If it can be done in Victoria, why not elsewhere?\u201d The retail workers\u2019 union, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association, said in its submission that structural change had nothing to do with a downturn in retail sales, instead citing \u201ca range of factors\u201d including the global financial crisis, an increased tendency to save, tax burdens on low and middle income families, and increased costs of living. \u201cNone of [these factors] add evidence to suggest that there are fundamental structural problems facing the retail industry,\u201d it wrote. \u201cNone of them give any grounds for believing that over time the Australian retail industry could not return to its normal growth and profitability.\u201d The union instead recommended tax cuts for low and middle income families and steps to reduce housing costs as ways of improving the retail industry. Osmond would not be drawn on whether the amendments the organisation was pushing for included changes to awards or penalty rates. She said it was part of another discussion. \u201cFrom our point of view there are many people who are happy to work the extended hours because of the penalty rates involved,\u201d she said. Coles also called for the government to abolish the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, resist calls for a national container deposit scheme and streamline food safety regulation.",

Breaking down the percentage of workers in each tax bracket in every occupation (and there are more than 400 listed by the ATO) gives us a clear picture of which workers are earning the most and who is earning the least. And it will be no surprise to anyone who has had to pay for surgery recently to discover that the occupation that features the highest percentage of workers earning over $180,000 are anaesthetists.

Low income can reflect that many of the workers in that occupation work casual or part-time. Waiters for example are much more likely to earn less than $37,000 a year compared with all other occupations: The influence of part-time/casual work on total income as well as the wage rate becomes very important when we examine the gender of high- and low-earning occupations. Of the 20 occupations with the highest number of workers earning more than $80,000 (in effect earning above the average full-time wage), not one has a majority of women working in it: While this is perhaps not surprising, given women account for only 48% of all workers, only five of the top 20 highest-earning occupations have more than 40% of women working in that job.
