      "bodyText": "Heavy discounting on clothing, shoes and electrical goods by duelling retailers helped trigger the fastest fall in prices in Britain's shops in more than seven years last month. Shop prices overall were 1.7% lower in March than a year earlier, driven down by falls in most non-food categories, but most notably a 12.8% drop in the cost of clothing and footwear and a 4.4% fall in the price of electrical goods. Food inflation also slowed significantly, to 0.8%. It was the fastest shop-price deflation since the British Retail Consortium/Nielsen index began in December 2006. Helen Dickinson, the BRC's director-general, said the deflation rate reflected retailers' efforts to attract customers who were carefully managing their budgets. \"It's strong industry-wide competition as retailers vie for a share of limited spending capacity that is driving this record-breaking run. Retailers have been responding to their customers with keen prices and promotions to maintain market share,\" she said. Prices have fallen in all categories of clothing and footwear for seven successive months, with children's clothing and women's clothing the fastest fallers in March. Non-food deflation of 3.2% was the sharpest on record, while last month's food inflation number was also an all-time low for the series. Dickinson said that as 15% of disposable incomes were spent on food and drink among the poorest third of UK households, slowing food inflation reflected \"retail's significant contribution to maintaining standards of living\". The consumer price index \u2013 Britain's official measure of inflation \u2013 has outpaced average wage growth for much of the past five years, dragging standards of living lower. However, inflation has fallen in recent months and is now below the Bank of England's 2% target. It is widely predicted that wages will finally start to outpace inflation later this year, offering some relief to consumers and budgets. Fresh food prices were the biggest driver of falling food inflation in March, with prices rising by just 0.6% in March compared with 1.5% in February on an annual basis. Lower prices of fish and vegetables and slowing inflation on milk, cheese, eggs and meat were behind the dip in fresh food inflation. BRC/Nielsen said that there had been some upward pressure on commodity prices since the beginning of the year due to poor harvests in Brazil, the world's top producer of coffee, sugar and orange juice. Meanwhile, a slowdown of cocoa production in West Africa has been attributed to below average rainfall, sending prices up. The report added: \"The prices of corn, wheat and cotton were up in double digits over the last three months. However, such sharp rises remain isolated and, although recent price movements need to be monitored carefully, the global outlook for rising commodity prices remains modest.\" Dickinson said support from the government on other costs facing retailers, such as business rate reform and the recent reliefs for national insurance contributions, would be important in keeping shop prices down. The latest official data published last month showed that rain and flooding failed to dampers shoppers' enthusiasm in February, with the volume of retail sales rising by 1.7% on the previous month \u2013 more than three times as fast as economists had expected. It followed a 2% drop in January.",

There is nothing wrong here, apparently, because lock-up periods are not binding. So Ashley's latest pledge not to sell for 150 days could mean the day after tomorrow or never. These rules are a nonsense. If stock exchange statements don't mean what they say, what's the point?",

Ashley, Sports Direct's executive deputy chairman, paid around \u00a320m for Sir Tom Hunter's stake in the department store chain after China's Sanpower Group agreed to acquire 89% in a deal worth more than \u00a3450m, including debt. In a statement on Tuesday, Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store, the listed retail arm of Sanpower, said it would sign the deal shortly and would set up a wholly owned subsidiary in the UK to acquire the stake. Ashley is known to have long held an interest in buying House of Fraser, although any attempt to derail Sanpower's move looks to have failed, with the transaction expected to be completed this week. In January Ashley kicked off the new year with another surprise move, selling a stake he just bought in UK department store chain Debenhams for a profit of about \u00a34.6m and betting on its share price holding up with a complex option deal. Insiders said his sale of 24m Sports Direct shares at \u00a38.50, which was confirmed on Tuesday, was not linked to the House of Fraser acquisition. Instead they pointed to calls from investors to increase the company's free float.",

The inquiry will scrutinise how details of a planned investigation into milllions of closed pension and investment policies were leaked by a senior FCA official, Clive Adamson, to the Daily Telegraph in an interview. The FCA then took more than six hours after the stock market opened before issuing a clarifying statement that halted a rout in insurance stocks. The watchdog's chief executive, Martin Wheatley, who was appointed by the Treasury, has come under pressure to resign over the affair. The industry trade body, the Association of British Insurers, has called for a truly independent inquiry, because the FCA's chairman and non-executive directors are still overseeing the investigation and have set out the terms of reference published on Tuesday. However, the ABI's director general, Otto Thoresen, told MPs on the Treasury Committee on Tuesday that he was \"not looking for heads to roll\". Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the parliamentary Treasury Committee, said MPs would quiz Davis, who has nearly 30 years expertise in corporate and financial institution investigations, once the lawyer has complete his inquiry. \"It is vital that this investigation is wholly independent of the regulator,\" he reiterated. The chancellor, George Osborne, also waded into the debate last week by writing a strongly worded letter to the FCA chairman. He wrote that he was \"profoundly concerned\" by the events, which he said had been damaging to the regulator as an institution and to Britain's reputation for regulatory stability and competence. Under the terms of the inquiry, Davis will examine why it took the FCA so long to issue its statement of clarification, whether a \"false or disorderly market\" was created, and who was responsible. The insurance industry had already been rocked by Osborne's surprise announcement in last month's budget ending the compulsory purchase of annuities \u2013 a retirement income scheme for pensioners. From next year those reaching retirement age will be able to decide how to spend their pension savings. The industry had not been consulted on the pension reform prior to the announcement, which Thoresen described as a \"genuine surprise\" on Tuesday.",

It will be a very big protest.\u201d</p> <p>Unions, he said, were also planning to stage mass demonstrations on Friday to coincide with the arrival in Athens of German chancellor Angela Merkel. \u201cEven if demonstrations are forbidden we will find a way,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe want to send a message to Europe that what has happened here has been totally counter-productive.

Put simply, the recovery is strengthening. We forecast world growth to be 3.6% this year and 3.9% next year, up from 3.0% last year. </p> <p><b>In advanced economies</b>, we forecast growth to reach 2.2% in 2014, up from 1.3% in 2013. </p> <p>The recovery which was starting to take hold in October is becoming not only stronger, but also broader. The various brakes that hampered growth are being slowly loosened. Fiscal consolidation is slowing, and investors are less worried about debt sustainability. Banks are gradually becoming stronger. Although we are far short of a full recovery, the normalization of monetary policy\u2014both conventional and unconventional\u2014is now on the agenda. </p> <p>Brakes are loosened at different paces however, and the recovery remains uneven. It is strongest in the United States, where growth is forecast to be 2.8% in 2014. </p> <p>It is also strong in the UK and Germany, where some imbalances persist, but where we forecast growth to be 2.9% and 1.7% respectively. </p> <p>In Japan, where we forecast 1.4% growth in 2014, fiscal stimulus has played a large role, and the strength of the recovery depends on private demand taking the relay. </p> <p>And, going back to the Euro area, the good news is that, for the first time in two years, Southern periphery countries are forecast to have positive, if admittedly still low, growth. But, while their exports are generally strong, internal demand is still weak, and it has to become stronger for the recovery to be sustained. </p> <p><b>Emerging and developing economies </b>continue to have strong growth, lower than before the crisis, but high nevertheless. We forecast their growth to reach 4.9% this year, slightly up from 4.7% last year. In particular, we forecast growth of 7.5% for China, and 5.4% for India. Of particular note is the performance of sub Saharan Africa, where we forecast growth of 5.4%. </p> <p>These emerging and developing economies have to operate however in a changing world environment. Stronger growth in advanced economies implies increased demand for their exports. The normalization of monetary policy in the United States, however, implies tighter financial conditions and a tougher financial environment. Foreign investors are less forgiving, macroeconomic weaknesses are more costly. And financial bumps, such as those we saw last summer and earlier this year, may well happen again.</p> <p><b>Acute risks have decreased, but risks have not disappeared. </b>Japan will need all three arrows if it is to both sustain growth and maintain fiscal sustainability. Adjustment and recovery in southern Euro countries cannot be taken for granted, especially if Euro area wide inflation remains very low or even, worse, turns to deflation, making the task of reestablishing competitiveness in the South even harder. As discussed in the Global Financial Stability Report, financial reform is incomplete, and the financial system remains at risk. Geopolitical risks have arisen, although they have not yet had global macroeconomic repercussions. </p> <p>Looking ahead, the focus must increasingly turn to the supply side, and I want to make three points: </p> <p>First, potential growth in many advanced economies is very low. This is bad on its own, but it also makes fiscal adjustment more difficult. In this context, measures to increase potential growth are becoming more important\u2014from rethinking the shape of some labor market institutions, to increasing competition and productivity in a number of nontradables sectors, to rethinking the size of the government, to reexamining the role of public investment. </p> <p>Second, although the evidence is not yet clear, potential growth in many emerging market economies also appears to have decreased. In some countries, such as China, lower growth may be in part a desirable byproduct of more balanced growth. In others, there is clearly scope for some structural reforms to improve the outcome. </p> <p>Finally, as the effects of the financial crisis slowly diminish, another trend may come to dominate the scene, namely rising inequality. Though inequality has always been perceived to be a central issue, until recently it was not seen as having major implications for macroeconomic developments.

This is not just a car making renaissance. Chemicals output is up 5.5% yoy, rubber and plastics rose 13.9%, basic metals 4.4%, machinery and other goods was up 9.2%. The production split by industrial grouping is interesting too. The recent strength is in consumer durables and intermediate goods. These are products that people buy, or produce, when they are optimistic about the economic future. And if there is one key story of the past six to twelve months in the UK, it is the return of belief in future growth.

Over to Greece again where unions in both the public and private sector are preparing to bring the country to a grinding halt tomorrow. But our correspondent, Helena Smith, says the government may also spring a surprise by announcing its first bond sale in more than four years on the same day: Unions are determined to make what will be Greece\u2019s 37th general strike a major affair. Public transport will be brought to a grinding halt, state offices and schools will be closed and ferries grounded. With private sector employees joining the walk-out, workers in pharmacies, banks and construction sites will also down tools. \u201cOur aim is to show the government that we remain totally opposed to policies that it continues to pass,\u201d Odysseus Trivalas, who heads the union of public sector employees ADEDY, told me this afternoon. \u201cOnly last week parliament endorsed more measures that break collective workers' agreements and will see another 25,000 civil servants losing their jobs. It will be a very big protest.\u201d Unions, he said, were also planning to stage mass demonstrations on Friday to coincide with the arrival in Athens of German chancellor Angela Merkel. \u201cEven if demonstrations are forbidden we will find a way,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe want to send a message to Europe that what has happened here has been totally counter-productive. Instead of saving Greece, its people are much worse off. We have lost close to 50% of our pay packets and at the same time the public debt is bigger than it was at the start of the crisis. Our fate could not be worse.\u201d But the government \u2013 perhaps buoyed by the latest poll showing public sentiment picking up \u2013 appears determined to seize the moment with officials and bankers suggesting that a foray into international markets may also be imminent. One banker said: \u201cAll the cards are in place for an issuance of five-year bonds to take place tomorrow\u201d. After almost four years being shut out of them, the step would be huge, both psychologically and symbolically, politicians say. \u201cIt is very important that Greece takes a very big step towards normality through a gradual and protected return to markets,\u201d the deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos announced late Monday. \u201cWhether we like it or not, the participation of a country in international markets is a sign of independence and sovereighty and it is important that markets appraise us so that the many mouths that, without any reason, make negative comments and don\u2019t respect the struggle and anguish of people are finally shut up. \u201c A return to markets would make a fitting prelude to Merkel\u2019s return to Athens. The German leader who was greeted by fiery protests when she last flew into Athens, has made clear that her visit \u2013 as of this afternoon still undecided in terms of timing and length, according to the German embassy in Athens - is a show of solidarity for Samaras. Tellingly, she will not be meeting Greece\u2019s radical left main opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras, whom aides describe as a \u201ctrouble maker.\u201d Despite overseeing a government of austerity, Samaras was voted the most suitable man for the post of prime minister in a GPO poll released Monday night. Almost 43 % of Greeks supported him in the role compared to 27.2 % for Tsipras whose message has been vehemently anti-austerity since the start of the debt crisis. Heads-up - the IMF is going to hold a discussion on the impact of inequality on Friday, and it wants to hear your questions.... Olivier Blanchard's slice of humble pie over the UK government's economic plan (see here) means George Osborne is unlikely to make too many jibes at the IMF, in a speech on Friday. Chris Giles of the FT reports: According to aides, the chancellor had planned an \u201cI told you so\u201d message, referring back to last year\u2019s battle with the IMF over austerity, but Treasury sources now say the speech will be mostly forward looking. More here: IMF sounds retreat on UK austerity Here's the UK Treasury's official response to the World Economic Outlook, and the news that the UK growth forecast this year has been hiked from 2.5% to 2.9% \u201cThe IMF forecast the UK to be the fastest growing major advanced economy this year. This is further evidence that the government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, providing economic security for hardworking people. But the job is not done. Budget 2014 set out the next stage of the plan that is creating a more resilient economy through support to businesses, savers, and exporters. The biggest risk now to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that's delivering a brighter economic future\u201d. And a reminder of the other key upgrades and downgrades: Here's an interesting chart from the World Economic Outlook, showing how eurozone economies suffered a much larger jump in unemployment than the rest of the world since the financial crisis began: Back in the UK, the NIESR thinktank has predicted that the UK economy grew by 0.9% in the first three months of this year. If they're right (and we find out later this month), that would mean growth accelerated compared to the end of 2013. From Washington, economics correspondent Phillip Inman reports that the IMF's concerns on income inequality overshadow its decision to upgrade UK growth forecasts: Britain will be the best performing of the world's major economies this year with growth of 2.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund, as consumer spending rebounds, inflation remains low and unemployment continues to fall steadily. But the Washington-based thinktank, which also acts as a lender of last resort to bankrupt countries, warned that the UK's recovery relied too heavily on easy credit, while business investment and exports remained weak. In its world economic outlook, published ahead of its spring conference in Washington, the IMF said steady growth in the US and the recent sharp turnaround in the UK's fortunes would benefit the global economy. However, the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, warned that income inequality was hurting many countries and becoming an important factor undermining the prospect for sustainable global growth. In his foreword to the WEO, Blanchard said \"as the effects of the financial crisis slowly diminish, another trend may come to dominate the scene, namely, increased income inequality\". Without pointing the finger at individual nations, he said a growing income and wealth divide was a longer-term problem for many nations, and not just those at the higher income scale. \"Though inequality has always been perceived to be a central issue, until recently it was not believed to have major implications for macroeconomic developments,\" he said. \"This belief is increasingly called into question. How inequality affects both the macroeconomy and the design of macroeconomic policy will likely be increasingly important items on our agenda.\" Here's Phillip's full report: UK to outperform other big economies with 2.9% growth, IMF predicts The IMF has uploaded the World Economic Outlook to its website - you can see the headlines here: Recovery Strengthening, but Requires Stronger Policy Effort Global economy to grow 3.6 percent in 2014 and 3.9 percent in 2015 Pick up in advanced economies but global recovery still uneven and subpar Risks include low inflation, potential capital flow reversals, and geopolitical uncertainties And the full report is here (pdf) From Brazil, Chancellor George Osborne has tweeted that the IMF forecasts are \"good news\", but there's more to do: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls also welcomed the new forecasts, but pointed out that the IMF sees growth slowing in 2015 to +2.5%, from +2.9% this year. Balls added: \u201cThese forecasts are welcome news after three damaging years when the economy flatlined and growth forecasts were repeatedly downgraded. Yet millions of working people, who are on average \u00a31,600 a year worse off since 2010, are still not feeling any recovery at all.\" The IMF press conference was briefly disrupted when Olivier Blanchard couldn't get a translation of a question. The word on the floor is that he suffered a moment of tech confusion - plugging his headphones into a dictaphone rather than the gadget used to translate into various languages. Easily done, Olivier..... The IMF's Olivier Blanchard has admitted that the Fund seriously underestimated the strength of the UK economy a year ago, in the press conference to discuss the World Economic Outlook (coverage start here) Ed Conway of Sky News reminded Blanchard about his famous (or perhaps notorious) warning in April 2013 that George Osborne was \"playing with fire\". Does the UK's strong recovery since mean he was wrong, or that the UK changed course? Blanchard eats a slice of humble pie, saying that it is fair to say that the IMF's forecast was too pessimistic, and growth has been much stronger than we forecast. Forecasting is an imperfect business, he says, and we clearly under-forecast on this occasion. But he also argues that the IMF was right to make its concerns public (at the time, the UK appeared to be close to a triple-dip recession). Part of our job is to warn about risks when we see them, says Blanchard, and of course not all risks come to pass. The stronger than expected growth in Britain recently is very good news for the UK, he concludes. A question about China's economic reforms. Thomas Helbling, Chief of the IMF's World Economic Studies Division, says the Fund welcomes Beijing's efforts to rebalance the economy. He cites plans to liberalise financial markets, and to open up markets to more competition. However, the effect of those reforms will be \"gradual\", and will drive medium-term growth rather than been seen this year or next. Today's report estimates that China will grow by 7.5% in 2014, and 7.3% next year. A question about Russia and the Ukraine - has the IMF assessed the impact of sanctions on the Russian economy, and is it confident that Ukraine can repay its debts? The IMF declines to discuss Ukraine, as talks over an aid package are ongoing. The IMF has already cut its growth forecast for Russia to +1.3%, down from 2% before. Olivier Blanchard says the Ukraine crisis has hurt an economic climate that was not perfect already, and has also created additional hesitation among those who could invest in Russia, or are considering taking their money out. Russia may also have to increase interest rates, suggests Blanchard, adding: Based on what has happened, growth in Russia will be lower than it would have been. Alex Brummer of the Daily Mail asks the IMF about the UK economy - is it worried about house prices are getting out of control? The IMF says that matters of financial stability are up to the Bank of England. The turnaround in the UK economy is proof that monetary policy has worked. Olivier Blanchard is taking questions now, at the press conference in Washington. The first question is about the eurozone, and Blanchard says that the IMF thinks \"there is a risk of deflation\" in the euro area. And if that happened, it would be even harder for countries to grow and tackle their debt levels. Everything should be done to avoid it, he says. Policymakers need to increase healthy growth. It's not just up to the European Central Bank, he adds. But, the ECB should consider all unconventional measures, including QE, and should implement them as soon as they are ready. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's top economist, has warned that the income inequality is a major threat as the recovery picks up, as he unveils the World Economic Outlook (see 2pm onwards). Here's his full opening remarks: The dynamics that were emerging at the time of the October 2013 World Economic Outlook are becoming more visible. Put simply, the recovery is strengthening. We forecast world growth to be 3.6% this year and 3.9% next year, up from 3.0% last year. In advanced economies, we forecast growth to reach 2.2% in 2014, up from 1.3% in 2013. The recovery which was starting to take hold in October is becoming not only stronger, but also broader. The various brakes that hampered growth are being slowly loosened. Fiscal consolidation is slowing, and investors are less worried about debt sustainability. Banks are gradually becoming stronger. Although we are far short of a full recovery, the normalization of monetary policy\u2014both conventional and unconventional\u2014is now on the agenda. Brakes are loosened at different paces however, and the recovery remains uneven. It is strongest in the United States, where growth is forecast to be 2.8% in 2014. It is also strong in the UK and Germany, where some imbalances persist, but where we forecast growth to be 2.9% and 1.7% respectively. In Japan, where we forecast 1.4% growth in 2014, fiscal stimulus has played a large role, and the strength of the recovery depends on private demand taking the relay. And, going back to the Euro area, the good news is that, for the first time in two years, Southern periphery countries are forecast to have positive, if admittedly still low, growth. But, while their exports are generally strong, internal demand is still weak, and it has to become stronger for the recovery to be sustained. Emerging and developing economies continue to have strong growth, lower than before the crisis, but high nevertheless. We forecast their growth to reach 4.9% this year, slightly up from 4.7% last year. In particular, we forecast growth of 7.5% for China, and 5.4% for India. Of particular note is the performance of sub Saharan Africa, where we forecast growth of 5.4%. These emerging and developing economies have to operate however in a changing world environment. Stronger growth in advanced economies implies increased demand for their exports. The normalization of monetary policy in the United States, however, implies tighter financial conditions and a tougher financial environment. Foreign investors are less forgiving, macroeconomic weaknesses are more costly. And financial bumps, such as those we saw last summer and earlier this year, may well happen again. Acute risks have decreased, but risks have not disappeared. Japan will need all three arrows if it is to both sustain growth and maintain fiscal sustainability. Adjustment and recovery in southern Euro countries cannot be taken for granted, especially if Euro area wide inflation remains very low or even, worse, turns to deflation, making the task of reestablishing competitiveness in the South even harder. As discussed in the Global Financial Stability Report, financial reform is incomplete, and the financial system remains at risk. Geopolitical risks have arisen, although they have not yet had global macroeconomic repercussions. Looking ahead, the focus must increasingly turn to the supply side, and I want to make three points: First, potential growth in many advanced economies is very low. This is bad on its own, but it also makes fiscal adjustment more difficult. In this context, measures to increase potential growth are becoming more important\u2014from rethinking the shape of some labor market institutions, to increasing competition and productivity in a number of nontradables sectors, to rethinking the size of the government, to reexamining the role of public investment. Second, although the evidence is not yet clear, potential growth in many emerging market economies also appears to have decreased. In some countries, such as China, lower growth may be in part a desirable byproduct of more balanced growth. In others, there is clearly scope for some structural reforms to improve the outcome. Finally, as the effects of the financial crisis slowly diminish, another trend may come to dominate the scene, namely rising inequality. Though inequality has always been perceived to be a central issue, until recently it was not seen as having major implications for macroeconomic developments. This belief is increasingly called into question. How inequality affects both the macroeconomy, and the design of macroeconomic policy, will likely be increasingly important items on our agenda for a long time to come. This 'heatmap', from today's World Economic Outlook, shows how emerging markets will continue to provide most of the growth in 2014: BREAKING: The International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast for UK growth this year, and expects the British economy to outpace its advanced rivals. The new World Economic Outlook predicts that UK GDP will rise by 2.9% in 2014, up from a previous forecast of 2.5% back in January. That's slightly faster than the US , where growth of 2.8% is expected, and much faster than Germany (+1.7%), and France (+1.0%). The IMF has also cut its forecast for Japan to +1.4% growth, down from 1.7%. The Fund expects the overall World Economy to grow by 3.6% this year, and 3.9% in 2015, both 0.1 percentage point lower than before. That is still an acceleration on last year's 3.0% growth. But it has cut its forecast for emerging markets by 0.2 percentage points, to +4.9% growth. In a statement, the IMF declared that \"global activity has broadly strengthened and is expected to improve further in 2014\u201315\". But while advanced economies look healthier (despite weak inflation) emerging market conditions have deteriorated. The Fund cited three key risks: emerging market risks have increased, there are risks to activity from lower-than-expected inflation in advanced economies, and geopolitical risks have resurfaced. Overall, the balance of risks, while improved, remains on the downside. More to follow, including highlights from the IMF press conference in Washington..... Just to update -- the International Monetary Fund releases the World Economic Outlook in 30minutes time. It will be packed with the latest economic forecasts for countries around the globe. The IMF will then hold a press conference. It will be webcast here. Reuters has polled 59 economists, and found that 55 of them believe eurozone inflation hit its lowest point in the current cycle last month, when it dropped to just 0.5%. The poll also found there is a 30% chance that the ECB will launch a quantitative easing programme. Europe's financial markets are in broad retreat now. The main indices down around 1% as the selloff that began on Wall Street last Friday continues to ripple through the markets. FTSE 100: down 67 points at 6555, German DAX: down 107 points at 9403 French CAC: down 45 points at 4390. It's a fairly broad sell-off -- with talk that investors are taking profits before companies start reporting earnings for the previous quarter. Sports Direct is dragging the London market down, it has now shed 10% after founder Mike Ashley sold \u00a3200m of shares last night (see earlier post for the details). Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, points out that the day began without the fresh Japanese stimulus that some had hoped for: Call it disappointment from the Bank of Japan, or continuing worries about the situation in Ukraine, or simply a continuation of the momentum selling that started on Friday, but for whatever reason the market continues to lose ground. A second consecutive day with little corporate news means that traders are picking off some of the more exposed names on the list. Previous star performers such as Sports Direct and Associated British Foods are being hit hard... Retail was one of the best-performing sectors in the first quarter, but the result of this was that many names were trading at chunky valuations, making them vulnerable to any momentum-driven selloff. Boris Johnson's chief economic advisor, Dr Gerard Lyons, reckons the Bank of England should hold its nerve and resist raising interest rates soon, despite UK manufacturing picking up pace in February. He tweets: Greece took another step towards financial normality this morning, selling short-term debt at the lowest interest rate since the debt crisis began four years ago. Athens sold \u20ac1.3bn of six-month bonds at yields of just 3.01%, the lowest since January 2010. Around 80% of the debt went to foreign investors, according to one official, who told Reuters: There was strong foreign interest, most of the issue went to foreign buyers. At the height of the crisis, most Greek debt was bought by Greek banks. Growing foreign interest in Greek debt is welcome, as the government prepares to auction longer-term bonds soon. Back in Greece, striking journalists are marching through Greece in an anti-austerity protest, ahead of tomorrow's general strike. University lecturer Spyros Gkelis tweets photos from the scene, via another eurocrisis watcher: We'll have more on the situation in Greece later today.... The pound has jumped a whole cent against the US dollar to $1.671, as traders anticipate that the manufacturing revival will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates sooner. Here's my colleague Angela Monaghan's news story on the manufacturing data: Heavy rainfall failed to dampen Britain's manufacturing sector in February with output growing much more strongly than expected, boosting the outlook for the wider economy. Manufacturing output jumped 1% to the highest level in more than two-and-a-half years, while the broader industrial production measure, which includes utilities and mining, was up 0.9% according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected much more modest growth of 0.3% for both measures, with some warning the wet weather may have disrupted activity. The figures provided a boost to the chancellor, who last month highlighted manufacturing and exports as a key priority in the budget as part of the government's wider ambitions to rebalance the UK economy away from a reliance on consumer spending and the financial services sector. More here: UK manufacturing sector shrugs off wet weather with February bounce ...and the CEBR agrees with Berenberg (last post) that the UK economy could grow by more than 3% this year, based on this morning's industrial output data (details start here) The Office for Budget Responsibility's latest estimate is that UK GDP will grow by 2.7% this year, but the CEBR's Danae Kyriakopoulou is more bullish: As the level of business confidence in the UK economy continues to improve we expect the momentum shown by today\u2019s data to carry forward into the next quarter. Overall Cebr expects UK GDP growth to exceed 3.0% in 2014 as a whole, placing the UK among the fastest-growing advanced economies this year, if not the fastest. But will the International Monetary Fund agree? We find out in three hours, when the World Economic Outlook is published..... Rob Wood of Berenberg bank says the 1% surge in UK manufacturing in February shows firms are benefitting from the Bank of England's loose monetary policy. The recovery in the eurozone could give another boost, he added: The UK rebound has much more momentum than consensus or the official forecasters seem to believe. Monetary policy is increasingly gaining traction and the recovery is snowballing into rising capital spending, real wages and more optimism. Of course, manufacturing is heavily dependent on world trade and the global cycle. The strengthening Eurozone economy, where most leading indicators now signal around trend growth soon, could well add another leg to the so far domestically led UK manufacturing recovery. The hard and soft data pose an upside risk to our already above consensus growth forecasts of 3.0% for 2014 and 3.3% for 2015. Wood also points out that the recovery is broad based: Manufacturing output gains were broad based across industries. This is not just a car making renaissance. Chemicals output is up 5.5% yoy, rubber and plastics rose 13.9%, basic metals 4.4%, machinery and other goods was up 9.2%. The production split by industrial grouping is interesting too. The recent strength is in consumer durables and intermediate goods. These are products that people buy, or produce, when they are optimistic about the economic future. And if there is one key story of the past six to twelve months in the UK, it is the return of belief in future growth. That is evidence in almost all forward looking business survey indicators, and increasingly in the hard data too. This chart, from the Indie's Ben Chu, makes the same point: Despite this good performance in February, production output across British industry remains below its pre-crisis peak. As this graph shows, manufacturing output only recently rose above its level in 2010: Not great, but the ONS says some other G7 rivals are struggling even more: On a global level, production output amongst the G7 nations has grown steadily since the trough reached in Q2 2009 and expanded by a further 1.2% in Q4 2013 compared with Q3 2013. Despite the upward trend achieved over the past four years, output [in the UK] remained 5.5% below the pre-downturn peak reached in Q1 2008. This experience does however vary by country; for example production output in Japan, France, the UK and Italy remained more than 10% below their respective pre- downturn peaks. On a related note, the Times has a nice graphic today, showing the UK's top 10 export markets. The US leads the way, followed by five European nations. China is only sixth, and there's no sign of the other BRIC nations: Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, agrees that Britain's manufacturings sector made a good start to 2014. Here's her view of today's survey: \u201cManufacturing output headed higher, buoyed by a strong pick up in the pharmaceuticals, transport and food sectors. Output now stands at its highest level in more than two and a half years with companies reporting good trading conditions both at home and in overseas markets. All manufacturing indicators are lining up for a strong first quarter growth rate, highlighting that industry remains a vital cog in the UK\u2019s continuing recovery.\u201d February's jump in industrial output suggests the UK economy posted solid growth in the first three months of this year. Here's Jeremy Cook of World First's take: \u201cThe strong expansion in pharmaceuticals this month \u2013 9.3% higher \u2013 comes after a 13.7% fall in the month previous, but strength was also reported in food and drink, and electronic sub-sectors. \u201cWe maintain our view that UK GDP will rise by 0.7% in Q1 following this number\u2026\u201d This chart from the ONS shows that Britain's manufacturing, pharmaceutical and mining companies drove February's jump in output: The instant reaction to this morning's strong UK manufacturing data is broadly favourable: Just in: Britain's industrial sector has recorded its strongest rise in industrial output since last summer, suggesting the UK recovery is gathering pace. Manufacturing output surged by 1.0% month-on-month in February, the biggest rise since September 2013. And the third monthly rise in a row. Economists has expected a rise of just 0.3%. On an annual basis, output is 3.8% higher, signalling that the sector has picked up over the last year. The wider measure of industrial production output (including energy and North Sea oil and gas) jumped by 0.9%, the biggest rise since June 2013. It's up 2.7% in the last year. Here's some key points from the Office for National Statistics: Production output increased by 2.7% between February 2013 and February 2014. This reflects increases of 3.8% in manufacturing; 8.5% in water supply, sewerage &amp; waste management and 0.2% in mining &amp; quarrying. The only decrease was in electricity, gas, steam &amp; air conditioning output, which decreased by 8.8% between February 2013 and February 2014. This was attributed to the average temperature in February 2014 being warmer than February 2013. Detail, and more reaction, to follow.... Greece's cleaning workers, laid off as part of government cutbacks, have become one of the emblems of public opposition to its austerity programme. Last November they famously forcing Troika officials to flee through a fire escape. They're back in action this morning, gathering outside the finance ministry to prepare for a meeting with finance minister Yannis Stournaras. Her's a photo, via Twitter: Some workers are already downing tools ahead of Wednesday's general strike, including journalists (who will be back on duty tomorrow) and dock workers: Some UK technology and high-growth stocks are coming under fresh pressure this morning, as fears of a tech stock rout linger. Internet fashion retailer ASOS has dropped another 5%, and Ocado are down 3.3%. Semiconductor maker CSR has dropped 2.5%, but its larger rival ARM is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, up 1.8% Billions has already been wiped off tech stocks in recent days, on fears that prices have been driven too high in recent months. Ishaq Siddiqi of ETX Capital comments: European equities pare early session gains to trade lower Tuesday, pressured by fresh geopolitical drama together with declines on Wall Street overnight where tech stocks continued their descent amid worries about inflated valuations \u2013 Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn all registered fat losses. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets was more cutting: The surprise is that it\u2019s taken investors so long to catch onto the fact that a lot of high growth stocks are trading on stupidly high valuations as companies like Twitter, Facebook, Pandora and Zynga continue to get pummelled. The FTSE 100 is down 16 points, or 0.2%, following a 1.4% drop on Japan's Nikkei overnight. In the financial markets, shares in UK retailer Sports Direct have tumbled 6% in early trading following the news yesterday afternoon that founder Mike Ashley had ditched \u00a3200m of shares. Ashley, one of Britain's richest people, took the surprise move just days after investors refused to support a new share incentive scheme that could have netted him over \u00a370m. The sale, to Goldman Sachs, cuts his stake to below 60%. Is it revenge on the City for blocking the precious bonus scheme? Ashley watchers are intrigued; he's also just taken an 11% stake in House of Fraser, in an apparent bid to block its sale to China's Sanpower. Retail analyst Nick Bubb comments: The latest share sale by Mike Ashley will certainly improve liquidity in Sports Direct, given the limited free float, but it will be interesting to see what sort of institutional appetite there is for the stock in the 850p-870p range, after the recent spike in the share price over 900p and the shenanigans over \u201cMad Mike\u2019s\u201d dealings in House of Fraser\u2026 Sports Direct are currently leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 55p at 840p, adding to yesterday's 3% drop. What a difference a year makes. Back in April 2013, the International Monetary Fund grabbed the headlines by warning that the UK was 'playing with fire', urging chancellor George Osborne to change his fiscal plans. Osborne was stung by the criticism from IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard. But ever since, the UK economy has been on an upward path. Britain's independent Office for Budget Responsibility raised its growth forecasts last month; economists say the IMF has every reason to do the same later today. According to the FT, Osborne will tell the IMF on Friday that its criticism last year was \"misplaced\", and outline \"a right-of-centre view of growth in a modern economy based on sound public finances, liberalised markets and tax reform\". Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. A big day for economic data lies ahead, as International Monetary Fund gathers with economists and journalists in Washington DC to announces its new World Economic Outlook. The IMF will release fresh projections for advanced and developing countries, and identify the biggest threats to the economic recovery. Since its previous forecasts in October we've seen inflation fears grow in the eurozone, tensions in the emerging markets, Japan's struggle to boost growth and inflation, and the Crimea crisis denting Russia's economic prospects -- all under the shadow of the Federal Reserve cutting its bond-buying stimulus programme. The report is issued at 2pm BST (9am Washington time), when the IMF will also give a press conference. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has already set the tone, warning last week that the global economy is still too weak for comfort. There's also plenty of UK data being issued today, including industrial production figures for February -- that should show if the manufacturing sector picked up as winter came to an end. And overnight, a survey has shown that exports from Britain's service sector has hit a record high as economic confidence grows. However, as many commentators have warned for some time, the recovery remains uneven: The quarterly poll of 8,000 firms by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) reports that service exports are at an all-time high and many key manufacturing balances are also at record levels, showing that growth is strengthening in the short term. However the survey also warned the recovery must become more balanced in the months ahead as it is still too reliant on consumer spending. Access to finance remains a critical issue for businesses as they look to expand, the report added. More here: UK business confidence surging, BCC survey shows We'll also be watching Greece, where anti-austerity protests are expected today ahead of tomorrow's general strike, along with all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The grocery market has fallen to its slowest pace of growth in at least 12 years, with all four major supermarket operators losing sales and market share in the first three months of 2014. Data from market research group Kantar says a late Easter and drop in grocery inflation are combining with the growing power of discounters Aldi and Lidl to pile pressure on Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda. Aldi shrugged off the problems of its bigger rivals to achieve a record 35.3% growth in sales in the 12 weeks to the end of March, taking its market share to 4.6%, just a step away from Waitrose's 5%. Lidl continued its rapid gains, with sales up 17.2%. The discounters are ratcheting up the pressure on the big four, which are also under attack from Waitrose at the top of the market. In a blow to the incoming chief executive, Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's showed its biggest drop in market share since 2005, as sales fell back by 1.7% \u2013 widening the gap between it and closest rival Asda to nearly a percentage point. Asda's sales also fell but it held market share almost steady at 17.4% while Sainsbury's slice of the grocery market slipped to 16.5% from 17% a month ago. Kantar director Ed Garner said Sainsbury's had suffered more than Asda from the late Easter, usually benefiting more than other stores from sales of British lamb and Easter eggs. The supermarket is also being measured against a strong performance last year when it had a clean sheet during the horsemeat scandal. Garner said: \"Sainsbury's figures are a surprise. If they have another period like that then we might start to worry.\" Tesco and Morrisons saw sales fall by 3% and 3.8% respectively in the period. Both the Tesco boss, Philip Clarke, and Morrisons chief executive, Dalton Philips, are under pressure to turn around months of falling sales. Clarke told the City in February he had accelerated his turnaround plan for Tesco with more store refurbishments in prospect and a planned \u00a3200m in price cuts on staple groceries. Morrisons has pledged \u00a31bn in price cuts and food quality investments over the next three years as it fights back against Aldi and Lidl. Clarke also appears to be responding to the latest round of criticism with an executive clearout. Chief financial officer Laurie McIlwee resigned last week amid rumours of a fall out with Clarke and on Tuesday it was reported that the head of the Clubcard loyalty scheme had departed. Online slide The UK's online retailers are the latest to suffer from a wave of cynicism about tech stocks sweeping around the globe. Online takeaway ordering service Just Eat yesterday fell 5.3% to 250p \u2013 its first full day of trading on the stock market, after it launched at 260p. Shares in AO World, the recently listed electrical appliances retailer, sank 5%, while online grocer Ocado's stock sank 6% and fashion retailer Boohoo was down 4.3%. Only Boohoo's bigger rival Asos escaped the carnage, with shares up just 0.8% \u2013 although its shares have dropped a third in the past month. Analysts said the rout, which reflects similar slumps on the US Nasdaq exchange and in Europe over recent days, was the result of investor moves away from riskier stocks where the share price is way ahead of the sales and profits achieved. Events in Ukraine, concerns about the slowing of quantitative easing in the US and reassessment of the risks and rewards from online retailing have all fed a flight to more stable stocks.",

The interim chief executive has in our view numerous challenges to confront. There is room for further downgrades if trading has continued to deteriorate and costs have been incurred trying to sell Early Learning Centre.  We are cutting our target price by 25% to 151p (from 200p)... as we expect further downside risk from the fourth quarter trading update and 2015 results... Furthermore, our cut in target price reflects our view that there is limited upside to the Mothercare business in 2014/15 and a risk that a new strategy and chief executive will be harder to find.  In our view, the most important issue to address is the lack of UK sales growth or improvement in sales densities across an over rented store base. Mothercare (excluding Direct from Home) has continually reported negative like for like sales since January 2010 and worse still steadily falling sales densities. In addition, the level of price discounts has led to gross profit falling faster than total cost savings or the benefit of closing loss making stores.  We believe another major issue is Early Learning Centre (ELC), which is rapidly becoming a liability, not an asset. UK ELC sales could fall by 18% to around \u00a395m this year (2013 \u00a3116m) and trading losses increase to an estimated \u00a38m, excluding central costs, across less than 40 ELC stores and 120 plus inserts in Mothercare shops.  ELC was bought and integrated by Mothercare for \u00a3113m in 2007 and the goodwill is valued at \u00a326.8m on the balance sheet (and \u00a39.5m of trade name goodwill). It has been reported in the financial media that ELC has been offered for sale by Lazard to numerous retailers (please note this is unsubstantiated) and we believe there has been a potential management buyout, although we think it could cost Mothercare to exit ELC and incur a further write-down of goodwill expose shareholders to a negative net asset value per share.  Furthermore, the international franchise business is showing signs of slowing growth potential as franchisees are taking less Mothercare stock and reporting lower sales growth rates in established markets. After the closure of the Australia and New Zealand businesses, we are cautious on the growth potential of sales and profits in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, UAE), Russia, Greece and Turkey while Mothercare and ELC only have limited exposure across about 20 countries.  We already expect Mothercare's 2014 underlying pre-tax profit to be \u00a37.3m (2013 restated to \u00a35.9m from \u00a38.3m) and see further risk to 2015 profits unless ELC is sold or further stores closed.  In our view, Mothercare's share price still has significant downside risk as any ELC deal could lead to further asset write-downs and expose Mothercare's weak balance sheet. </blockquote>",

Hopes of a bid from AT&amp;T have faded, while there are worries about outlook for future growth.

The bank's analysts have put an overweight rating on the shares with a 270p price target, saying: Vodafone shares have underperformed the FTSE by 10% over the last six weeks as regulatory and M&amp;A hopes have begun to fade.
