      "bodyText": "The chief executive of ITV has said now is the last chance for UK broadcasters to build a British Netflix, as the US streaming giant continues to grow at breakneck speed. The warning from Carolyn McCall, chief executive of the UK\u2019s largest free-to-air commercial broadcaster, follows protracted talks between the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV to create a credible domestic streaming rival to Netflix that have failed to bear fruit. McCall, who took over at ITV in January, has made developing a subscription video-on-demand service a priority \u2013 to sit alongside existing free service ITV Hub and a paid-for, ad-free version that allows access in Europe which has proved popular with holidaymakers \u2013 with a launch planned for next year. She says UK broadcasters have little time left to act, in concert or by developing their own services, or they will find it impossible to turn the tide against the invasion of the US-based global streaming superpowers Netflix and Amazon. \u201cI think the window is closing,\u201d McCall told the Guardian. Asked if ITV and its domestic rivals were effectively in the last chance saloon to develop British-focused competitor to Netflix, she said: \u201cOf course, which is why I think ITV feel we just want to get on. We know it\u2019s not going to be easy. We know it\u2019s not slam dunk. If we don\u2019t do it we will never do it. We have to take the plunge.\u201d McCall\u2019s comments follow Netflix\u2019s better-than-expected results last week, with a third-quarter record of new subscribers signing up, some 7 million, to take its global total to more than 137 million. As Netflix\u2019s core market gets closer to saturation, it is international markets that are driving growth with UK viewers flocking to the service making it one of the most important markets for the US giant. Netflix has almost 10 million UK subscribers, Sky has 9.6 million pay-TV subs and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video service has about 7.3 million. McCall said that to provide the best depth and breadth of content for an ITV subscription video-on-demand service, \u201cmust have\u201d content previously licensed to services such as Netflix would be kept in-house. There will be no more deals such as licensing Love Island, the ITV2 reality TV show, to Netflix. \u201cWhen we have commissioned content and it is run on ITV it is less likely we will [then] sell it to Netflix [for on-demand viewing],\u201d she said. \u201cLove Island is a good example. Love Island series one and two went on Netflix this summer before Love Island four started on ITV2. It is likely that we will need that for ITV\u2019s [new] service. As those sorts of deals end we have to think about what we need to do with our content. Would we do that deal again when we are building our own service, it is unlikely we would sell those rights.\u201d McCall said the best chance of creating a viable rival to Netflix is for the UK\u2019s public service broadcasters (PSBs) to join forces. However, she conceded that a joint venture between three such different businesses \u2013 the publicly-listed ITV, state-owned commercially funded Channel 4, and the BBC \u2013 is proving tricky. \u201cWe would like to collaborate with the PSBs because it just makes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we all have different ownership structures and we all have slightly different objectives. I would like to see partnerships in this and there is a lot of work going on to try and get that.\u201d ITV has a joint venture streaming service with the BBC, called BritBox. However, it is available only in the US. More than a decade ago the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV came together to build the video-on-demand service Kangaroo, which was due to launch in 2007, but it became tangled in red tape and was ultimately blocked by the competition regulator two years later.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has referred a racist incident on one of its flights to Essex police, after facing criticism that it did little to prevent a male passenger inflicting a tirade of racist abuse on a 77-year-old woman. The airline apparently did not remove the passenger from the flight from Barcelona, instead moving the woman from her seat. The man was filmed by a fellow passenger calling the woman an \u201cugly black bastard\u201d, and shouting \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me in a foreign language\u201d when she spoke to him in English with a Jamaican accent. UK resident David Lawrence filmed the incident, which happened on Friday on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted, and shared it on social media, resulting in a barrage of criticism of the airline\u2019s handling of the incident. The video shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats, while her daughter angrily tells him her mother is disabled which is why she is moving slowly. He can be heard shouting: \u201cI don\u2019t care whether she\u2019s fucking disabled or not \u2013 if I tell her to get out she gets out.\u201d The man proceeds to tell staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: \u201cIf you don\u2019t go to another seat I\u2019ll push you to another seat.\u201d In the footage, cabin crew appear to be doing little initially to stop the man\u2019s tirade, with a passenger in the row behind him telling him to stop the abuse. Then a cabin crew member can be heard saying to the man: \u201cDon\u2019t be so rude, you have to calm down,\u201d while other passengers call for the man to be thrown off the flight. The woman can be heard telling the man he stinks and needs a wash, before asking to be moved so she can sit next to her daughter. The woman\u2019s 53-year-old daughter told the Huffington Post that they were returning from a holiday designed to cheer her mother up, a year after the death of her father. The argument started because her mother \u2013 a member of the Windrush generation who came to the UK in the 1960s \u2013 has arthritis so it took her some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat. \u201cI know that if I was behaving like he was, or any other black person for that matter, police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight,\u201d she said. \u201cMum\u2019s really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief she\u2019s already experiencing. As for me, I\u2019m upset about the whole thing too \u2013 the fact that the passenger wasn\u2019t taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with,\u201d she said. She added that cabin crew denied hearing racist slurs and told her to ring customer services on Monday. The Labour MP for East Hull and shadow attorney general, Karl Turner, tweeted: \u201cHe should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police. \u201cWe assume the aircraft was in the UK. I fully expect Ryanair to confirm the situation if in fact it was their flight.\u201d The MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde, Stuart McMillan, tweeted: \u201cThis is really appalling Ryanair. You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.\u201d His fellow SNP politician Margaret Ferrier said: \u201cJust watched the shocking footage on a Ryanair aircraft, utterly disgusting. Racist male passenger should have been put off flight before it departed. Flight attendant incapable of responding appropriately. However, well done to passenger with black T-shirt that intervened \u2013 hero.\u201d The budget airline tweeted on Sunday that it had seen the footage and reported the incident to Essex police. It added: \u201cAs this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.\u201d A spokeswoman for Essex police said: \u201cThis incident, which we were made aware of this morning, is believed to have taken place on a plane at Barcelona airport. Essex police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported. \u201cWe are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Saudi Arabia has the most to lose from a sharp rise in oil prices | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Opec oil cartel chose its moment well. Inflationary pressures had been building in the global economy for years and stocks of crude were low. With Israel on top in the Yom Kippur war, Arab oil producers decided to step in. They announced production cuts and an oil embargo on the US and other western countries. The decision had far-reaching consequences. Oil prices more than quadrupled in a matter of months. Inflation rocketed, triggering demands for higher pay. Rising business costs led to job losses on a scale not seen since the 1930s. This was the moment, 45 years ago to the month, when the post-war boom ended and the era of stagflation began. Memories of October 1973 have been rekindled by the death of Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of a Saudi Arabian hit squad at the country\u2019s consulate in Turkey. The Saudi explanation that the dissident journalist died as a result of a fist fight has been viewed with scepticism. Donald Trump has said the consequences could be \u201cvery severe\u201d if the government in Riyadh is found to have ordered the killing. The White House has not specified whether \u201cvery severe\u201d includes the sort of punitive economic and financial sanctions recently imposed on Iran, but if it does the Saudis say they will retaliate by weaponising oil. The message is clear. Back off or we will hurt you just as we did in the 1970s. There would be serious economic consequences were events to unfold in this way. The price of crude rose after Trump announced sanctions on Iran, and Saudi Arabia is a much more significant player. Oil prices are already hovering around the $80 a barrel mark and would spike to well over $100 a barrel should Saudi impose significant output curbs. Oil hit a peak price, unadjusted for inflation, of $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008 and could easily return to that sort of level. The question, though, is whether the Sauds would be dumb enough to act in such a fashion, because the lesson of 1973 is that the short-term gains from cutting off oil supplies are outweighed by the long-term costs. What\u2019s more, the costs are higher and the benefits are smaller than they were in the 1970s. For a start, new sources of oil have emerged in the past four and a half decades. Saudi Arabia was second to Russia in the table of oil producers in 2016, with the US in third place as a result of the expansion of shale production. Saudi production matters, but not as much as it did. Developed economies are also much less oil-intensive than they were in the 1970s. That\u2019s partly the result of the shift from manufacturing to services, and partly because high oil prices in the 1970s encouraged industry to become more energy-efficient. In the past 25 years, the amount of energy needed per dollar of economic output has fallen by a third. The two oil shocks of the 1970s \u2013 the one in 1973-74 was followed by a second in 1979-80 - were both followed by deep recessions that brought the price crashing down. By the mid-1980s, a glut of crude meant oil prices adjusted for inflation had fallen by 75% from their peak. By then, oil-importing countries had realised their vulnerability and had begun diversifying into natural gas and nuclear. The biggest beneficiaries of Saudi output curbs today would be solar and wind producers. The unit cost of renewables has already fallen sharply as a result of technological advances, and each ratcheting up of oil prices will make solar and wind more competitive. If the west has become less oil-dependent, the opposite is true for Saudi Arabia, which, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund, needs oil prices of $85-87 a barrel to balance its budget. The country\u2019s reliance on oil revenues was exposed in the period between 2014 and 2016, when the price of crude collapsed from $110 to $30 a barrel. During that time, the Saudi budget deficit increased from 3.5% to 15.8% of GDP, necessitating unpopular austerity measures for a population grown accustomed to free public services, generous welfare benefits and subsidised energy. Riyadh knows that it needs to diversify out of oil, but the plan is to do so at a pace that does not lead to social unrest. Half of the population is under the age of 25 and the unemployment rate is more than 12%, a potentially combustible mix. The whole point of organising an investment conference this week that so many western politicians are now boycotting was to expand the non-oil sectors of the economy. What does all this mean? It means, simply, that the country with most to lose from a sharp rise in oil prices would be Saudi Arabia itself. Claims that western sanctions would prompt retaliatory action of such severity that they would derail the global economy are a gigantic bluff. All this, of course, assumes that the developed world adopts a get-tough approach with Saudi Arabia.

      "body": "<p>The Opec oil cartel chose its moment well. Inflationary pressures had been building in the global economy for years and stocks of crude were low. With Israel on top in the Yom Kippur war, Arab oil producers decided to step in. They announced production cuts and an oil embargo on the US and other western countries.</p> <p>The decision had far-reaching consequences. Oil prices more than quadrupled in a matter of months. Inflation rocketed, triggering demands for higher pay. Rising business costs led to job losses on a scale not seen since the 1930s. This was the moment, 45 years ago to the month, when the post-war boom ended and the era of stagflation began.</p> <p>Memories of October 1973 have been rekindled by the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/19/jamal-khashoggi-dead-saudi-arabian-state-television-confirms\">Jamal Khashoggi </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/19/jamal-khashoggi-dead-saudi-arabian-state-television-confirms\">at the hands of a Saudi Arabian hit squad</a> at the country\u2019s consulate in Turkey. The Saudi explanation that the dissident journalist died as a result of a fist fight has been viewed with scepticism. Donald Trump has said the consequences could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/18/trump-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-latest-dead-consequences-very-severe\">\u201cvery severe\u201d</a> if the government in Riyadh is found to have ordered the killing.</p> <p>The White House has not specified whether \u201cvery severe\u201d includes the sort of punitive economic and financial sanctions recently imposed on Iran, but if it does the Saudis say they will retaliate by weaponising oil. The message is clear. Back off or we will hurt you just as we did in the 1970s.</p> <p>There would be serious economic consequences were events to unfold in this way. The price of crude rose after Trump announced sanctions on Iran, and Saudi Arabia is a much more significant player. Oil prices are already hovering around the $80 a barrel mark and would spike to well over $100 a barrel should Saudi impose significant output curbs. Oil hit a peak price, unadjusted for inflation, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/12/oil.commodities\">$147 a barrel </a>in the summer of 2008 and could easily return to that sort of level.</p> <p>The question, though, is whether the Sauds would be dumb enough to act in such a fashion, because the lesson of 1973 is that the short-term gains from cutting off oil supplies are outweighed by the long-term costs. What\u2019s more, the costs are higher and the benefits are smaller than they were in the 1970s.</p> <p>For a start, new sources of oil have emerged in the past four and a half decades. Saudi Arabia was second to Russia in the table of oil producers in 2016, with the US in third place as a result of the expansion of shale production. Saudi production matters, but not as much as it did.</p> <p>Developed economies are also much less oil-intensive than they were in the 1970s. That\u2019s partly the result of the shift from manufacturing to services, and partly because high oil prices in the 1970s encouraged industry to become more energy-efficient. In the past 25 years, the amount of energy needed per dollar of economic output has fallen by a third.</p> <p>The two oil shocks of the 1970s \u2013 the one in 1973-74 was followed by a second in 1979-80 - were both followed by deep recessions that brought the price crashing down. By the mid-1980s, a glut of crude meant oil prices adjusted for inflation had fallen by 75% from their peak. By then, oil-importing countries had realised their vulnerability and had begun diversifying into natural gas and nuclear.</p> <p>The biggest beneficiaries of Saudi output curbs today would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/26/study-wind-and-solar-can-power-most-of-the-united-states\">solar and wind producers</a>. The unit cost of renewables has already fallen sharply as a result of technological advances, and each ratcheting up of oil prices will make solar and wind more competitive.</p> <p>If the west has become less oil-dependent, the opposite is true for Saudi Arabia, which, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arabia-imf/saudi-arabia-needs-oil-at-85-87-a-barrel-to-balance-budget-imf-official-idUSKBN1I30H7\">needs oil prices of $85-87 a barrel </a>to balance its budget. The country\u2019s reliance on oil revenues was exposed in the period between 2014 and 2016, when the price of crude collapsed from $110 to $30 a barrel. During that time, the Saudi budget deficit increased from 3.5% to 15.8% of GDP, necessitating unpopular austerity measures for a population grown accustomed to free public services, generous welfare benefits and subsidised energy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6dc0cbc5155901ca9a5450437af00d7a1750bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6dc0cbc5155901ca9a5450437af00d7a1750bb4/0_91_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Funeral of a senior Houthi official who was killed by a Saudi-led coalition airstrike in Sanaa, Yemen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The funeral of a senior Houthi official who was killed by a Saudi-led coalition airstrike in Sanaa, Yemen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hani Mohammed/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Riyadh knows that it needs to diversify out of oil, but the plan is to do so at a pace that does not lead to social unrest. Half of the population is under the age of 25 and the unemployment rate is more than 12%, a potentially combustible mix. The whole point of organising an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/18/liam-fox-pulls-out-of-saudi-event-over-alleged-of-jamal-khashoggi\">investment conference</a> this week that so many western politicians are now boycotting was to expand the non-oil sectors of the economy.</p> <p>What does all this mean? It means, simply, that the country with most to lose from a sharp rise in oil prices would be Saudi Arabia itself. Claims that western sanctions would prompt retaliatory action of such severity that they would derail the global economy are a gigantic bluff.</p> <p>All this, of course, assumes that the developed world adopts a get-tough approach with Saudi Arabia. So far there is no real evidence of them planning to take the kind of action Riyadh really fears - cutting off supplies of military hardware.

Many of the people who voted to \u201cleave Europe\u201d follow closely the ups and downs of the teams in the Premier League, teams whose stars and managers are often from, well, \u201cEurope\u201d. It is unimaginable that any football fan would want his or her team to descend from the Premier League to the lowest, just like that. Yet that is not unlike what this country would be doing if the wishes of the Brexit extremists were to be realised. The analogy was made recently by a man who ought to know, namely the distinguished French civil servant Pascal Lamy. Lamy is a former director of the World Trade Organisation, into whose rulebook hard Brexiters wish to precipitate us if a stop is not put to Brexit. At a recent event at the London School of Economics in honour of the late Peter Sutherland \u2013 the man who set up the WTO and whom Lamy succeeded \u2013 the latter could hardly have put it more plainly: \u201cThe internal market is the top league. The WTO is the bottom.\u201d The internal market is usually referred to in the UK as the single market, of which Mrs Thatcher was a passionate supporter, arguing that it would give the UK economy \u201caccess to over 300 million of the world\u2019s most prosperous people, bigger than Japan, bigger than the US. It\u2019s not some bureaucrat\u2019s dream \u2013 it\u2019s for real.\u201d The propagation and membership of the internal/single market was considered by former Tory chancellor Kenneth Clarke to be Margaret Thatcher\u2019s greatest achievement. But, thanks to the trade agreements the EU has with a fair proportion of the rest of the world, as the Office for Budget Responsibility reminds us in its Discussion Paper No 3, \u201cwhen added to the 49% share of UK trade accounted for by members of the EU, altogether [existing] trade agreements reduce or eliminate tariffs for around 66% of UK trade.\u201d The idea of crashing out of the EU and trying to set up new trade agreements from scratch in a world that is going protectionist fast is, or ought to be, for the birds. Now, most media comment about recent OBR pronouncements has concerned speculation about the \u201cwiggle room\u201d that might or might not be available to Philip Hammond in his budget next week. For me the OBR\u2019s observations about the impact of even the mere prospect of Brexit are the real fascination. The idea that Hammond has \u201croom for manoeuvre\u201d with a budget in the midst of the post-referendum chaos should be seen in the context of a timely report by the Nuffield Foundation and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Within the off-putting carapace of its title \u2013 Understanding and Confronting Uncertainty: Revisions to UK Government Expenditure Plans \u2013 the authors spell out how public spending plans are subject to continual adjustment as economic growth usually turns out to be less than indicated by the ambitious forecasts on which spending plans are based. The OBR reminds us that, since the referendum, \u201cthe UK moved from being close to the top of the G7 GDP growth range in early 2016 to close to the bottom in 2018\u201d. It goes on: \u201cBusiness investment appears to have been depressed by uncertainty \u2026 while the prospect of weakened access to foreign markets has pushed the exchange rate lower, raising inflation.\u201d The traditional boost to the economy from a devaluation has been thwarted by the internationalisation of supply chains, \u201cwhich means that many UK exports have a high import content\u201d, but also (and I suspect principally) by \u201cthe uncertainty for exporters created by the referendum result (which may have inhibited investment in new capacity), and resilient demand for imports\u201d. What this economy needs is a statesmanlike \u2013 or stateswomanlike \u2013 decision to admit that continued membership of the EU is in our best interests, and an admission that we are living in cloud cuckoo land if we do not accept the argument of the veteran economist Robert Neild \u2013 referred to recently in this column \u2013 that better public services require higher taxes. In his Quinlan lecture at the Foreign Office last week, Sir John Major described the prospect of Brexit as \u201ca colossal misjudgment\u201d. He went on to say that once the damage became clear, \u201cI believe those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for. They persuaded a deceived population to be weaker and poorer. That will never be forgotten \u2013 nor forgiven.\u201d But it is not too late.

      "bodyText": "What does the future hold for US tech stocks? The coming weeks will tell, as eight of the most dominant technology companies report results. Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent), Amazon, Snap Inc (Snapchat), Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Spotify are all scheduled to report quarterly results between now and the start of November, with four of them making their announcements on the same day. The results will come after a difficult month for the tech companies. Just over two weeks ago, the worst drop in the Dow Jones average in eight months was led by sharp declines in technology stocks, mirrored on the Nasdaq. That Wednesday, the best-performing stocks over the past year \u2013 which include the so-called Faang companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2013 took some of the biggest losses. Amazon was down 6.2% and Netflix 8.4%. There were several factors contributing to the drop, concerns over trade tensions between the US and China and rising interest rates being the most prominent. Tech companies tend to be highly leveraged, so can be vulnerable to rising interest rates. The EU\u2019s planned tax on technology firms is also putting them under pressure. The first to report, on Wednesday, will be Microsoft, releasing first-quarter results. Attention will be focused on whether the company\u2019s Azure cloud computing service is driving growth. The platform has been used by a number of governments recently. Next up, \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d will see Alphabet, Amazon, Snap Inc and Twitter all report on the same day. For Alphabet, analysis from Hargreaves Lansdown highlights the recent \u20ac4.3bn fine the EU slapped on Google, but says it expects growth in revenue numbers. Separately, the company has been investing heavily in areas such as self-driving cars and cloud computing. Amazon is expected to have enjoyed strong revenue growth, according to the analysts, with services such as Prime and Alexa making increasing progress, as is the company\u2019s web services division. Snap Inc, parent of social media app Snapchat, will also report third-quarter results. Investors saw some light earlier this month when chief executive Evan Spiegel said that he hoped the company would turn a profit next year. Finally for Thursday, Twitter will also make a third-quarter announcement. In July, its shares dropped by more than 20% after it reported a drop of a million users following its action to delete fake and offensive accounts. At the time, the social media platform told investors to expect user numbers to fall further as it took action to block fake accounts. One of the most eagerly anticipated results will be Facebook\u2019s: its third-quarter results will be reported on 30 October. In the summer, the company said that revenue growth would continue to slow in the second half of this year. Daily and monthly active users on the site fell for the first time in the second quarter of this financial year. When Apple reports on 1 November, the focus will be on whether the high price of the iPhones has affected the demand for the handsets. Hargreaves Lansdown analysts say they are hopeful of a strong result, but warn that a slowdown in the US market\u2019s first $1tn company would not be taken well on the markets.",

      "body": "<p>What does the future hold for US tech stocks? The coming weeks will tell, as eight of the most dominant technology companies report results.</p> <p>Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent), Amazon, Snap Inc (Snapchat), Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Spotify are all scheduled to report quarterly results between now and the start of November, with four of them making their announcements on the same day.</p> <p>The results will come after a difficult month for the tech companies. Just over two weeks ago, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/10/dow-jones-drops-800-points-stock-markets\" title=\"\">worst drop in the Dow Jones average in eight months</a> was led by sharp declines in technology stocks, mirrored on the Nasdaq. That Wednesday, the best-performing stocks over the past year \u2013 which include the so-called Faang companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2013 took some of the biggest losses. Amazon was down 6.2% and Netflix 8.4%.</p> <p>There were several factors contributing to the drop, concerns over trade tensions between the US and China and rising interest rates being the most prominent. Tech companies tend to be highly leveraged, so can be vulnerable to rising interest rates. The EU\u2019s planned tax on technology firms is also putting them under pressure.</p> <p>The first to report, on Wednesday, will be Microsoft, releasing first-quarter results. Attention will be focused on whether the company\u2019s Azure cloud computing service is driving growth. The platform has been used by a number of governments recently.</p> <p>Next up, \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d will see Alphabet, Amazon, Snap Inc and Twitter all report on the same day. For Alphabet, analysis from Hargreaves Lansdown highlights the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/18/google-faces-record-multibillion-fine-from-eu-over-android\" title=\"\">\u20ac4.3bn fine the EU slapped on Google,</a> but says it expects growth in revenue numbers. Separately, the company has been investing heavily in areas such as self-driving cars and cloud computing.</p> <p>Amazon is expected to have enjoyed strong revenue growth, according to the analysts, with services such as Prime and Alexa making increasing progress, as is the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/02/amazon-web-services-the-secret-to-the-online-retailers-future-success\" title=\"\">web services division</a>. Snap Inc, parent of social media app Snapchat, will also report third-quarter results. Investors saw some light earlier this month when chief executive Evan Spiegel said that he hoped the company would turn a profit next year.</p> <p>Finally for Thursday, Twitter will also make a third-quarter announcement. In July, its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/27/twitter-share-price-tumbles-after-it-loses-1m-users-in-three-months\" title=\"\">shares dropped by more than 20%</a> after it reported a drop of a million users following its action to delete fake and offensive accounts. At the time, the social media platform told investors to expect user numbers to fall further as it took action to block fake accounts.</p> <p>One of the most eagerly anticipated results will be Facebook\u2019s: its third-quarter results will be reported on 30 October. In the summer, the company said that revenue growth would continue to slow in the second half of this year. Daily and monthly active users on the site fell for the first time in the second quarter of this financial year.</p> <p>When Apple reports on 1 November, the focus will be on whether the high price of the iPhones has affected the demand for the handsets. Hargreaves Lansdown analysts say they are hopeful of a strong result, but warn that a slowdown in the US market\u2019s first $1tn company would not be taken well on the markets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You wish fervently for something then, when it happens, it\u2019s not what you hoped for at all. That is how central bankers must be feeling as they watch corporate debt soar to record highs. They wanted companies to borrow and grow, but not like this. Last week, this concern was visible in the minutes of Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee. They show that the committee, which overseas bank lending and is chaired by governor Mark Carney, likened a rapid growth in lending to indebted companies around the world to the US sub-prime mortgage market, which triggered the 2008 financial crisis. For a sober, usually reticent group of regulators, comparing today\u2019s corporate borrowing boom to the reckless years before 2008 is a sit-up-and-take-notice moment. The trillions of dollars of cheap money pumped out by Threadneedle Street, the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan over the past 10 years had to find a home. The hope was that companies starved of cash would take the money and invest in new machinery and processes. Instead they appear to have done two other things. The first was to borrow enough to pay off old debts. This is classic zombie behaviour and leaves the company\u2019s managers without any funds for investment. If they make a profit it is because workers can accept low pay and poor conditions now that cheap borrowing keeps their bills low. The second destination for central bank money was property \u2013 seen as a safe haven investment when a punt on new machinery seemed like a silly gamble. Central bankers must have known this might happen. They work on the basis that a business cycle of eight to 10 years culminates in a recession. During the recession, interest rates climb and firms that borrowed heavily and failed to improve profits go out of business. The financial crash was so big that it caught out good businesses and bad. To prevent a calamity, the bank cut interest rates, and expanded the money supply, which saved the bad firms and the good. That banks are lending to businesses that have done little with their previous borrowing is a worry. The debt just piles up, and too often continues to be used to pay off old debts. Not just once, but on a rolling programme of debt funding. That the money pumped up property prices is not much better. That has obvious consequences too. As the committee points out, this is a global trend and not just part of the UK narrative. Maybe that makes UK policymakers feel better. Yet it just means that when the crash comes, it will be more bloody. Is there a remedy? The Bank of International Settlements, the grouping of central bankers based in Basel, says interest rates should be going up in the developed world and, more importantly, more should be done to make commercial banks pass on the effect to customers. For some time, the response from high street banks has been to keep interest low by squeezing their margins and making up for the loss of profit by lending even more. However, when so much commercial activity is based on ultra-low interest rates, the BIS remedy matches Lord King\u2019s warning to regulators after the collapse of Northern Rock \u2013 namely that when the party is in full swing, they have to be prepared to take away the punch bowl. Is the party in full swing? Full employment would tell them it is. On the other hand, pay that is still below 2008 levels on average would say the party hasn\u2019t even started. Full swing or not, high street banks cannot help themselves when it comes to reckless lending, which leaves regulators contemplating more direct intervention. Given the potential for another calamity, direct intervention should be an option. Lies, damned lies and China\u2019s GDP The regularity with which China\u2019s official growth figure comes in smack on forecast confirms the assertion, attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. No serious observer believes that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy is actually growing at 6.5% a year, or anything like it. The real story in China is of an economy that was slowing even before Donald Trump imposed his protectionist measures. Its exports were actually robust in the third quarter, as US companies brought forward purchases of Chinese goods to avoid paying tariffs. China\u2019s problems are mainly of a homegrown nature. It avoided calamity during the global recession of a decade ago, through a combination of public and private debt. State-owned enterprises were kept afloat, and cheap credit fuelled a housing boom. Rising property prices allowed Chinese consumers to use their homes as cash machines, and this boosted demand for cars and other durables. In the past few years, China\u2019s policymakers have been trying to do what proved impossible in the west: deflate the bubble without causing a massive recession. All the talk has been of slower but better balanced growth. If only. Balanced growth would mean production shifting away from inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) towards private companies. In recent months, China\u2019s policy makers have been doing the opposite. Purchases from SOEs have increased while loans to the private sector have been restricted. Restrictions on credit have eased. With the impact of Trump\u2019s trade war yet to be fully felt, Beijing will increase the scale of its stimulus. In the short term, this will lead to a pick-up in growth \u2013 but will harm the country\u2019s long-term growth and make a future bust more likely. Another Gatwick runway should be stopped Barely has Gatwick seen one runway scheme cut down than up it pops, like an asphalt-spewing hydra, with two. Having seen its expansion plans knocked back by the government in favour of Heathrow, the West Sussex airport, unabashed, has unveiled a masterplan to turn its emergency runway into a fully operational second landing strip, and safeguard land beyond its perimeter for a possible third runway. This latest proposal has the backing of businesses and the London mayor \u2013 chiefly, one might surmise, for not being Heathrow. The competing merits of expansion at the rival airports could fill a book \u2013 as, of course, they have: the Airports Commission answered this question in two lengthy tomes, over years of consultation and research. So why is it being asked again? Gatwick\u2019s 15-year plan makes it clear that it could handle substantially more flights just by maximising the output on its existing single runway. Turbocharging that growth with another strip of tarmac raises several questions. On a practical level, there is still a back-of-the-envelope whiff to this. Accepted wisdom has long been that the airport\u2019s dimensions could not accommodate two runways; widening the emergency runway may not convince the safety regulators. Also, the commission made it clear that only one more runway in the south-east would made economic sense \u2013 and give Britain a reasonable shot at meeting its climate change targets. The UN\u2019s warning this month of the devastation expected beyond another 1.5C of temperature rises might have given the airport expansionists a moment\u2019s pause. More airport capacity is available and more is coming, at a time when economic jitters and Brexit could dampen demand for air travel. Few require, or will benefit from, these additional runways bar Gatwick\u2019s biggest shareholder, GIP, which aims to cash in its 42% stake and needs to sell a vision of ever more planes over southern skies.",
