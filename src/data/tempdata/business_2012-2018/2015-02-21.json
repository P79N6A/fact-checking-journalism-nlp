    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "German officials chose a suitably Greek metaphor last week as they rejected the anti-austerity Syriza government\u2019s initial demands, accusing finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and his colleagues of wheeling out a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d. As the fraught talks played out, however, instead of an army of fearsome Greek warriors emerging at Varoufakis\u2019s side, it appeared more like one weary foot-soldier, waving an enormous white flag. It all started so promisingly. As their first confrontation with the eurogroup of finance ministers approached, Varoufakis and his prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, had waxed bold about their determination to wake up Europe, and free the single currency\u2019s members from austerity. They made a strong moral and practical case. Since the much-hated troika of creditors (the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission) imposed their \u20ac240bn (\u00a3177bn) \u201cbailout\u201d on Greece, unemployment has soared, the debt-to-GDP ratio has rocketed and output has collapsed. Greece\u2019s people have undergone hardship on a scale not seen in a developed country since the 1930s. At the same time, Athens was effectively forced to subcontract economic policymaking to the troika, with its budgets pored over line by line by unelected foreign officials. And as the Jubilee Debt Campaign recently pointed out, more than half of the bailout funds went not to keep schools and hospitals open, but to repay the private sector speculators, in many cases German and French banks, that lent recklessly to Greece in the runup to the crisis, charging the government in Athens little more to borrow at the time than they asked of the parsimonious Germans. Tsipras and Varoufakis were right to question the virtue of austerity as a catalyst for economic recovery, too. The ECB\u2019s recent decision to unleash a \u20ac60bn-a-month quantitative easing programme underlines the fact that demand in the eurozone economies remains weak and the recovery fragile. Yet once Varoufakis and his colleagues were in the harsh spotlight of the world\u2019s media in Brussels, they appeared ill-equipped for the brutal battle. For one thing, they appeared to give away many of their strongest cards almost as a starting point. Debt forgiveness, much talked about during the campaign, seemed to be off the agenda; \u201cGrexit\u201d, which should have been Varoufakis\u2019s nuclear option, seemed ruled out from the start. While extremely risky, default and devaluation could have offered the Greek economy a re-set; and the market chaos that would inevitably follow would exact a high price for other eurozone members. Varoufakis should surely have left that possibility hanging like a sword over last week\u2019s talks, instead of insisting in his long-winded introductory remarks \u2013 later leaked to the press \u2013 that \u201cGreece is a permanent and inseparable member of the European Union and our monetary union\u201d. Perhaps it was a tactic, but there was a lot of bluster and very few numbers in Greece\u2019s initial proposals. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble also has a democratic mandate and he was always going to want to see how Athens would make the sums add up. In the end, when Friday night\u2019s deal was announced, it was hard to see what Varoufakis had salvaged. Admittedly no one used the word \u201cbailout\u201d, instead referring to \u201cthe Master Facility Agreement\u201d. But Greece will accept the supervision of the troika (without calling it such), submitting detailed reform proposals for review by the end of Monday; it will refrain from \u201crowing back\u201d on reforms where they might endanger \u201cfiscal sustainability\u201d; and it will seek an extension of financial support, \u201con the basis of the conditions of the current arrangement\u201d. What\u2019s more, instead of the six-month bridging loan it had asked for, it will get just four months\u2019 grace. There was a mention in Friday\u2019s statement of \u201cmaking best use of the given flexibility\u201d in the bailout programme; and a promise to \u201ctake the economic circumstances in 2015 into account\u201d, when judging whether Greece has met its budget targets, which should allow a little wriggle room. Funds will also remain available to recapitalise Greek banks \u2013 essential given that a slow-motion bank run was gathering pace. And there is an argument that putting faith in the \u201cinstitutions\u201d of the IMF, the ECB and the European commission, instead of euro ministers, to test Syriza\u2019s plan, may weaken Germany\u2019s power of veto. But at best, this looks like a modest loosening of Greece\u2019s fiscal \u2013 and political \u2013 straitjacket. Athens has won back the right to determine some of its own economic policies \u2013 but only if these continue to achieve the degree of austerity rubber-stamped by its creditors. That will be tough. There is much negotiation still to be done; but Varoufakis and his colleagues will now have to try and rebuild the shattered Greek economy, and fulfil the vaulting aspirations of their voters, under the watchful eyes of the reviled troika.",

      "standfirst": "<p>The ageing fleet of delivery vehicles is long past due an overhaul. Among the common-sense upgrades employees want: air conditioning and more workspace</p>", 
      "body": "<p>For the better part of the last 30 years, the flatulent buzz of the US Postal Service\u2019s boxy delivery vans \u2013 audible as they lighted from mailbox to mailbox \u2013 has been a familiar sound to most Americans. Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays the USPS\u2019s mail trucks from the swift completion of their appointed rounds, as the postal service\u2019s unofficial motto would have it. Now the ageing workhorses are heading to the scrap yard, and a $6.3bn dollar battle to replace them has begun.<br></p> <p>The postal service has let automobile manufacturers know that it\u2019s ready to replace the truck at the core of its current postal fleet, the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, or LLV, the newest of which were built in 1994. Last month, the agency <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=e4c65069740a6b4df5158fb0a9512b1c&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0\">issued a request for information</a> \u2013 a document asking manufacturers to to outline what what sort of replacements they are capable of producing \u2013 signaling the lead-in to the bidding process. The manufacturer that eventually places the winning (read: lowest) bid will have cause to celebrate. The postal service says it needs 180,000 new vehicles, which it estimates will cost $25,000 to $35,000 each. In other words, the contract could be worth as much as $6.3bn.</p> <p>The LLV consists of a Grumman-built aluminum body riding atop a GM chassis adapted from the Chevrolet S10 compact pickup truck. Although a vast improvement over the rudimentary mail jeeps that came before them, they were hardly modern, even in 1987 when USPS began buying them. The first units were powered by the \u201cIron Duke\u201d, a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine that had been in GM\u2019s powertrain lineup since 1977, although later versions received an updated engine.

      "bodyText": "For the better part of the last 30 years, the flatulent buzz of the US Postal Service\u2019s boxy delivery vans \u2013 audible as they lighted from mailbox to mailbox \u2013 has been a familiar sound to most Americans. Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays the USPS\u2019s mail trucks from the swift completion of their appointed rounds, as the postal service\u2019s unofficial motto would have it. Now the ageing workhorses are heading to the scrap yard, and a $6.3bn dollar battle to replace them has begun. The postal service has let automobile manufacturers know that it\u2019s ready to replace the truck at the core of its current postal fleet, the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, or LLV, the newest of which were built in 1994. Last month, the agency issued a request for information \u2013 a document asking manufacturers to to outline what what sort of replacements they are capable of producing \u2013 signaling the lead-in to the bidding process. The manufacturer that eventually places the winning (read: lowest) bid will have cause to celebrate. The postal service says it needs 180,000 new vehicles, which it estimates will cost $25,000 to $35,000 each. In other words, the contract could be worth as much as $6.3bn. The LLV consists of a Grumman-built aluminum body riding atop a GM chassis adapted from the Chevrolet S10 compact pickup truck. Although a vast improvement over the rudimentary mail jeeps that came before them, they were hardly modern, even in 1987 when USPS began buying them. The first units were powered by the \u201cIron Duke\u201d, a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine that had been in GM\u2019s powertrain lineup since 1977, although later versions received an updated engine.
