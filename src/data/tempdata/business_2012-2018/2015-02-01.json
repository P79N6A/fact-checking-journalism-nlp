    "webTitle": "Labour launches stinging attack on Boots boss Stefano Pessina", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labour has launched a stinging attack on the billionaire boss of high street chemist Boots after he accused the opposition party of promoting policies that would lead the country to catastrophe. In a sign of rising tensions ahead of the general election on 7 May, Douglas Alexander, the head of Labour\u2019s election campaign, described the comments by Stefano Pessina as \u201crubbish\u201d, while Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the electorate was unlikely to listen to someone who does not live or pay tax in the UK. Pessina lives in Monte Carlo, with a fortune estimated at \u00a37.5bn. Boots was targeted by tax campaigners when it moved its formal tax residence from Britain to Switzerland following Pessina\u2019s private equity-backed buyout in 2007. Last year when Pessina merged Boots with US group Walgreens, there were plans to move the headquarters from the US to Switzerland for tax reasons, although the idea had to be abandoned in the face of a US political row and a potential customer backlash. The weekend row started with Pessina, the 74-year-old acting chief executive of the newly-merged Walgreens Alliance Boots, saying that if Labour politicians acted in the way that they spoke \u201cit would be a catastrophe\u201d. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Pessina said: \u201cThe problem is would they [Labour] act that way or not? One thing is to threaten and to shout but it is completely different to be in charge and to manage the country day-to-day ... [and if they did it would be] not helpful for business, not helpful for the country and in the end it probably won\u2019t be helpful for them.\u201d Pessina, whose company has 2,500 shops and employs 70,000 staff in Britain, declined to say which policies he particularly objected to but there has been previous criticism by business executives of Labour promises to reintroduce a 50p top rate of income tax, freeze prices in the energy sector and impose restrictions on the size of high street banks. Alexander led the fight back, telling the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show: \u201cHonestly, it is rubbish. It tells you much more about the agenda of the newspapers than it tells you about the agenda of Ed Miliband and the Labour party. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re doing well, we\u2019re going on to victory.\u201d Umunna later went further, saying it was important that the voice of business was heard during the general election campaign, not least on Europe. But he said: \u201cThe British people and British businesses will draw their own conclusions when those who don\u2019t live here, don\u2019t pay tax in this country and lead firms that reportedly avoid making a fair contribution in what they pay, purport to know what is in Britain\u2019s best interests.\u201d The Conservatives insist they had nothing to do with Pessina\u2019s comments but George Osborne took the unusual step of providing a direct quote highlighting the businessman\u2019s stance. The party has previously been known to approach business people to speak out on sensitive political issues such as the Scottish independence referendum. \u201cWe are not going to stand a Tory analysis of our economic policy from someone who is worth \u00a37.5bn and does not pay tax in this country,\u201d a senior Labour source said, suggesting that Miliband would also address the criticism head-on. The pre-election temperature will be raised further by a speech to be delivered by Marcus Bowman, president of the UK Chamber of Shipping, at the organisation\u2019s annual dinner on Monday night in London, which will accuse political parties of engaging in anti-business rhetoric. He will say: \u201cThe Labour party \u2013 seemingly more pro-Europe \u2013 is laying down a policy agenda that amounts to more tax, more spending and more regulation. To business, this is not an economic strategy but a political one. Again, they should think long and hard about the messages they are sending out, and the impact their policies will have.\u201d Bowman, a shipping lawyer, will not confine his criticism to Labour but also attack the Conservative party for engaging in anti-European rhetoric in a bid to head off its own criticism from Ukip. \u201cThe institutions of the EU are flawed, the commission is often aloof, and less engaged with industry than it should be. The whole thing is in need of reform \u2013 but we should think long and hard about what reforms we need, and what leaving the single market would mean for our business, our workforce and our country.\u201d Bowman will say: \u201cSome of the rhetoric from all parties is decidedly anti-business, and is causing deep uncertainty among those who would want to invest, create jobs and contribute more to the economy.\u201d As he fought back against the \u201cagenda of the newspapers\u201d, Alexander claimed Miliband was suffering negative coverage in the right-wing press because the party is on course for victory in May\u2019s election. He declined to rule out doing a deal with the Scottish National party if Labour fails to win a majority but made it clear that his party would not contemplate abandoning Trident as the price for an alliance. This is one of the three conditions demanded by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon in relation the possibility of a tie-up with Miliband. A spokesman for Walgreens Boots Alliance said: \u201cThe comments made by Stefano Pessina were a small part of a much larger conversation and have been taken out of context. Stefano Pessina was expressing his personal views only and is not campaigning against Ed Miliband or the Labour party. \u201cIndeed, he previously held good relationships with the Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, as well as the current coalition Government led by David Cameron and Nick Clegg. \u201cThe UK remains a very important market for Walgreens Boots Alliance. Over the last eight years, and under Mr Pessina\u2019s leadership, Alliance Boots contributed over \u00a31.2bn to its pension funds, benefitting many of the 70,000 people it continues to employ in the UK, and invested a similar amount in transforming Boots stores across the UK, helping to ensure it is best placed to serve its customers and patients. \u201cPrior to completion of the merger with Walgreens in December 2014, the corporation tax paid by Alliance Boots was 40% higher in 2013/14 than in the prior year, at \u00a390m. Cash taxes paid were also over 50% higher in 2013/14 than those paid in its last year as a publicly listed company. Overall, the total amount of tax paid in the UK, including business rates, national insurance and corporation tax, was around \u00a3550m in 2013/14.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BP will on Tuesday unveil plans to slash billions of pounds off its capital spending programme in a bid to counter the impact of plunging oil prices and a 40% fall in its fourth quarter profits. The company, which has already cut hundreds of jobs in Aberdeen and thousands around the world, is expected to announce spending reductions of over 10% bringing the official target below $22bn (\u00a315bn) for 2015. Bob Dudley,BP\u2019s chief executive, is expected to further sweeten the pill for investors by making no changes to the dividend while not making any further specific redundancies. BP said in December that it was taking a $1bn charge to pay for restructuring \u2013 almost all for job cuts \u2013 and has since made local announcements about new staffing levels in Houston, Trinidad and Azerbaijan. The latest cost-reductions come as BP is expected to report profits of around $1.5bn for the last three months of its financial year. Peers such as Shell will reduce expenditure by $15bn over the next three years, Chevron is to cut 13% of spending to $35bn after reporting a 30% plunge in final quarter earnings, while ConocoPhillips slashed its capital expenditure by 33% to $11.5bn. ExxonMobil, the world\u2019s largest quoted oil company, will also unveil its strategy for dealing with a Brent blend oil prices which has fallen to around $50 a barrel from $115 in June last year. BP\u2019s previous target was to spend between $24bn and $25bn in 2014 although the final outturn for the year was expected to have already fallen to $23bn and the company is now expected to try to ensure the official target in 2015 is even lower. The company is particularly vulnerable to lower commodity prices because it is still suffering financially from ongoing fallout from the Deepwater Horizon accident of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico and from its risky investments in Russia. Last week the British-based oil company raised more cash to pay for its Gulf liabilities by handing over a larger stake and operatorship of the Gila and Tiber fields in US waters to Chevron and ConocoPhillips. BP had already divested $42bn worth of assets up to the end of the third financial quarter of the 2014/15 financial year and will update the market of its progress in disposing of a further $6bn that includes Gila and Tiber. Latest court judgements in the US still leave BP potentially open to a fine under the Clean Water Act for pollution of a further $13.7bn. Dudley will also try to reassure investors that the 20% holding in the largely state-owned Rosneft oil company is still a positive asset despite sanctions by the West on Russia over the Ukraine. There has been speculation that the ability of Rosneft to pay a hefty annual dividend to BP in the summer is seriously endangered by the fall in energy prices and debt problems at sanction-hit Rosneft.",

      "bodyText": "Greece and Germany are on a collision course. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s new Syriza-led government in Athens wants a big chunk of its debt written off. Angela Merkel is saying \u201cnein\u201d to that. If this were a western, Tsipras and Merkel would be the two gunslingers who have decided in time-honoured fashion that \u201cthis town ain\u2019t big enough for the both of us\u201d. But this isn\u2019t Hollywood. There is no guarantee that this shootout will have a happy ending. Things look like getting nasty and messy. The five-year crisis in the eurozone has entered a dangerous new phase. How can this be? Isn\u2019t Greece a small country, which accounts for less than 2% of the output of the European Union? Wouldn\u2019t it be relatively easy and not particularly expensive for its creditors to write off its debts, mostly owned by governments or international bodies? Isn\u2019t it the case that using Greece as a laboratory mouse for an austerity experiment has been a failure? The answer to all three questions is yes. Greece is a small country. Writing off part of its debts or easing the repayment terms would be simple and painless. The obsession with deficit reduction has depressed growth not just in Greece, but in the whole of the eurozone. What\u2019s more, the lesson from the last five years is that those countries that use the euro are paying a heavy price for the lack of a common system for transferring resources from one part of the single-currency area to another. There is one currency and one interest rate, but there is no fiscal union to stand alongside monetary union. So, unlike in the US or the UK, there is no large-scale method for recycling the taxes raised in those parts of the eurozone that are doing well into higher spending for those parts of the eurozone that are doing badly. Mark Carney pointed out this weakness in a lecture in Dublin last week when he said: \u201cIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, if the euro were a country, fiscal policy would be substantially more supportive.\u201d The governor of the Bank of England added that a \u201cmore constructive fiscal policy\u201d would help mitigate the negative impact that structural reforms have on demand and would be consistent with the longer-term aim of closer integration. All this is music to the ears of Tsipras and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who will be in London for talks with George Osborne on Monday. Varoufakis, judging by his comments on Newsnight last week, thinks Germany should soften its approach not just because the current policy is not working but also as an act of European solidarity. \u201cSuppose a friend of yours were to come to you and say that he or she had difficulty paying the mortgage because of a reduction in their income \u2013 they lost their job or something like that,\u201d Varoufakis said. \u201cThey have a great idea on how to solve this problem: they would get a credit card and draw money from it in order to meet the mortgage payments for the next few months. Would you advise them that they should continue to take these tranches of loans from the credit card in order to deal with what is essentially an insolvency problem?\u201d Merkel\u2019s response to the implication that Greece is essentially bankrupt was uncompromising. \u201cI don\u2019t see a further debt haircut,\u201d the German chancellor said. Seen from Berlin\u2019s perspective, this approach is neither cruel nor heartless but simply good economic sense. Not much attention has been paid to the German perspective in the past week, which is a mistake because in the end the creditors call the shots. The Germans had reservations about the single currency right from the start. They adored the Bundesbank as the bulwark of prosperity and only agreed to join the euro provided the European Central Bank (ECB) was a carbon copy of their own beloved institution. They raised an eyebrow when countries including Greece were allowed to become founder members of monetary union, because they knew their economies were relatively weak and inefficient. But they expected membership of the euro to act as discipline, forcing countries to undertake structural reforms to make themselves more competitive. That is what Germany did after entering the euro at a rate that was disadvantageous for its exporters. The labour market was reformed. Workers took cuts in real wages. Welfare was made less generous. Today Germany has an unemployment rate below 5%, runs a budget surplus and exports far more than it imports. Merkel\u2019s message to fellow eurozone leaders is that if we can do it so can you and that this is what we all signed up for when the single currency was introduced in 1999. Berlin\u2019s unhappiness with the ECB\u2019s decision to begin its own version of quantitative easing goes beyond a visceral German fear of cranking up the printing presses. It also thinks the ECB is letting the eurozone\u2019s backsliders off the hook. Nor does the argument that Germany is being unreasonable cut much ice with Merkel. Greece, she says, has also had two bailouts, which had strings attached. Asking the German taxpayer to write cheques to help what was once East Germany is acceptable: asking them to write blank cheques to Greece is not. From the outside, the German approach may look strange or misguided. It makes little sense for Germany to be running a budget surplus while at the same time exhorting other eurozone countries to export their way out of trouble. If Merkel cut taxes, German consumers might start to buy more Greek, Spanish and Portuguese goods. Nor is there any evidence that quantitative easing (QE) programmes have led to inflation. On the contrary, deflation is currently much more of a concern. But, crucially, this is not the way the Germans see it. They think running a budget surplus is prudent because it is salting away money that will be needed in the future to cope with the demands of an ageing and declining population. And they would argue, rightly, that the long-term effects of QE are unknown. What does all this mean? It means that Merkel is likely to hang tough in negotiations with Tsipras. It means that Germany will drag its feet on fiscal union, fearing a repeat of what happened with monetary union. It means that the eurozone will stay in limbo, with countries having no control over their interest rates but continuing to run their own budgets. The most probable outcome is that the eurozone will muddle through, as it has in the past. But there are two alternative scenarios. The first is that Greece leaves. The other, still more unlikely, is that Germany \u2013 for all its undoubted commitment to the European project \u2013 decides the price of membership is no longer worth paying.",

      "bodyText": "The Wahaca chain of Mexican street food restaurants put a new special on the menu in January. At \u00a34.25 the dish has a core ingredient many would wince at \u2013 crickets. Nevertheless some 1,500 plates a week have been sold at the chain, set up by former Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers. Wahaca has been experimenting with the idea of bringing entomophagy - eating insects - to the high street since 2013 and is now considering whether the crickets will be put on the permanent menu in the restaurants. Rather than having the insects eaten by diners as a dare or as a gimmick amongst the tacos and quesadillas, marketing manager Oli Ingham said they wanted to raise the issue of sustainability in food production. The move marks another development in the growing campaign to get foods such as grasshoppers and mealworms accepted onto the western palate in the same way as they are in many developing countries - there insects are salted and eaten as a snack with a beer or can even command prices higher than fillet steak due to the scarcity of some types. \u201cIt is in our nature to eat insects ... as they are eaten all around the world,\u201d said Shami Radia, the co-founder of Grub, a London-based company which sells packets of dried mealworms, crickets, grasshoppers and buffalo worms. Working in the aid sector in Malawi, he was given termites sprinkled with chilli and lime to go along with his beer one evening. It gave him the idea to bring edible insects to the UK. \u201cIn some ways I can understand it [the reticence]. I really have had a lot of belief in the idea. In the year that we have been trading, it has been proven that there is something in it,\u201d he said. People in four out of five countries around the world eat insects, said Radia. The United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that two billion of the world\u2019s population eat insects as part of their normal diet. Their high protein level, low carbon footprint and production cost are frequent arguments used by those lobbying for them to be eaten as part of the Western diet. Radia and his business partner Neil Whippey set up a series of pop-up restaurant nights in London, changing traditional meats for their products - in one case swapping brown crab for buffalo worms. Traffic to their website, which was launched two years ago to sell packets of the dried insects, jumped as a result. \u201cIt is one of those things that we have learnt. We learn to fear eating insects, it is not something which is inbuilt. In Europe the reason that we don\u2019t eat insects is because of the climate. In all of the other countries it is hot [and] insects are in abundance. It is easy to catch them and they are an easy source of protein,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hear the term superfood bandied about but these actually are a superfood in terms of their nutritional qualities.\u201d Grub has started to supply the Planet Organic chain of supermarkets and also has an agreement with Wahaca to sell crickets sourced in the Netherlands, a country which has had a more progressive attitude to consuming insects, said Radia. The key to acceptance amongst the public, he said, is to make insects seen as a viable food alternative as opposed to something used in a challenge from \u201cI\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here\u201d. Crickets, according to Radia, taste like a \u201cnutty shrimp\u201d while buffalo worms are like almonds. Another company, Ento, is working to create a food kit similar to a Mexican taco set but using insects from which people can make canap\u00e9s to serve at the start of an evening for six people. Aran Dasan, one of the group behind the idea, said people are often surprised that the taste is not more acute when they first bite in. \u201cI think a lot of people presume that the strength [of the taste] of the insects is correlated with the strength of the taboo and that is simply not true. A lot of insects have mild savoury flavours, a lot like nuts and sometimes quite yeasty like marmite,\u201d he said. While many may wince at the idea of eating grasshoppers as part of a meal, the comparison constantly drawn is with sushi, which now sits on supermarket shelves alongside ready-made sandwiches - a development which took years to work, said Radia. \u201cIt is just about how it is marketed. It is just about how it is presented to the great British public in smashing those taboos about eating insects,\u201d he said. But at over \u00a310 for a packet of crickets and grasshoppers, Radia admits that they are expensive due to supply limitations. The way to find acceptance, according to Dasan, is to sell insect products to \u201cfoodies\u201d who are willing to experiment and then hope that it trickles down to a more mass market appeal. Ento aims to have products on retail shelves by summer of this year. \u201cIt is all about how you present the food. If you present it as normal food - maybe not as normal as chips, beans and gravy - [but] maybe we start off with it [as a] special occasion food like sushi may have been a couple of years ago. You are not creating the impression in your mind that it is a novelty or a joke,\u201d he said.",

Ento aims to have products on retail shelves by summer of this year.</p> <p>\u201cIt is all about how you present the food. If you present it as normal food - maybe not as normal as chips, beans and gravy - [but] maybe we start off with it [as a] special occasion food like sushi may have been a couple of years ago. You are not creating the impression in your mind that it is a novelty or a joke,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Among the most uplifting images from Syriza\u2019s victory in Greece last week were the elated faces of a small group of fiercely determined women: the public sector cleaners who were laid off during the country\u2019s brutal budget cuts and had been told they would be swiftly re-hired by the new government. The fate of a few low-paid mop operatives is a world away from the cut and thrust of international negotiations on debt relief for Greece. Yet it has so often been the fate of working-class women \u2013 standing in the bread queues, scrabbling to feed their families, laid off in their droves in the public sector job cuts mandated by the country\u2019s troika of creditors \u2013 that has best illustrated the despair to which many in the recession-ravaged country have been driven. Syriza had promised that \u201chope is coming\u201d, injecting the language of emotion into dry debates about deficits and debt repayments. It remains to be seen how successful they will be in the high-stakes negotiation they must now enter with their eurozone partners, under the minute-by-minute scrutiny of the financial markets. But the party\u2019s triumph \u2013 and the cleaning women\u2019s plight \u2013 underlines the fact that economics is about not just the state of the public finances (improving, in Greece\u2019s case) or GDP (on the up), but raw human experience in homes and families. One lesson from the crises that have roiled the eurozone over the past five-plus years is that anyone who tells you the only response to a public debt crisis is to slash spending and embark on \u201cstructural reform\u201d is either masochistic or downright mad. But we could take a more profound lesson away too, which so far most economists have failed to learn from the Great Recession and its long-drawn-out aftermath: the individualistic, neoliberal perspective on the world that bleaches out humanity in favour of equations needs to be junked too. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s promise in 1979, \u201cwhere there is despair, let us bring hope\u201d, may have prefigured Syriza\u2019s language, but her arrival in No 10 marked the start of an era in which we have increasingly come to see ourselves as \u201caspirational\u201d, atomised individuals, scrabbling to make our way in a world without the support of the society Thatcher notoriously dismissed. This approach was underpinned and apparently vindicated by the proliferation of economic models that conceived of people as cool, rational, drastically simplified robots who beetle around trying to maximise their utility. The market became seen as the ultimate expression of this calculating rationality, and its values \u2013 competition, self-interest, even greed \u2013 as the fundamental driving forces of life. Behavioural economists have spiced up this dull world with concepts such as irrational exuberance, helping to explain why even financial markets \u2013 supposedly the embodiment of hardnosed rationality \u2013 can experience moments of madness. And others show why the qualifier ceteris paribus \u2013 \u201call things being equal\u201d \u2013 that always applies to these elegant mathematical constructions is a nonsense, because all things are never, ever equal. Still others, such as David Tuckett at UCL, have done good work weaving the role of emotion and ambition into the coke-fuelled activities of City traders, whose decisions can have such catastrophic effects on the rest of us. But a polemical and entertaining new book by journalist Katrine Mar\u00e7al suggests that Economic Man has another major shortcoming: he\u2019s not, and never could be, a woman. In the excellently titled Who Cooked Adam Smith\u2019s Dinner? (spoiler: it was his good old loyal mum), Mar\u00e7al argues that a swath of traditionally feminine activities \u2013 cooking, cleaning, caring, changing nappies \u2013 have been systematically excluded from economists\u2019 view of the world, which has become the lens through which just about everything is scrutinised. Smith and his fellow pioneers in economics asked themselves how a loaf of bread got to their table \u2013 through the unpleasant-but-useful self-interest of the farmer who grew the wheat, the miller who made the flour, the baker who kneaded the dough, and so on (most of them chaps in those days, naturally). But they simply took it for granted that someone would nip out to the shops to buy a loaf, slice it, toast it, butter it and pop it on a plate. And make the beds. And cook the kids\u2019 tea. Care, which is still overwhelmingly carried out by women, was effectively a natural resource. That helps to explain why roles such as nurse, cleaner, carer are still undervalued today; but it also leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of human motivations. Economic Man has nothing as troubling as emotions, family connections, class loyalties or friendships. He\u2019s a lean, mean, utility-maximising machine. He\u2019s been repeatedly rubbished over the years: by Nobel prize winners Kahneman and Tversky, for example, who showed decades ago that we just don\u2019t think in the shrewd, consistent way required to make the logic work. Maybe the bolshie cleaners were acting out of rational self-interest when they camped out in front of the finance ministry for months; more likely they were hurt, disillusioned and furious. Mar\u00e7al argues that the rationalist worldview has had extraordinary sticking power because it appeals to a desire in us to detach ourselves from the messy world of love and duty, and make decisions in a clean, rational way. It\u2019s also elegant and apparently powerful: it allows the number-crunchers to construct models apparently encompassing entire economies. Anything that replaces it would be more piecemeal, messier, more uncertain, and certainly less appealing to purists. But more true. As Mar\u00e7al puts it: \u201cEconomic science should be about how one turns a social vision into a modern economic system. It should be a tool to create opportunities for human and social development. Not just address our fears as they are expressed as demand in the market.\u201d Hope, and a whole slew of other messy emotions \u2013 fear, greed, loyalty, even love \u2013 need to be brought back not just onto the streets of Athens, but right into the heart of economics.",

      "bodyText": "At the start of the last season, viewers of Sky Sports\u2019 Monday Night Football programme were treated to a nice bit of knockabout between pundits Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville. As Carragher discussed the attributes of Liverpool No 2 Glen Johnson, he speculated that as a kid the player would have dreamed of becoming a flying winger rather than a dreary fullback. \u201cNo one wants to grow up and be a Gary Neville,\u201d he said. Similarly, in the City, execs want to lead thrusting, fast-growing, rival-acquiring firms, but it doesn\u2019t always pan out like that, as a mooted corporate double act may illustrate this week. We have numbers from Vodafone \u2013 which, following sector consolidation, is suddenly facing relegation to the bottom of the mobile-network league in its home market. And there are results from Sky - which last week announced its own mobile service. There will be the inevitable queries about how these two will protect themselves against a consolidating sector and a thrusting BT, which is encroaching into both of their markets. And yet both firms have supporters just as they are. A media sector note from Barclays last week trumpeted Sky (even if it loses a chunk of Premier League rights) as its \u201cdefensive pick\u201d, which just goes to show: sometimes you do covet being the Gary Neville. Another burst of MPC inactivity There are plenty of City types who revel in those tabloid tales of folk claiming state funds while loafing around doing sweet Fanny Adams. If that\u2019s the type of story that gets you going, then you\u2019re in for a treat this week, with the case of the middle-aged men and women claiming thousands for almost six years of inactivity. Yes, it\u2019s that time of the month when the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee gathers for a two-day summit where it will deliberate, cogitate and digest the current economic data \u2013 and then come to the startling conclusion that it doesn\u2019t need to do anything. Having briefly flirted with the vague notion of action, the MPC took a step back from raising rates last month: its two dissenters capitulated and sided with the majority backing the status quo of maintaining ultra-low rates. They look unlikely to switch sides again, as this time the concerns are more likely to centre on deflation \u2013 rather than inflation \u2013 following the governor\u2019s admission that falling prices are a possibility and his letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation is so low. More of the same next month too (probably). BP execs out of pocket We were reminded last week about the effects of the falling oil price on those that get the stuff out of the ground. Shell said it was to make $15bn (\u00a310bn) of spending cuts as it warned George Osborne that North Sea operations were in the firing line unless the chancellor could offer tax cuts. BP, which will report a fourth-quarter profit drop of about 45% this week, said in December that it would make hundreds of job cuts over the next year in response to the continued slump in global oil prices. But will the oil price fall also force others to spend more? For example, BP\u2019s remuneration policy requires its executives to build up shareholdings worth five times their salary. In its last annual report, chief exec Bob Dudley was 61% towards that target, but following the oil price slump \u2013 and the resultant knock-on effect on the BP share price \u2013 he\u2019s now back down at about 52%. That leaves the American theoretically needing to spend $4.3m to get to his target holding \u2013 so if prices stay this low, will he be forced to stick his hand in his pocket? The company does not say, but adds the target only has to be achieved \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time from appointment\u201d. NB: Dudley joined the board in 2009.",
