      "bodyText": "Theresa May will be forced to offer further politically difficult concessions to the EU to minimise damage to the economy caused by Brexit, said one of the UK\u2019s leading economic thinktanks. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said Britain was gripped by an epidemic of uncertainty about the terms of its EU departure, and warned that the government would have to pay a bigger financial contribution or accept higher migration to get the deal it wanted. May has already lost two cabinet ministers \u2013 David Davis and Boris Johnson \u2013 after announcing plans for Brexit that involved prioritising trade in goods over services, while aiming to limit free movement of people. But in its latest quarterly health check on the economy, the NIESR said May\u2019s version of a soft Brexit was still not soft enough. The government was aiming for market access similar to that enjoyed by Switzerland but with a much tougher migration system. \u201cIn our view, the government will have to make significant concessions to the EU,\u201d it said. The thinktank said, that following the pick-up in activity after the sluggish start to the year, the economy was on course to grow by 1.4% in 2018 and by 1.75% each year thereafter. It added, however, that even these modest growth rates relied on the UK continuing to have close to full access to the EU market for its goods and services. The more limited proposals for market access in the recently published white paper would lead to a loss of output amounting to \u00a3500 per person over time, compared to a soft Brexit. \u201cThe loss would be around \u00a3800 under a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit. These estimates do not include the likely impact on productivity which could, on some estimates, double the size of the losses,\u201d said the thinktank. Jagjit Chadha, director of the NIESR, said: \u201cIn the UK, uncertainty about exit from the EU seems to be limiting the development of policies to promote more inclusive growth.\u201d Brexit, he added, was a demanding agenda that was causing political stasis. \u201cThings are not happening that should be happening.\u201d Chadha said pre-Brexit Britain was \u201cgripped by an unusual amount of uncertainty, you might call it an epidemic of uncertainty \u2013 we haven\u2019t worked out how to do it\u201d. The NIESR said the Bank of England would need to take account of the uncertainty when setting interest rates. While supporting a quarter-point increase in official borrowing costs this week, the Bank should make it clear that it was prepared to reverse the decision, the institute added. \u201cThe UK is just eight months away from the March 2019 EU exit date and the range of outcomes remains as wide as ever. We are by no means sure that there will be a deal by then, and even if there is a deal it is not clear how policymakers, businesses and households will respond to the new arrangement. And, all along, the chance of a second referendum is rising.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Water companies have been urged to \u201craise the bar\u201d on tackling leaks during talks with Michael Gove, the environment secretary, after once again failing to meet targets. The firms insisted they would do more and are planning \u201cambitious\u201d new goals to reduce leakage by at least a further 15%. It comes after eight of the 18 water companies failed to meet targets on leaks in 2017-18 and reports of low levels in some reservoirs following the recent dry spell. A hosepipe ban was introduced from 5 August by north-west supplier United Utilities, which has been accused of \u201cwasting\u201d 430m litres of water every day. Research from the GMB union found the firm was allowing 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools\u2019 worth of water to go down the plughole daily. Following the discussions with the government, Michael Roberts, the chief executive of the industry body Water UK, said: \u201cLeakage is a big priority for the industry. We know how important it is for customers, and since the mid-1990s companies have successfully managed to reduce leakage levels by a third. \u201cBut we also know there is more to do, which is why water companies are currently developing ambitious plans to cut leakage even further. \u201cAs well as increasing their work on leakage now, companies are all currently finalising plans to cut leakage by at least a further 15%, with some companies preparing to go even further.\u201d The UK\u2019s driest start to the summer since 1961 has been blamed by the industry for causing some of the problems as the ground dries out and moves, weakening joints and cracking pipes. The companies have also cited the freeze-thaw which followed the cold snap in February and March which led to more leaks and have argued that customers have a role to play in conserving water. Suppliers who attended the meeting were South Staffordshire, Bristol, Severn Trent, Thames, Yorkshire, Essex and Suffolk (via their parent company Northumbrian), Portsmouth and United Utilities. The companies are using satellite technology, drones and underground listening equipment to identify leaks in addition to doubling the number of teams dedicated to tackling the problems but have been urged to do more. Total average water leakage increased by 2% in England and Wales last year from 3,123m litres per day in 2016-17 to 3,183m litres daily in 2017-18. They are expected to submit their higher targets to address leaky pipes when submitting their business plans to regulator Ofwat in September. Gove said: \u201cWhile extreme weather events do pose a challenge to the industry, they are a consequence of climate change with which we all have to deal. We all agreed water companies must do more to adapt and prepare for changing weather patterns. \u201cI have asked the companies I spoke to today to raise the bar on tackling leaks and agree ambitious new targets when they submit their business plans to Ofwat. \u201cThe government, Ofwat and customers expect water companies to improve their performance.\u201d In June, Thames Water, Britain\u2019s biggest water company, was ordered to pay back \u00a365m to customers as part of a \u00a3120m package of penalties over poor management of leaks following an Ofwat investigation. Ofwat published new rules earlier this month that force firms to explain how executive pay is linked to performance and to prioritise customers\u2019 interests. Companies paying dividends above 5% will have to explain how that benefits customers in addition to investors.",

    "webTitle": "No FCA action against RBS after mistreatment of small businesses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the \u201cwidespread inappropriate treatment\u201d of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank\u2019s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that \u201csometimes you have to let customers hang themselves\u201d when in financial difficulty, adding that \u201cmissed opportunities will mean missed bonuses\u201d. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. \u201cThe fact that we can\u2019t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.\u201d Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: \u201cIt will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG\u2019s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. \u201cThe government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.\u201d In February, Morgan\u2019s committee published the City watchdog\u2019s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS\u2019s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG\u2019s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around \u00a3500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple\u2019s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: \u201cI just don\u2019t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book \u2026 The government have got to get a grip.\u201d The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: \u201cWe are disappointed but not surprised by today\u2019s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.\u201d Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: \u201cIt is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA\u2019s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. \u201cTaking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.\u201d Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: \u201cThe board welcomes the FCA\u2019s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA\u2019s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. \u201cThe board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.\u201d",

We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: <em tabindex=\"-1\">\u201c</em>It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG\u2019s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. </p> <p>\u201cThe government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.\u201d</p> <p>In February, Morgan\u2019s committee published the City watchdog\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/s166-rbs-grg.pdf\">full unredacted report</a> into what the committee called RBS\u2019s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/12/confidential-report-into-rbs-small-business-scandal-to-be-published\">standoff with the FCA</a>, which had published only a redacted version.</p> <p>Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG\u2019s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy.</p> <p>One of them is <a href=\"https://www.smealliance.org/uploads/1/0/8/5/10850060/nigel_henderson_complete_profile.pdf\">Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma</a>, with annual profits of around \u00a3500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/rbs-royal-bank-scotland-legal-claims-damages-small-businesses-bankruptcy\">drove the business into bankruptcy</a> and seized all the couple\u2019s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Pointing to Iceland and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/20/david-drumm-former-chief-of-anglo-irish-bank-sentenced-to-eight-years-in-jail\">the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed</a> for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: \u201cI just don\u2019t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book \u2026 The government have got to get a grip.\u201d </p> <p>The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/nov/08/small-businesses-rbs-royal-bank-scotland-marks-pencer\">complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne</a>, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008.</p> <p>Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process.</p> <p>The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: \u201cWe are disappointed but not surprised by today\u2019s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bailey said: \u201cIt is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA\u2019s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited.</p> <p>\u201cTaking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.\u201d</p> <p>Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: \u201cThe board welcomes the FCA\u2019s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA\u2019s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy.</p> <p>\u201cThe board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "House of Fraser has been judged to be in technical default on its loans as the troubled department store group fights to avoid financial collapse. The retailer is urgently seeking \u00a350m in new funds to meet its quarterly rent bill of nearly \u00a325m in late September and secure sufficient stock for the Christmas trading period. It also wants about \u00a310m to pay down an expensive short-term overdraft. The credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s on Tuesday marked House of Fraser as in \u201climited default\u201d and warned clients that the outlook for the retailer\u2019s rating was negative, making it harder for the company to borrow money. On Monday, fellow ratings agency S&amp;P said the new debt arrangements agreed last week were \u201ctantamount to a default\u201d. The warnings come after Moody\u2019s downgraded its rating of House of Fraser\u2019s debts for the second time in eight months over concerns about the retailer\u2019s ability to refinance. \u201cIn December we downgraded the company as its operating performance was below our expectations due to both challenging market conditions and company specific factors, notably the disruption after the launch of a new web platform, and underperformance of in-house brands,\u201d said the agency. \u201cLast week we realised that even our lowered expectations will no longer be met and the refinancing risk increased considerably so we downgraded the company another notch.\u201d House of Fraser last week secured the right, via a court order, to add \u00a350m more in debts and extended the deadline for repayment of a string of loans. It extended repayment of \u00a3225m of debts by more than a year and \u00a3165m of bonds by a month so that all now have a payment deadline of October 2020. The company is understood to have approached banks and investors about a \u00a350m loan as it tries to fend off administration. House of Fraser had already received an approach from Mike Ashley, who owns an 11% share, with the offer of investment, reportedly via a loan or purchase of a stake in the retailer. The offer from the Sports Direct boss is seen as an attempt to gazump a deal with C.banner, the Chinese owner of the toy store Hamleys, which appears to have run aground. C.banner warned last Thursday that its plan to invest \u00a370m in House of Fraser this summer may not be confirmed until late October. It blamed the delay on legal action by landlords against the planned closure of 31 of House of Fraser\u2019s 51 stores which had been agreed via an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). A group of landlords filed a legal complaint in Edinburgh less than a fortnight ago, saying they had been unfairly prejudiced in the CVA approved by a majority of creditors, including other landlords, last month. On Tuesday, the Guardian understands that House of Fraser filed a challenge, arguing that the landlords had misunderstood the nature of the deal with C.banner and wrongly judged that they would be better served by the retailer going into administration rather than completing a CVA.",

      "bodyText": "Adani has applied to increase the export capacity at its Abbot Point coal terminal, allowing it to expand the port relatively quickly without the \u201csignificant capital expense\u201d of its long-term expansion plans. Plans lodged with the Queensland state development department on Tuesday show Adani wants to build a conveyor and transfer tower at Abbot Point \u201cterminal one\u201d to expand throughput by 10m tonnes a year. The company says the revamped plans \u2013 under which it would still be able to go ahead with its controversial $16bn Carmichael coalmine in the Galilee Basin \u2013 would delay the \u201csignificant capital expense\u201d of building a second loader. Plans for a second terminal, which would require dredging and other works to increase capacity to 90m tonnes a year, would be downsized and deferred but not scrapped. But despite putting the dredging on hold, the plans could provide a flashpoint in an ongoing dispute about cultural heritage and the protection of sacred Indigenous sites. Guardian Australia understands the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander partnerships department has sought to mediate a disagreement between Adani and two groups representing Juru traditional owners. One group, Juru Enterprises Limited, has applied for a stop order that could force Adani to cease works in the vicinity of Abbot Point. It claims previous cultural heritage surveys are invalid and need to be reviewed. Guardian Australia understands the department is unlikely to recommend a stop order unless work is imminent and carries a demonstrated risk to cultural heritage. Adani\u2019s expansion plans are likely to now provide a specific focus for the traditional owners pursuing the stop order application. The existing terminal has capacity for about 50m tonnes of coal a year, but is exporting only about half that. The planned works would allow 60m tonnes to potentially be exported without building a terminal. Its application said the plan would \u201callow the immediate ... capacity increment demand at the port to be realised in the most efficient manner\u201d. \u201cThis enables significant capital expense, terrestrial disturbance and the requirement for offshore works to be deferred,\u201d it said. Tim Buckley, an energy market analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the expansion appeared to be \u201cmore sensible business planning than flagging anything more material\u201d. \u201cGetting a 20% expansion of terminal one would probably add another $100m in value,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s only sensible business strategy if you think you can use the capacity. \u201cIf they don\u2019t go ahead with Carmichael then Abbot Point is under-utilised and there\u2019s no capacity to fix that.\u201d Adani said in a statement this month that it continued to finalise financing of the Carmichael project, which includes the port expansion, the construction of a rail link, and construction of the mine. The company still requires some regulatory approvals, and faces ongoing court and other challenges by environmentalists and Indigenous traditional owners.",

      "bodyText": "The latest redundancies at Carillion, the construction and outsourcing company that fell into administration in January, include just over 340 construction apprentices. The Unite union said the apprentice redundancies, which made up the bulk of the most recent round of 356 job losses, were \u201can act of crass stupidity\u201d amid a shortage of skilled workers in the construction industry. Carillion collapsed under the weight of a \u00a31.5bn debt pile after the government refused to bail it out. The outsourcing firm was a central contractor for the Crossrail project and also maintained and repaired some UK prisons and provided cleaners and caterers to schools. Gail Cartmail, an assistant general secretary at Unite, said: \u201cThis is an appalling way to treat these apprentices who should have become the backbone of the industry. To dump them and to destroy their training is an act of crass stupidity.\u201d The union said the Carillion redundancies reduced the UK construction apprenticeship numbers by 1.6%. Cartmail said: \u201cThese actions highlight the government\u2019s total failure to assist the workers who have been most affected by Carillion\u2019s collapse through no fault of their own. \u201cThe government could have used its procurement power to find placements for these apprentices but it chose not to, demonstrating that it is not serious about dealing with the skills crisis facing the industry.\u201d The government said the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) had found new paid employment for 777 apprentices who had worked for Carillion and was offering \u201ctailored support\u201d to help those made redundant find new work. Announcing the latest redundancies, the official receiver said 13,516 jobs (74% of the pre-liquidation workforce) had been saved and 2,778 (15%) made redundant through the liquidation of Carillion. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing the collapse of Carillion the CITB took immediate action to make sure apprenticeship training could continue as normal and we have been working closely with the CITB to find alternative employment for all those apprentices.\u201d Earlier this month MPs urged ministers to learn lessons from the demise of Carillion, which was one of the biggest UK corporate collapses in years. The House of Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee found fundamental flaws in the way the government awards contracts, resulting in contractors taking on unacceptable levels of financial risk.",

      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City\u2019s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let\u2019s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That\u2019s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG\u2019s behaviour will find the FCA\u2019s lack of power to act \u201cdisappointing and bewildering\u201d. She\u2019s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU\u2019s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK\u2019s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government\u2019s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.",

The struggling department store chain, which has issued three profit warnings this year amid brutal high-street trading conditions, said at the start of the summer that it was considering selling assets to shore up its finances. Debenhams\u2019 advisers, Lazard, believe the Danish chain could fetch \u00a3200m-\u00a3250m based on a teaser document being circulated among potential buyers. Debenhams acquired Magasin for just \u00a312m nearly a decade ago.

The chief executive of Debenhams, Sergio Bucher, is under pressure to show that he can end the current sales slump, which has seen Debenhams\u2019 share price plummet more than 70% over the past year. In 2017, he set out plans for an ambitious makeover that would turn its stores into destinations by installing new restaurant brands as well as nail and blow-dry bars.

That has had a knock-on effect on confidence in the sector and it recently emerged that credit insurers including Euler Hermes had reduced cover for Debenhams\u2019 suppliers. A withdrawal or reduction in cover tends to mean that suppliers demand payment upfront, putting increased strain on a retailer\u2019s working capital.

      "bodyText": "HSBC\u2019s former head of currency trading has won a last-ditch battle to block his extradition to the US, where he faces 11 charges of foreign exchange rigging which each carry a maximum 30-year prison sentence. Stuart Scott on Tuesday won an appeal in the high court against his extradition. The charges in the US related to an alleged \u201cfront running\u201d scheme in which he and his former boss have been accused of making more than $8m (\u00a36m) profit on currency deals arranged for the oil and gas exploration company Cairn Energy. The court of appeal ruled that Scott, who is in his 40s and lives in Hertfordshire, should not be extradited because \u201cmost of the harm took place\u201d in the UK and extradition was not in the interests of justice\u201d. Scott had been charged alongside Mark Johnson, HSBC\u2019s former head of global foreign exchange. Johnson, who is also British, was arrested at JFK airport in New York as he attempted to fly back to London in July 2016. Last year, he was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to two years in prison and fined $300,000. Lord Burnett, the lord chief justice, said a district judge who had allowed for Scott\u2019s extradition had been mistaken and overturned the order. After the ruling, Scott said he was very pleased, but declined to speak further as the US government has indicated it planned to appeal. He denies all the charges. It is the second high-profile extradition case in the UK to go against the US recently. In February Lauri Love, a student accused of hacking US government websites, won his appeal against extradition. Burnett also made the ruling in that case. In Johnson\u2019s trial, US prosecutors used recordings of HSBC calls in an attempt to prove that he and Scott discussed how high the price of the pound could rise before the client would \u201csqueal\u201d. In one call Johnson told Scott: \u201cI think we got away with it.\u201d In 2014 HSBC was one of six global banks fined a total of \u00a32.6bn by UK and US regulators for allowing a \u201cfree for all culture\u201d in the \u00a33.5tn-a-day foreign exchange market.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank\u2019s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There\u2019s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that \u2013 as the FCA claims \u2013 the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn\u2019t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example \u2013 small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan \u2013 then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA\u2019s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: \u201cThe FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system\u201d. He also stated: \u201cThe FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct\u201d. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG\u2019s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here\u2019s Reuters wrapping up the day\u2019s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union\u2019s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July \u2014 again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi\u2019s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any \u201cbehind the curve\u201d thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA\u2019s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA\u2019s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA\u2019s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA\u2019s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can\u2019t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to \u00a374.5m. Germany\u2019s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here\u2019s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: \u201cSince our data security review uncovered last year\u2019s breach, we\u2019ve been working around the clock to put it right. That\u2019s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we\u2019re updating on today. \u201cAgain, we\u2019re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we\u2019ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.\u201d The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. \u201cWhile there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,\u201d Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company\u2019s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year\u2019s figure included a one off \u00a3462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of \u2018material uncertainty\u2019 we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it\u2019s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast \u2013 cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It\u2019s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany\u2019s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France\u2019s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan\u2019s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye \u2013 with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it\u2019s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual \u00a580trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will \u2018maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time\u2019 \u2013 which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week\u2019s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight\u2019s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we\u2019d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we\u2019ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today\u2019s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group.

The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system\u201d. </p> <p>He also stated: \u201cThe FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct\u201d. </p> <p>What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit.

Any \u201cbehind the curve\u201d thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked.</p> <p>Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment.</p> <p>Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down.</p> <p>Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%.</p> <p>Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB.</p> <p>The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b602c38e4b0b2d8950df82e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-31T09:32:57.307Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement.

Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA\u2019s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. </p> <p>We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA\u2019s conclusions are correct and reasonable. </p> <p>I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. </p> <p>The fact that we can\u2019t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS.

But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it\u2019s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual \u00a580trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will \u2018maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time\u2019 \u2013 which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b600579e4b08bf600304d58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-31T06:49:46.083Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dixons Carphone admits huge data breach</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data.

The technology drop which followed last week\u2019s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight\u2019s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. </p> <p>Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. </p> </blockquote> <p>It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014.</p> <p>On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we\u2019d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. </p> <p>Since then we\u2019ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today\u2019s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. </p> </blockquote> <p>Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being.</p> <p>Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/20/mps-publish-full-unredacted-report-into-rbs-small-business-scandal\">Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group</a>.</p> <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p> <p>10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP</p> <p>10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland</p> <p>13.30 BST US personal spending figures<br><br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets\"><br></a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-07-31T06:56:39.881Z\">at 7.56am BST</time></p>  </div>",

British Gas, the UK\u2019s biggest energy supplier, lost 341,000 customer accounts in the UK in the first half of the year, although the rate of losses slowed. Operating profit at the business fell to \u00a3430m. Centrica said it was keeping its tariffs under review, noting that wholesale energy prices had continued to rise since it increased its prices in April, and that a number of its rivals had raised their tariffs. The 5.5% price rise in April, taking the average bill to \u00a31,161 a year, affected 4.1 million out of 7.5 million British Gas customers, and prompted criticism from the government and consumer groups. Centrica said it still had 3.5 million customers on standard variable tariffs \u2013 usually the most expensive \u2013 although the number is down from 4.3 million at the start of the year. The company said it was encouraging customers to switch to one of its cheaper fixed-term tariffs. It has withdrawn the SVT for new customers, and 428,000 accounts have moved on to the new safeguard tariff for vulnerable customers. The government\u2019s cap on all standard energy tariffs including SVTs is expected to come into force at the end of this year. A price cap for vulnerable households already came in early last year. Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, reiterated concerns that some customers would end up paying more once the wider cap comes in. \u201cPrices may well bunch around the level of the cap, so some of the cheaper deals in the market may disappear, which means that some customers will end up paying more,\u201d he told the BBC. Conn suggested ending the SVT instead. Centrica\u2019s overall adjusted operating profit fell 4% to \u00a3782m. The group\u2019s shares were one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 after the results were announced, losing more than 5%. During the cold snap in February and early March, when the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d brought large parts of the UK to a standstill, British Gas incurred additional call-out costs of \u00a315m.

      "bodyText": "The Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, has held talks about an emergency funding deal for the struggling department store chain, House of Fraser. The billionaire, who already owns an 11% stake in House of Fraser, was asked in recent days by bankers advising the retailer to consider providing it with a \u00a350m loan, according to a report by Sky News. In June, House of Fraser announced plans to close 31 of its 59 stores, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. The retailer later secured breathing space from its lenders when they agreed to extend loans while it carries out the restructuring under a company voluntary arrangement scheme. C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, had agreed to make a \u00a370m investment in House of Fraser, conditional on the CVA being implemented. However, the CVA plans have been thrown into doubt by a legal challenge in Scotland, where a group of landlords argues that the restructuring plan would inflict unfair financial pain on them. Alex Williamson, the chief executive of House of Fraser, has previously described the CVA as the \u201clast viable\u201d option for the business. Days after the restructuring scheme was announced, Ashley won a legal challenge to obtain the store\u2019s business plans, providing him with vital information in the event of an investment bid. Ashley bought his 11% stake in 2014 when 89% of the business was sold to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in a deal worth \u00a3480m. The Sports Direct founder also has a 29.7% stake in Debenhams and strategic investments in businesses including Goals Soccer Centres and French Connection. House of Fraser is one of a number of retailers to seek controversial CVAs as some of the biggest names on Britain\u2019s high streets struggle to cope with rising costs, weak consumer confidence and competition from online-only rivals such as Amazon. Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin collapsed earlier this year, while the likes of Prezzo, Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian have shut restaurants and cut hundreds of jobs.",

Dixons said it had put further security measures in place to prevent future cyber-attacks after the breach, which was one of the biggest data breaches at a single firm. The retailer has said that the data breach happened in 2017, before the new European General Data Protection Regulation rules came into force.

      "bodyText": "The latest report of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, released today by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, provides more evidence of stagnant household incomes. In 2016 real household disposable income actually fell, and it remains below the peak level of 2009. While the survey finds that inequality improved slightly in 2016, it highlights the increasing financial stress for families, as incomes fail to keep pace with living costs. The annual release of the Hilda survey is always manna from heaven for data nerds. Unlike most ABS surveys, which are snapshots of the population at any one moment in time, the Hilda survey provides a longitudinal survey. That means it is able to better look at the changes in our society over time. Among the most important aspects of the survey are its findings on household income and inequality. The news on inequality is mostly good. In 2016 the Gini coefficient, which measures the scale of inequality from 0 to 1, was effectively unchanged, with the shift from 2015 to 2016 a marginal 0.294 to 0.293. Both years recorded lower inequality than at the start of the century. The survey\u2019s long-term measure of inequality, also showed a slight fall in 2012-16; however, the level of inequality on this measure remains higher than it was in 2001-05: The survey also found that income mobility remains higher than it was in 2001 \u2013 meaning people are more likely to have the same income from one year to the next. The survey notes that this is a bit of a good-news/bad news situation. \u201cWhile the increase in income stability from year to year is a positive development for people with good incomes\u201d survey author Roger Wilkins, notes, \u201cthis is not a good development for people with low incomes, since they are more likely to have persistently low incomes\u201d: What is clearly not good news, however, is the findings that real median household disposable income declined once again in 2016. The 0.5% fall coupled with the 0.2% fall in 2015 means in 2016 a median income family of four was around $690 worse off in real terms than it was in 2014, and $2,000 worse off compared to 2009: The survey highlights just how poor Australian households have been doing since the GFC. While thanks to the mining boom, the median disposable incomes of Australian households rose much faster than in the USA, since the GFC both nations have been doing it tough. In the US incomes went backwards by more than here, but since 2009 a case could be made that Australian households have made less progress: The survey also allows us to examine the question of just what is the median income of Australian households. The survey finds that the median equivalised household disposable income in 2016 was $46,865 \u2013 down from $47,085 in 2015. That means that a single person with that level of disposable income is in the median of all Australian households accounting for size. To take into account an extra adult or children we add 50% per adult and 30% for each dependent child. This means for a family of four to have the median level of disposable income in 2016 they would have required an income of $98,417. As this is disposable income, using the standard 70:30 income split, it would mean one of the adults would be on a pre-tax income of around $89,000 while the other was earning around $32,000. Such a measure does give the government some level of support that raising the 37% tax threshold from $87,000 to $90,000 does cover median households \u2013 although this is very much dependent upon the size of the household. For a family with just one child, the median disposable income falls to $84,375, which on the 70:30 income split would have the highest bread winner on a pre-tax income of around $73,000. At any rate we remain a very long way from being able to say that an individual income of $120,000 is anywhere close to being middle Australia. The report also highlights that income levels are generally higher in capital cities than in other urban or non-urban areas, with only Adelaide and the urban areas of Tasmania being below the national average: The flat income growth however has not surprisingly translated into rising financial stress for households. Housing costs have been a major factor in this, with the median households now spending 3.6% points more of their income each year on housing than they did at the turn of the century \u2013 or around $3,500 for a family of four in real terms: The survey has found that housing stress has also risen in most capital cities in the past decade. The survey defines housing stress as the point at which housing costs, such as rent or mortgage repayments, constitute \u201cmore than 30% of household income, and the household is in the bottom 40% of the income distribution\u201d. As such the definition focuses on relatively low-income households as those with higher incomes could be expected to reallocate their expenses in a way beyond the ability of those on lower incomes. Here we see that all capital cities but Perth (which has seen a sharp fall in the price of rents) have higher levels of housing stress than they did a decade ago: But the greater cost of living in Sydney is clearly apparent \u2013 as has the fact that rising house prices and rent has also made it much harder to live in Sydney on a low income compared to other capital cities over the past decade. The annual Hilda report continues to provide some of the best data on Australia produced each year. While this year\u2019s report mostly has good news on inequality, the lack of household income growth and the growing levels of housing stress highlights that the decades since the GFC has been a struggle for most to get ahead, and that for middle Australia, the standard of living remains worse than it was in 2009. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "body": "<p>The latest report of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, released today by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, provides more evidence of stagnant household incomes. In 2016 real household disposable income actually fell, and it remains below the peak level of 2009. While the survey finds that inequality improved slightly in 2016, it highlights the increasing financial stress for families, as incomes fail to keep pace with living costs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/31/more-australians-renting-and-in-housing-stress-as-disposable-incomes-stagnate\">More Australians renting and in housing stress as disposable incomes stagnate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The annual release of the Hilda survey is always manna from heaven for data nerds. Unlike most ABS surveys, which are snapshots of the population at any one moment in time, the Hilda survey provides a longitudinal survey. That means it is able to better look at the changes in our society over time. </p> <p>Among the most important aspects of the survey are its findings on household income and inequality. </p> <p>The news on inequality is mostly good. </p> <p>In 2016 the Gini coefficient, which measures the scale of inequality from 0 to 1, was effectively unchanged, with the shift from 2015 to 2016 a marginal 0.294 to 0.293. Both years recorded lower inequality than at the start of the century. </p> <p>The survey\u2019s long-term measure of inequality, also showed a slight fall in 2012-16; however, the level of inequality on this measure remains higher than it was in 2001-05:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Income inequality - annual and long-term (gini coefficient)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/v8zGG/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The survey also found that income mobility remains higher than it was in 2001 \u2013 meaning people are more likely to have the same income from one year to the next. </p> <p>The survey notes that this is a bit of a good-news/bad news situation. \u201cWhile the increase in income stability from year to year is a positive development for people with good incomes\u201d survey author Roger Wilkins, notes, \u201cthis is not a good development for people with low incomes, since they are more likely to have persistently low incomes\u201d:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Income stability\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AjUAy/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>What is clearly not good news, however, is the findings that real median household disposable income declined once again in 2016. The 0.5% fall coupled with the 0.2% fall in 2015 means in 2016 a median income family of four was around $690 worse off in real terms than it was in 2014, and $2,000 worse off compared to 2009:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Median equivalised household disposable income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1FOtu/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The survey highlights just how poor Australian households have been doing since the GFC. While thanks to the mining boom, the median disposable incomes of Australian households rose much faster than in the USA, since the GFC both nations have been doing it tough. In the US incomes went backwards by more than here, but since 2009 a case could be made that Australian households have made less progress:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Real median household incomes since 2001: USA v Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HhUAj/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The survey also allows us to examine the question of just what is the median income of Australian households.</p> <p>The survey finds that the median equivalised household disposable income in 2016 was $46,865 \u2013 down from $47,085 in 2015. That means that a single person with that level of disposable income is in the median of all Australian households accounting for size. </p> <p>To take into account an extra adult or children we add 50% per adult and 30% for each dependent child. This means for a family of four to have the median level of disposable income in 2016 they would have required an income of $98,417.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Disposable incomes by household size (2016)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6OpYQ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As this is disposable income, using the standard 70:30 income split, it would mean one of the adults would be on a pre-tax income of around $89,000 while the other was earning around $32,000. </p> <p>Such a measure does give the government some level of support that raising the 37% tax threshold from $87,000 to $90,000 does cover median households \u2013 although this is very much dependent upon the size of the household. For a family with just one child, the median disposable income falls to $84,375, which on the 70:30 income split would have the highest bread winner on a pre-tax income of around $73,000.</p> <p>At any rate we remain a very long way from being able to say that an individual income of $120,000 is anywhere close to being middle Australia. </p> <p>The report also highlights that income levels are generally higher in capital cities than in other urban or non-urban areas, with only Adelaide and the urban areas of Tasmania being below the national average: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Median equivalised household income by region (2016)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/F1Znk/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The flat income growth however has not surprisingly translated into rising financial stress for households. </p> <p>Housing costs have been a major factor in this, with the median households now spending 3.6% points more of their income each year on housing than they did at the turn of the century \u2013 or around $3,500 for a family of four in real terms:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Housing costs as a proportion of income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yWrgu/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The survey has found that housing stress has also risen in most capital cities in the past decade.</p> <p>The survey defines housing stress as the point at which housing costs, such as rent or mortgage repayments, constitute \u201cmore than 30% of household income, and the household is in the bottom 40% of the income distribution\u201d. As such the definition focuses on relatively low-income households as those with higher incomes could be expected to reallocate their expenses in a way beyond the ability of those on lower incomes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jul/26/low-inflation-levels-dont-add-up-with-the-reality-of-peoples-lives\">Low inflation levels don't add up with the reality of people's lives | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here we see that all capital cities but Perth (which has seen a sharp fall in the price of rents) have higher levels of housing stress than they did a decade ago:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Rates of housing stress\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/J2grv/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the greater cost of living in Sydney is clearly apparent \u2013 as has the fact that rising house prices and rent has also made it much harder to live in Sydney on a low income compared to other capital cities over the past decade.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Level of housing stress relative to Sydney\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JkEOC/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The annual Hilda report continues to provide some of the best data on Australia produced each year.
