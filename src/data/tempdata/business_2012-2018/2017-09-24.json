      "bodyText": "Deliveroo has achieved a valuation of more than $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) after the British takeaway food delivery firm raised $385m in new funds. Deliveroo said the new funding brought the total it had raised since launching to $860m, with the latest round meaning the company has nearly doubled its value since its last fundraising in August 2016. In that funding round, the company raised $275m in a deal it said valued the business at about $1.1bn. The new funds have been earmarked to help the startup business expand into new cities and countries, to enlarge its technology team and to work with restaurants to develop delivery-only kitchens, the company said. Deliveroo currently operates in more than 150 cities across 12 countries and has about 30,000 riders on its books. Like the taxi app firm Uber, which was stripped of its London operating licence on Friday, Deliveroo has been criticised by unions, which say it is exploiting its workers by not offering basic protections and the minimum wage. The controversy around Deliveroo has centred on the employment status of its riders. The company argues the government should change the law either to allow additional rights for self-employed riders or to create a new category of employment. It claims that self-employed status gives both it and its staff flexibility. However, the Central Arbitration Committee \u2013 a government body that resolves workplace disputes \u2013 is investigating whether Deliveroo\u2019s drivers are independent contractors or whether they should be classified as workers with rights to holiday pay, the national minimum wage and collective bargaining via a union. A group of 20 British riders is seeking compensation in a similar employment tribunal case. The new investment has also been unveiled just days after it emerged that the Deliveroo founder, Will Shu, handed himself a 22.5% pay rise last year. Shu, a former investment banker who set up Deliveroo from his London flat in 2013, increased his salary to \u00a3125,000 and handed out close to \u00a34.5m in share bonuses to directors and hundreds of other head office staff, despite a 300%-plus increase in losses. The new funding for his company is being led by two US-based investment companies, T Rowe Price Associates and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, which have previously backed technology startups such as Facebook, Airbnb and Tesla.",

      "bodyText": "Completing repair work on the hundreds of buildings that have failed fire safety tests in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster could take years due to the scale of the task, according to a government document. In an email seen by the Guardian, a senior civil servant in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) warned that new ideas and skills for high-rise building work will be required to repair the vast number of unsafe flats, schools and hospitals in the timely manner demanded by the public. \u201cThere are a large number of high-rise residential buildings, in the public and private sectors, as well as other buildings such as schools and hospitals, where the existing cladding is likely to need to be removed and replaced to ensure the building is safe,\u201d the civil servant wrote. Warning that the work could take much longer than the expected timescale, he said: \u201cThese projects \u2026 typically take months to complete, and this activity can cause significant disruption to both the residents or those working in an individual building, and also to those working in or passing though the immediate vicinity. \u201cTherefore, it is likely that undertaking a major programme of repair and replacement of cladding using existing techniques will take years to complete, which will not meet public expectations that urgent action will be taken.\u201d The author of the email, Fergus Harradence, is the deputy director for construction at BEIS. In England, 266 buildings taller than 18 metres (59ft) failed fire safety tests after the Grenfell blaze, according to the latest data from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). A spokesman for the department said all the buildings affected had implemented interim safety measures. In order to speed up the process, \u00a3250,000 from the government agency Innovate UK has been made available to the Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC), which develops innovation in manufacturing, to find faster ways to strip and replace building cladding that has failed fire safety tests. The deaths of 66 people in the Grenfell fire in June have been confirmed by police, but officers have said they believe the final death toll will be about 80. The government has tasked MTC with developing more efficient processes in areas such as plant and scaffolding, and the removal and replacement of cladding, possibly with the use of new forms of scaffolding or special purpose robots. Technicians from MTC will work with the existing teams removing and replacing the cladding, with final recommendations to BEIS and DCLG expected by November. The BEIS email said: \u201cIt is a government priority to ensure these repairs are delivered as quickly and efficiently as possible. The project proposed by the Manufacturing Technology Centre could, if successful, support this objective through helping manage capacity constraints through the efficient use of resources such as plant and scaffolding, and through developing more efficient techniques for removing and replacing cladding.\u201d. The government is hoping that any lessons learned from the MTC project will have longer-term benefits for the UK construction sector, making it more efficient and supportive of the emerging industrial strategy. A spokesperson for BEIS said: \u201cFollowing the fire at Grenfell Tower, investigations have found cladding on a large number of high-rise buildings must now be removed and replaced. The government is working with the Manufacturing Technology Centre and industry to identify possible approaches to removing and replacing this cladding, so that we can ensure that these high-rise buildings are made safe for residents as quickly as possible.\u201d In the aftermath of the Grenfell fire, an industry response group was established, made up of the government and the construction sector. A spokesperson for the group said it was too early to say how many skilled workers would be needed to carry out the necessary work. \u201cThis number will depend on various factors, including a clear understanding of the number of buildings involved, the locations of those buildings, the extent and severity of the problems at each, and the range of possible solutions still to be determined. \u201cThese capacity planning concerns are being addressed by the industry response group, who are reviewing solutions to ensure buildings are safe and the supply chain capability to cope with a rapid upsurge in remedial and refurbishment work which may follow. The group is working to find and implement solutions as quickly as possible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a sad economic choice: accept the need for mounting debts just to achieve moderate growth or crack down on borrowing and get no growth at all. When there are queues at food banks and child poverty is on the rise, it might seem irresponsible to choose between reckless growth and sober stagnation. Neither option does the poorest any favours, but that appears to be the main dilemma for central bank policymakers. The US Federal Reserve and Bank of England think they can have it both ways. Not for the first time, they argue that clever regulation of the financial sector can allow for a rise in borrowing to spur moderate growth, without the risks associated with this strategy. Other state bodies are not getting involved in the debate, instead focusing narrowly on an agenda set by the government and accepting the regulators\u2019 assurances that they are on top of the situation. Other agencies of the state that participate in this debate refuse to question the tradeoff. Instead they focus narrowly on an agenda set by the government and accept the assurances of the regulators that clever people in positions of seniority are on top of the situation. Among the bodies that sit on the sidelines is the Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain\u2019s independent economic forecasting body. You might think that from its title it would have a moral duty to question the roots of the government\u2019s economic planning. You would be wrong. The OBR makes forecasts showing us the path for interest rates, inflation, employment, wages, business investment and tax receipts based on the Treasury\u2019s plans, however crazy they might be. The organisation was the creation of the Treasury; more particularly it was the creation of the then chancellor, George Osborne, and it was not designed to question his policies. This situation became stark in the last years of Osborne\u2019s tenure as he manipulated his tax and spending plans to conjure a smooth path of deficit reduction, knowing the OBR would be forced to follow his lead and simply calculate the impact of Treasury policies. More recently, the OBR has found itself in hot water over the basis of its forecasts using the budget plans of Osborne\u2019s successor, Philip Hammond. When it was first created in 2010, the OBR adopted the Treasury view that austerity would have very little impact on potential for economic growth. It predicted a surge in business investment and jobs as if the economy was about to bounce back from a medium-sized recession and not the worst financial crash in a century. For several years, its reports repeated the same nonsense that wages would soar and annual inflation return to the Bank\u2019s target of 2%, without any regard for what was obvious from just looking around. In this respect it followed the Treasury, many of the economists in the largest City banks and, most importantly, the Bank of England. After a few years the OBR realised this wasn\u2019t happening and changed its tune. Rather than businesses borrowing to invest, consumers would borrow to spend. However, without inflation-busting wage rises, the money would need to come from somewhere, and that somewhere would be loans. More than that, the consumer would borrow so much on mortgages, credit cards, overdrafts and car loans that total household borrowing would soar above the 2007 level by 2020, the OBR predicted. Things changed for a while in 2015 after oil prices dived, almost out of the blue. The dramatic fall in the cost of a barrel of oil meant that inflation fell to zero and suddenly lacklustre wage rises of barely 2% became a real boost. Yet this only accelerated another trend missed by the OBR. Hidden beneath the averages for household debt was the propensity for middle-income households, and especially those where the main wage earners were more than 50 years old, to take the benefit of ultra-low interest rates and real income rises to pay down their mortgages. They spent some of the gain from lower interest rates, but from 2009 onwards they were also embarking on their own austerity programme. Better late than never, the OBR adopted a new methodology for calculating household debt. Overnight the trend for rising household debt weakened. It was no longer going to rise to credit crunch levels. This was shown most starkly in the OBR forecast conducted for the budget in March. At the time this re-evaluation was widely welcomed. No longer would Britain\u2019s growth be built on a mountain of debt. That would be comforting, however, if the average household debt figure was representative of most households. Unfortunately, a large minority of households, many of them living in rented accommodation, are caught in a spiral of unsecured debt that has already sent the total for the UK above \u00a3200bn and, according to the OBR, will send it soaring further until it reaches a new peak as a ratio of GDP as soon as 2020. As part of the OBR\u2019s re-evaluation of mortgage debt, the forecaster found that its overall debt figures more generally failed to add up. There are four main creditors and debtors in any economy. They are households, companies, the government and foreign investors. At any one time these elements are supposed to be in balance. So if households are spending more than their income would allow, they must be borrowing the balance and another group must be lending. For the last couple of years the OBR\u2019s figures haven\u2019t added up. Businesses have not stepped in to borrow now that households have cut back. The government has eased back on austerity and the deficit with foreign investors has moderated, but not enough to make up the difference. The OBR blames the discrepancy on official statistics, which also fail to balance. Yet, while this may be true, it is not hard to see why opposition politicians and more thoughtful Tories believe the OBR is not up to the task of offering an unbiased, critical view of where the Treasury is taking us. There needs to be a broader, in-depth examination of where the economy is going, especially when the averages for debt, wages and household wealth disguise more than they reveal. The path chosen by the Treasury is not without huge risks. But the only one it highlights is the risk of higher government borrowing. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England since 2013, made reference to the persistent and large borrowing from abroad in a speech last year when he warned that Brexit could test \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d. That was ignored, leaving Britain\u2019s current-account deficit, which is the largest in the G7 nations, to be factored into the next five-year forecast. Andrew Bailey, the boss of the main financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, is concerned that significant numbers of families are drowning in debt. Is anyone listening? Not if the OBR forecast for soaring unsecured personal debt is anything to go by. Their warnings are not enough. The Labour MPs Frank Field and Rachel Reeves, who head the work and pensions and business select committees, have called for an independent commission to examine Britain\u2019s growing debt problem. Parliament should heed this call and insist one is convened.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a sad economic choice: accept the need for mounting debts just to achieve moderate growth or crack down on borrowing and get no growth at all.</p> <p>When there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/29/biggest-ever-study-of-food-banks-warns-use-likely-to-increase\">queues at food banks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/10/child-poverty-david-cameron-austerity\">child poverty is on the rise</a>, it might seem irresponsible to choose between reckless growth and sober stagnation. Neither option does the poorest any favours, but that appears to be the main dilemma for central bank policymakers.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve and Bank of England think they can have it both ways. Not for the first time, they argue that clever regulation of the financial sector can allow for a rise in borrowing to spur moderate growth, without the risks associated with this strategy.<br></p> <p>Other state bodies are not getting involved in the debate, instead focusing narrowly on an agenda set by the government and accepting the regulators\u2019 assurances that they are on top of the situation.</p> <p>Other agencies of the state that participate in this debate refuse to question the tradeoff. Instead they focus narrowly on an agenda set by the government and accept the assurances of the regulators that clever people in positions of seniority are on top of the situation.<br></p> <p>Among the bodies that sit on the sidelines is the Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain\u2019s independent economic forecasting body. You might think that from its title it would have a moral duty to question the roots of the government\u2019s economic planning. You would be wrong. The OBR makes forecasts showing us the path for interest rates, inflation, employment, wages, business investment and tax receipts based on the Treasury\u2019s plans, however crazy they might be.</p> <p>The organisation was the creation of the Treasury; more particularly it was the creation of the then chancellor, George Osborne, and it was not designed to question his policies. This situation became stark in the last years of Osborne\u2019s tenure as he manipulated his tax and spending plans to conjure a smooth path of deficit reduction, knowing the OBR would be forced to follow his lead and simply calculate the impact of Treasury policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/18/uk-debt-crisis-credit-cards-car-loans\">The UK's debt crisis \u2013\u00a0in figures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More recently, the OBR has found itself in hot water over the basis of its forecasts using the budget plans of Osborne\u2019s successor, Philip Hammond.</p> <p>When it was first created in 2010, the OBR adopted the Treasury view that austerity would have very little impact on potential for economic growth. It predicted a surge in business investment and jobs as if the economy was about to bounce back from a medium-sized recession and not the worst financial crash in a century.</p> <p>For several years, its reports repeated the same nonsense that wages would soar and annual inflation return to the Bank\u2019s target of 2%, without any regard for what was obvious from just looking around. In this respect it followed the Treasury, many of the economists in the largest City banks and, most importantly, the Bank of England.</p> <p>After a few years the OBR realised this wasn\u2019t happening and changed its tune. Rather than businesses borrowing to invest, consumers would borrow to spend. However, without inflation-busting wage rises, the money would need to come from somewhere, and that somewhere would be loans. More than that, the consumer would borrow so much on mortgages, credit cards, overdrafts and car loans that total household borrowing would soar above the 2007 level by 2020, the OBR predicted.</p> <p>Things changed for a while in 2015 after oil prices dived, almost out of the blue. The dramatic fall in the cost of a barrel of oil meant that inflation fell to zero and suddenly lacklustre wage rises of barely 2% became a real boost.</p> <p>Yet this only accelerated another trend missed by the OBR. Hidden beneath the averages for household debt was the propensity for middle-income households, and especially those where the main wage earners were more than 50 years old, to take the benefit of ultra-low interest rates and real income rises to pay down their mortgages. They spent some of the gain from lower interest rates, but from 2009 onwards they were also embarking on their own austerity programme.</p> <p>Better late than never, the OBR adopted a new methodology for calculating household debt. Overnight the trend for rising household debt weakened. It was no longer going to rise to credit crunch levels. This was shown most starkly in the OBR forecast conducted for the budget in March.</p> <p>At the time this re-evaluation was widely welcomed. No longer would Britain\u2019s growth be built on a mountain of debt. That would be comforting, however, if the average household debt figure was representative of most households.</p> <p>Unfortunately, a large minority of households, many of them living in rented accommodation, are caught in a spiral of unsecured debt that has already sent the total for the UK above \u00a3200bn and, according to the OBR, will send it soaring further until it reaches a new peak as a ratio of GDP as soon as 2020.</p> <p>As part of the OBR\u2019s re-evaluation of mortgage debt, the forecaster found that its overall debt figures more generally failed to add up.</p> <p>There are four main creditors and debtors in any economy. They are households, companies, the government and foreign investors. At any one time these elements are supposed to be in balance. So if households are spending more than their income would allow, they must be borrowing the balance and another group must be lending.</p> <p>For the last couple of years the OBR\u2019s figures haven\u2019t added up. Businesses have not stepped in to borrow now that households have cut back. The government has eased back on austerity and the deficit with foreign investors has moderated, but not enough to make up the difference.</p> <p>The OBR blames the discrepancy on official statistics, which also fail to balance. Yet, while this may be true, it is not hard to see why opposition politicians and more thoughtful Tories believe the OBR is not up to the task of offering an unbiased, critical view of where the Treasury is taking us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/18/credit-card-user-debt-advice\">'They just kept topping it up' \u2013\u00a0how one credit card user fell \u00a328,000 in debt</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2017/08/were-racing-towards-another-private-debt-crisis-so-why-did-no-one-see-it\">There needs to be a broader, in-depth examination of where the economy is going</a>, especially when the averages for debt, wages and household wealth disguise more than they reveal.</p> <p>The path chosen by the Treasury is not without huge risks.

      "bodyText": "The moment was hugely significant and yet so heavily flagged that it passed without a tremor in the financial markets. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen confirmed last Wednesday that the central bank would start to unwind the vast holdings of government and mortgage debt it acquired in the years following the 2008 financial crash. The Fed, under former chairman Ben Bernanke, more than quadrupled the size of its balance sheet, to $4.5tn, by purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities under a programme dubbed quantitative easing (QE). Many were from the effectively bust Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage lenders. In 2014 Bernanke hinted that the time had come to sell some of this vast fund back to private investors or, more precisely, to stop buying back the bonds when they matured. Widely seen as a precursor to much higher interest rates, this had the effect of sending the cost of borrowing in dollars over the next 30 years rocketing. Markets across the world went into shock. The taper tantrum, as it became known, revealed how countries such as Turkey, which had borrowed heavily in dollars to revive its economy, were suddenly faced with the prospect of escalating interest bills. Ankara was hit especially hard after much of its corporate sector was revealed to be financed with dollars borrowed from New York banks. In the years in between, the Fed made the case for unwinding QE several times, but at any sign of a tantrum from the markets it throttled back. In December 2015, the Washington-based Fed made a move to increase interest rates and has made three more such moves since then, taking its base rate from a range of 0% to 0.5% (effectively 0.25%) to 1% to 1.5% (1.25%). Now says Yellen, QE will be unwound on a parallel track, with a further four rate increases by the end of next year, without any promises about the timing of the interest rate rises. The question must be, why adopt a circumspect outlook over increases in the cost of borrowing when the Fed feels comfortable about reducing QE? Surely the US economy is strong enough to withstand both after registering annualised GDP growth of 3% in the past quarter. Yellen is quite rightly concerned about falling consumer prices and the prospect of entering 2018 with a plan for raising rates while forecasts show inflation heading back to 1% \u2013 and missing its 2% target by a country mile. She has tried to explain away some of the drop in inflation by blaming one-off factors, but has conceded that core inflation, a measure that strips out volatile factors, will not head back to 2% until 2019, a year later than previously forecast. Another argument against a rate rise or unwinding of QE is the relationship between wages and inflation. The Fed had hoped that low unemployment and strong growth in new jobs would send wages through the roof. This would give the economy a solid foundation for growth, allow shops to increase prices and be the perfect pretext for raising interest rates. However, the US recovery is built on the same flimsy foundations as the UK\u2019s. There are millions of low-paid jobs in the leisure and hospitality industries, the transport industry delivering Amazon parcels and in wholesalers\u2019 distribution warehouses. There are no wage rises to be had in these workplaces, no fringe benefits and no job security. That\u2019s why consumer spending growth in the US, like in the UK, is largely fuelled by consumer borrowing. Worse, there is some evidence that lenders in the US are loosening the criteria they use for consumer lending, especially car loans, which could be sowing the seeds of the next crash. It is true that increasing the cost of credit could choke off demand for the riskiest loans. It is more likely to simply raise the cost of borrowing for millions of people, who will be forced further into debt. In this context, tightening monetary policy is a misstep. The smartphone wars are over \u2013 and both sides were victorious Ten years ago, they stood in rapturous lines. On Friday, the first person in the world to buy a new iPhone 8 Plus, in Australia, wasn\u2019t even getting it for himself; he was queueing for the attention, and will give the phone to his mother. He\u2019s waiting for the even-pricier iPhone X, with face recognition, animated emoji and a Samsung-made OLED screen, which won\u2019t be available until November, and surely in short supply even then. While the queues have died down compared to the past because Apple and the mobile networks sell a lot of phones online now, and in more countries \u2013 removing the need for \u201cgrey market\u201d buyers \u2013 all the talk is about the forthcoming top-end phone, whose \u00a3999 starting price is also a standout feature of sorts. But has Apple snookered itself? The last time it released a \u201clow-end\u201d iPhone, with the 5C in 2013 alongside the \u201chigh-end\u201d 5S, demand for the latter outstripped supply, while the \u201cunashamedly plastic\u201d 5C sat on shelves. Online ordering suggests the two iPhone 8 models are in plentiful supply, with only a few specific versions hard to get. Given that new iPhones have looked almost identical externally since 2014, perhaps Foxconn has got better at making them in huge volumes. Perhaps. But more likely is that people are slavering at the idea of the X, just as they did for the 5S. Even so, Apple can now rely on a huge base of users who will upgrade over time at a predictable rate. If they can\u2019t get an X (and it\u2019s likely many will be disappointed because production seems to be severely limited), they\u2019ll satisfy themselves with an 8. The smartphone wars are essentially over: the number of people switching in either direction between iPhones and phones using Google\u2019s Android is tiny compared with the billions of users worldwide. Now the iPhone\u2019s look is changing, the 8 may be the last of its kind. It\u2019s almost certain next year\u2019s models will have the X\u2019s OLED screen, adding LG as a supplier. And the queues? We\u2019ve probably seen the last of those too. M&amp;S duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange delivered in an hour: is it a good gig? Having waited a decade longer than its rivals, M&amp;S is finally taking its upmarket food halls online. Despite it being official that the internet has caught on, M&amp;S chief executive Steve Rowe is treading carefully with two modest trials: a fast home delivery service in central London akin to Amazon and apps such as UberEats; and what is basically a click and collect service in Berkshire. After a strong run, M&amp;S food no longer sets the heather on fire, so seeking the sweet spot in Britain\u2019s \u00a3180bn grocery market would seem wise. But M&amp;S needs to tread more carefully than most in the controversial gig economy. In London, its orders are delivered by courier firm Gophr \u2013 which uses self-employed riders \u2013 but the retailer says it is \u201cculturally aligned\u201d with its own business. Rowe had better hope it truly is: his is not any online grocery service, this is a Marks &amp; Spencer food delivery service. It needs to be truly special.",

      "bodyText": "This is quite an anniversary year for great British economic disasters. Last weekend saw the 25th anniversary of the ignominious exit of the pound from the European exchange rate mechanism \u2013 \u201cthe first Brexit\u201d, and, I still hope, the only one. Then this November will see the 50th anniversary of the dramatic 14% devaluation of the pound \u2013 an episode from which the Labour government of Harold Wilson never quite recovered, not least because Wilson made the mistake of proclaiming that \u201cthe pound in your pocket has not been devalued\u201d \u2013 based on a brief by Treasury officials which was aimed at explaining that, from the point of view of the pocket or purse, it was only the price of imports that were going up, and spending on imports was only a small fraction of total household spending. At least, it was in those days. As even people who voted Leave are beginning to realise, the recent referendum-induced devaluation is having a very noticeable impact on the prices of the vast number of imported goods and food items that we now take for granted. Yet \u2013 unlike, it seems, the recent devaluation \u2013 the 1967 one, thought disastrous for the reputation of the government, was a success from the point of view of (eventually) correcting the trade deficit. Unfortunately for Labour, however, some freak trade figures published on the eve of the 1970 general election enabled the tabloid press to proclaim \u201cBritain Back in the Red\u201d. This was a brief phenomenon, but it contributed to the electoral damage Wilson suffered. Today, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Bank of England still point to a dismal UK trading performance, and the OECD\u2019s post-referendum forecasts show the economy being outpaced by our continental friends, with growth a miserable 1.1% (fourth quarter, 2016 to 2017) and a forecast of 0.9% next year. How\u2019s that for a Brexit boost to the economy? Now, the recovery in the export/import relationship in the late 1960s took time. We talk about the \u201cJ curve\u201d to illustrate how things got worse before they got better: first higher import prices, then the impact of price changes on the volume of exports (a boost) and imports (a discouragement). However, one of the problems 50 years later is that industrial decline has left British industry smaller, as a proportion of gross domestic product, and it is an open question whether there will be such marked J-curve effects as before. Ah, I hear the Brexiters who brought us this devaluation cry, what about our strength in financial services? Here we come to the nub of the crisis, induced by our so-called leaders\u2019 lame acceptance of a referendum result so close that Nigel Farage would have demanded another vote if it had gone the other way. While so much of the publicity seems to be devoted to the cost of the \u201cexit bill\u201d, the real cost lies with all the uncertainty that the prospect of Brexit has provoked: vital economic actors are leaving town and country; investment and trade are suffering; and a divided, second-rate government, which is making a false show of unity, continues to live in a fantasy world where we can enjoy all the benefits of the largest trading group in the world and none of the responsibilities. Which brings me back to Black Wednesday. In a new book, my co-authors and I argue that this \u201cfirst Brexit\u201d, in 1992, led, via a long fuse, to the referendum and its explosive result. Leaving the exchange rate mechanisim emboldened the Eurosceptics in the Conservative party to perfect a guerrilla campaign against our membership of the European Union, which eventually brought us to this juncture. All the while, by the way, Britain was having almost the best of both European worlds, enjoying the benefits while negotiating numerous opt-outs from what did not appeal. The more messianic of the Brexiters are drawing a false analogy between the outcome of Black Wednesday and the outcome of Brexit (if the country does not come to its senses). After Black Wednesday, we were freed from the mechanism that forced excessively high interest rates in order to preserve the value of the pound\u2019s relationship to the Deutschmark. Interest rates came down dramatically, and the economy grew so rapidly that \u2013 guess what \u2013 the fiscal position also improved. This time, interest rates are so low that the only question \u2013 repeated ad nauseam in the financial press \u2013 is when they are going to go up. And, God help us, far from benefiting from J-curve effects, many firms that operate here because of the advantages of the single market for their supply chains are \u201cconsidering their position\u201d. This is a national disaster waiting to happen. One way or another, it has to be averted. We face enough economic problems as it is. Perhaps the ultimate irony is that more and more people are claiming that the referendum was a protest vote against austerity. Unless there is a change of heart soon, there will be even more, Brexit-induced, austerity. I sincerely hope that Brexit will not happen, so that there will be no need for a 25th or 50th anniversary. \u2022 Six Days in September \u2013 Black Wednesday, Brexit and the Making of Europe, by William Keegan, David Marsh and Richard Roberts is out now, published by OMFIF",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s an old story about Michael O\u2019Leary that sums up the outspoken boss of Ryanair. Former Aer Lingus chief executive Willie Walsh, now supremo of British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG, was driving when he heard O\u2019Leary interviewed on the radio, bragging about Ryanair\u2019s low prices compared with those of the Irish flag carrier. Walsh, a pugnacious character himself, pulled over, called the radio station and invited himself into the studio to dispute his rival\u2019s claims. What followed was an acrimonious encounter, each man lobbing vicious barbs at one another. But as soon as they came off air, a beaming O\u2019Leary strode up to Walsh and shook his hand, saying: \u201cThat was brilliant Willie, we must do this again as soon as possible.\u201d For most of his 23 years as chief executive, O\u2019Leary has lived by the motto that there is no such thing as bad publicity. His roll-call of insults, outlandish claims and four-letter tirades is too long to rehearse exhaustively, but there are some particular highlights. He once joked that Ryanair pilots would \u201cengineer a bit of turbulence\u201d in order to boost drinks sales and has also said he would like to charge for use of the toilet. \u201cI would wipe their bums for a fiver,\u201d he quipped. Most bosses would never dream of insulting customers, but O\u2019Leary has made a virtue of it, calling passengers forced to pay a \u20ac60 fine for forgetting their boarding card \u201cstupid\u201d. On occasion he has managed to insult diametrically opposed interest groups within a sentence. \u201cThe airline business is mostly run by a bunch of spineless nincompoops who actually don\u2019t want to stand up to the environmentalists and call them the lying wankers that they are,\u201d he has said. Born into an affluent farming family, he attended Clongowes Wood, the elite private boarding school in County Kildare, and Trinity College Dublin. While many airline bosses were once pilots, O\u2019Leary trained as an accountant, advising the airline\u2019s founder Tony Ryan on his personal tax affairs, before enjoying a rapid rise to the top job at Ryanair under Ryan\u2019s wing. Somewhere along the way, he has become better known for bombast and an understanding of how to grab the attention of the media. Possessed of a shrewd financial mind, O\u2019Leary spotted that the future lay in the low-cost model that has turned Ryanair into Europe\u2019s biggest airline by passenger numbers, learning from and building on the business strategy pioneered by US carrier Southwest Airlines. Ryanair\u2019s initial success was built on luring passengers with rock-bottom fares, while charging them for everything from checking in their luggage to inflight food and drink. Costs were also kept to a minimum by measures including making staff pay for their own training, uniforms and meals. However, after Ryanair slipped to a quarterly loss at the end of 2013 O\u2019Leary introduced a radical new corporate philosophy \u2013 being nicer \u2013 which has helped the airline kick on to further success. The carrier introduced new features including allocated seating, bottle-warming, changing facilities, free room for children\u2019s car-seats, an extra cabin bag for children and discounts on their checked-in bags. It also allowed passengers to take a second bag without incurring a fine.",
