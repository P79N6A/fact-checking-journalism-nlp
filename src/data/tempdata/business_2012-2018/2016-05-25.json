      "bodyText": "Rex Tillerson, the boss of oil giant ExxonMobil, said cutting oil production was \u201cnot acceptable for humanity\u201d as he fought off shareholders\u2019 and activists\u2019 attempts to force the company to fully acknowledge the impact of climate change on the environment and Exxon\u2019s future profits. During a long and fractious annual meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, Tillerson, who serves as Exxon\u2019s chairman and chief executive, beat back several proposals to force the company to take more action on climate change. However, dissident shareholders won a vote that could make it easier for them to propose board candidates concerned about climate change and remove incumbent directors. Tillerson said Exxon had invested $7bn in green technology, but the science and technology had not yet achieved the breakthroughs needed to compete with fossil fuels. \u201cUntil we have those, just saying \u2018turn the taps off\u2019 is not acceptable to humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s presentation at the meeting showed that Exxon believes oil and gas will still provide about 60% of the world\u2019s energy demands by 2040, even if countries adopt climate change proposals agreed in Paris last year. His comments came after investors urged Exxon, the world\u2019s largest oil company, with a market value of $374bn (\u00a3254bn), to reduce carbon extraction or at least warn investors about how global governmental action against climate change could affect the viability of its fossil fuel assets. More than 38% of Exxon\u2019s investors rebelled against the company by voting for a proposal that would have required the company to publish an annual study of how its profits may be affected by public climate change policies, following the Paris climate agreement, to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2C (3.6F). A similar vote at Chevron\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, also held on Wednesday, showed 41% support from Chevron investors that cast ballots. Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church of England, who proposed the resolution, said he was delighted at the \u201cvery significant shareholder revolt on climate change\u201d. \u201cConsidering the scale of this vote, we urge Exxon to sit down urgently with its investors to agree the reporting it will provide on the risk that climate change policy poses to its business. Following the Paris agreement, the time for climate risk reporting has well and truly arrived and the investor call for it is clear. It will not go away.\u201d Mason, who helps manage \u00a36.7bn of assets for the Church Commissioners for England, said it wasn\u2019t just the environment that was at risk, but also the billions of dollars invested in Exxon, if it does not adapt quickly to a changing world. \u201cThe financial risks of not acting are very real,\u201d he said. Exxon had tried to block the resolution from being heard at its meeting, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulator ruled that it must include the resolution among Wednesday\u2019s votes. \u201cGiven the significant resources Exxon spent fighting this proposal, such a strong vote is a real rebuke to company management,\u201d said Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas for Ceres, a coalition of sustainable investment groups. \u201cInvestors have sent a clear message that meaningful 2 degree stress testing is the new normal, and companies like Exxon and Chevron can no longer act as if nothing has changed.\u201d Tillerson, who was paid $23.4m last year, also suffered an investor backlash over his current position as both chairman and CEO. Some 38.8% of investors voted for a resolution asking that the company appoint an independent chairman when Tillerson stands down. He is due to retire before his 65th birthday, in March 2017. Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement for Arjuna Capital, who proposed one of the motions, said: \u201cWhile the business plan of extracting as much carbon as possible was a winner last century, it will destroy value this century, and already has.\u201d The Guardian was banned from reporting from inside the meeting, and instead listened to proceedings via webcast. \u201cWe are denying your request because of the Guardian\u2019s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting, demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers,\u201d a spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel is considering keeping its UK business, raising hopes that the Port Talbot steelworks and 11,000 jobs can be saved. Sources close to Tata Steel said it is evaluating the performance of its UK operations and the package of financial support that the government has offered, at the same time as running a sales process. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, held talks with Tata Steel in Mumbai before of the company\u2019s board meeting on Wednesday. He is thought to have asked it to consider keeping the business. At a press conference after the board meeting, Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel, said the company was still evaluating offers for the UK business. The deadline for potential buyers to make a formal bid was Monday and the company was expected to try to draw up a shortlist at the board meeting. Eight bidders are thought to be in the running, including metals group Liberty House, Excalibur, a management buyout backed by a Welsh consortium, Leeds-based private equity firm Endless, JSW Steel of India and US group Nucor. Chatterjee said: \u201cWe are running a credible process, working with the government. Each step has been done with a lot of careful consideration. We need to consider these bids, understand who wants what, and how, and understand the implications for Tata.\u201d However, a Tata source said: \u201cIt is a possibility they might stay on. They are evaluating that in parallel with the sales process. If what the government is saying is ok, they will stay.\u201d When asked at the press conference about keeping Tata Steel UK, Chatterjee did not rule it out and said the management team were still \u201clooking at continuing and sustaining the business\u201d. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a case as yet.\u201d Chatterjee also declined to confirm how many formal bids had been received and the identity of the interested parties. Javid has said the government is willing to offer hundreds of millions of pounds to a buyer of Tata Steel UK and is also looking at ways to restructure the pension scheme, which has liabilities of almost \u00a315bn and costs more than \u00a3100m a year to support. This package could also be available to Tata Steel, although it is not clear whether they would take up the government\u2019s offer of a 25% stake in the business. However, there is a row within the government about Javid\u2019s plan to cut the liabilities of the pension scheme by benchmarking it against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI) and spinning it off into a new financial vehicle. The Department for Work and Pensions is concerned this could set a dangerous precedent for defined benefit pension schemes. Javid is scheduled to update parliament on the progress of talks on Thursday. David Cameron warned on Wednesday that there was no guarantee that attempts to save 12,000 jobs at Tata Steel UK will succeed. The prime minister said the government was doing everything it could to secure a buyer for the business, which includes two blast furnaces at Port Talbot in south Wales. But he added: \u201cAs I\u2019ve always said there are no guarantees. We can\u2019t guarantee this is going to work.\u201d Cameron made his comments as he was travelling to a G7 summit in Japan, where world leaders are likely to discuss the dire impact that Chinese steel dumping is having on the industry. \u201cQuite a feature will be dangers of overcapacity in sectors like steel,\u201d he said, adding that he planned to use the meeting to discuss the issue with the presidents of the European commission and council, as well as the leaders of France, Germany and Italy. Cameron added: \u201cWe continue to work towards trying to get a good outcome for Tata in south Wales. The sales process is underway, there have been an encouraging number of serious bids from companies coming through. We\u2019ve got to stick at it to try to bring this to successful conclusion.\u201d Workers from Tata Steel and other British producers marched on Westminster on Wednesday to call for a responsible sale of the UK business and for a government strategy to support the industry. MPs have accused Javid and the government of reacting too slowly to the crisis in the industry. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, joined the workers\u2019 march and said his party was doing everything it could to support the steel industry. \u201cWe have to secure enough time to make sure the industry has a future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe industry is strong and the workers are incredibly skilled. It cannot be allowed to go to the wall.\u201d Owen Smith, Labour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary, commenting on the news that the government is to publish a written statement on Thursday on its plans for the Tata Steel UK pension scheme, said: \u201cSteel workers\u2019 pensions must be protected, they\u2019ve earned them with hard graft over many years. So if ministers are considering measures which might see those pensions reduced, MPs from all parties, especially those representing steel communities, will want a chance to question the plans, along with the trade unions who are playing such a vital and impressive role standing up for Tata workers.\u201d Tata, the Indian conglomerate that also makes Jaguar cars and Tetley tea, announced in March it wanted to sell its UK steel business. The business, which it bought in 2007, was losing an estimated \u00a31m a day. Tata blamed cheap Chinese imports and high business costs. Tata Steel reported that it had a net loss of 32.1bn rupees (\u00a3325m) in the three months to 31 March. This reflects the pressure the business is under, although it is smaller than the 56.7bn rupees loss of a year earlier.",

The impact of new tariffs in overseas markets would also be a burden for UK businesses, adding a further \u00a35.5bn to the costs of trade, he said. \u201cThe consumer in the UK will have to pay those duties,\u201d Azevedo said. \u201cThe UK is not in a position to decide \u2018I\u2019m not charging duties here\u2019. That is impossible. That is illegal.\u201d His comments came as ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said sterling\u2019s status as a reserve currency would be jeopardised by a decision to quit the EU as central banks around the world would sell their holdings in favour of more secure currencies. S&amp;P said countries with a reserve currency earned considerable income from heavy trading on foreign exchange markets and enjoyed lower interest charges on overseas debt. \u201cA departure from the EU could put sterling\u2019s reserve status at risk by deterring foreign direct investment and other capital inflows into the UK,\u201d it said, adding that because last year\u2019s current account deficit was the world\u2019s second-highest, any decline in capital inflows would weaken the pound and hit GDP growth. The remain camp said the two interventions left the economic argument for leaving the EU \u201cin tatters\u201d. Former business secretary Vince Cable said Brexit campaigners believed British businesses would be no worse off operating under WTO rules compared to exporting from inside the EU. \u201cBut the head of the WTO has warned leaving the EU could cost the UK billions in trade and lead to years of damaging uncertainty. The comments from the WTO are especially important as Boris Johnson has made clear that his vision of a \u2018Brexit future\u2019 lies within a WTO framework. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s warning over sterling would mean higher prices, higher mortgage rates and more government debt.\u201d Boris Johnson told the BBC in April: \u201cThe WTO has changed the way trade works in the world now. Tariff barriers are much less important and don\u2019t forget 73% of the non-EU trade we do at the moment is done without any kind of trade deal whatsoever.\u201d The WTO and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which came into force in 1948, were created to lower trade barriers and police disputes. Azevedo told the Financial Times: \u201cPretty much all of the UK\u2019s trade [with the world] would somehow have to be negotiated. It is extremely difficult and complex to negotiate these trade agreements. And slow as well. Even if you are in a position to negotiate quickly with all these other members it doesn\u2019t mean that they will be in a position to negotiate with you because they have their own priorities.\u201d Responding to Azevedo\u2019s comments, the chief executive of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliot, said: \u201cAt the moment our trade relations are dictated by the EU, and this means British businesses are subject to unnecessary constraints. For example, we are forbidden from making free-trade agreements with India and other emerging economies, and we are bound by rules and regulations that we have no say over. Not only that, we currently have no seat at the WTO but are just one of 28 countries represented by the EU. If we vote leave, we can take back control of our our own trade relations, and look forward to a more secure and more prosperous future.\u201d Britain could opt to simply scrap all trade barriers, as some free market economists have advocated, and turn its economy into a duty-free state, but that was unlikely, Azevedo said. He suggested that a burden of great responsibility rested with UK voters regarding Britain\u2019s future trade position and the wider economy. Azevedo said: \u201cIt is a very important decision for the British people. It is a sovereign decision and they will decide what they want to decide. But it is very important, particularly with regard to trade, which is something very important for the British economy, that people have the facts and that they don\u2019t underestimate the challenges.\u201d S&amp;P analyst Frank Gill said several other countries could soon be in a position to take over from sterling as a reserve currency, which it defines as accounting for at least 3% of global foreign exchange reserves. The Australian and Canadian dollars have increased from close to zero a decade ago to a combined 3.8% at the end of last year.",

      "bodyText": "The Duracell and Energizer bunnies are set to fight it out in court, after a judge ruled that a legal tussle over the right to use a rabbit mascot can proceed. Duracell failed in a bid to dismiss a lawsuit by Energizer, which claims that its rights to use a pink bunny to advertise batteries in the US have been violated. While Duracell\u2019s bunny is 16 years older than Energizer\u2019s, having been born in 1973, the latter firm has the sole right to sell rabbit-emblazoned batteries in the US. Duracell retained European rights to the familiar bunny in a landmark rabbit-sharing deal between the two companies struck in 1992. But Energizer claims its rights are being violated because packets of Duracell batteries featuring a rabbit have begun showing up in US stores after being imported from Europe. It says this is likely to confuse customers and damage its business, which has been using a drumming bunny in US marketing since 1989, making the claim that its batteries \u201ckeep going and going and going\u201d. Duracell, owned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s firm, Berkshire Hathaway, has called the suit a thinly veiled attempt to renegotiate the two companies\u2019 1992 agreement to divide rabbit rights between Europe and North America. The firm argues that it is unable to stop distributors exporting batteries to the US, where it does not use the Duracell bunny in its advertising. Energizer claims the distributors are firms that its rival \u201cdirectly or indirectly controls or over which Duracell has the ability to exercise control\u201d. US district judge Carol Jackson in St Louis ruled Duracell had no basis with which to dismiss the suit, adding that Energizer\u2019s claim had a chance of succeeding if it could be shown that Duracell had a close relationship with its distributors. Jackson also dismissed claims against former Duracell parent Procter &amp; Gamble and its Gillette unit, finding no sign they sold batteries or were involved in the 1992 agreement. The rabbit row between Duracell and Energizer is the second major trademark battle to get the go-ahead in a week, after it emerged that dating app Tinder is to sue 3nder, a rival app aimed at people seeking threesomes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Steve Rowe\u2019s first outing as chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer contained an odd mix of refreshing candour plus a surprising dose of the jargon that has infected too many M&amp;S bosses over the years. The encouraging part is that Rowe has given up the pretence that a return to growth in clothing lies around the next corner, which was predecessor Marc Bolland\u2019s pitch for the past two years. Rowe admits M&amp;S has underperformed in clothes; wants to give up chasing fashion trends; is aiming to make the clothes more accessible; will lower prices instead of engaging in stop-start promotions; and will try not to baffle the customers with all those \u201csub-brands\u201d. Jolly good, it sounds like a plan. And there is no disgrace in saying improvements will take time to arrive: at M&amp;S, they always do. The City, naturally, concentrated on Rowe\u2019s warning that the overhaul, plus tricky trading conditions at home and abroad, will have an \u201cadverse impact on profit in the short term.\u201d Analysts translated his words as a \u00a3100m whack, which is why the share price fell 10%. Rowe, though, is right not to fret about the short term. He has inherited from Bolland an upgraded supply chain and a website that (finally) works. Now is the moment to arrest the loss of market share in clothing, which Bolland never did, and stop muddling through by boosting profit margins \u2013 a tactic that was bound to run out of steam eventually. It\u2019s a credible approach and, at 400p, the shares carry a dividend yield (ignoring Wednesday\u2019s small special) of 4.7%. That\u2019s not bad if you believe M&amp;S\u2019s latest self-help plan won\u2019t imperil the divi. Rowe, though, could do himself a favour by sparing us the sermons on \u201ccherishing Mrs M&amp;S\u201d. The language is straight out of the 1980s and will alienate most of the 50-year-olds Rowe is supposedly describing. As for the commitment to make \u201cevery moment special for our customers\u201d, tone it down a bit: some of us just want to buy our socks in peace. One expects better of a Millwall fan whose nickname is Nails. Far from Arcadia This week\u2019s hearings on BHS have clarified one part of the complicated tale. The plan to revitalise the loss-making chain of department stores had a simple aim \u2013 shaft the landlords. None of the witnesses put it like that (though one MP did). Instead, the Grant Thornton partner who had provided due diligence services on BHS said on Wednesday: \u201cThe perception was that while BHS was part of Arcadia \u2013 even though it [Arcadia] was not a guarantor \u2013 it was difficult to renegotiate leases.\u201d Put another way, the landlords would never agree to cut rents while Sir Philip Green and Arcadia were seen to be standing behind BHS. Instead, there had to be a credible threat that BHS could go bust, which is why Green decided to seek a buyer in the first place. Arcadia\u2019s own management said as much in Monday\u2019s session. In pure business terms, it\u2019s possible to admire Green\u2019s calculation. But if you\u2019re going play those games, you have a moral obligation to protect workers and ensure pensioners are not hurt in the process. Instead, the chosen buyer was an outfit led by a former bankrupt, Dominic Chappell, with little retail experience and only sketchy funding. Under this new ownership, the threat of a collapse at BHS wasn\u2019t merely possible, but far too credible. Thus the big question for Green remains as pressing as it did at the outset: having enjoyed hefty dividends from BHS in happier times, do you really think your responsibilities to BHS pensioners ended the day you sold to a crew like Chappell\u2019s? Sajid\u2019s seven-day dream Is business secretary Sajid Javid engaging in government by headlines? It looks that way after the sceptical response by the Council of Mortgage Lenders to Javid\u2019s idea of giving homeowners the right to switch their mortgage within a week. The CML points out mortgages aren\u2019t the same as phone lines, electricity and gas services, or even current accounts. For a start, lenders have to value the property secured against a mortgage. That is a regulatory requirement. It\u2019s not hard to imagine cases where a structural engineer has to be summoned or past insurance claims examined. \u201cWhether a seven-day target is realistic, given tasks that lenders need to complete to fulfil risk and regulatory requirements, depends on when the clock starts ticking,\u201d says the CML, very politely. Fair point: it all depends on when you start counting \u2013 before or after the checks. Javid shouldn\u2019t talk so loosely.",

And there is no disgrace in saying improvements will take time to arrive: at M&amp;S, they always do.</p> <p>The City, naturally, concentrated on Rowe\u2019s warning that the overhaul, plus tricky trading conditions at home and abroad, will have an \u201cadverse impact on profit in the short term.\u201d Analysts translated his words as a \u00a3100m whack, which is why the share price fell 10%.</p> <p>Rowe, though, is right not to fret about the short term. He has inherited from Bolland an upgraded supply chain and a website that (finally) works. Now is the moment to arrest the loss of market share in clothing, which Bolland never did, and stop muddling through by boosting profit margins \u2013 a tactic that was bound to run out of steam eventually. It\u2019s a credible approach and, at 400p, the shares carry a dividend yield (ignoring Wednesday\u2019s small special) of 4.7%. That\u2019s not bad if you believe M&amp;S\u2019s latest self-help plan won\u2019t imperil the divi.</p> <p>Rowe, though, could do himself a favour by sparing us the sermons on \u201ccherishing Mrs M&amp;S\u201d. The language is straight out of the 1980s and will alienate most of the 50-year-olds Rowe is supposedly describing. As for the commitment to make \u201cevery moment special for our customers\u201d, tone it down a bit: some of us just want to buy our socks in peace. One expects better of a Millwall fan whose nickname is Nails.</p> <h2>Far from Arcadia</h2> <p>This week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/philip-green-10m-a-year-in-bhs-pensions-scheme-mps-dominic-chappell\">hearings on BHS</a> have clarified one part of the complicated tale. The plan to revitalise the loss-making chain of department stores had a simple aim \u2013 shaft the landlords.</p> <p>None of the witnesses put it like that (though one MP did). Instead, the Grant Thornton partner who had provided due diligence services on BHS said on Wednesday: \u201cThe perception was that while BHS was part of Arcadia \u2013 even though it [Arcadia] was not a guarantor \u2013 it was difficult to renegotiate leases.\u201d</p> <p>Put another way, the landlords would never agree to cut rents while Sir Philip Green and Arcadia were seen to be standing behind BHS. Instead, there had to be a credible threat that BHS could go bust, which is why Green decided to seek a buyer in the first place. Arcadia\u2019s own management said as much in Monday\u2019s session.</p> <p>In pure business terms, it\u2019s possible to admire Green\u2019s calculation. But if you\u2019re going play those games, you have a moral obligation to protect workers and ensure pensioners are not hurt in the process.</p> <p>Instead, the chosen buyer was an outfit led by a former bankrupt, Dominic Chappell, with little retail experience and only sketchy funding. Under this new ownership, the threat of a collapse at BHS wasn\u2019t merely possible, but far too credible.</p> <p>Thus the big question for Green remains as pressing as it did at the outset: having enjoyed hefty dividends from BHS in happier times, do you really think your responsibilities to BHS pensioners ended the day you sold to a crew like Chappell\u2019s?</p> <h2>Sajid\u2019s seven-day dream</h2> <p>Is business secretary Sajid Javid engaging in government by headlines? It looks that way after the sceptical response by the Council of Mortgage Lenders to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/25/seven-day-switching-service-mortgages-consultation\">Javid\u2019s idea</a> of giving homeowners the right to switch their mortgage within a week.</p> <p>The CML points out mortgages aren\u2019t the same as phone lines, electricity and gas services, or even current accounts. For a start, lenders have to value the property secured against a mortgage. That is a regulatory requirement. It\u2019s not hard to imagine cases where a structural engineer has to be summoned or past insurance claims examined.</p> <p>\u201cWhether a seven-day target is realistic, given tasks that lenders need to complete to fulfil risk and regulatory requirements, depends on when the clock starts ticking,\u201d says the CML, very politely. Fair point: it all depends on when you start counting \u2013 before or after the checks. Javid shouldn\u2019t talk so loosely.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than \u00a3700m has been wiped off the market value of Marks &amp; Spencer after its chief executive warned his turnaround plan for its struggling clothing business would blow a hole in profits in the short term. The shares, which were already down by a quarter this year, slumped another 10% on Wednesday after Steve Rowe said the group needed to lower its prices and put more assistants on the shop floor to better serve its most loyal group of shoppers, dubbed \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d. These fiftysomething women had been neglected as it chased younger shoppers but Rowe promised to \u201ccherish and listen to her\u201d. M&amp;S\u2019s clothing sales have grown in only one quarter over the past five years and Rowe has made clear that reviving the division was his \u201cNo 1 priority\u201d. He said prices were out of kilter with the competition and in some cases it had \u201cgone a bit too fashionable\u201d. \u201cMrs M&amp;S has always been there but we have not always paid her enough attention,\u201d he said, adding that instead of sticking to the plan to bank profits from manufacturing its clothes more cheaply it would cut prices across 30% of its range. His comments came as M&amp;S reported a 3.5% increase in full-year profits to \u00a3684.1m in the year to 26 March. Sales rose 0.8% to \u00a310.4bn. The retailer has started a review of its cost base, but Rowe, who began his retail career at 15 as a Saturday boy at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store in south London, has delayed until the autumn any pronouncements on major business areas such as the future of its large store estate or its international arm, whose operating profits tumbled 40% to \u00a355.8m. It has also begun talks with staff over plans to shut its final salary pension scheme \u2013 which is already closed to new members. Rowe, who has worked at M&amp;S for 26 years, succeeded Marc Bolland as chief executive at the start of April. To rejuvenate its struggling clothing division he has promised to improve the quality and fit of its clothes as well as offer more entry level prices, addressing criticism that its fashion had become too expensive. \u201cWe are investing to re-establish our price position by sharpening prices and to enhance service by putting more employees into our stores,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cThese actions, combined with the difficult trading conditions, will have an adverse effect on profit in the short term.\u201d While customers can look forward to lower prices, investors were less enthused by the outlook for profits, given the years of heavy investment under Bolland were supposed to have laid the foundations for growth. In a measure designed to soothe disgruntled shareholders, the retailer said it was paying a special dividend of 4.6p a share, or a total of \u00a375m. Haitong analyst Tony Shiret predicted the City\u2019s profit forecast for the retailer would drop from \u00a3700m-$710m to \u00a3620m-\u00a3630m for this year. The warning on profits coupled with the delayed strategic review was a \u201cpoor combination\u201d, said Shiret. \u201cThe danger here is that the strategy review when it arrives will bring further news of negative numbers.\u201d Rowe was upfront that his turnaround of the business faced major headwinds. \u201cConsumer confidence has dipped, the clothing market is flat, online sales have slowed and there\u2019s deflation in the food market,\u201d he said. \u201cOur customers are changing too as they become increasingly style and health conscious, shop around and expect more.\u201d After analysing the behaviour of its 32 million shoppers he said that while some retained a \u201cdeep rooted affection for M&amp;S\u201d for others M&amp;S \u201cis no longer their first choice\u201d. He revealed that contrary to the popular view 42% of its shoppers were actually male and 22% were under 35. \u201cSo clearly they are not all old or female,\u201d he said although younger shoppers were more likely to be found in its foodhalls. Rowe said he had to act to stop the rot in clothing and home business because despite initiatives, such as a collaboration with TV presenter Alexa Chung, the division had haemorrhaged \u00a3200m of sales in the last three years. Over the same period its average clothing price had risen 13% with M&amp;S increasingly reliant on the \u201cdrug\u201d of discounting to stimulate sales, resulting in 40% of goods being marked down. \u201cThis started a damaging cycle for our clothing business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly got our price dynamic wrong.\u201d The retailer said it would now focus on delivering \u201cstylish everyday essentials\u201d andthat it was reducing the number of overall clothing options by 10% after shoppers complained its range had become unwieldy and confusing. Rowe also promised to spruce up store toilets and changing rooms, with grubby facilities a favourite gripe of its army of small investors-cum-shoppers at its annual meeting. \u201cOur customers look to M&amp;S not for fashion trends but for accessible products they can wear with confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will restore our price position by investing in everyday price and reducing the number of promotions and sales. We have been too reliant on promotions which has eroded our value credentials.\u201d",

Previous plans to privatise the agency, which keeps records of property ownership across England and Wales, were abandoned in 2014 after the then business secretary, Vince Cable, vetoed the move.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Debt campaigners criticise IMF over Greek deal - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "News of the Greek debt deal has seen stock markets record some good gains - apart ironically from in Athens - while Greek bond yields have fallen sharply. Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.47%, France\u2019s Cac closed 1.13% higher, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.66% and Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.32% higher. But after an early 1.5% rise, the Athens market ended virtually unchanged, slipping back 0.04% amid the threat of further strikes in protest against the proposed pension and tax reforms. Greek two year bond yields are currently down 80 basis points at 7.4% as investors welcomed the progress in the bailout talks. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. After Moody\u2019s saying the Greek deal was credit positive, Fitch has also welcomed the late night agreement but warned of possible problems implementing reform measures. The ratings agency said: The agreement reached between Greece and its eurozone creditors reduces the risk of another Greek liquidity crisis this summer, and incentivises the country to complete its third bail-out programme. However, with little debt relief offered upfront, the Greek government may find it progressively more difficult to continue with politically controversial measures required to meet ambitious programme commitments. Implementation risk therefore remains high. The agreement highlights the improved relations between Greece and its official creditors since last summer\u2019s often confrontational negotiations leading up to the current ESM programme. The Greek government has implemented prior actions, including pension reform and a contentious requirement for additional fiscal contingency measures to safeguard the 2018 budget target. For their part, Greece\u2019s official creditors have agreed to possible debt relief (nominal haircuts are still excluded)... Delivering debt relief in stages and contingent on programme performance could incentivise the Greek authorities to meet programme targets. However, given the track record of slippage under previous programmes in the past five years, we think there is still a high risk that the 2018 surplus target will be missed despite the agreement on a contingency fiscal mechanism. This risk could increase if the conditionality in Wednesday\u2019s agreement meant that sizeable debt relief came to be seen by Greek politicians or the public as a distant or unattainable prospect. A question mark is therefore likely to remain over the sustainability of Greek debt in the medium term. While gross financing needs are modest over the next few years, substantial increases in gross financing requirements would follow in the long term without further debt re-profiling. Our \u2018CCC\u2019 sovereign rating, which we affirmed in March, reflects risks to programme implementation and debt sustainability. The Eurogroup \u201cbreakthrough\u201d on debt relief was no such thing, says Joan Hoey, Greek analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: The coveted debt relief upon which the [Greek] prime minister has been banking, to provide a political fig leaf for his acceptance of another bailout, remains out of reach, contingent and unquantified. The Eurogroup did not finalise the long-delayed first review of the bailout programme. It looked at the reforms passed so far and found them wanting. It concluded that several conditions \u201cprior reforms\u201d will have to be met before any money can be handed over. The release of funds would then follow in two sub-tranches, the first amount of \u20ac7.5bn in June, depending on successful completion of \u201cprior actions\u201d. The balance of \u20ac2.8bn will be released only after the clearance of government arrears and after the government has met milestones related to the privatisation fund, bank governance, the revenue collection agency and the energy sector. This disbursement is scheduled for the end of the third quarter. The Eurogroup won a commitment from the IMF, with which it has been at loggerheads over debt relief, to participate in the bailout, pending approval from the Fund\u2019s executive board. We retain our view that disaffection in the party and among the electorate will grow, posing risks to political stability and Greece\u2019s membership of the eurozone. And now some comments emerging from the IMF: Here\u2019s a timeline of Greece\u2019s incoming bailout funds and outgoing payments in the next few months: European markets are holding onto their gains as they head to the close. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Stocks extended gains on Wednesday as a tentative agreement on Greek debt relief and a fresh seven-month high in the price of US oil offered more cause for optimism. Banks were top risers for a second day as markets price-in the earnings benefit of a possible US rate rise in the summer. Banks in the peripheral of Europe most exposed to Greek debt, including Spain\u2019s Banco Santander, were top performers. Less exposure to Greece and weak earnings from M&amp;S weighed on the FTSE 100, which rose less than its European counterparts. Greek shares rose and the yield on Greek Debt fell after the IMF and Germany deferred a quarrel on Greek debt relief until 2018... Greece avoiding another cliff-edge moment is undoubtedly positive for markets, which already face the uncertainty of the Brexit referendum and Spanish elections in June. The funds to be released following the late night Eurogroup agreement should last Greece until the end of October when the second review of the bailout programme is due start, according to the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. It says: The \u20ac10.3bn tranche that the Eurogroup decided to disburse to Greece will fully meet the country\u2019s financing needs until the end of October, when the second review of the Greek programme is set to start, Eurozone officials said on Wednesday. Describing the events behind the scenes at Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup, the sources said that the IMF and Europeans had reached a compromise in spite of their different initial positions, while confirming that the IMF will participate. According to one EU official, this was not so much a \u201cpower play\u201d but more that all sides moved from their initial position, with the IMF fully understanding that the Eurozone operates in a different way from the fund. Regarding the measures for the debt, the European sources said that there were no \u201cimmediate decisions\u201d but this was not a surprise, since there were no debts maturing in the short term. In the medium-term, the Eurozone countries said they will examine the possibility of buying up debt to the IMF early, or the bilateral loans with Eurozone countries, using the unspent funds (approximately 20 billion euros) originally destined for the recapitalisation of the banks. This would, however, require the approval of some national parliaments. According to Eurozone officials, the chances that Greece can return to borrowing from the markets at reasonable interest rates at the end of the programme are much higher following the agreement at Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup. They said that Greece\u2019s access to the markets can begin to be restored gradually, in the second half of 2017, and that the aim is to restore full market access by the end of 2018. The more credible Greece\u2019s economic policy, including its success in delivering primary surplus targets, the smaller the spreads on Greek bonds will be, though borrowing from the Eurozone will always be cheaper, the same sources said. The second review of the Greek programme would begin at the end of October, they added, noting that the measures that remained to be taken will not be as difficult as those required by the first review. In Greece trade unionists are already flexing their muscles and planning mass industrial action, reports Helena Smith. Strikes are expected to start tomorrow when workers at the Piraeus Port Organisation and Thessaloniki Port Organisation begin a 48-hour walk-out in opposition to the controversial privatisation programme the government has signed up to. Adedy, which represents employees in the public sector, has also decided to hold a Pan-Hellenic work stoppage on June 8. \u201cWe decided, today, after meeting health and education federations that we would take this action to protest all the things that these new measures mean: lack of staff, underfunding, appointments that should, but will never happen,\u201d Adedy\u2019s chief policy maker, Grigoris Kalomoiris told the Guardian. \u201cThe Eurogroup was a fiasco for Greece. The government was just a spectator while Germany rode roughshod over everyone else and made all the decisions. To conclude the review we agreed to sell off all our public wealth and impose more of the same counter-productive measures. It makes no sense. Come September/October we foresee mass and dynamic reaction because it is then that the measures will start to kick in.\u201d Kalomoiros said the trade union now firmly believed the only way out for the debt-stricken country was to leave the eurozone. Back with German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. According to Bloomberg he has said a fourth Greek bailout programme is not needed as of now. As expected, US markets have followed their counterparts elsewhere and moved higher in early trading, partly buoyed by the Greek agreement overnight and continuing strength in the oil price. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 124 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.28% and Nasdaq 0.34% better. The moves came despite some weaker than expected US services and composite PMI data. Sch\u00e4uble also said there were no major changes to the Greek bailout programme, according to Reuters, so there was no need for German parliamentary approval. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has said last night\u2019s result on Greece was a good one, and the next tranche of aid can now be paid out. But it looks like it\u2019s not all sweetness and light with the IMF: Here\u2019s a link to the transcript of the comments by Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, after last night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting: Markets continue to be buoyed by the early morning Greek deal, although are now off their best levels. Banks are among the main movers, both on the Eurogroup agreement and because a rise in US interest rates, which could come as early as June or July, is likely to bolster their balance sheets. In Greece, the Athens market is currently up 0.45%, while the country\u2019s 10 year bond yields are down 8 basis points at 7.3%. Two year bond yields are currently down 87 basis points at 7.37%. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.4%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 1.3% and Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 2.1%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is up 0.6% and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 73 points higher. The European Central Bank holds its regular meeting next week and some are hoping that it will discuss reintroducing a waiver to allow the central bank to accept Greek bonds (as UniCredit suggested below). FastFT reports (\u00a3): Greek officials are optimistic that the eurozone\u2019s top monetary policymakers will take a big step towards rehabilitating the country\u2019s banking system next week, by deciding to accept Greek bonds as collateral for the European Central Bank\u2019s loans for the first time in more than a year. The ECB\u2019s governing council...will meet next Thursday in Vienna. Officials are likely to use the Vienna meeting to discuss whether to reintroduce a waiver that allows the eurozone\u2019s central bank to accept Greek debt in its regular auctions of central bank cash. Athens is confident that the council will support the reintroduction of the waiver. The waiver was scrapped in February 2015 as the crisis escalated. Someone else who thinks Germany gave the least ground at the marathon Eurogroup meeting, given the delay on any major decisions on debt. Economist Tullia Bucco at UniCredit Research said: In our view, there are two important features in this framework that are intended to provide reassurance to the European creditors for which Greece poses a thorny political issue: 1. The bulk of the debt-relief measures will only be granted at the end of the program in 2018, if necessary, and 2. Long-term relief measures remain very vague. All in all, Germany can be considered to be the winner of the negotiations, given that any major decision on debt relief will only be taken after next year\u2019s general elections, whereas the IMF committed to participate financially to the program already before the end of 2016. The agreement could also pave the way to returning Greek banks to some kind of normality: Last but not least, we think that the deal would soon allow the ECB to reinstate the waiver for Greek bonds posted as collateral at its refinancing operations. This is good news for Greek banks. There were some tired faces at today\u2019s ECOFIN meeting, among ministers who worked late into the night on the Greek agreement. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, looked positively pensive at one point: Tsakalotos also had an expressive chat with Pierre Moscovici, EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs... All sides made some concessions at last night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, but it does seem that Germany gave the least ground. Writing for Macropolis, the Greek analysis site, Yiannis Mouzakis explains: German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is probably the one participant in the Eurogroup that completely achieved his objective. His only concession is that he had to compromise on his initial stance that Greece\u2019s debt does not need to be discussed before 2023. There is nothing in this agreement to make him uncomfortable beyond that. It does not require any major changes to the programme\u2019s modalities, the targets remain, large-scale debt measures are not due to happen until after the German elections in autumn next year and the IMF has committed that it will go to its board with a recommendation to participate in the Greek programme with financing and a new programme that will ensure policing of compliance and reform implementation. Yiannis also cautions that today\u2019s deal could turn sour in a few months, particularly if the IMF concludes that Greece\u2019s debt relief doesn\u2019t go far enough. Here\u2019s the piece: A Eurogroup deal that might be hard to stomach Over in Greece, the government\u2019s supporters have hailed the eurogroup deal. Opponents, though, have dismissed it - and argued that Greece must leave the euro. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2013 the underlying current of this six-year crisis \u2013 was in full play this morning, in the media, on the streets and in the commentary of politicians, trade unionists and businessmen, the actors in the drama. While pro-government newspapers lauded the \u201cwhite smoke\u201d that had finally appeared at the end of a gruelling 11-hour euro group, opposition newspapers slammed it as a sham. Avgi, mouthpiece of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist Syriza party, enthused: \u201cThe review has been concluded, roadmap [agreed] for the debt.\u201d The paper quoted Syriza\u2019s prominent MEP Dimitris Papadimoulis as saying Athens had finally moved on from vagaries to concrete plans regarding the country\u2019s staggering debt pile. \u201cWe are no longer speaking about the debt in general, vague terms but have a framework of an agreement, a concrete roadmap,\u201d he said of the decision to deal with debt load in three stages, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a good decision that allows us to turn the page.\u201d On the streets, however, enthusiasm was remarkably muted. Shopkeepers shrugged off any suggestion that Greece was about to turn the corner. \u201cIt might bring some stability,\u201d said Panos Tsekouras who runs a textile store in the heart of downtown Athens. \u201cWe won\u2019t see the drama of last year but once the summer is over and the taxes have piled up who is going to pay the bill? There\u2019ll be mayhem.\u201d Opposition politicians from the left and right described the deal as a fiasco. Speaking to the Guardian, Panaghiotis Lafazanis, the former energy minister who broke ranks with Syriza to set up the breakaway anti-austerity Popular Unity party, predicted it would be only a matter of time before there was widespread reaction when the government tried to enforce new taxes and cuts. Lafazanis told me: \u201cIt won\u2019t be able to enforce the measures it has agreed to. This is an agreement that solves no problems and on the contrary creates new ones. Greece, simply, cannot survive in this currency. There will be a disorderly default and ultimate exit from the euro that will be all the worse for not being planned.\u201d Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, hopes that the eurozone will avoid a summer of Greek debt drama. Analyst Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence is concerned that Greece hasn\u2019t won the solid commitments which prime minister Alexis Tsipras has promised. That may make it harder for Tsipras to hold his small parliamentary majority together, and implement the unpopular austerity measures it has agreed to. Here\u2019s Wolf\u2019s key points: After prolonged talks, Greece and its international lenders achieved a deal about the conclusion of the on-going review in the early hours of 25 May. The standoff between Germany and the IMF has \u2013 for now \u2013 been settled by careful reference to the possibility of limited debt relief measures. While this is a move in the right direction from the Greek perspective, the roadmap remains vague and the eventual meaningful debt relief measures distant. Athens remains stuck with harsh fiscal targets and reform commitments but only vague promises of debt relief, leaving Tsipras badly exposed domestically. The Greek agreement is part of a broader strategy to avoid rocking the boat until Britain\u2019s EU referendum is over, argues my colleague Jonathan Freedland. He writes: Whatever the rights and wrongs of the [Greek] austerity argument, Cameron has wanted the issue to go away \u2013 at least for another month. Today\u2019s bailout loan has achieved that. Rating agency Moody\u2019s has just announced that the Greek deal is \u201ccredit-positive\u201d. Moody\u2019s says the promise of \u20ac10.3bn of bailout loans alleviates the danger that the country defaults this summer. It also welcomes the \u201croad map\u201d on debt relief agreed by creditors, although it is light on details. Although the announcement doesn\u2019t provide specifics on the type of relief, it is clear that material relief will be considered only after the program expires in 2018 and remains contingent on the Greek governments\u2019 ability to implement successfully the conditions associated with the program. However, the agency is also concerned that Athens will struggle to implement the measures agreed with creditors. We consider implementation risks in Greece to remain high, given the small governing majority, weak institutions, and the backdrop of political and social discontent.\u201d Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, is relatively upbeat about the deal: The Eurozone provided Greece with a firm offer of debt relief yesterday at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels, a decision which could see the Euro provide \u20ac10bn in new funds for the country. The IMF seems to have softened its stance significantly from its hard line position as it had previously insisted that Greece\u2019s proposed programme did not offer a path to fiscal sustainability. The positive conclusions to these talks are a good sign on a number of fronts \u2013 showing flexibility by the IMF and European ministers, and some early signs of improving confidence in Greece. Greek 10-year bond yields fell below 7% this morning for the first time since November 2015.\u201d We\u2019re going to need a new metaphor.... Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s former finance minister, has given the deal the thumbs-down: A year ago, Varoufakis was doing battle with the eurogroup on a weekly basis (at least, that\u2019s how it felt), trying to persuade fellow ministers to abandon their push for austerity packages laden with tax rises. That approach died after the Greek people voted to reject creditors demands\u2019, only for prime minister Tsipras to sign up to the third bailout. If you missed the Greek agreement, it\u2019s online here: The Financial Times has a good word to describe the Greek deal - \u201cmessy\u201d. And that\u2019s because the really sticky issue, of how to make Athens\u2019 debts sustainable, has been kicked down the road. Although the creditors have made commitments, the agreement released in the early hours of this morning is light on detail. Mehreen Khan and Alex Barker sum it up: The ambiguities are legion. A target was set to maintain Greece\u2019s gross financing needs at no more than 15 per cent of national income until 2030. And measures were outlined to do that, including maturity extensions and a possible buyout of IMF loans in 2018. The caveat: no numbers were agreed on what relief the measures would actually deliver. And while the IMF dropped its most ambitious debt relief demands \u2014 including the need for them to be automatic when Greece exits its programme in 2018 \u2014 there was a big caveat. To participate financially in the programme before the end of the year, the IMF would need to approve a new debt sustainability analysis (DSA) on Greece that would meet its normal lending standards. For Germany too, the deal amounted to a trade-off. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, German finance minister, met his two main red lines: no haircuts and no Bundestag votes before the German federal elections in 2018. But to secure the IMF\u2019s political participation, he made a concession: an implicit commitment to meeting a DSA that will be hard to retreat from. And language was softened on the requirement for Greece to meet a 3.5 per cent budget surplus target for at least the next 10 years; this would now be reviewed in 2018. More here: Messy Greek debt deal leaves key questions unanswered In another reassuring signal from the markets, the yield on 2-year Greek bonds has tumbled below the 10-year bond yield. Why does that matter? Because it means investors are now rating Greece\u2019s short-term debt as less risky than its longer-term borrowings. That\u2019s how markets usually operate -- but for months Greece\u2019s two-year yields (which rise when prices fall) have soared over the 10-year yield. Why? Because if Greece can\u2019t repay its debts, it will default on shorter-dated bonds first. This chart, from Reuters\u2019 John Geddie, explains all: Although the London market is at a three-week high, City investors do recognise that the details of Greece\u2019s debt relief are still up in the air. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: Eurozone discussions finally reached a conclusion regarding the restructuring of Greek debt, yet the outcome was far from constructive as ministers decided to kick the can by simply resume talks after the French and German elections. This issue will drag on for years and there is a feeling that the Greeks will say whatever they need to in order to get a good deal. With austerity crippling the Greek economy, the hopes of it standing on its own two feet and paying back its debts anytime soon seem negligible. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit is also concerned about Greece\u2019s debt mountain, which is currently 180% of GDP. The International Monetary Fund is coming under fire from debt campaigners this morning. They\u2019re disappointed that the Fund has abandoned its commitment to \u201cupfront\u201d Greek debt relief as part of last night\u2019s deal. Instead, medium-term debt relief will only kick in around 2018 - and the details are still Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, says this isn\u2019t acceptable: \u201cIMF staff are proposing to lend more money to Greece without the upfront and unconditional debt relief they called for. This is a major climb down, which once again breaks the IMF\u2019s own rules not to lend when they know a debt cannot be paid. Last night, the IMF\u2019s Poul Thomsen agreed that the Fund had made a \u2018major concession\u2019, in order to reach a deal. In return, all creditors agreed that Greece\u2019s debts are unsustainable, paving the way to debt relief over time. Clifton though, insists that action is needed now. \u201cEurozone finance ministers cannot keep repeating this pattern of sticking plaster measures followed by near defaults and all night crisis meetings for the next 40 years. Only significant cancellation of Greece\u2019s debt now, including payments coming due now such as to the IMF and ECB, will help tackle the humanitarian crisis in the country and restore the lack of confidence which is holding back Greece and the wider European economy.\u201d Economist Megan Greene, of asset management firm Manulife, says Berlin appears to have won last night\u2019s Tussle in Brussels: Greece\u2019s stock market has jumped by 1.4% in early trading, led by bank stocks. Greek government bonds are on an absolute tear this morning, as fears of a disorderly default fade away. The country\u2019s 10-year bonds are rallying hard, driving down the interest rate (or yield) on the debt below 7% for the first time since last November. That\u2019s an important sign \u2013 7% is traditionally the level where a country\u2019s debts are unaffordable. So investors are calculating that this agreement is significant, despite the doubts and question marks. Henrik Enderlein, director of the Jacques Delors Institute, sums up the deal: After a few hours sleep, Eurozone ministers are returning to the Justis Lipsius building for a full Ecofin meeting with EU ministers. They won\u2019t be discussing Greece - instead, they\u2019ll be debating an anti tax avoidance Directive. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici just shared a touching embrace with Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem. A cheerful-sounding Dijsselbloem then says that last night\u2019s agreement with Greece is a \u201creally important step\u201d. All sides realised we had to get a deal, he says, even though we all realised it would be difficult. The IMF was asking a lot, and we were asking a lot of Greece. But the deal brings the IMF on board, strengthens confidence between all sides, and thus should improve confidence within the eurozone. Q: So are we 100% sure that the IMF will be on board? No, Dijsselbloem says. The Fund must conduct its own debt sustainability analysis, and the final decision is up to its board. Marc Ostwald of City firm ADM Investor Services is also underwhelmed by the deal: This is another to be sorted under \u2018can kicking\u2019, leaving any decision on genuine debt relief until 2018, after the French and German elections, but also not creating any precedents or short-term crises which might influence the Italian municipal elections on June 5, the UK Brexit referendum on June 23 or the Spanish election on June 26. It also continues to impose austerity measures which will continue to strangle the Greek economy, per se ensuring that the next crisis moment in the Greek saga will not be far away. European stock markets have jumped in early trading. The news that Greece will finally receive the \u20ac10bn bailout tranche is easing concerns of another eurozone financial crisis over the summer, on top of Britain\u2019s EU referendum. In London, the FTSE 100 has swiftly gained 40 points, or 0.6%, to 6255. That\u2019s its highest level since May 3rd. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 0.8%. Peter Spiegel, the FT\u2019s former Brussels bureau chief, isn\u2019t completely convinced by the agreement. Last night\u2019s deal may not be perfect, but it appears to \u2018kick the can\u2019 down the road until after France and Germany have gone to the polls in 2017. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: \u20ac7.5bn will be released in June that will allow Greece cover maturing IMF and ECB loans in June and July and begin to clear arrears which have built up as the review process has stalled. The outstanding portion of the payment will then be made after the summer. There was also agreement on a roadmap for Greek debt relief. In the short term this is mainly through managing the interest rate and repayment profile of euro area loans. Further out, there was commitment on further measures once the programme is completed in 2018. While not quite the unconditional debt relief the IMF had called for in its assessment of Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, the measures are sufficient for the Fund to stay involved in the programme although that will still have to be formally approved by the IMF board. The deal means that Greece should now be \u2018parked\u2019 until after next year\u2019s German general and French presidential elections but, equally important, any decision on Greek debt relief won\u2019t have to be taken in the German parliament until after the next autumn\u2019s vote. Money is pouring into government debt issued by the eurozone\u2019s weaker members this morning, as investors react to Greece\u2019s debt real. This has driven down the yield (or interest rate) on peripheral government bonds -- a sign that traders are happy to buy these riskier assets. Reuters has the details: Portugal\u2019s 10-bond yield fell 4.8 basis points to a three-week low at 3.02%, while Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields fell to one-month lows at around 1.51% and 1.40% respectively. \u201cThe agreement between Greece and its creditors is positive for risk sentiment and in turn peripheral bond markets,\u201d said Rene Arecht, a derivatives market analyst at DZ Bank. I imagine we\u2019ll also see a rally when the Greek stock and bond markets open shortly.... Our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, explains how the IMF has backed down over its demands for immediate Greek debt relief: European officials have agreed to unlock \u20ac10.3bn in bailout money for Greece as the International Monetary Fund made a significant climbdown in its demand for upfront debt relief for the recession-hit country. Greece\u2019s international creditors emerged from an 11-hour meeting in Brussels at 2am on Wednesday having agreed on steps to ease the burden of Greece\u2019s \u20ac321bn (\u00a3245bn) debt mountain, worth 180% of annual economic output. But the debt relief plan was a far cry from the \u201cupfront\u201d and \u201cunconditional\u201d debt relief the IMF had demanded on Monday, when it warned that Greece would face an ever-growing bill to service its loans. Poul Thomsen, director of the IMF\u2019s European programme, said the IMF had made \u201ca major concession\u201d. \u201cWe had argued that [debt relief measures] should be approved up front and [now] we have agreed that they should be made at the end of the programme period. Here\u2019s her full dispatch from Brussels, a few hours ago: Good morning. There\u2019s a sense of relief in the eurozone this morning after Greece and its creditors finally hammered out a deal to unlock \u20ac10bn in bailout funds, and trigger work on debt relief. After a lengthy meeting, which we liveblogged through the night, ministers emerged to report that a breakthrough had been reached. Both sides appear to have given some ground to get the deal onto the table. One the one hand, all creditors have agreed that Greece\u2019s debt mountain is unsustainable \u2013 suggesting Germany has given up some ground. On the other, debt relief isn\u2019t as immediate or concrete as the International Monetary Fund has been demanded, meaning the Fund has made concessions too. If you were snoozing during the action, here\u2019s the key points: 1) Greece has finally received the green light to receive more than \u20ac10bn in bailout funds, easing concerns that it could face financial peril this summer. A few prior actions do remain, concerning pensions and privatisations, but once that is resolved, the money will flow -- starting with \u20ac7.5bn in June. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that Greece\u2019s programme was back on track. \u201cWe achieved a major breakthrough on Greece which enables us to enter a new phase in the Greek financial assistance programme.... This is stretching what I thought would have been possible not so long ago.\u201d 2) In an important development, the International Monetary Fund has signalled that it could join the bailout. That could happen by the end of 2016. However, the IMF\u2019s European chief Poul Thomsen insisted that the Fund must check that the eurozone is offering substantial debt relief. In a rare public appearance, Thomsen said: We welcome that all stakeholders recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. We welcome that it is understood that Greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable. 3) Eurozone ministers have agreed to \u201ca package of debt measures\u201d to make Greece\u2019s debts sustainable. That will start with short-term tweaks to Greece\u2019s debts, to smooth out its obligations. Medium-term measures are also promised, although not until 2018, which looks like a concession from the IMF. There is also a commitment to consider whether further restructuring will be needed once the bailout ends, assuming Athens sticks to the programme and everything works out. However, this doesn\u2019t appear to be as comprehensive, wide-ranging and unconditional as the IMF has been demanding. 4) The deal has been generally welcomed by Greece\u2019s finance minister. Euclid Tsakalotos said it would help end the country\u2019s vicious circle of austerity and recession. Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, said the Greek deal was good for the global economy. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Kazimir also sounded satisfied, comparing the negotiations to \u201ca complicated birth\u201d. And France\u2019s Michel Sapin was positively upbeat, saying the deal was \u201cfirst and foremost a declaration of confidence in today\u2019s Greece.\u201d But that was last night. Now that people have slept on it (however briefly), we should get some proper reaction.",

The ratings agency said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The agreement reached between Greece and its eurozone creditors reduces the risk of another Greek liquidity crisis this summer, and incentivises the country to complete its third bail-out programme. However, with little debt relief offered upfront, the Greek government may find it progressively more difficult to continue with politically controversial measures required to meet ambitious programme commitments. Implementation risk therefore remains high.</p> <p>The agreement highlights the improved relations between Greece and its official creditors since last summer\u2019s often confrontational negotiations leading up to the current ESM programme. The Greek government has implemented prior actions, including pension reform and a contentious requirement for additional fiscal contingency measures to safeguard the 2018 budget target.</p> <p>For their part, Greece\u2019s official creditors have agreed to possible debt relief (nominal haircuts are still excluded)...</p> <p> Delivering debt relief in stages and contingent on programme performance could incentivise the Greek authorities to meet programme targets. However, given the track record of slippage under previous programmes in the past five years, we think there is still a high risk that the 2018 surplus target will be missed despite the agreement on a contingency fiscal mechanism. This risk could increase if the conditionality in Wednesday\u2019s agreement meant that sizeable debt relief came to be seen by Greek politicians or the public as a distant or unattainable prospect.</p> <p>A question mark is therefore likely to remain over the sustainability of Greek debt in the medium term. While gross financing needs are modest over the next few years, substantial increases in gross financing requirements would follow in the long term without further debt re-profiling.</p> <p>Our \u2018CCC\u2019 sovereign rating, which we affirmed in March, reflects risks to programme implementation and debt sustainability. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5745c9b8e4b00a2e2e3a0720\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-25T16:07:31.676Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Eurogroup \u201cbreakthrough\u201d on debt relief was no such thing, </strong>says Joan Hoey, Greek analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit:</p> <blockquote> <p>The coveted debt relief upon which the [Greek] prime minister has been banking, to provide a political fig leaf for his acceptance of another bailout, remains out of reach, contingent and unquantified.</p> <p>The Eurogroup did not finalise the long-delayed first review of the bailout programme.

The balance of \u20ac2.8bn will be released only after the clearance of government arrears and after the government has met milestones related to the privatisation fund, bank governance, the revenue collection agency and the energy sector.

The message entitled \u201cCONFIDENTIAL \u2013 Sable Mining\u2019s Account with Sherman\u201d, lists a series of transactions, including: payments as high as $50,000 (\u00a334,000) that appear to have been made to several well-placed Liberian officials; plus a transfer for $75,000 that is labelled \u201cPayment (facilitation) revised PPCC Act\u201d \u2013 seemingly a reference to the country\u2019s Public Procurement and Concession Commission Act, which impacted on mining rights. Sable has confirmed to the Guardian that it funded the account and that the email was received by Groves and Heine van Niekerk, who it described as \u201cthe de facto chief operating officer for Sable in west Africa\u201d. Van Niekerk says he was not aware of any bribes being paid, while Sable said Groves paid no attention to the message. At the time of the payments, Groves was chief executive and Edmonds was chairman of Sable, which owned a 36.5% stake in the Liberia business. Sable increased its shareholding to 63.5% in 2011. Edmonds resigned as chairman of Sable in 2014, while Groves remains as chief executive. Global Witness has said the leaked documents show \u201cSable was able to bribe many of Liberia\u2019s top politicians, which is trying to turn the page on 14 years of civil war, corruption and most recently Ebola\u201d. Sable has said: \u201cAlthough many of the issues raised by Global Witness were subject to internal review a number of years ago, they have prompted a further review of all of these matters. We have found no evidence to support or justify this attack on the company or its directors, past and present.\u201d Sable did not add to its previous comments on Wednesday. Sherman\u2019s law firm, Sherman &amp; Sherman, did not respond to efforts to contact it.",

Rensi, who was the CEO of McDonald\u2019s US in the 1990s, said a national minimum wage of $15 an hour \u2013 which is being pushed for by an alliance of labor unions and workers \u2013 was nonsense and would lead to \u201cjob loss like you could not believe\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think we ought to have a federal minimum wage. The states ought to decide what the minimum wage is based on the cost of living in the states they are in. You don\u2019t need a $15 minimum wage in communities that have a standard of living which is substantially lower than in New York City,\u201d he said. After a quick pause, he added: \u201cOK, maybe the wage ought to be higher in New York.\u201d Members of the Fight for $15 movement, however, have said they would keep fighting until all workers across the nation were earning $15 an hour. The majority of their protests have been focused on McDonald\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest fast-food chain. McDonald\u2019s has shrugged off years of declining sales in recent quarters. In April, the company announced that its first quarter sales at US locations rose by 5.4%, largely thanks to the introduction of all-day breakfast. This was a third quarter in a row that McDonald\u2019s announced an increase in sales. Last year its global profits topped $7bn. George McCray, who works at McDonald\u2019s in Chicago, Illinois, and earns the local minimum wage of $8.25 an hour, would like the company to pass some of its profits on to the workers. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to make new changes like the all-day breakfast a success and have helped make the company billions, but our wages haven\u2019t budged. How much longer will McDonald\u2019s workers have to wait before the company\u2019s success benefits us too?\u201d he asked. According to the Fight for $15 movement, about 10,000 workers are expected to protest in front of the McDonald\u2019s headquarters during the fast-food giant\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday. The campaign said it would be \u201cthe largest-ever protest to hit the shareholder meeting\u201d. However, after New York and California have passed legislation that would see their state minimum wages increased to $15 an hour, the Fight for $15 movement has lost some of its momentum. In April, the campaign planned what they hoped to be the largest day of action yet. However, the turnout at some of the events planned was about half of what it had been the year before. The campaign has been largely funded by the Service Employees International Union in the hope that the workers would also organize and push for union recognition in their respective McDonald\u2019s stores. This past weekend, at the SEIU National Convention, a delegation of fast-food workers from the Fight for $15 movement announced that they wanted to join the SEIU pending votes by cooks and cashiers at stores across the country. When he appeared on Fox Business on Tuesday, Rensi also focused on the labor movement\u2019s role in the protests. \u201cAll this nonsense with McDonald\u2019s minimum wage, work rules, it\u2019s all about union dues. It\u2019s about organizing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a theater of protests to capture votes for the Democratic party. It\u2019s absolute nonsense. It\u2019s a sham and it\u2019s destroying the middle class in this country.\u201d Fight for $15 members insist that higher minimum wage and ability to unionize will help \u201clift\u201d low-wage workers out of poverty and into the middle class. \u201cOur decision to ask to join SEIU underscores the fact that we want not just $15 an hour, but union rights too,\u201d said Guadalupe Salazar, one of the McDonald\u2019s workers attending the SEIU convention. \u201cWe are sending a powerful message to companies like McDonald\u2019s that we are going to keep fighting until we win an organization that helps lift up not just fast-food workers, but all underpaid workers.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Philip Green 'refused to put more than \u00a310m a year' in BHS pensions scheme", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green refused to pump in more than \u00a310m a year to the BHS pensions scheme but took a \u201ccaring approach\u201d to members, the former chairman of the pension trustees has said. Margaret Downes said the trustees \u201ccould not move them off\u201d a pledge to invest \u00a310m a year into the scheme despite its growing deficit. Downes was giving evidence on Wednesday during the latest stage of an investigation by MPs into the demise of the department store chain. MPs also heard from the existing chairman of the trustees, Chris Martin, and advisers to Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS from Green for \u00a31 in March 2015. Martin said he was \u201cvery, very disappointed\u201d when Green\u2019s retail company Arcadia paused a plan to restructure the pension scheme in September 2014. Meanwhile the boss of Cornhill Capital, a former adviser to Dominic Chappell, the head of the Retail Acquisitions consortium, said Chappell\u2019s plan to buy BHS was \u201ca bit of a punt\u201d. Administrators are struggling to secure a rescue deal for BHS and its 11,000 workers. Greg Tufnell, the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, is leading a bid backed a wealthy Portuguese family, but if a deal cannot be completed on Thursday then the liquidation of BHS is likely to be announced on Friday. Administrators have been told the bidders are willing to pump tens of millions of pounds into BHS, but the details of the agreement are still to be finalised and time is running out. Downes was chairman of the BHS pension trustees for 13 years until the end of 2013, a period during which Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit of about \u00a3571m. She said a 23-year recovery plan put in place for the pension scheme during her tenure was \u201cextremely long-term\u201d. This involved \u00a310m being pumped into the scheme each year by Arcadia, with Green declining to make larger contributions. \u201cFrom the very beginning of us working on the 2012 valuation it was made clear to us that the maximum amount that would be given by the sponsor [Arcadia] was \u00a310m a year,\u201d Downes said. \u201cThey never veered from that. No matter how much we addressed endeavouring to increase that either with Philip Green or with Paul Budge [the Arcadia finance director], we could not get them to move away from that.\u201d Despite this, Downes said: \u201cI do believe he had, at heart, a caring approach to the 22,000-odd members.\u201d When asked by MPs to explain this view, Downes said: \u201cI think he expressed at that stage that if funds were available and if BHS Limited was in a position to contribute to the pension fund then he would be very happy that would happen.\u201d However, Downes said that advisers to the pension scheme had warned that BHS was reliant on support from its parent company, Arcadia, to make contributions towards erasing the deficit. Martin, who succeeded Downes as pension chairman, said he was forced to \u201cderisk\u201d the pension scheme\u2019s investments after Arcadia withdrew proposals to restructure BHS pensions through a plan known as Project Thor. He said he was very concerned after the proposals were shelved because Arcadia had said it planned to launch a full strategic review of BHS and could no longer afford to support the department store chain, which was relying on funding from its parent company. \u201cWe had to behave like we had no covenant,\u201d Martin told MPs. He said there was uncertainty on pensions issues from Chappell and Retail Acquisitions when they took over BHS, and that they had only done limited due diligence on the pension scheme in the run-up to the deal. Although Martin sought written assurances from Retail Acquisitions over his concerns, which were provided, the pension scheme did not have the power to veto the deal. Martin said his company has been paid around \u00a3250,000 for his work on BHS since 2014. MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee are investigating the retailer\u2019s collapse. They were told by advisers to Retail Acquisitions that there were doubts about the qualifications of Chappell to rescue BHS when he led a buyout. This will raise further questions over why Green agreed to sell BHS to Chappell. Stephen Hermer, partner at the law firm Olswang, said it knew Chappell had been declared bankrupt in 2009. Roberts said Olswang had conducted \u201conline searches against risk intelligence databases\u201d and there was \u201cclearly a question mark about Mr Chappell\u2019s business acumen\u201d. Chappell has been declared bankrupt three times and left a string of failed ventures before buying BHS. Andrew Frangos, chief executive of Cornhill Capital, worked with Chappell on arranging financing for the takeover of BHS. He said Chappell had expressed an interest in buying a Swiss retail chain and a small British retailer as well as BHS. Frangos added: \u201cWe\u2019re interacting with Dominic, we\u2019re thinking: \u2018This is hugely ambitious. Is it real? Does it have a realistic chance of success?\u2019 For us, it was a bit of a punt. \u201cI say it was ambitious because he didn\u2019t have a CV and it was a large acquisition that he was planning to make.\u201d Frangos said he had been told that BHS needed between \u00a330m and \u00a3200m of financial support. He was tasked with discovering whether funds could be raised through selling off BHS property or taking out loans secured against the retailer\u2019s assets. Chappell eventually told Frangos that Retail Acquisitions had sourced funds from elsewhere, and the pair are now in dispute over unpaid fees, MPs were told. The accountancy firm Grant Thornton said it had done \u201cextensive\u201d due diligence on BHS for Retail Acquisitions, but it confirmed that the turnaround plan for the business was based on the plan drawn up by the existing management team. A supplier to BHS has called in administrators as the failure of the retailer starts to have repercussions across the industry. CUK Clothing Limited and Courtaulds Brands, which are part of the same group, have collapsed, leading to the loss of 350 jobs. Courtaulds has made clothes in the UK for almost a century. The factory in Belper, Derbyshire, where the company is based, produces Pretty Polly tights, which have been worn by popstar Beyonce.",

MPs also heard from the existing chairman of the trustees, Chris Martin, and advisers to Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS from Green for \u00a31 in March 2015.</p> <p>Martin said he was \u201cvery, very disappointed\u201d when Green\u2019s retail company Arcadia paused a plan to restructure the pension scheme in September 2014. Meanwhile the boss of Cornhill Capital, a former adviser to Dominic Chappell, the head of the Retail Acquisitions consortium, said Chappell\u2019s plan to buy BHS was \u201ca bit of a punt\u201d.</p> <p>Administrators are struggling to secure a rescue deal for BHS and its 11,000 workers. Greg Tufnell, the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, is leading a bid backed a wealthy Portuguese family, but if a deal cannot be completed on Thursday then the liquidation of BHS is likely to be announced on Friday. Administrators have been told the bidders are willing to pump tens of millions of pounds into BHS, but the details of the agreement are still to be finalised and time is running out.</p> <p>Downes was chairman of the BHS pension trustees for 13 years until the end of 2013, a period during which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m</a> in dividends, rent and interest payments. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit of about \u00a3571m.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>She said a 23-year recovery plan put in place for the pension scheme during her tenure was \u201cextremely long-term\u201d. This involved \u00a310m being pumped into the scheme each year by Arcadia, with Green declining to make larger contributions.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the very beginning of us working on the 2012 valuation it was made clear to us that the maximum amount that would be given by the sponsor [Arcadia] was \u00a310m a year,\u201d Downes said.</p> <p>\u201cThey never veered from that. No matter how much we addressed endeavouring to increase that either with Philip Green or with Paul Budge [the Arcadia finance director], we could not get them to move away from that.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this, Downes said: \u201cI do believe he had, at heart, a caring approach to the 22,000-odd members.\u201d</p> <p>When asked by MPs to explain this view, Downes said: \u201cI think he expressed at that stage that if funds were available and if BHS Limited was in a position to contribute to the pension fund then he would be very happy that would happen.\u201d</p> <p>However, Downes said that advisers to the pension scheme had warned that BHS was reliant on support from its parent company, Arcadia, to make contributions towards erasing the deficit.</p> <p>Martin, who succeeded Downes as pension chairman, said he was forced to \u201cderisk\u201d the pension scheme\u2019s investments after Arcadia withdrew proposals to restructure BHS pensions through a plan known as Project Thor.</p> <p>He said he was very concerned after the proposals were shelved because Arcadia had said it planned to launch a full strategic review of BHS and could no longer afford to support the department store chain, which was relying on funding from its parent company. \u201cWe had to behave like we had no covenant,\u201d Martin told MPs.</p> <p>He said there was uncertainty on pensions issues from Chappell and Retail Acquisitions when they took over BHS, and that they had only done limited due diligence on the pension scheme in the run-up to the deal. Although Martin sought written assurances from Retail Acquisitions over his concerns, which were provided, the pension scheme did not have the power to veto the deal.</p> <p>Martin said his company has been paid around \u00a3250,000 for his work on BHS since 2014.</p> <p>MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee are investigating the retailer\u2019s collapse.</p> <p>They were told by advisers to Retail Acquisitions that there were doubts about the qualifications of Chappell to rescue BHS when he led a buyout. This will raise further questions over why Green agreed to sell BHS to Chappell.</p> <p>Stephen Hermer, partner at the law firm Olswang, said it knew Chappell had been declared bankrupt in 2009. Roberts said Olswang had conducted \u201conline searches against risk intelligence databases\u201d and there was \u201cclearly a question mark about Mr Chappell\u2019s business acumen\u201d. </p> <p>Chappell has been declared bankrupt three times and left <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/bhs-owner-dominic-chappell-olivia-petroleum\">a string of failed ventures before buying BHS.</a></p> <p>Andrew Frangos, chief executive of Cornhill Capital, worked with Chappell on arranging financing for the takeover of BHS. He said Chappell had expressed an interest in buying a Swiss retail chain and a small British retailer as well as BHS.</p> <p>Frangos added: \u201cWe\u2019re interacting with Dominic, we\u2019re thinking: \u2018This is hugely ambitious. Is it real? Does it have a realistic chance of success?\u2019 For us, it was a bit of a punt.</p> <p>\u201cI say it was ambitious because he didn\u2019t have a CV and it was a large acquisition that he was planning to make.\u201d</p> <p>Frangos said he had been told that BHS needed between \u00a330m and \u00a3200m of financial support. He was tasked with discovering whether funds could be raised through selling off BHS property or taking out loans secured against the retailer\u2019s assets. Chappell eventually told Frangos that Retail Acquisitions had sourced funds from elsewhere, and the pair are now in dispute over unpaid fees, MPs were told.</p> <p>The accountancy firm Grant Thornton said it had done \u201cextensive\u201d due diligence on BHS for Retail Acquisitions, but it confirmed that the turnaround plan for the business was based on the plan drawn up by the existing management team.</p> <p>A supplier to BHS has called in administrators as the failure of the retailer starts to have repercussions across the industry. CUK Clothing Limited and Courtaulds Brands, which are part of the same group, have collapsed, leading to the loss of 350 jobs.</p> <p>Courtaulds has made clothes in the UK for almost a century. The factory in Belper, Derbyshire, where the company is based, produces Pretty Polly tights, which have been worn by popstar Beyonce. </p>",

He said free banking \u2013 a concept introduced by Midland Bank 30 years ago \u2013 had led to the \u201cmother of mis-selling\u201d scandals as banks grappled to maintain the concept of free banking at a time when interest rates had plunged from a peak of 17%. \u201cThe contortions the industry has put itself through to maintain this over-riding of the price mechanism have been very damaging, not only to the most vulnerable consumers who through penalty charges subsidise the better-off (they used to be known, revealingly, as \u2018delinquents\u2019), but also, I believe, to banking in general,\u201d Taylor said in a speech in London. Teaser rates, which were offered to lure people in before the 2007 crisis, had left mortgage customers \u201cmarooned on the standard variable rate and unable to refinance\u201d. \u201cThe habit of giving what are effectively disloyalty discounts has turned into a cynical and corrosive negative-sum game,\u201d he said.

The company declined to say exactly how many staff would be affected in the UK but asaid 475 of a wider package of 5,000 redundancies would come from the North Sea operation. Paul Goodfellow, Shell UK\u2019s vice-president, told staff in Aberdeen just 24 hours after chief executive Ben van Beurden\u2019s \u00a34.3m remuneration package was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting in The Hague. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing the improvement journey we\u2019ve been on to create a competitive and sustainable business in the North Sea.

A number of major shareholders did speak out against the bonuses, which came on top of a \u00a39.7m share handout tied to performance to be vest in three years. The pay concern was expressed more forcefully at rival BP, where almost 60% of shareholders voted against the \u00a314m package of its chief executive, Bob Dudley.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has warned that there is no guarantee that attempts to save 12,000 jobs at Tata Steel UK will succeed as the Indian company\u2019s board meets in Mumbai to consider bids for its British business. The prime minister said his government was doing everything it could to secure a buyer for the business, which includes two blast furnaces at Port Talbot in south Wales. But he added: \u201cAs I\u2019ve always said there are no guarantees. We can\u2019t guarantee this is going to work.\u201d Cameron made his comments as he was travelling to a G7 summit in Japan, where world leaders are likely to discuss the dire impact that Chinese steel dumping is having on the industry. \u201cQuite a feature will be dangers of overcapacity in sectors like steel,\u201d he said, adding that he planned to use the G7 meeting to discuss the issue with the presidents of the European commission and council, as well as the leaders of France, Germany and Italy. Cameron added: \u201cWe continue to work towards trying to get a good outcome for Tata in south Wales. The sales process is underway, there have been an encouraging number of serious bids from companies coming through. We\u2019ve got to stick at it to try to bring this to successful conclusion.\u201d Tata Steel\u2019s board is meeting on Wednesday to consider a handful of offers for its loss-making UK operations. It could publish a shortlist of one or more preferred bidders and is at least expected to comment on the state of the bidding process when it reports its annual results to Indian analysts. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, met Tata board members on Tuesday after flying to Mumbai. He is likely to make a statement to parliament on Thursday. Javid is pressing for Tata to allow time for a deal with government backing for a buyer that includes hundreds of millions of pounds of loans and grants, and a possible equity stake. Workers from Tata Steel and other British producers are to march on Westminster on Wednesday to call for a responsible sale of the Tata business and for a government strategy to support the steel industry. MPs have accused Javid and the government of reacting too slowly to the crisis in the industry which has put thousands of jobs at risk. Cameron hit back at critics who say the EU has failed to take action on the floods of Chinese imports, arguing that tariffs have cut imports of some forms of steel by 90% or more. Bidders had until Monday to submit offers for the rest of Tata Steel\u2019s UK business, which employs about 12,000 people including 4,000 at Port Talbot. Taking into account the supply chain, about 40,000 jobs are said to be in danger if the business closes. Tata, the Indian conglomerate that also makes Jaguar cars and Tetley tea, announced in March it wanted to sell its UK steel business. The business, which it bought in 2007, was losing an estimated \u00a31m a day. Tata blamed cheap Chinese imports and high business costs. Earlier this month, Tata said it had received seven credible expressions of interest and invited the potential bidders to come up with firm offers. The company is reported to have received at least four bids for consideration at Wednesday\u2019s board meeting. Liberty House, the metals group run by Sanjeev Gupta, and Excalibur Steel, led by Tata Steel\u2019s UK management, are said to have submitted separate bids after discussing the idea of working together. Excalibur on Monday rejected talk of its team joining Liberty House\u2019s bid. Greybull Capital, the investment firm that has bought Tata\u2019s long products business in Scunthorpe, and India\u2019s JSW Steel have also submitted bids, Reuters reported. China\u2019s Hebei Iron and Steel as well as Endless, a US private equity fund, have both expressed interest, while Wilbur Ross, a US buyer of distressed businesses, has considered making an offer.",

      "bodyText": "On a day when retailers have seen varying reactions to their results - Marks &amp; Spencer down, Dixons Carphone up - Tesco is also in the spotlight. The supermarket\u2019s shares are down 2.45p at 168.55p after a downgrade from Credit Suisse. The bank has cut its target price from 135p to 115p, partly on concerns about its property estate. It said: Large-store performance looks worse than reported. We deconstruct Tesco\u2019s UK sales by format, adjusting for differing sales densities and growth in online, and conclude that like for likes at Tesco\u2019s largest stores (46% of its UK grocery space) were 2.3% lower in 2016. Our proprietary analysis indicates that these stores create a structural EBIT headwind of -1.7%. Real estate burden appears unique and intractable. Tesco spent \u00a31.7bn buying back leases and joint ventures in 2016,but we expect this trend to slow as fewer large packages become available to purchase. We also analyse the \u00a33.6bn of structured debt transactions comprising 106 stores that average 70,000 square feet, which further limit real estate flexibility. UK operating profit margins likely to be permanently rebased lower. After incorporating our unique analysis of Brand Guarantee, Farm Brands, online, and scale, we see no obvious path back to historical margin levels (or what \u2018normal\u2019 margins should be). We reduce our UK terminal margin to 2.2% from 2.8%, which already assumes Tesco can mitigate 50% of the structural drag of its large stores. We also reduce our 2018-19 UK and Republic of Ireland EBIT estimates by 14% and 29%, respectively, resulting in group operating profit estimates falling by 8.0% and 17.8%, respectively.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ExxonMobil moved to squash a well-established congressional lecture series on climate science just nine days after the presidential inauguration of George W Bush, a former oil executive, the Guardian has learned. Exxon\u2019s intervention on the briefings, revealed here for the first time, adds to evidence the oil company was acutely aware of the state of climate science and its implications for government policy and the energy industry \u2013 despite Exxon\u2019s public protestations for decades about the uncertainties of global warming science. Indeed, the company moved swiftly during the earliest days of the Bush administration to block public debate on global warming and delay domestic and international regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to former officials of the US Global Change Research Program, or USGCRP. The Bush White House is now notorious for censoring climate scientists and blocking international action on climate change by pulling the US out of the Kyoto agreement. The oil company is under investigation by 17 attorney generals for misleading the public about climate change, and is facing a shareholder revolt at its annual general meeting on Wednesday by investors pressing Exxon for greater disclosure about the effect of climate change on its profits. In early 2001, however, after Al Gore lost the White House to George Bush, Exxon officials apparently saw a chance to influence the incoming administration, according to former officials of the research program. The government agency was set up in 1990 and charged with producing definitive reports to Congress every four years on the effects of climate change on the US. In the mid-1990s, as part of its legal mandate, USGCRP began organizing monthly seminars on climate science for elected officials and staffers in Congress. On 29 January 2001, nine days after Bush\u2019s inauguration, Arthur Randol, a former senior environmental advisor at Exxon, telephoned Nicky Sundt, then communications director for the research program, to inquire about the future of the lecture series. A few days earlier, Sundt had emailed a survey to congressional staffers seeking suggestions for the next lecture series. Exxon had not been on his distribution list, and Sundt said he was surprised to receive a call from Randol. \u201cI thought it was very unusual, if not inappropriate, for a fossil fuel lobbyist to be calling me directly days after the administration was sworn in only directly to instruct me on how we would be communicating to the Congress on climate change,\u201d Sundt told the Guardian. \u201cThis is ExxonMobil reaching into the federal government science apparatus and seeking to influence the communication of science.\u201d Sundt, who now directs the WWF-US climate science programme (although he said he was not speaking on behalf of the organisation), said he made notes of the phone call. The briefings had then been running for a number of years and were well regarded by Republican as well as Democratic staffers, according to Bryan Hannegan, a Senate staffer and scientist who went on to work for the Bush administration and is now at the National Renewable Energy Lab. But the Exxon lobbyist saw it differently. \u201cI very specifically remember him suggesting that the seminars were what he called \u2018agenda-driven\u2019, and he indicated that with the new administration and the Congress that \u2013 if the seminars continue \u2013 he hoped to see a different balance of viewpoints,\u201d Sundt said. That was Sundt\u2019s only encounter with Randol. He told his USGCRP colleagues about the telephone call but did not speak out publicly until now. In retrospect, Sundt said the telephone call was the first sign of the energy industry\u2019s efforts to squash the agency\u2019s reporting about climate change, and the broader debate about global warming, during the George W Bush era. Bush went on to pull the US out of the Kyoto climate change agreement, and White House officials were later found to have played down scientists\u2019 warnings about the dangers of climate change. Randol, who left Exxon in 2003 after 25 years with the oil company, was known to have played a key role in such efforts \u2013 even before Sundt came foward. On 6 February 2001, not long after his phone call to Sundt, Randol wrote a memo urging the Bush administration to demand the removal of Bob Watson, a well-regarded climate scientist, as head of the UN\u2019s climate science panel, the intergovernmental panel on climate change. Randol describes Watson as \u201chand-picked by Al Gore\u201d. \u201cRestructure the US attendance at upcoming IPCC meetings to assure that none of the Clinton/Gore proponents are involved in any decisional activities,\u201d the memo reads. In the same memo, Randol also recommended sacking three US climate officials. The Exxon lobbyist was extraordinarily successful. At the IPCC, Watson was replaced by Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian engineer who stepped down from the science panel last year after being accused of sexual harassment. Following Randol\u2019s recommendations, a number of climate sceptics were appointed to the administration, including Harlan Watson, a then Republican congressional staffer, who went on to lead the US climate negotiating team. Meanwhile, Randol sought to put Exxon\u2019s stamp on the blockbuster US climate reports. On 22 March 2002, Randol forwarded a company memo to the White House council of environmental quality suggesting an overhaul of the USGRCP\u2019s national climate assessments. The memo, which extolled Exxon\u2019s qualifications in climate science, recommended the agency focus more on \u201cgaps and uncertainties\u201d in climate science. Exxon and Randol did not respond to requests for comment. However, Mike MacCracken, a former chief scientist at the USGRCP, said Sundt\u2019s account of the phone call fits in with his recollections of Exxon\u2019s efforts to influence government climate science research. \u201cI don\u2019t recall the call directly but they were objecting to all sorts of things as the new administration came in,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess the Republicans were sort of pushing from Congress. They were taking over and they had their views.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has escaped new price controls after the communications regulator said the universal postal system was working in its current form. Ofcom investigated the company over concerns it no longer had competition in the delivery of letters following the withdrawal of Whistl from the market. Publishing the initial findings of its review, launched last July, the regulator said it would not impose new price caps on the company. \u201cGiven the declining letters market, and increased competition in parcels, Ofcom is not proposing to impose new price controls on Royal Mail\u2019s wholesale or retail products.\u201d It added: \u201cThe universal postal service is financially sustainable, while current rules and safeguards for people and businesses who use post are generally working well.\u201d Shares in Royal Mail rose 1.8% to 530p after Ofcom delivered the findings, making it one of the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest risers on Wednesday morning. Ofcom said that, as the postal regulator, it had a duty to secure the universal postal service, which requires Royal Mail to deliver to every address in the UK, six days a week, at a uniform price. Royal Mail could do more to improve efficiency to benefit customers, Ofcom said, because there was too much variation in performance at different delivery depots. The regulator added that it intended to introduce new rules to ensure the safe arrival of letters. Postal operators which failed to follow these rules would be fined. Jonathan Oxley, competition director at Ofcom, said: \u201cConsumers should have utmost confidence in using postal services. We want to ensure that letters which haven\u2019t been tracked, but may still contain important contents, arrive safely.\u201d The regulator said it was concerned Royal Mail had the potential to subsidise its parcels business through its letters business \u2013 where it has a much larger market share and established delivery network - in a way that might disadvantage other parcel delivery companies. \u201cOfcom will closely monitor whether Royal Mail is appropriately allocating its costs between parcels and letters,\u201d it said. The regulator said it would publish a final report later in the year, following a further consultation period that will close on 3 August. Royal Mail said in response to Ofcom\u2019s initial findings: \u201cRoyal Mail notes that Ofcom has today published its consultation document containing proposals in relation to the regulatory framework for Royal Mail. \u201cThe company is reviewing the proposals and will issue a further announcement in due course.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eurozone ministers are finally heading to their beds, and the frazzled Brussels press pack are heroically filing copy. So let\u2019s have a brief recap. Greece has finally received the green light to receive more than \u20ac10bn in bailout funds, easing concerns that it could face financial peril this summer. After a marathon meeting in the Belgian capital, creditors agreed that Greece has done pretty-much everything required under its bailout A few prior actions do remain, concerning pensions and privatisations, but once that is resolved, the money will flow -- starting with \u20ac7.5bn in June. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that Greece\u2019s programme was back on track. \u201cWe achieved a major breakthrough on Greece which enables us to enter a new phase in the Greek financial assistance programme,....This is stretching what I thought would have been possible not so long ago.\u201d In an important development, the International Monetary Fund has signalled that it could join the bailout. That could happen by the end fo 2016. However, European chief Poul Thomsen insisted that the Fund must check that the eurozone is offering substantial debt relief. Thomsen said: We welcome that all stakeholders recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. We welcome that it is understood that Greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable. Crucially, Eurozone ministers have agreed to \u201ca package of debt measures\u201d to make Greece\u2019s debts sustainable. That will start with short-term tweaks to Greece\u2019s debts, to smooth out its obligations. Medium-term measures are also promised, although not until 2018, which looks like a concession from the IMF. There is also a commitment to consider whether further restructuring will be needed once the bailout ends, assuming Athens sticks to the programme and everything works out. The deal has been welcomed by Greece\u2019s finance minister. Euclid Tsakalotos said it would help end the country\u2019s vicious circle of austerity and recession. Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, said the Greek deal was good for the global economy. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Kazimir also sounded satisfied, comparing the negotiations to \u201ca complicated birth\u201d. And France\u2019s Michel Sapin was positively upbeat, saying the deal was \u201cfirst and foremost a declaration of confidence in today\u2019s Greece.\u201d Some questions remain, over the details of the debt relief, whether it will satisfy the IMF, and whether Greece can ever exit its financial crisis while sticking to the tough terms of its bailout. We\u2019ll consider them tomorrow later today. Until then, goodnight! GW It\u2019s late, but Bruno\u2019s brain is still whirring. Greek finance chief Tsakalotos added: \u201cI think there is some ground for optimism that this can be the beginning of turning Greece\u2019s vicious circle of recession-measures-recession into one where investors have a clear runway to invest in Greece. (via Reuters) Down the corridor, Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has told reporters that today\u2019s deal is an \u2018important moment\u2019 (echoing Dijsselbloem, Thomsen and Moscovici) Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has hailed the agreement - which comes as world leaders head to Japan for a G7 meeting. And finally.... Jeroen Dijsselbloem insists that the eurozone would not \u2018go it alone\u2019 without the International Monetary Fund. If, hypothetically speaking, the Fund found it couldn\u2019t back the package then the two sides would work together to find a solution, he says, promising that: We will stay in close co-operation with the IMF. And that, blessedly, is the end of the press conference, at almost 3am in Brussels. Ah.... Bruno Waterfield of the Times is concerned that the measures agreed tonight aren\u2019t actually quantified. Why not? Poul Thomsen says Europe can deliver the measures which the IMF has been calling for. He agreed that they need to be quantified, before the Fund can come on board. The key is that Greece must be able to stand on its own at the end of the programme period (in 2018) And Thomsen warns that he will not ask the Fund\u2019s board to join the bailout programme otherwise. Q: When will the eurozone decide the details of medium-term debt relief? Not until after the German elections? Dijsselbloem claims he doesn\u2019t know when those elections are! (I think they could be in August 2017, or later). He then explains that the Greek deal expires in 2018 - so if the programme is completed, we will draw up a new debt sustainability analysis. He also insists that the package hammered out for Greece is truly ambitious, Ministers have \u201cstretched their political capital\u201d to get this deal on the table, Dijsselbloem adds. Q: Today\u2019s debt relief measures seem weaker than what the IMF has been proposing, so is there a danger that it fails your debt sustainability test? Poul Thomsen says the IMF will assess the latest proposals (online here) and see if they go far enough. [On Monday, the IMF argued that the eurozone should grant Greece debt relied until 2040 -- today\u2019s measures don\u2019t go that far] Onto questions. Q: What has to happen before Greece receives its bailout funds? ESM chief Klaus Regling says some additional steps are needed on privatisations, pensions and non-performing loans. Now the IMF\u2019s European chief, Poul Thomsen, speaks! He says the Fund welcomes the \u201cimportant package of measures\u201d which Greece has adopted. All sides have had to compromise. And Thomsen then turns to the big issue - debt relief. We welcome that all stakeholders recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. We welcome that it is understood that Greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable. And we welcome that there is agreement on the methodology and the objectives of what debt relief will achieve. The IMF will now spend some time analysing the short-term debt relief measures being taken. And crucially he confirms that IMF staff will recommend joining the bailout by the end of 2016, as long as the debt sustainability analysis shows that the measures on the table will work. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s a decision for the Fund\u2019s board. Onto the details.... The boss of the ESM bailout fund, Klaus Regling, says Greece needs to complete the outstanding \u2018prior actions\u2019 previously agreed with its lenders. Then national governments must give their approval, before the first portion of the bailout funds - worth 7.5 billion euros -- can be handed over in June. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici says the eurogroup has reached a good agreement. It opens the way to rebuild confidence and create a \u201clasting economic recovery in Greece\u201d. Moscovici adds: It is a very important moment in this long and sometimes difficult journey\u201d Sometimes?! Curious metaphor alert, from the Slovakian finance minister: The Eurogroup\u2019s statement is online here: Eurogroup statement on Greece It confirms that Greece will receive its bailout loans, that the eurozone will offer debt relief, and that IMF officials are planning to recommend that they join the Greek bailout programme. The key points: Dijsselbloem sounds quite cheerful, telling reporters that this is an important moment in the long Greek saga. Confidence has begun to recover since the drama of last summer, and he extends his thanks to Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and his staff. We have entered a new phase, and I welcome that very much, Dijsselbloem concludes. In another important development, Dijsselbloem says that that IMF is on board with the Greek bailout. He explains that the Fund\u2019s management have agreed to recommend a new financial arrangement for Athens before the end of this year. Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem says ministers have agreed a range of debt relief measures for Greece. In the short term, these relate to \u2018debt management\u2019 - smoothing Greece\u2019s repayments to avoid any shocks. Medium-term measures will kick in from mid-2018, when Greece\u2019s bailout expires (assuming Athens complies with its demands). He also explains that profits which the European Central Bank has made on Greek bonds will be returned to Athens, to help with debt sustainability. This decision eases concerns that Greece could default over the summer. However, most of this new loan will be returned to Greece\u2019s creditors, of course, or used to cover outstanding government bills. It\u2019s official! Jeroen Dijsselbloem confirms that the eurozone\u2019s bailout vehicle has agreed to extend \u20ac10.3bn of bailout loans to Greece. But as rumoured earlier, the aid will be handed over in several instalments, not in one lump. Dijsselbloem says: This is very good news... the programme is fully back on track. Greece is delivering a lot, and we are making good progress. Jeroen Dijsselboem has arrived at the press conference, rubbing his hands. And excitingly, IMF chief Poul Thomsen is there too. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem is about to hold a press conference about the meeting. It\u2019s being streamed live, here (right-click to open in a new tab) AFP are now reporting that the eurogroup has done enough to unlock its long-awaited bailout funds: Michel Sapin has also declared that the IMF is part of this deal with Greece, which covers short, medium and long-term debt relief (Reuters reports) French finance minister Michel Sapin says a deal has been struck with Greece, according to a newsflash on Reuters. It\u2019s official, the eurogroup meeting had concluded! And there are reports that an agreement has been reached between the eurozone and the IMF on Greek debt relief, and reforms. Remember that Zorba the Greek tune we mentioned earlier? Apparently it was played to the eurogroup! Hang in there.... the latest word is that the meeting might *finally* be over. Current state of play: The clocks have now chimed 1am in Brussels, and the eurogroup meeting still grinds on. We\u2019re expecting a press conference at some stage, meaning ministers won\u2019t get much sleep before they return for fresh meetings on Wednesday morning.... The IMF\u2019s top man in Europe, Poul Thomsen, is reportedly consulting with Christine Lagarde over the Greek issue.... Sounds like Greece\u2019s creditors are still divided... Oh goodness me.... AFP\u2019s Alex Pigman has heard the eurogroup ministers haven\u2019t reached an agreement after all.... That\u2019s bad news all round, as ministers are due back for an ECOFIN meeting (including non-euro countries) tomorrow morning..... Euronews have produced a handy explanation to the Greek debt crisis - which you can see here. It includes clips of the anti-austerity protests which gripped Brussels today (as covered earlier today), and saw riot police use water cannons on demonstrators. It\u2019s now Wednesday in Brussels, and 1am over in Greece, and still the eurogroup meeting continues. More seriously, my local pub just rang \u2018time at the bar\u2019 :( Excellent news.... That could mean that ministers are ready to sign off an agreement.... Heads-up! Eric Maurice of EUobserver reckons eurozone finance ministers might wrap things up in 20 minutes.... Bong! It\u2019s now eight hours since eurozone finance ministers began today\u2019s meeting, and just 30 minutes until the Brussels bells chime midnight. So far, it sounds like they may agree to hand Greece its \u20ac11bn aid tranche, but in two installments. But there\u2019s no sign of a breakthrough over how to give Greece debt relief. At least they\u2019re still talking, though.... Alex White of the Economist Intelligence Unit suspects tough decisions on Greek debt relief could be delayed until after the next German general elections, in autumn 2017. That may not be acceptable to the IMF, though.... Cross everything.... OK, I have no idea what this means....but EC spokesman Simon O\u2019Connor just tweeted this catchy tune from Zorba the Greek. Might it be a sign that talks are speeding up?... Finland\u2019s finance minister has just tweeted that the eurogroup has taken a break, and that these long days require \u2018endurance\u2019: What would we do without online translation sites, eh? The Wall Street Journal have a great timeline showing Greece\u2019s debt repayments: Greece\u2019s Debt Due: What Greece Owes When This chart shows its obligations this year: Don\u2019t worry too much about the grey lines - they show short-term debt held by Greek banks which can be \u2018rolled over\u2019 at regular auctions. The red and blue lines are important, though - they show money owed to the IMF and the ECB. Defaulting on either creditor would have serious consequences. Splitting Greece\u2019s bailout funds into two tranches would leave Athens\u2019 a little more exposed over the summer. It has to repay around \u20ac3bn of long-term debt to its creditors in July, which should be manageable if it receives \u20ac7.5bn in loans next month (as is rumoured). Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 latest report from Brussels, confirming what we\u2019ve been hearing: Euro zone finance ministers are likely to approve new loans to Greece of 10.3 billion euros, according to a draft statement seen by euro zone officials. The 10.3 billion euros in new loans is likely to be paid out in two tranches, officials said, with the first one in June worth 7.8 billion euros. The amount and timing are not final yet, officials said. The disbursement was conditional on Greece delivering on reform promises. Our own Jennifer Rankin confirms that Greece may get its aid loans in two portions, not all in one lump as expected: She\u2019s also hearing that negotiations over debt relief for Athens are continuing... A Slovak government advisor tweets that eurogroup ministers are taking a break. I hate to rush you, guys, but it\u2019s 11pm in Greece and our dear readers may need their sleep..... A few journalists in Brussels are reporting that Greece\u2019s bailout payment is going to be split into two instalments. Efi Koutsokosta of Euronews has the details: If so, that could mean that creditors aren\u2019t totally happy with the measures approved by Athens last weekend. Or it could mean something else.... Over in New York, Wall Street has just closed for the night with gains across the board. Banks and tech stocks led the rally, as investors appeared to stop worrying about the prospect of a US rate rise. The Dow Jones index finished 211 points higher at 17,704 points, a jump of 1.2%, following a strong day in Europe. Today\u2019s problem in a nutshell: Rumblings of discontent in Brussels.... Greek government bonds traded at a six-month high today. That\u2019s thanks to hopes that Athens would receive the bailout funds needed to avoid another financial crisis. Bond yields (the interest rate on the debt) fell sharply on Monday after MPs approved the austerity measures sought by creditors. They fell a little further today, as traders waited for developments in Brussels. Ciaran O\u2019Hagan, a strategist at Societe Generale, says investors are now looking for concrete moves on debt relief: \u201cThe fall in Greek bond yields reflects optimism that the reforms passed by the Greek parliament pave the way for support from the Eurogroup later today.... If there is debt relief, you will see further outperformance.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quote) The Eurogroup meeting is now entering its seventh hour. Greek journalist Yannis Karagiorgas sums up the mood: Here\u2019s our latest news story from Brussels: It begins thus: European officials have voiced optimism that Greece could unlock the next tranche of bailout money even as an ongoing row between the country\u2019s creditors threatens to plunge the eurozone back into crisis. Greece\u2019s international creditors remain deadlocked over how to reduce the recession-hit country\u2019s \u20ac321bn (\u00a3245bn) debt mountain, worth 180% of annual economic output. The International Monetary Fund has threatened to walk away from the Greek bailout unless substantial debt relief is agreed, but Germany maintains there can be no changes before 2018. Going into the talks between 19 eurozone finance ministers in Brussels, Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner in charge of the euro, said he hoped to see \u201can agreement in principle\u201d, including on disbursement of bailout funds..... (click here for more) The Greek delegation are briefing reporters in Brussels now, and confirming that talks are continuing. They\u2019re also suggesting that Germany is pushing for changes to the austerity measures passed last Sunday. Eleni Varvitsiotis, EU correspondent at Greek newspaper Kathimerini, says three outstanding issues must be resolved before Greece gets its aid tranche: EKAS is Greece\u2019s Pensioners\u2019 Social Solidarity Benefit, which is being cut back under the bailout programme (some wealthier pensioners are reportedly being told to hand back some recent payments). NPL means non-performing loans - the bad debts held by Greece\u2019s banks , which are to be sold off. Matthew Klein, one of FT\u2019s Alphaville\u2019s many blindingly-bright sparks, has been digging through Greece\u2019s finances, and spotted something rather interesting. It\u2019s all to do with Greece\u2019s net debt (basically its gross debt minus the financial assets the country holds). The International Monetary Fund reckons those financial assets are worth just \u00a33bn, a drop in the ocean compared to its debt mountain. But Matt has discovered that the Bank of Greece has calculated it as \u00a330bn - using the methodology recommended by the IMF itself. It\u2019s not really obvious why such a difference should occur - but it\u2019s obviously important when assessing Greece\u2019s financial health. If you have any ideas why, please tell Matt here: Is the IMF under-counting the Greek government\u2019s financial assets? Greece\u2019s ANA newswire are reporting that eurozone finance ministers are likely to approve Greece\u2019s \u20ac11bn bailout tranche tonight. Here\u2019s the story, hot off the Reuters terminal: Negotiations at Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting are focusing on Greece\u2019s debt, a source from the European Commission said, adding that Eurozone\u2019s finance ministers are expected to approve the disbursement of the loan installment totaling 10.3 billion euros. The same source said there are still some pending issues which will be included in the final statement. Commenting on these issues, a government source said they are not decisive and will be resolved summarily. But what about the showdown between Greece\u2019s creditors? As we\u2019ve reported earlier, the two sides are someway apart. ANA says: On the issue of the country\u2019s debt, the distance between the IMF and Germany is still great and the aim is to achieve greater convergence today. The Commission source said that after pressure by the IMF, the weight has shifted towards measures that will be taken in the short term. However, Eurozone officials hope some deal will eventually be achieved with the IMF tonight, as there\u2019s political pressure to avoid reviving the crisis. Let\u2019s fill the time with some dispiriting Greek charts, via Open Europe analyst Raoul Ruparel: Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin says there\u2019s no sign when the talks about Greece\u2019s bailout, and other eurozone economic issues, will end. Last time, the eurogroup were done and dusted by around 7pm local time (6pm BST). But regular crisis watchers will know that these meetings have a nasty habit of running on towards midnight.... Greece\u2019s former top central banker fears that the country is ill-prepared to exit its economic crisis. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains: While we wait for progress at the Eurogroup, here are some more photos from today\u2019s meeting. But... More optimism the Eurogroup\u2019s talks will be constructive: The story is here (in Greek). Stock markets appear to have come to terms with the prospect of a US interest rate rise, perhaps as early as next month. Indeed, the idea of the Federal Reserve hiking rates put financial shares in the spotlight, on the basis that dearer borrowing costs could boost their balance sheets. Meanwhile there was also optimism that a deal between Greece and its creditors could finally be reached at the Eurogroup meeting, despite tensions with the IMF over the country\u2019s debt situation, thus releasing much needed bailout funds. Another EU referendum survey showing the remain camp in the lead also helped support markets, as did another rise in the oil price. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: It\u2019s been nothing short of a stellar day for the FTSE-100 as the market has shaken off earlier woes to forge a path higher, despite what could be construed as a raft of adversity. Public sector borrowing was higher than expected and Bank of England officials painted another gloomy picture over the economic outlook in their parliamentary appearance. The saving grace however appears to have been a combination of that latest Brexit survey data showing the Remain camp forging its way ahead, plus the fact that oil prices are evidently ascending, too. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 82.83 points or 1.35% at 6219.26 Germany\u2019s Dax added 2.18% to 10,057.31 France\u2019s Cac climbed 2.46% to 4431.52 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped 3.34% to 17,903.97 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.34% higher at 8918.1 But in Greece, there was some profit taking after recent rises, and the Athens market fell 1.08% to 642.08 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 215 points or 1.23%. As for oil, Brent crude has climbed 0.54% to $48.61 a barrel. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s summary of the comments ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on Greece: The eurozone\u2019s top official expressed optimism Tuesday that Greece\u2019s creditors will approve its reform efforts, paving the way for the payout of a new batch of rescue loans that would keep Athens from defaulting on its massive debts this summer. \u201cI hope that there is full agreement between the institutions, that we can move on in the program,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers, as he arrived for the talks in Brussels. Greece\u2019s parliament passed a bill over the weekend on a series of measures that creditors had demanded. They included tax hikes, more budget-cutting reforms and a new privatization superfund, which will manage almost all state property. The next step for creditors would be to find a way to lighten the country\u2019s debt load, which mainly consists of past rescue loans from eurozone states. Greece\u2019s debt is predicted to reach more than \u20ac333bn this year, around 180% of its annual economic output. \u201cGreece needs room to breathe, it needs certainty. It\u2019s made considerable efforts, and again this weekend,\u201d said French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, referring to the reforms Greece passed. On the question of debt relief, Dijsselbloem said there was no appetite for any outright cut to the value of the money Greece owes. Rather, the creditors are likely to examine a possible lowering in the interest rates and possibly an extension of the rescue loans\u2019 maturity dates, as called for by the International Monetary Fund. There are fears the IMF may even pull out of the bailout program if Greece\u2019s debt burden is not lightened. \u201cAn actual haircut of the loans will not happen,\u201d Dijsselboem said. \u201cWhat we can look at is the annual debt burden, so Greece can on an annual basis pay its debts. If not, we are ready to help them in the coming years.\u201d Senior EU officials believe the plans being drawn up by experts to address Greece\u2019s short, mid- and longer-term debt needs will be enough to keep the IMF on board. \u201cThere is a real added value to have the IMF on board, so it is not an option to go on without the IMF,\u201d Dijsselbloem said. US investors have followed their European counterparts and moved back into the stock market, with continuing talk about an imminent Federal Reserve rate rise helping to lift financial stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or just over 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 has added 0.7% and Nasdaq is 0.85% better. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.8% higher while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2%. The FTSE 100 is up 70 points or 1.1%. But as the Eurogroup meets to try and resolve the Greek debt situation, the Athens market has slipped 1.27%. Back with Mark Carney, and here\u2019s our report on the Bank of England governor\u2019s appearance at the Treasury select committee: More comments made ahead of the Eurogroup meeting which should now be well underway: And Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem: The International Monetary Fund is using its negotiating position to try and persuade the Eurogroup to make concessions in the Greek debt crisis, says the Centre for Economics and Business Research, and this may be its best chance to push its point of view. But Cebr economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said: Cebr warns against premature optimism that today\u2019s meeting will mark \u2018the end of the Eurozone crisis\u2019. IMF policy is determined by its shareholders (represented by the board), rather than its staff. Politics matter much more to the former. And there is little enthusiasm in Germany for debt relief which would be hard to sell to the country\u2019s voters. On the other hand the Eurogroup will be unwilling to risk a crisis that could break up the Euro in the run-up to the UK Brexit vote on 23 June and the Spanish elections on 26 June, so arguably today\u2019s meeting is the IMF\u2019s best chance to use its negotiating power to force the concessions it believes are necessary. The Cebr sees two ways the situation could develop: 1. The IMF backs off and avoids confrontation with the Europeans. This would continue the \u201cextend and pretend\u201d strategy that has governed the Greek crisis since it started. This would most certainly be bad for the Greek economy, as the IMF staff\u2019s projections show. And, it could prove very damaging to Europe as it raises the likelihood of a default and Grexit further down the line \u2013 meaning that debt owed to European taxpayers (including in the UK) would never be repaid. 2. The IMF plays hardball and poses a painful dilemma to the Europeans. This would certainly be risky. A failure to agree could lead to another Eurozone crisis, possibly a Grexit. But it is in everyone\u2019s interest that this is avoided. The debt relief itself need not take the form of an outright haircut. Some form of reprofiling, as outlined in the IMF\u2019s DSA could do the trick. This would put the Greek economy on a more sustainable trajectory but would be costly politically to Eurozone leaders and may lead to political instability in the already-troubled union. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has just put his finger on the problems over the Greek bailout. Arriving for today\u2019s meeting, Sch\u00e4uble told reporters that there can be \u201cno programme\u201d for Greece without the IMF. However, he then declared that a decision on Greece\u2019s debt relief can only come in 2018, at the end of the bailout. That\u2019s later than the IMF is demanding. However, Sch\u00e4uble says he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d that these issues can be resolved. Back at the eurogroup, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has revealed that all isn\u2019t well: I suspect he\u2019s worried about the tensions between Greece\u2019s creditors, after the International Monetary Fund urged the eurozone to give Athens deeper debt relief. Today\u2019s meeting could become a serious showdown between the two sides, over the issue of Greece\u2019s debt sustainability. Belgium\u2019s finance chief, Johan Van Overtveldt, told reporters outside today\u2019s meeting that he wasn\u2019t impressed by the IMF\u2019s new call for \u2018unconditional\u2019 debt relief. Such relief must always have conditions attached, he argues. Here\u2019s why Belgium\u2019s workers took to the streets today, from AFP: \u201cI am here to protest against all the measures that this right-wing government is taking. They are attacking workers, pensioners and the unemployed,\u201d Michel Beis, a trade union member taking part in the peaceful rally told AFP before the violence broke out. \u201cWe are going backwards,\u201d added Jacques Warnier, a protester from the town of Liege. The AFP newswire are tweeting photos from today\u2019s clashes in Brussels: They report: Belgian police fired water-cannon during clashes with protesters at a huge demonstration in Brussels on Tuesday against the centre-right government\u2019s austerity measures, AFP journalists said. A group of around 100 masked protesters broke away from the peaceful main rally of around 60,000 people in the Belgian capital and started hurling objects and firecrackers at riot police, they said. Officers then drove them back with jets of water from three cannon. Tuesday\u2019s protest is supposed to kick off months of planned demonstrations and national strikes led by trade unions against the policies of Prime Minister Charles Michel\u2019s government. Clashes are breaking out in the Belgium capital, as an anti-austerity demonstration turns violent. Local media are reporting that riot police are using water cannon on protesters; just as eurozone finance ministers meet to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout. Today\u2019s protests are organised by Belgium\u2019s unions, to oppose the government\u2019s cost-cutting measures and employment reforms. The demonstrations had started peacefully: But some protesters then began throwing rocks at the police.... ....prompting the water cannons to be deployed. Meanwhile in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers have been gathering for today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. As explained back in the introduction, we had expected ministers to sign off on a \u20ac11bn bailout payment for Greece. But, in a worrying sign, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has warned that the meeting will be difficult - and could last all night! Peter Ka\u017eimer appears to be pushing for a deal on Greece\u2019s loans today, but not on the sticky issue of debt relief which is dividing the country\u2019s creditors. Cambridge lecturer Finbarr Livesey has helpfully tweeted the timings of the best moments of today\u2019s hearing: Here\u2019s some reaction to Mark Carney\u2019s appearance at parliament today, from Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly: \u201cToday\u2019s grilling of Mark Carney by the Treasury Select Committee has only helped fuel the speculation on the impact a Brexit would have on the UK economy. \u201cThe build-up to the EU referendum appears to be having a significant impact on the economy as sterling has been incredibly volatile, while GDP and inflation have slowed are slowing. \u201cMr Carney didn\u2019t exactly offer savers much ground for optimism today as he merely said the next move in interest rates would \u2018probably\u2019 be up if there is a vote to remain, while a Brexit would mean there is less chance of a rate rise. Once again savers are left wondering how long rates will continue at rock bottom, potentially eroding the value of their cash. \u201cSavers should heed this warning from the Governor and look to the long term returns stocks and shares ISAs can offer, though risk is attached.\u201d That was a livelier morning than expected. Here\u2019s a quick recap. The governor of the Bank of England has fought off criticism following his warning that Britain\u2019s economy would suffer if the public vote to leave the EU. Mark Carney insisted that the Bank was right to outline its concerns, saying: By our actions, and comments, we have made it more likely that we\u2019ll bring inflation back to target, whatever the outcome of the referendum, sooner and more sustainably. Carney also warned that the financial markets could have a \u201cPavlovian\u201d reaction to the EU referendum vote. If Britain chooses to Brexit on June 23, then it would have a negative impact on growth and the pound, and push inflation up, he argued. It\u2019s important not just for those in financial markets to understand that, but it\u2019s important also to (be) straight with the British people about that. But Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg accused the governor of peddling government propaganda. In one of the more ill-tempered exchanges seen recently, Rees-Mogg argued that the Bank had broken its own rules on independence, and damaged its reputation. And fellow Tory Steve Baker appeared to shock Carney, by asking him to deny that he was secretly working for Goldman Sachs. Carney said he was shocked that such a thing could even be suggested. Carney was supported by three other top officials. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent, and external MPC members Martin Weale and Gertjan Vleighe, said they shared the governor\u2019s concerns. And the governor also revealed that he had an early peek at the Brexit paper produced by the Treasury yesterday, over breakfast with the chancellor. Before the session began, we learned that Britain\u2019s financial position was worse than thought. The UK was forced to borrow \u00a34bn more than forecast in the 2015-16 financial year, in a blow to George Osborne. But every challenge is also an opportunity -- in this case, an opportunity to warn about Brexit fears.... Andrew Tyrie has returned from his little chin-wag with Jacob Rees-Mogg, to wrap up the session. He thanks Martin Weale for his work at the Bank of England, as this could be his final appearance before the committee. Tyrie cites Weale\u2019s \u201cindependence of mind\u201d (which included several lonely, hawkish votes to raise interest rates). Tyrie then hints that Weale might have another job lined up.... We\u2019re very grateful for your public service, and we hope it\u2019s not the last. Weale keeps a straight face. And committee chairman Tyrie can\u2019t resist causing some mischief. He then picks up a copy of the Financial Times, which reports that governor Carney is the most trusted foreigner, ahead of German chancellor Angela Merkel or the US president. Q: What did Carney make of this, as he enjoyed his porridge, or \u2018whatever you have in the morning, when you\u2019re not having breakfast with the chancellor\u2019? Carney says that the committee had to consider the impact of the EU referendum, because of the Bank\u2019s mandate. And he jokes that he assumes Tyrie won\u2019t be questioning everyone else on that list. Tyrie then suggests that IMF Christine Lagarde could \u201cdrift by\u201d the committee in a few weeks time, \u201cif she does decide to put both feet in it\u201d. Get the popcorn ready.... Back in the committee room, Scottish Nationalist MP George Kerevan asks about the Banks medium-term view of the UK economy. Mark Carney says that growth has slowed from the high days of 2013, when GDP was expanding by around 3% per year. Now, though, it has dropped to around 1%. Stripping out the referendum effect.... the bigger picture is that growth will move in line with supply growth, which is weaker than it was. So once the uncertainty effect of the Brexit vote fades, the Bank expects growth to return to around 2.25%, Mark Carney concludes. Get a sponge and a towel, folks -- here\u2019s the moment when the gloves came off between Mark Carney and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward sums it up: Mark Carney displayed flashes of anger at his chief pro-Brexit tormentor on Parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee in his most robust defense yet of the Bank of England\u2019s comments on the European Union vote. It \u201cmay be inconvenient, but by our actions, and comments, we have made it more likely that we\u2019ll bring inflation back to target, whatever the outcome of the referendum, sooner and more sustainably,\u201d the governor told Jacob Rees-Mogg, the lawmaker who called this month for him to be fired. \u201cThat\u2019s our contribution to a better economic outcome for the British people, and for you to suggest otherwise is to try and undermine that.\u201d More highlights earlier in this blog.... The committee turns to the issue of Britain\u2019s current account deficit. Mark Carney says there would be a \u2018necessary\u2019 rebalancing of sterling (a fall, basically), if Britain chose to leave the EU. And that would have an import on exporters, meaning the domestic sector would increase relative to the export sector (ie, Britain would sell less overseas, at least for a while). However, Carney insists that talk of a \u201csterling crisis\u201d is overdone. Today\u2019s Telegraph cartoon will amuse those who take government Brexit warnings with lashings of salt. The committee then turn to the weapons available to the Bank to stimulate the economy. MPC member Gertjan Vleighe says he believes another round of quantitative easing (buying bonds from banks with newly created money) would still be effective. And there is still room to cut bank rate. Jacob Rees-Mogg then gets up and leaves the room, with a polite nod to the witnesses. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie then hops up and follows him...... #curious.... Steve Baker MP then leaves Mark Carney briefly speechless, by asking him to refute the suggestion that Goldman Sachs have pushed him into the Brexit debate. Baker tells the Bank governor that he is asking \u2018in the spirit of goodwill\u2019 (!!).... We know that Goldman Sachs has been a donor to the Remain campaign, you are a former managing director of Goldman Sachs. Can I just give you the opportunity to refute any suggestion that Goldman Sachs may have put pressure on you to take a view? \u201cWow....\u201d, replies Carney, seemingly at a loss for words. Baker: It\u2019s not an allegation - it\u2019s an opportunity to refute it. Carney refutes it with gusto: Yes, I refute it categorically... and am stunned to ever have it raised. That\u2019s a pretty remarkable jibe at the credibility of one of the world\u2019s top central bankers -- but one which conspiracy theorists will like to hear aired.... Q: Why do the Bank\u2019s latest graphs show uncertainty over UK assets falling, just as the EU referendum reaches its height, asks Steve Baker. Policymaker Martin Weale suggests that it is tracking the support for the Remain campaign. Steve Baker then turns to the Bank\u2019s [not unblemished] track record on forecasting You said that interest rates might rise when unemployment fell to 7%, but they didn\u2019t. Then you said they might rise once real wages went up, but they didn\u2019t. Then you suggested rate could go up at the turn of 2016. They didn\u2019t. So.... Q: If the bank can\u2019t forecast its own actions, why should we trust your forecasts? You didn\u2019t even predict the halving of the oil price. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says no-one predicted that oil would fall so sharply. Financial markets make their best guess about these moves. Q: Well, you\u2019ve just proved the impossibility of making major economic predictions (such as the impact of Brexit) That\u2019s a false dichotomy, Broadbent replies. You can\u2019t say that forecasting is impossible, just because you can\u2019t predict everything. Just because the future is uncertain doesn\u2019t mean that forecasting is useless, he adds. [This is an example of what Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam yesterday called the \u2018pizza analogy\u2019:] Steve Baker MP goes next, and reduces Mark Carney to giggles. Baker, another pro-Brexit MP, tells the Bank of England\u2019s top brass that he positively rejects the idea that they are wicked conspirators. Instead.... I choose to believe your wholesale innocence, completely unsullied by the grubby politics of this referendum matter. As it happens I think you\u2019re just wrong.... Baker also invites Carney to the Annual Hayek Memorial Lecture held by the IEA thinktank on 8 June, to learn the error of his ways. You can sign up here: George Selgin on stability without Central Banks During a long discussion on sterling, Ben Broadbent suggests that the pound could fall by 5% if Britain votes to leave the EU. Ben Chu of the Independent says that Mark Carney has \u201cdoubled down\u201d on his concerns over the EU referendum this morning. And that could be significant, as opinion polls have found that the public trust the Bank of England governor more than Westminster\u2019s best and brightest. Ben writes: The Governor of the Bank of England, one of the most trusted public figures in the UK, has sounded another warning about the instant economic shock Brexit would inflict on Britain. Speaking in front of MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Mark Carney, who recent polling suggested is more trusted among the public than senior politicians, said: \u201cBrexit to my mind would have a material impact on growth and inflation. It would be likely to have a negative impact in the short term.\u201d Following up on his words earlier this month, Mr Carney added: \u201cI certainly think that would increase the risk of recession.\u201d Mr Carney\u2019s warning follows a stark warning from the Chancellor yesterday, citing Treasury economic analysis, that Brexit would lead to an immediate year-long recession for the UK. More here: Asked about recent movements in the pound, Mark Carney says sterling has been tracking the probability of Britain leaving the EU (rising when Brexit looks less likely). This may not reassure critics of the Bank\u2019s independence.... Carney says he saw the draft version, because it included economic forecasts, but he didn\u2019t give any feedback. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent, though, says he\u2019s hardly looked at the Treasury\u2019s analysis at all (which warns that Brexit would cause a DIY recession) John Mann MP now takes up the issue of the Bank\u2019s independence (or lack of) over Brexit. He says the external members of the Monetary Policy Committee \u2013 Martin Weale and Gertjan Vlieghe \u2013 are being accused of simply \u201cdoing whatever the governor tells you to do\u201d. Weale points out that he\u2019s often disagreed with the rest of the committee, by voting to raise interest rates in recent years (before changing his mind). Q: But why aren\u2019t the external members at the Bank speaking up against these slurs on your integrity? Vlieghe says he does resent the implication that the committee are under the control of Mark Carney, or George Osborne. He insists that there\u2019s no secretive control of the Bank. No-one has told me, or asked me, about which way these discussions should go. Mann suggests that if the MPC\u2019s external members are truly independent, they should speak up a bit. Perhaps sensibly, Mark Carney declines to comment on the Brexit analysis issued by the Treasury yesterday, which predicted four quarters of recession. Mark Carney then warns that a vote to leave the EU could prompt a \u2018Pavolvian\u2019 reaction in the City, pushing up the risk premium on UK assets. But it would also be hard to the Bank to stimulate the economy, if a weaker pound drove up inflation. Rachel Reeves then questions Mark Carney about the implications of Britain leaving the EU. Mark Carney agrees that Brexit could cause the pound to weaken, creating an upside shock to inflation that would make it harder to keep interest rates low. If Britain stays in the EU, the next move in interest rates is probably up. If the public vote to leave, there\u2019s less chance of a rate rise. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent then points out that the UK economy appears to have slowed quite sharply this year - it\u2019s unclear how much of this is due to Brexit fears. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie steps in -- perhaps worried that Mark Carney and Jacob Rees-Mogg might take their argument outside. He tells the BoE governor that many members of the commitee would have been concerned if the Bank had NOT discussed the EU referendum. Labour MP Rachel Reeves than puts the boot into Rees-Mogg, saying: If anyone\u2019s reputation has been damaged by today\u2019s performance, it\u2019s not the Bank of England. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP now accuses Carney of being influenced by chancellor George Osborne. As the gloves come off, Carney insists that he\u2019s not being played by government. There\u2019s \u201cno possibility of undue influence from the Treasury\u201d, Carney insists. It wouldn\u2019t work anyway, even if they tried Q: So it\u2019s very convenient that you\u2019re putting out the same propaganda as the Chancellor? I don\u2019t accept that at all, Carney replies. Q: But you have a duty to remain apolitical. How can anyone trust you on interest rates now? Our comments might not please you, Carney shoots back, but it has improved the chances of the economy recovering from the Brexit undertainty. To suggest otherwise is to try to undermine it. Rees Mogg insists that Carney has become politically involved... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth replying to, says Carney, trying to swat the pro-Brexit MP aside. Q: What contact have you had with George Osborne about the referendum? Mark Carney says he has had a series of conversations around how membership of the EU allows the bank to achieve its monetary targets. Ultimately we can achieve the inflation target whether we\u2019re in the EU or not. And there have also been conversations about the impact of Brexit on financial stability, and on the mechanics of potentially exiting the EU, Carney says. Q: How would any directions from the government come? I\u2019d expect it in writing, and in public, Carney says - he wouldn\u2019t accept \u2018informal direction\u2019. Mark Carney warns that sterling has been hit since November by the single issue of whether Britain stays in the EU, or leaves. That\u2019s why the Bank was right to flag up that the referendum could change monetary policy, he argues. Rees-Mogg isn\u2019t impressed: pointing out that a Labour government in his lifetime proposed re-introducing capital controls. Yet the Bank wouldn\u2019t give a view on a general election - but here it is, wading into the referendum issue. Your comparison is essentially false, he tells Carney. Now Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, a pro-Brexit MP, takes the microphone. Q: In general elections, you don\u2019t give a view on opposition policies, so why is the Bank giving its view on Brexit? Carney explains that the EU referendum is a single event that creates a \u2018discrete risk\u2019 to monetary policy, while a general election does not, as policies are implemented over time. Q: But a change of government is a discrete event, Rees-Mogg gently insists. You get a new economic policy and a new chancellor. Carney argue that it\u2019s still not a single event whose impact can be clearly identified. The Treasury committee now turns to other top officials from the Bank of England. First Martin Weale, who sits on the monetary policy committee which sets interest rates. He says Brexit would probably have a materially negative impact on growth and inflation, in the short term. And that would increase the risk of recession, Weale adds. Dr Gertjan Vleighe, another independent MPC member agrees. It is likely that there would be a material slowing in growth, inflation would rise, the exchange rate would fall, if Britain votes to leave the EU, Vleighe explains. Ben Broadband, deputy governor, says he agrees too. Q: So is there anyone on the MPC who disagrees? Governor Mark Carney says there isn\u2019t - the Committee is united on this one. Q: How about the Financial Policy Committee? (responsible for financial stability). Carney says they are also concerned about the referendum: It is the consensus view of the FPC that Brexit represents the biggest domestic risk to financial stability. Q: And there are no dissenters on the FPC either? No, Carney replies. The key points so far: Next question for Mr Carney.... Q: Is it acceptable for the International Monetary Fund to turn up a week before the EU referendum and give its views? [explainer: the Fund is due to publish its full health check on the UK, including in-depth calculations on the \u2018Brexit\u2019 effect, next month] Quite frankly, I have no influence over the IMF, says Carney. Q: But is it acceptable? The thrust of the IMF\u2019s views on this issues is well known, Carney argues Q: But is it a good idea for the IMF to \u2018jump in\u2019 with both feet, at such a crucial political time? Carney says he\u2019s only expecting to get \u201cdetail\u201d from the IMF about the UK economy next month.... Mark Carney begins his hearing by defending the Bank of England\u2019s warning that Britain could plunge into recession if it leaves the EU. Asked what principles and guidelines are being used for such forecasts, the governor says the Bank has adopted \u201csubstantially the same rules as the UK civil service\u201d. But there\u2019s one big difference - civil servants support a minister, while the Bank is independent and doesn\u2019t support government policy. And the Bank will soon go into purdah, to prevent any officials saying anything controversial in the run-up to the June 23 referendum. However, the Bank will be setting UK interest rates on 16 June, and will release the minutes of its meeting on that day Q: So we can\u2019t exclude the possibility of anoher intervention in the Brexit debate, asks chairman Andrew Tyrie.... It can\u2019t be excluded, Carney agrees. But in his judgement, the Bank has already highlighted the main issues. So he doesn\u2019t expect to say anything new on the 16th. There is a lot of uncertainty in the economy at the moment, so the Bank could be over-or-under-estimating the strength of the economy, Carney concludes. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before parliament\u2019s Treasury committee to answer questions about the UK economy, and his warnings against Brexit. Here\u2019s a livefeed. Britain\u2019s failure to hit its borrowing targets last year are a blow to chancellor George Osboene, as he tries to rally the country to remain in the EU. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: The upwardly revised shortfall for 2015/16 leaves the Chancellor open to criticism that he clearly missed the 2015/16 public finances targets that were set out as recently as March\u2019s budget \u2013 and could well be used by supporters of the UK leaving the EU as evidence that the Treasury\u2019s forecasts are unreliable (although the public finance forecasts are actually done by the Office for Budget Responsibility). Breaking: Britain missed its borrowing target last year by more than previously expected. The UK borrowed almost \u00a376bn in the 2015-16 financial year to cover the deficit, according to new figures just released by the Office for National Statistics. That\u2019s almost \u00a34bn more than the \u00a372bn estimate set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. It\u2019s also \u00a32bn more than the ONS initially estimated last month. On the upside, it\u2019s \u00a315.7bn less than Britain had to borrow in the previous 12 months -- but still a long way from George Osborne\u2019s target of a surplus. The ONS also reports that the UK borrowed \u00a37.2bn in April (the first month of the new financial year). That\u2019s \u00a30.3bn lower than in April 2015, and the lowest for any April since 2008. But it\u2019s also more than expected, with corporation tax receipts weaker than expected. The pound has jumped this morning, after a new opinion poll gave the Remain campaign a big lead. Sterling has gained half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.4538. This comes after the Daily Telegraph reported that the campaign to stay in Europe holds a 13-point lead over the Brexit camp. And crucially, the poll showed more support for Remain from older voters and Conservative supporters (there is some overlap, of course...). Cue a monstrous jump in the pound.... Elsewhere in the eurozone, Germany\u2019s largest bank has just had its credit rating slashed. Deutsche Bank has been downgraded by one notch by Moody\u2019s to Baa2, which is just two notches above Junk. Moody\u2019s warned that Deutche\u2019s recent performance has been weak, after seeing profits halve in the last quarter. And it also faces \u201csubstantial operating headwinds\u201d, including the record low interest rates in the eurozone, and uncertainty over the global economy. CEO John Cryan, who has been pushing a turnaround plan and cutting bonuses, says he\u2019s \u2018very disappointed\u2019 by the news. In an encouraging sign for Athens, the yield on Greek debt has hit the lowest level since last November. Investors are buying into Greece\u2019s government bonds, in the hope that the country is less likely to default on its bonds. That shows they are expecting Greece to receive its much needed \u20ac11bn of bailout funds from the eurogroup today. This has driven down the yield on 10-year Greek debt down to 7.35%, from 7.37% yesterday. A small move, but in the right direction. Yields move inversely to bond prices, and this chart shows how they soared last summer as Greece flirted with crashing out of the eurozone. The FT\u2019s Mehreen Kahn explains why this eurogroup meeting is a little different: She\u2019s also produced this graph, showing why the IMF is demanding deeper Greek debt relief (as explained earlier). European stock markets have opened in the red, as investors watch to see how today\u2019s eurogroup meeting proceeds. Germany\u2019s DAX led the declines, down 0.5% . The City is watching to see whether Greece receives funds to help it cover this summer\u2019s debt repayments, and for clashes between the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Whilst it seems almost guaranteed that Greece will receive this monetary boost, things aren\u2019t so cut and dry. The IMF is reportedly refusing to participate in this latest bailout without Greece being granted \u2018upfront and unconditional\u2019 debt relief. The issue continues to be the one major division over the treatment of Greece, and could cause a few heated debates among the Eurozone\u2019s finance ministers as they try and bridge the schism between those fiercely opposed to the idea and those willing to cut the country some debt-slack. A surge in investment helped Germany\u2019s economy to grow at the fastest pace in two years. The Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden has reported that capital investment jumped by 1.8% in January-March, with building activity surging by 2.3%. Consumers, though, were more restrained, as private consumption rose by 0.4%. And that meant Germany\u2019s GDP jumped by a punchy 0.7% in the last quarter, confirming the initial estimate two weeks ago. Economists, though, reckon growth is now slowing.... Today\u2019s eurogroup meeting begins at 3pm Brussels time, or 2pm in the UK. And the AFP newswire explains why it matters: Greece urgently needs the next tranche of bailout money to repay big loans to the European Central Bank (ECB) and IMF in July, and has already fallen behind in paying for everyday government duties and public sector wages. The outcome of the meeting remains highly uncertain, due to a row between Greece\u2019s creditors, the eurozone governments and the International Monetary Fund, over the state of the Greek economy and debt relief. Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s economics team are quite confident that Greece\u2019s creditors will agree to hand over \u20ac11bn of bailout loans today. They told clients: Today\u2019s meeting of euro area finance ministers will be focused on Greece. On Sunday, the Greek parliament passed a package of tax increases and reforms along with the contentious contingency to be deployed in the event of the 2018 budget going off track. Assuming it finds the measures acceptable, Eurogroup is expected to disperse the next tranche of programme funds (c.\u20ac11bn) which would allow Greece to meet forthcoming debt repayments and clear arrears which have built up as the review has dragged on. The focus then moves on to debt relief with the ministers set to discuss options for debt relief that have been drawn up by officials as the euro area looks to bridge the gap between it and the IMF on the sustainability of Greece\u2019s debt and allow the IMF participate in the latest Greek programme. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s nine months since Greece signed up to its third bailout, after months of torturous negotiations and deadlock climaxed in an all-night summit meeting. And today, Athens could finally pass the first review of that programme, unlocking \u20ac11bn in loans to help ward off another financial crisis. Eurozone finance ministers will gather in Brussels this lunchtime for a Eurogroup meeting. They are likely to agree that the austerity package of tax rises and reforms passed by Greek MPs on Sunday go far enough. But the relief could be short-lived. Although Greece will get a pat on the head for doing its best, there are still serious tensions between its creditors. Last night, the International Monetary Fund made a significant intervention, warning that the Eurozone\u2019s plans to give Greece some debt relief simply don\u2019t go far enough. It also insisted that Greece\u2019s fiscal targets are simply unachievable. The Fund is pushing European creditors to forgo any Greek debt payments until 2040 and to also peg the borrowing costs at 1.5%. That would be politically awkward for some eurozone members, such as Germany, as it could expose them to further Greek bills. The Fund also wants Greece\u2019s debt relief wrapped up in two years, undermining the eurozone\u2019s goal of delaying some debt relief until after the current bailout expires in 2018 (after the next German federal elections). In a clear challenge to the eurozone, the IMF declares: \u201cThe implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the programme period. \u201cProviding an upfront, unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u201d So it could be a difficult meeting.... Also coming up today... Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be in the spotlight this morning, when he testifies to parliament about the latest Quarterly Inflation Report. He\u2019ll surely face criticism from pro-Brexit MPs, over his prediction that Britain could fall into recession if it leaves the EU. The punch-up hearing starts at 10am, and City experts are predicting a lively one.... Before that, the latest UK public finance figures are released, at 9.30am, showing how much Britain had to borrow in April. DIY chain Kingfisher and building society Nationwide are both reporting result this morning. Oil giant Shell is holding its AGM. And we\u2019re also getting two pieces of German data. The second estimate of GDP in the last quarter is just being released, confirming that the economy grew by 0.7%. The ZEW institute is publishing its estimate of investor confidence at 10am.",

ANA says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the issue of the country\u2019s debt, the distance between the IMF and Germany is still great and the aim is to achieve greater convergence today. The Commission source said that after pressure by the IMF, the weight has shifted towards measures that will be taken in the short term.

IMF policy is determined by its shareholders (represented by the board), rather than its staff. Politics matter much more to the former. And there is little enthusiasm in Germany for debt relief which would be hard to sell to the country\u2019s voters.</p> <p>On the other hand the Eurogroup will be unwilling to risk a crisis that could break up the Euro in the run-up to the UK Brexit vote on 23 June and the Spanish elections on 26 June, so arguably today\u2019s meeting is the IMF\u2019s best chance to use its negotiating power to force the concessions it believes are necessary.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Cebr sees two ways the situation could develop:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. The IMF backs off and avoids confrontation with the Europeans. This would continue the \u201cextend and pretend\u201d strategy that has governed the Greek crisis since it started. This would most certainly be bad for the Greek economy, as the IMF staff\u2019s projections show. And, it could prove very damaging to Europe as it raises the likelihood of a default and Grexit further down the line \u2013 meaning that debt owed to European taxpayers (including in the UK) would never be repaid.</p> <p>2. The IMF plays hardball and poses a painful dilemma to the Europeans. This would certainly be risky. A failure to agree could lead to another Eurozone crisis, possibly a Grexit. But it is in everyone\u2019s interest that this is avoided. The debt relief itself need not take the form of an outright haircut. Some form of reprofiling, as outlined in the IMF\u2019s DSA could do the trick.

That would be politically awkward for some eurozone members, such as Germany, as it could expose them to further Greek bills.</p> <p>The Fund also wants Greece\u2019s debt relief wrapped up in two years, undermining the eurozone\u2019s goal of delaying some debt relief until after the current bailout expires in 2018 (after the next German federal elections).</p> <p>In a clear challenge to the eurozone, the IMF declares:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the programme period.</p> <p>\u201cProviding an upfront, unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs.
