      "bodyText": "British-based financial institutions must be prevented post-Brexit from selling their services in the eurozone, Emmanuel Macron, the likely progressive left candidate for the French presidency has told the Guardian. He said a ban on so-called financial passporting rights, seen as potentially highly damaging to the City of London and one of the most fraught issues in Brexit talks, \u201cshould not be seen as a technical issue but a matter of sovereignty\u201d. Financial services passporting allows banks and other financial companies, like insurers and accountancy firms, to operate across the European Union based on their authorisation in a single member state. Macron, currently the best prospect of preventing a rightwing victory in next year\u2019s presidential election, added he could not see how the UK could be granted a financial passport unless it contributed to the EU budget in the same way as Switzerland and Norway. But Macron insisted: \u201cThe financial passport is part of full access to the EU market and a precondition for that is the contribution to the EU budget. That has been the case in Norway and in Switzerland. That is clear.\u201d The proposal would be rejected outright by British Eurosceptics. He also gave no ground on free movement of EU workers, saying any concessions that allowed the UK to exclude some EU citizens would lead to the disintegration of Europe. Macron\u2019s remarks are a fresh sign that leading French politicians jockeying for the presidency are in no mood to offer concessions to the UK. Macron,39, resigned from Hollande\u2019s unpopular government last week, to set up new movement \u201cEn Marche\u201d and assemble his \u201cprogressive diagnosis\u201d of French ills ahead of a decision on a presidential bid in a couple of months. With only two years in mainstream politics, he is seen as an intriguing wild card who could thwart either Nicholas Sarkozy or the Front National of Marine le Pen. He was in London to help build a campaign war chest as large as \u20ac12m (\u00a310m) and claims 75,000 people have joined his movement since it was launched. Describing his position of third in the polls as \u201ca good beginning\u201d, he insists he can be the catalyst to disrupt and break the classical outmoded left-right political blocs. Macron\u2019s remarks on passporting run counter to claims made by both Philip Hammond, the chancellor and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, that passporting rights will be preserved. Hammond told MPs this week that any attempt by the EU to split off euro-denominated clearing would not benefit the EU, with business instead drifting to New York. Johnson has insisted the UK\u2019s financial services sector will not be stripped of the passporting rights, which exist within the single market, saying that the City of London will remain a global financial centre. But Macron said: \u201cWe have the eurozone. Could we accept to be cleared, regulated and de facto have inflows and outflows from a country that has decided to leave the EU? For me, definitely not.\u201d He added the EU could not wait months and months for the UK to start Brexit talks. \u201cProcrastination is not the right answer. We have to be extremely strict on the implementation of Brexit so there is a common approach between member states. We must avoid a sector by sector or country by country approach, and ask the UK to be clear.\u201d He also spurned the concessions on free movement as a price for access to the EU single market. \u201cIf you accept such caveats, the more you can damage the EU and it will be an open door for whoever has doubts about Europe, and so reduce the incentive to be pro-European. \u201cI was completely against the agreements signed with the UK in February; it just said \u2018OK if you give me more, then I will stay in the club\u2019. That is the beginning of the dismantlement of Europe. Now just because there is a leave vote, should we rewrite the rules of the club for one country. It\u2019s a very strange defeat for Europe if people accept that.\u201d Macron said he is trying to develop a programme on economic dynamism, married to social protection, equality of opportunity and security: \u201cI am not just a liberal movement. I come from the progressive left. I am trying to refresh and counter the system.\u201d Macron, attacking his rivals on the right on their strongest issue of national identity, described \u201cthe recent shortcut in the debate from the Nice terrorist attack to the burkini ban as crazy. A national debate on this was the best way to divide the country\u201d. He said that the middle classes were losing their sense of cultural security, but that issue could not be solved by national laws and bans. \u201cThe guy who killed people in Nice was not a Muslim. Daesh [Islamic State] want civil war in our country. They want to divide the country. But they are not in a position to break our country unless we decide to enter into this game and organise a civil war. It is crazy to think the best way to defeat Daesh is to fight Muslims. We have 5.5 million Muslims in France\u201d. But he said there was a deeper issue about unintegrated Muslims in France, especially Salafists who regarded Islamic law as superior to French secular law. He estimated that between 25\u201330% of French Muslims, close to 2 million, thought in this way, and the answer lay in enforcing French secular law. French Muslims had to become less dependent on preachers from Algiers and Morocco, he said. But he added that measures such as the burkini ban, or wearing the veil, risked disenfranchising Muslims and risking their ability to be fully aligned with the Republic.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen engineer James Liang pleaded guilty on Friday to one count of conspiracy in the company\u2019s emissions cheating scandal and has agreed to cooperate in the widening criminal investigation. This is the first criminal charge in the justice department\u2019s year-long investigation into the company\u2019s rigging of federal air pollution tests. VW previously admitted to cheating on US diesel emissions tests for several years after researchers found about 500,000 of its cars contained a software that would reduce emissions while the car was undergoing a government-administered emissions test. When the car was on the road and the cheat device was turned off, the cars emitted up to 40 times the legal limit for nitrogen oxide, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Such levels can cause respiratory problems. VW agreed to pay $15.3bn to its customers and regulators in July. The settlement did not preclude criminal charges. \u201cWe will follow the facts wherever they go and we will determine whether to bring criminal charges against any companies or individual wrongdoers,\u201d Sally Yates, US deputy attorney general, said at the time. Liang pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud against US regulators and customers and to violating the Clean Air Act. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. By cooperating with the government, he could potentially reduce his prison sentence. Liang worked at Volkswagen since 1983, beginning in Germany and then moving to the US in 2008 \u2013 two years after the government says the conspiracy began. He was part of the team of engineers working on the diesel engine at the center of the emissions tests cheating scandal. The 62-year-old appeared in Detroit federal court with a translator. His sentence is not expected to be announced until January. Liang\u2019s plea comes just a day after Vermont\u2019s attorney general, William Sorrell, said the settlement reached over the summer was inadequate and announced that Vermont was bringing its own lawsuit against VW\u2019s affiliates. \u201cThis was not a mistake. This was not a \u2018whoops\u2019 situation,\u201d Sorrell said on Thursday. \u201cThis was intentional fraud on a massive scale.\u201d The lawsuit seeks penalties for violations of Vermont\u2019s environmental and consumer laws. The company addressed the suit: \u201cTo date, Volkswagen has agreed to buy back or modify affected 2.0L TDI vehicles, establish a $2.7 bn environmental remediation trust, for which Vermont is eligible to receive $17.8m, and invest $2bn for infrastructure and awareness to increase the use of zero emission vehicles across the United States.\u201d By the end of August, about 210,000 of the 475,000 owners of affected VW cars have registered to settle with the company as part of the $15bn settlement. According to the attorneys working on the class-action suit, only 235 people have opted out of the settlement to pursue legal action on their own. \u201cVolkswagen is continuing to cooperate with the US Department of Justice. We cannot comment on this indictment,\u201d the company said in a statement. A final decision on the settlement is expected on 18 October. Recent sales figures show VW sales dropped 9% compared with last August. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "webTitle": "City banks tone down Brexit doom and gloom forecasts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Economists at major City investment banks have cancelled forecasts of a Brexit-inspired recession amid fresh data showing the economy performing more robustly than expected. Britain\u2019s trade deficit narrowed significantly in July, as exports increased by \u00a3800m to \u00a328.4bn, while imports fell by \u00a3300m to \u00a336.6bn. Construction output was also steady in July, faring better than expected a month after the Brexit vote. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are among the major banks that have now withdrawn earlier predictions that Britain is likely to enter recession. Credit Suisse had been among the most bearish immediately after the EU referendum result, forecasting a 1% contraction in the UK economy in 2017. However, in a note entitled \u201cBouncing back from Brexit\u201d, its economists now reckon the UK economy will expand by 0.5% next year. \u201cThe negative impact of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU on growth appears to have been materially less than we expected in late June \u2026 Resumed political stability, a weaker currency and the Bank of England\u2019s policy response look to have stabilised activity ... that may be sufficient for GDP to avoid a modest contraction.\u201d Other major banks had forecast a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d with GDP possibly going negative for two quarters later this year or next. Morgan Stanley initially forecast the economy going negative by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2016, but this week changed that to expectations of 0.3% growth. It said: \u201cWe\u2019ve \u2018marked-to-market\u2019 our growth forecast from a sharp slowdown and Brecession, to a lesser slowdown, which narrowly avoids a technical recession.\u201d In the days after the vote, Goldman Sachs slashed its growth forecast for the UK by 2.5% over two years. Its chief European economist, Huw Pill, said on 27 June that there would be \u201ca steep fall in activity\u201d as he predicted a \u201cmild recession by early 2017\u201d. Pill said this week: \u201cThe downturn in the UK \u2013 while still substantial \u2013 is likely to be shallower than we thought in the immediate aftermath of the referendum.\u201d Goldman Sachs is now pencilling in UK growth of 0.9% in 2017. One forecasting house, Oxford Economics, which maintains a \u201crecession watch\u201d barometer, on Friday lowered the chances of a UK recession from 30% to 25%. Prominent vote leave campaigner, Ukip\u2019s only MP Douglas Carswell, said the U-turn in recession forecasts showed how far bankers are \u201cmarinaded in groupthink\u201d. \u201cHaving hyped up the dangers of Brexit, a lot of the banks today look pretty stupid \u2013 almost as stupid as they were before the financial crisis, when they were convinced that the bubble would last. If only their bonuses were related to the accuracy of their forecasts.\u201d However, some economists are standing firm on their forecasts about the possibility of a Brexit-inspired recession, continuing to predict a significant slowdown in the UK economy in 2017, with article 50 yet to be triggered, and businesses deeply cautious about investing while negotiations over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU continue. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said: \u201cFor the year to date, economic growth in the UK has been subdued compared with recent history, and the economy has been flat since April. Given this, the probability of a technical recession before the end of 2017 remains significantly elevated.\u201d Among the more bearish of City commentators is Pantheon Macroeconomics. In a note to clients earlier this week, its chief UK economist, Samuel Tombs, said the \u201cweak July industrial production figures keep the risk of a contraction in Q3 GDP alive\u201d. He expects industrial production to decline in August and September, leave production 0.3% lower in Q3 than Q2. He added that the better trade data \u201cis emphatically not a sign that sterling\u2019s depreciation already is having beneficial effects \u2026 as it takes time for firms to renegotiate contacts and exporters to invest in new capacity. In addition, multinational companies have warned vocally that they will hold back from investing and relocating production to the UK.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Former Tesco directors charged with fraud over accounting scandal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three former senior directors at Tesco have been charged with fraud in relation to a \u00a3263m-plus accounting scandal at the supermarket chain. Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, and John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, have all been charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. A statement from the Serious Fraud Office said the alleged activity occurred between February and September 2014. The three men have been summoned to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 22 September 2016 and could face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of fraud by abuse and seven years for false accounting. The SFO said its investigation into Tesco remained ongoing and it is still possible that further individuals could face action. However, it is understood that former chief executive Philip Clarke, who was questioned under caution by the SFO, will not be charged. Tesco said in a statement that it continued to co-operate with the SFO\u2019s investigation: \u201cThe last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.\u201d The SFO launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014 after the company admitted it had overstated profits by \u00a3263m because it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers, relating to issues such as marketing costs or reaching sales targets. The scandal came to light after a whistleblower alerted the company\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who took over in September 2014. A team of forensic accountants from Deloitte then established that Tesco had artificially inflated an estimate of first-half profits given to the City in August 2014. They also found similar practices had been in place in prior reporting periods. In April 2015, Tesco said it had found a further \u00a360m in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations. Clarke, who left the company when Lewis arrived, was questioned by the SFO in relation to the scandal, which wiped millions of pounds off the supermarket\u2019s value. However, a source said he had been told he would not face charges. Rogberg and Scouler left Tesco in November 2014. The two men, and Bush, were all members of the so-called \u201cCheshunt Eight\u201d \u2013 named after the location of Tesco\u2019s Hertfordshire head office \u2013 who were suspended when the profits overstatement first came to light. Bush\u2019s legal representative issued a statement saying he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the SFO\u2019s decision to charge him. \u201cHe is not guilty and from the outset has fully co-operated with both Tesco and the SFO in their investigations. He will vigorously contest these allegations and is confident he will be cleared of any wrongdoing,\u201d said the representative in a statement. Neil O\u2019May, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said: \u201cOur client, Carl Rogberg, has always denied any wrongdoing. He will be vigorously contesting the charges to prove his innocence.\u201d Scouler joined internet provider TalkTalk as commercial director in February last year but is understood to be on sabbatical. The company said it was aware of the SFO\u2019s announcement but could not comment on \u201can ongoing investigation unrelated to TalkTalk\u201d. It emerged last week that the Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, had dropped an investigation into Laurie McIlwee, the former Tesco chief financial officer. McIlwee has been interviewed by the SFO, but only as a witness, and it is understood he is not being considered for prosecution. The FRC continues to investigate Tesco\u2019s former auditor, PwC. A third investigation by the grocery market watchdog in January led to Tesco being ordered to make significant changes in the way it deals with suppliers, after finding that the supermarket, Britain\u2019s biggest, had deliberately delayed payments to maximise profits. The SFO has said it wants to wrap up the Tesco case by the end of this year \u2013 although it did originally expect to finalise the investigation in 2015. It was rumoured to be pushing for a new type of deal that would let Tesco avoid a criminal prosecution. A \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d (DPA), which requires high court approval, would involve fines and other undertakings, if the company co-operates. City analysts have warned that the scandal could cost Tesco a \u00a3500m fine. The charges against Tesco executives come after the SFO asked the government for an extra \u00a321m to help it keep pursuing complex cases, as it struggles with a string of investigations into high-profile cases and complex financial dealings including Libor and Euribor rigging. It is currently investigating allegations concerning Tata Steel, Airbus GlaxoSmithKline, Rolls-Royce and Barclays.",

      "bodyText": "Asda is to cut prices on fresh meat and own brand essentials such as tomato ketchup and instant coffee by an average of 15% in the latest salvo in the supermarket price war. Britain\u2019s third largest grocery chain is also planning to cut prices on some wines, alongside improving the freshness of its fruit and vegetables as it tries to turnaround a dismal sales performance. The cuts on thousands of lines come after rival retailer Morrisons slashed the price of 160 products, mainly fresh meat, fruit and vegetables, by an average 12% last week. Asda will launch a new catch line \u201cThat\u2019s Better\u201d via a TV campaign which will premiere during The X Factor on ITV on Saturday. The latest campaign replaces the previous \u201cpocket more\u201d price campaign and will feature TV chef James Martin who previously fronted a series of ads to highlight the quality of food at Asda. Asda\u2019s move will fuel rumours that the chain will try to win back shoppers from the likes of Aldi and Lidl with aggressive price cuts setting off a full-scale industry price war. However, the latest round of price cuts is understood to be within Asda\u2019s \u00a31.5bn price investment budget announced earlier this year. Asda said last month that it will not increase its investment in price cuts despite a 7.5% slump in sales at established stores in the three months to 30 June, by far the worst performance of the UK\u2019s major supermarkets. The drop in sales at established stores was a much worse performance after a 5.7% fall in the previous three months and its eighth quarter of decline. Asda chief executive, Sean Clarke, who replaced long-term boss Andy Clarke this summer, said: \u201cThis week we\u2019re taking the next step in our journey to deliver better value for our customers and to improve quality. We will continue to listen to our customers and take action, with better prices for products they buy week in, week out.\u201d The major chains typically launch promotional campaigns at this time of year as they try to capitalise on families stocking up after the school holidays. But Asda is keen to improve its reputation pricing after losing its long-held position as the UK\u2019s cheapest major grocer to the German discounters. Asda has been losing market share for the past two years as Aldi and Lidl have expanded rapidly, while bigger rival Tesco has improved its prices and service. Price deflation and the rise of online shopping, combined with increasing use of small local grocery stores, have driven sales declines at all the major traditional supermarket chains.",

      "bodyText": "Fears of a post-referendum recession have receded further after a rise in exports and a better month for the struggling construction industry buoyed hopes that the UK economy has continue to grow since 23 June. As the pound tumbled following the Brexit vote, goods exports from the UK to other countries rose 3.4% between June and July. Exports to the EU, made cheaper by the pound\u2019s decline, rose 9.1%, according to official figures. It was the biggest rise in EU exports since October 2010. In a separate release the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said construction output stabilised in July, defying expectations among economists for another drop. Construction companies also enjoyed the biggest pick-up in orders for three years in the three months leading up to the referendum. The ONS said a rise in exports and drop in imports in July helped narrow the UK\u2019s goods trade deficit with the rest of the world to \u00a311.8bn in July from \u00a312.9bn in June, broadly in line with expectations in a Reuters poll of economists. There was also a narrowing in the deficit on the trade in goods and services to \u00a34.5bn from \u00a35.6bn in June. That gap is smaller thanks to the UK consistently running a surplus in trade in services \u2013 an area covering businesses such as financial and legal services \u2013 which helps make up some of the trade deficit in goods. Britain\u2019s international trade secretary, Liam Fox, said: \u201cThis data is very encouraging as it shows a major boost for exporters post referendum. However, while these statistics are highly encouraging we need to wait for further trade data to determine whether this is a clear trend.\u201d Economists have been revising up their gloomy predictions for the UK economy in recent days as news as more positive data rolls in. Consumer spending appears to have held up well and surveys suggest manufacturing and services companies enjoyed a rebound in activity in August following an initial post-referendum slump in July. Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the improved trade performance in July lifted hopes it would make a positive contribution to third-quarter GDP. \u201cDecent news for UK third-quarter growth prospects as the trade deficit narrowed markedly in July helped by improved exports, and construction output defied expectations of a drop in output,\u201d he said. Based on recent business surveys published by financial data company Markit, the economy looks likely to have grown 0.1% in the third quarter. That would represent a sharp slowdown from 0.6% in the second quarter. But Archer also noted the ONS\u2019s warning not to read too much into one month\u2019s data. In its report on trade, the ONS said: \u201cAs monthly data can often be volatile, it is unclear whether this is an impact of the depreciation of sterling and it is necessary to look at the trend over the next few months to get a clearer picture.\u201d On construction, the ONS said: \u201cThere is very little anecdotal evidence at present to suggest that the referendum has had an impact on output. You should note that we always warn against overly interpreting one month\u2019s figures.\u201d Paul Hollingsworth at the consultancy Capital Economics echoed those warnings. \u201cWhile we would caution against reading too much into any one month\u2019s figures at the best of times, this is particularly true of trade and construction figures. \u201cIndeed, the survey evidence suggests that the near-term outlook for construction is poor ... The near-term outlook for trade on the other hand looks a little better ... The upshot is that while it is still early days, the latest figures give us little reason to alter our view that the immediate impact of the vote to leave the EU will be less severe than many had anticipated.\u201d Chiming with recent business surveys showing companies are having to pay more for imported materials because of a weaker pound, the ONS trade release showed import prices grew by 3.2% on June 2016. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK\u2019s near-term trade prospects would continue to be largely determined by how much the benefits of lower sterling for exporters are offset by higher input costs. \u201cOver the long-term, the UK\u2019s trade position will be driven by how successful the government is in delivering the best possible terms of trade for the future, both with the EU and with markets further afield,\u201d added Thiru. The ONS construction figures showed output was flat in July, better than economists\u2019 expectations for a 0.8% drop. It compared with a 1.0% drop in June. Measured against a year ago, output was down 1.5%, the biggest drop since April 2013 but above expectations for a 3.2% drop in a Reuters poll of economists. Construction orders rose 8.6% in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, primarily boosted by housing. The figures will reassure Bank of England policymakers meeting to set interest rates next week that they can afford to leave policy unchanged for now. Interest rates were cut to a new record low of 0.25% in August and governor Mark Carney hinted another cut to take rates close to zero could follow before the end of the year. But economists expect the monetary policy committee to wait until November to cut again.",

      "bodyText": "Lidl\u2019s UK boss has unexpectedly left the company and is being replaced by the sales and operations director of the supermarket group\u2019s Austrian business. Ronny Gottschlich, who has run the German discounter\u2019s UK store chain for six years, departed on Thursday. It is not clear whether or not he has taken up a new post but sources said he was likely to face a year of gardening leave under any departure agreement. The exit of the 41-year-old who has spent at least 16 years at Lidl is unexpected. Gottschlich has overseen a period of dramatic growth for Lidl through clever marketing and the introduction of more upmarket products, particularly at Christmas. He is being replaced by 34-year-old German national Christian H\u00e4rtnagel. One well-informed source said Gottschlich\u2019s relations with Lidl\u2019s head office in Germany had increasingly cooled as he had adopted a series of policies radically different in culture to the parent group. The source said Gottschlich\u2019s focus on marketing and PR and the roll out of additional benefits for workers such as matching the independently verified living wage and offering a staff discount had been frowned on by head office. Meanwhile, his heavy investment in marketing and rapid sales growth had led to issues in Lidl\u2019s logistical operation and pressure on profits, according to the source. The appointment of H\u00e4rtnagel is seen as a likely attempt to bring Lidl\u2019s UK operation back in line with the rest of the business and put a lid on costs. The Austrian operation from which he joins has a more traditional Lidl culture and is seen as a training camp for executives. H\u00e4rtnagel has been with Lidl for 13 years and has worked in different management roles, including as regional director at Lidl Ireland. Most recently, he was responsible for sales and operations as a board director for Lidl Austria. In his new position, H\u00e4rtnagel will be responsible for continuing Lidl\u2019s ambitious UK investment plans with the potential for stores to more than double in number to 1,500 in the long term. In the financial year 2015, Lidl Great Britain achieved revenue of \u00a34.7bn from its 630 stores in England, Scotland and Wales. Gottschlich was unavailable for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has suffered a further blow to his reputation after the BHS scandal crossed the Atlantic thanks to Vanity Fair. The renowned US magazine has included a lengthy feature about the billionaire tycoon in its latest issue, describing him as \u201cBritain\u2019s Donald Trump\u201d on its cover. The article is headlined \u201cHow Sir Philip Green made an outrageous fortune and outraged an entire nation\u201d. It describes the furore the collapse of BHS has caused in the UK and examines Green\u2019s background, quoting supporters of the tycoon in the US but also critics such as Labour MP Frank Field. The coverage of the scandal in the US is significant because Green has expanded Topshop into large American cities and the US private equity firm Leonard Green owns 25% of the chain. BHS collapsed into administration in April, with the last of its 164 shops closing last month. The demise of the retailer led to 11,000 job losses and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green sold the department store chain for \u00a31 to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell 13 months before it collapsed. The tycoon, his family, and other BHS investors collected more than \u00a3580m from the company during the 15 years he ran it. The Vanity Fair article likens Green to Trump because of his \u201cflowing white curly locks, perma-tan, and unshakeable brashness\u201d. William D Cohan, the award-winning journalist who wrote the article, claims that Green called him while he was writing it to say: \u201cYou\u2019re on trial. Let\u2019s see how well behaved you are.\u201d The feature finishes with another quote from Green. The tycoon is quoted as telling Cohan: \u201cYou\u2019re going to find England, unfortunately, is a place where you get a lot of jealous, envious, you know, negative people. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d Green has denied putting pressure on the Pensions Regulator and dragging his feet over reaching a settlement concerning the pensions of 20,000 former BHS workers. He said on Friday he was working to resolve the problem every day and that the process took time because it was highly complex. Green said he felt compelled to deny allegations about his conduct during negotiations over a deal. He said Field, chairman of the parliamentary committee that investigated the demise of BHS, was wrong to accuse him of obstructing a settlement. \u201cMr Field suggested in the House of Commons on Wednesday there was a lack of willingness on my part to reach a settlement with regard to the pension fund. This is untrue, totally inaccurate and unhelpful in solving this issue,\u201d Green said. He also denied reports he was trying to extract concessions from the Pensions Regulator in return for injecting money into the BHS pension scheme. \u201cThere have also been suggestions in the press that I have tried to pressurise the regulator, or, as was stated on the front page of one newspaper, \u2018blackmail\u2019 it. This is wholly untrue. I am not in control of the process. I am following the process which has been set down by the regulator,\u201d he said. Green told MPs in June he would \u201csort\u201d the pension deficit, which threatens to severely reduce the pensions of the chain\u2019s former employees. He and his family took more than \u00a3400m out of BHS during 15 years of ownership. The businessman said he and his team had been cooperating with the Pensions Regulator for 17-18 months. He said he had always intended to secure a better outcome for pensioners than the Pension Protection Fund could achieve. He said: \u201cI would like to apologise sincerely to all the BHS people involved in this sorry affair. Contrary to all the coverage I have been working on this issue on a daily basis, and will continue to do so with my best efforts to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all involved as soon as possible.\u201d Green and Field have been at war over BHS for months after Field criticised Green before he attended a parliamentary inquiry into the chain\u2019s collapse. Green is battling to hold on to his knighthood, which is under review after complaints about his ownership of BHS.",

      "bodyText": "Before closing up for the day, here is a summary of events on what has been a busy day. The main event was the Eurogroup meeting in Bratislava, where eurozone finance ministers gathered to discuss Greece\u2019s progress on reform. Athens is hoping to secure a \u20ac2.8bn tranche of bailout money, but it is dependent on a programme of 15 reforms. With only two of the 15 reforms complete, ministers urged the Greek government to hurry up. The message was this: Athens still has time but it must work faster. Other developments today: In Athens itself, the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hosted fellow leaders of southern European countries, at a summit designed to find common ground and identify a unified position. A surprise fall in German exports dragged the country\u2019s trade surplus lower and raised concerns about the strength of Europe\u2019s largest economy. The weak figures from Germany, as well as a failure by the ECB to announce more eurozone stimulus on Thursday, weighed on European stocks, with all major indices down. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 is currently down 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 is off 0.8% or 58 points. In the UK, the Serious Fraud Office revealed it has charged three former senior executives of Tesco with fraud, in relation to a \u00a3263m-plus accounting scandal at the supermarket chain. There was better than expected data from the UK\u2019s construction sector, where output was flat in July. It suggested the sector was not sent into a shock downward spiral following the Brexit vote. Britain\u2019s trade deficit narrowed in July to \u00a311.8bn after exports rose but imports fell. The data suggested the sharp drop in the pound since the Brexit vote could be starting to feed through to increased exports. Sir Philip Green, founder of collapsed retailer BHS, issued a statement to reject the idea that he is dragging his feet over reaching a settlement for the firm\u2019s 20,000 pensioners. He insisted he is working on a solution every day. Thank you for reading the blog today, and for all your comments. Have a great weekend, and please join us again on Monday. AM US markets have opened down: Dow Jones: -0.5% at 18,383 S&amp;P 500: -0.7% at 2,167 Nasdaq: -0.8% at 5,218 There is a live feed on the margins of the Ecofin meeting in Bratislava, where Mario Monti, Italy\u2019s former prime minister, will soon be speaking. Wall Street is expected to open lower. North Korea\u2019s most power nuclear test to date is likely to unnerve investors. Meanwhile Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren - historically a dovish policymaker in favour of lower rates - said the Federal Reserve increasingly faces risks by failing to raise interest rates. Brent crude oil is down 2.4% at $48.77 a barrel. However, prices are still on course for the first weekly gain in three weeks after oil producers Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to work together to rebalance the markets. Prices have also been boosted over the week by the International Energy Agency, which said oil demand should finally exceed supply in the third quarter of 2016, meaning global stockpiles could start to fall. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been addressing leaders of southern European countries who are in Athens for a (Club Med) summit: Our countries have in recent years been disproportionately affected by the economic crisis... and are on the front line of migratory flows. We were on the front line of the parallel crises which have tested Europe. He added in an interview with the EurActiv news website: In such a debate, Europe\u2019s Mediterranean countries can and must raise their voice. The way to have a bigger say is to seek a common approach and common positions. Here in the UK, the Eurosceptic chairman of the Wetherspoon\u2019s pub chain has blasted Britain\u2019s establishment stance over the Brexit vote. Tim Martin, who also founded Wetherspoon\u2019s, said those predicting doom had been proved wrong: In the run-up to, and the aftermath of, the recent referendum, the overwhelming majority of FTSE 100 companies, the employers\u2019 organisation CBI, the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury, the leaders of all the main political parties and almost all representatives of British universities forecast trouble, often in lurid terms, for the economy, in the event of the leave vote. City voices such as PwC and Goldman Sachs, and the great preponderance of banks and other institutions, also leant weight to this negative view. Martin added there was no need for anxiety over a UK trade deal with the EU: \u2018Scare Story 2\u2019 is that failure to agree on a trade deal with the EU will have devastating consequences. Common sense suggests that the worst approach for the UK is to insist on the necessity of a \u2018deal\u2019 \u2013 we don\u2019t need one and the fact that EU countries sell us twice as much as we sell them creates a hugely powerful negotiating position.\u201d The party continues in Bratislava, where the Eurogroup meeting has ended but the broader Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers is underway. Top of the agenda is \u201cthe future of the EU economic policies\u201d. Ministers will assess whether the existing framework is sufficient for the current unprecedented challenges such as migration, Brexit or security challenges. Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister and Ecofin host, adds: The aim is to draw a lesson from previous mistakes and gradually design tools enabling us to avoid or at least to mitigate possible future crises. Eurogroup has published a list of its \u201cmain results\u201d, here. Specifically on Greece, it says: The institutions and the Greek minister for finance, Euclid Tsakalotos, briefed the Eurogroup on the state of play of the implementation of Greece\u2019s economic adjustment programme. The Greek authorities intend to complete the milestones, agreed in the context of the programme\u2019s first review in a timely manner. These include 15 measures relating to privatisation, energy sector reform, bank governance and the establishment of the revenue agency. The achievement of these milestones is a condition for a disbursement of \u20ac2.8 billion by the European Stability Mechanism Representatives of the institutions will be travelling to Athens shortly to prepare for the start of the second review of the programme. Markets in Europe are still in gloomy mood, with all major indices down this afternoon: FTSE 100: -0.4% at 6,832 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 10,640 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 4,520 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.6% at 17,278 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,084 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 348 Tesco has commented since the news broke that the SFO has charged three former executives with fraud. The retailer said in a statement: We note the decision of the SFO to bring a prosecution against former colleagues in relation to historic issues and acknowledge the investigation into the company is ongoing. Tesco continues to cooperate with the SFO\u2019s investigation. The last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time. As a reminder, here is the background to the Serious Fraud Office investigation into accounting practices at Tesco, which led to a \u00a3263m profit overstatement: The basic message today from eurozone finance ministers in Bratislava to Greece: i.e. HURRY UP. Please. Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office has charged three senior former executives at Tesco with fraud, as part of its investigation into an accounting scandal at the supermarket chain. The SFO said it had charged Carl Rogberg, 49, Christopher Bush, 50, and John Scouler, 48, \u201cwith one count of fraud by abuse of position, contrary to section 1 and 4 of the Fraud Act 2006 and one count of false accounting contrary to s17 Theft Act 1968.\u201d The SFO added: The alleged activity occurred between February 2014 and September 2014. The above-named individuals have been requisitioned to appear at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on 22 September 2016. The investigation into Tesco PLC remains ongoing. Bush was managing director of Tesco UK, Rogberg was UK finance director, and Scouler was UK food commercial director. All three were suspended over the scandal. More soon. Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras is meeting French president Francois Hollande, Italy\u2019s Matteo Renzi and the leaders of Portugal, Malta and Cyprus in Athens today for a four-hour conclave aimed at winning backing for a southern European pushback against austerity. Tsipras wants a joint stance on the need to ease fiscal rules with Europe\u2019s other six Mediterranean countries \u2013 Spain\u2019s acting PM, Mario Rajoy, was invited but is too busy trying to form a government at home \u2013 ahead of the EU summit on 16 September (without Britain) in Bratislava. Tsipras has long argued that the fiscal straitjacket favoured by Germany will never allow weak economies such as Greece\u2019s to recover, and said in an interview with Le Monde on Thursday that the EU stability pact \u2013 whose budget deficit limits have already been tested by France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, \u201cis not the word of God\u201d. \u201cWe want to promote a common approach among the countries \u2026 which, objectively, were the most affected by the crisis,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cIf we do not give priority to employment, Europe risks decomposition. It is true Greece has been the black sheep for quite a while. But I think our partners have understood that the Greek experiment should not be made elsewhere in Europe.\u201d German MPs warned the putative \u201cEuro-Med\u201d bloc, which will be joined for the meeting by ECB head Mario Draghi, against taking any action that might damage the EU, saying a strong and stable union was more essential than ever following the Brexit vote. Conservative MP Markus Ferber told newspaper Die Welt he was concerned the southern countries could form a \u201ccoalition of redistributors\u201d that would threaten Europe\u2019s financial stability: \u201cAfter Britain\u2019s departure, the \u2018Club Med\u2019 will have a blocking minority that can prevent all kinds of laws that it does not like,\u201d he said. Away from Bratislava and in Athens itself, the Greek Prime Minister is hosting a meeting of leaders from Europe\u2019s other Mediterranean countries, aimed at finding common ground. Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner for economic and financial affairs is giving a bit more detail on Greek reforms. He says that ministers are satisfied that two out of 15 agreed \u2018milestones\u2019 have been achieved by Greece: The 13 others are not on track or underway. There is progress, but this needs to be completed. [We] insist that the job is done, it is necessary. And the Greek authorities must know that we are waiting for them, for the matter of trust and efficiency. It is true too that we have lost some time, but I think we must balance that judgement by other considerations. The first one is that we can see an acceleration of work in the last days. The second point of balance is that it is still feasible to reach the completion of the milestones on time, and that is clearly what [the Greek finance minister] Euclid Tsakalotos said in the meeting. So we have to tell them clearly that they need to stick to their commitments and be really demanding, but at the same time let\u2019s not dramatise. We are still in capacity to reach this agreement. We all want it, there is a political will. The European Central Bank\u2019s Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 is pitching in. He is going over the central bank\u2019s decision on Thursday not to introduce more monetary stimulus at this time. [Nothing new here.] Here is the official statement from the Eurogroup meeting, which is focused on spending reviews and public finances across eurozone countries. Dijsselbloem says there was a general signal from ministers that Greece must speed up progress on reforms: Today we discussed first of all the state of affairs in Greece. We took stock of the progress. There are number of milestones still pending to fully complete the first review and coupled with those are further disbursements. So we took stock of those and heard a little about the issues at stake. There was a general feeling that we must not lose time - the time scale that was drawn up and agreed in May 2016 - so more progress is needed and we strongly encouraged the Greek government as a whole to speed up the implementation of the remaining milestones. That of course could also help in ensuring a timely start and completion of the second review. The work on that will have to start very soon also. Against this background, we were happy to hear from our Greek colleague his commitment to do that work very quickly. We will be following that closely in the coming weeks. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem kicks off by saying there are positive signs in the eurozone: There are many challenges ahead. The economic recovery is progressing, growth returned to almost all of our countries and there are positive signs throughout the eurozone. The Eurogroup press conference is coming up here... The proportion of British people who think the Bank of England will raise interest rates over the next year has fallen to a record low. The Bank said 21% of people surveyed in August expected it to raise interest rates in the next 12 months, down sharply from 41% in May. It was the lowest level since the survey began in 1999. Mark Carney and his colleagues on the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee cut rates to a record low of 0.25% on 4 August, in a bid to limit the potential negative impact of the Brexit vote. The MPC has signalled more action will follow if the economic data deems it necessary. The poll of 2,177 people aged 16 and over was conducted on 8-9 August, a few days after the rate cut. Sir Philip Green, the former owner of collapsed retailer BHS, has denied dragging his feet over reaching a settlement for the firm\u2019s 20,000 pensioners. He has also denied putting pressure on the Pensions Regulator over a potential deal. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 a little more than a year before it collapsed in April, leaving an estimated pensions black hole of \u00a3571m. Green has issued a statement today, in response to allegations by Frank Field MP, chairman of the work and pensions committee. Green said: Mr Field suggested in the House of Commons on Wednesday there was a lack of willingness on my part to reach a settlement with regard to the pension fund. This is untrue, totally inaccurate and unhelpful in solving this issue. There have also been suggestions in the press that I have tried to pressurise the regulator, or, as was stated on the front page of one newspaper, \u2018blackmail\u2019 it. This is wholly untrue. I am not in control of the process. I am following the process which has been set down by the regulator. I would like to apologise sincerely to all the BHS people involved in this sorry affair. Contrary to all the coverage I have been working on this issue on a daily basis, and will continue to do so with my best efforts to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all involved as soon as possible. Sticking with Dijsselbloem, he has given the best soundbite on Greece from Bratislava so far today: The pressure is back on. The summer is over. Pack up the camping gear, get back to work. The deal was that Greece would implement 15 reforms in September - including privatisation plans and energy sector changes - in exchange for a final \u20ac2.8bn tranche of emergency funding. Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, said there was still time for Greece to come good on its side of the bargain: Today is 9 September, so there is still time for Greece. It\u2019s not new that, with Greece, we see the implementation of the measures that have been agreed towards the final phase of the agreed time frame. Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to glean more on the mood of the meeting at the press conference which is due to start in a about 20 minutes or so. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the group of eurozone finance ministers has offered some thoughts on the Brexit thoughts. Speaking in Bratislava before ministers got down to business on Greek bailout talks, he said Britain must make up its mind on the start of formal divorce proceedings: For the Brexit process, it really is up to the British to make up their minds, in terms of when to start and how to get it on the road. I think, in the end, it will be the British economy that is damaged most, which I don\u2019t hope for but, I mean, this is my concern. Here is our full story on Sports Direct, whose biggest investors have met with the board and are demanding an independent review of working practices and governance: Construction output was steady in July, faring better than expected a month after the Brexit vote. A zero rise in output in July followed a 1% drop in June, easily beating expectations of a 0.8% fall. It lowered the annual rate of contraction in output to 1.5% from 2.2% in June. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the construction figures form the ONS are the latest to suggest the economy held up better than expected following the EU referendum: The latest post-referendum official figures indicated that the construction sector held up better than expected in July, and the trade deficit narrowed, continuing the recent trend of relatively upbeat data. The upshot is that while it is still early days, the latest figures give us little reason to alter our view that the immediate impact of the vote to leave the EU will be less severe than many had anticipated. Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit narrowed to \u00a311.8bn in July, down \u00a31.2bn compared with a year earlier. Exports increased by \u00a3800m to \u00a328.4bn, while imports fell \u00a3300m to \u00a336.6bn. The figures from the Office for National Statistics were roughly in line with expectations. This is the first full month of trade data since the Brexit vote on 23 June sent the pound sharply lower. Given a weaker pound makes British goods cheaper abroad, are we seeing a boost in these numbers? Figures published in Germany earlier revealed a surprise fall in exports in July, brining down the country\u2019s trade surplus. Exports fell by 2.6% over the month, following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase in June. It was the sharpest fall in almost and year, and well below economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.25% increase. Imports also fell unexpectedly, by 0.7%. Economists had predicted a 0.8% rise. It brought Germany\u2019s trade surplus down to \u20ac19.4bn in July from \u20ac21.4bn in June. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist for Germany and Austria, said the figures would add to concerns about growth in Europe\u2019s largest economy: Forget July. The month of July was clearly not a good month for Germany. Not only did July see the German national soccer team leave the European Championships after the semi-final, it saw industrial and trade data taking a deep nosedive. Today\u2019s data confirm the picture already painted by earlier industrial data: the former powerful engine of the German economy \u2013industry \u2013 is stuttering. Either the entire industry took an early and long summer break, or Brexit and a general weakness in Germany\u2019s main export partners left another mark on the economy. A further cooling of the economy in the months ahead should give more support to just-started discussions about fiscal stimulus. Right now, the discussions only focus on minor tax cuts but they could easily grow into a general debate on more fiscal support for investment to increase the German economy\u2019s potential growth rate. The pound is up against both the dollar and the euro this morning, as we await the latest official UK data on trade and construction. The pound is up just a touch (0.02%) against the dollar at $1.3298, and 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.273. Data out shortly is expected to show Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world was \u00a311.75bn in July. The government will be hoping that a weaker pound since the Brexit vote will drive exports up in the coming months and the trade deficit down. Construction data is expected to show that output on Britain\u2019s building sites fell 0.8% in July, following a 0.9% drop in June. There will be a press conference from Bratislava at 12pm local time (11am UK time). There should be a live stream here. The heat is on Athens: Investors are in a downbeat mood this morning, disappointed by Mario Draghi who failed to unleash any further monetary ammunition on Thursday. The FTSE 100 is down 13 points or 0.2%. FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,846 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 10,644 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 4,533 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 17,361 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 9,113 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 348 Sports Direct, the under pressure retailer founded by Mike Ashley, has met with shareholder pressure group the Investor Forum about a way forward. The company is facing intense scrutiny over poor working practices and corporate governance, culminating on Wednesday with a fiery annual meeting. An emphatic 53% of independent investors voted against the re-election of chairman Keith Hellawell, who claimed he could regain their trust over the next 12 months but resign if he failed. The Investor Forum has now revealed that following the AGM it chaired a meeting between major shareholders and the Sports Direct board, \u201cto discuss how trust can be re-built in the company and board.\u201d Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Investor Forum: Independent shareholders have sent a clear message to the Board of Sports Direct through their votes at the AGM and in their public statements. We are encouraged by Sports Direct\u2019s recent open approach, publishing the working practices report and hosting an open day. These, however, are only the first steps in a long journey towards rebuilding trust and shareholder value. Our focus in the coming weeks will be on identifying key milestones to achieve this goal and, in particular, reaching agreement regarding the specific nature, remit and timing of the 360 and governance reviews. Facilitating a constructive dialogue on this will take on heightened importance over the next three months before the General Meeting required to re-elect the Chairman. The agenda for today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting can be found here. Here is the outline for discussion on Greece: Greece \u2013 state of play The Eurogroup will discuss the state of play of the macroeconomic adjustment programme to Greece. In particular, the Ministers are expected to be informed by the institutions and the Greek authorities on the implementation of the milestones and progress with arrears clearance, as defined in the Eurogroup statement on Greece of 25 May, as well as the next steps for the second review. The Eurogroup statement of 25 May indicates that the additional disbursement after the summer under the second tranche will be subject to the completion of milestones related to privatization, including the new Privatization and Investment Fund, bank governance, revenue agency and energy sector reforms as well as progress in clearing of net arrears. The tough words have begun in Bratislava, with a declaration Austria\u2019s finance minister Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling that Athens has not fulfilled its side of the bargain: Oil prices are also likely to influence equities this morning according to the Jasper Lawler from CMC Markets: Stocks in Europe look set for a lower open as investors continue to digest disappointment from the latest ECB meeting while a big drawdown in US oil inventories has sent Brent crude back towards $50 per barrel. Oil prices gained nearly 5% in 24 hours in response to American Petroleum Institute and Department of Energy inventory weekly figures. Storms Gaston and Hermene prevented imports coming in from Africa and the Middle East on the East Coast and its estimated US oil output may have dropped over 10% as rigs closed down. The huge two-day rebound in oil prices has been to a large extent ignored by stock markets and could play a bigger role on Friday, whether there is less corporate and economic data. Brent crude is down 1.2% at the moment however, at $49.35 a barrel. European markets are expected to open lower this morning. Investors were disappointed that Mario Draghi and his colleagues at the European Central Bank failed to announce more stimulus for the eurozone economy when they met yesterday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on Greece again as eurozone finance ministers meet to discuss whether or not to hand over to Athens the next trance of emergency funding. Back in May, ministers agreed a \u20ac10.3bn funding package for Greece, with \u20ac7.5bn handed over immediately. Today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting in Bratislava will be focused on whether or not to release the remaining \u20ac2.8bn. This is not necessarily going to be straightforward, given recent reports that Athens has met only two of the 15 reform measures agreed on with its eurozone partners.

Tim Martin took aim at David Cameron, FTSE 100 chief executives, the governor of the Bank of England, City economists and Goldman Sachs in a tirade accompanying the pub chain\u2019s annual results. He also disparaged the CBI, the International Monetary Fund and the OECD. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of FTSE 100 companies, the employers\u2019 organisation CBI, the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury, the leaders of all the main political parties and almost all representatives of British universities forecast trouble, often in lurid terms, for the economy in the event of the leave vote,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWhat I call \u2018scare story one\u2019 was that the act of voting leave would cause an immediate and profound downturn in the economy, and that\u2019s been proved to be entirely false.\u201d He said Wetherspoon\u2019s trading had improved since the end of its financial year and suggested that this was caused by sporting success, better weather and the referendum result. Pre-tax profit, excluding one-off items, for the year to 24 July rose by 3.6% to \u00a380.6m, on sales that increased by 5.4%. Martin criticised Cameron and the former chancellor George Osborne for predicting that families would eventually be \u00a34,300 worse off, mortgage rates would rise and house prices would fall after a vote for Brexit. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, supported these claims \u201cin terms\u201d, he said. Martin, a longstanding critic of the EU, attacked Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, for saying it was a given that economists were correct in predicting malign consequences from a vote to leave. \u201cThis is a strange argument to advance, since consensus forecasts from economists, who generally failed to forecast the last recession or the catastrophic flaws of the euro, are almost always delusional,\u201d he said. Economic surveys since the referendum on 23 June have been mixed. A report showing a recovery in the services industry during August followed a rebound for manufacturing and high street spending. But economists have said the UK could still slip into recession and have warned that higher prices and slowing investment will eventually take their toll. Martin said: \u201cThey [the experts] didn\u2019t say \u2018in the long run\u2019. The Treasury said interest rates would immediately go up and that it would cause so much uncertainty that unemployment would go up, and there would be an immediate and severe shock. There is only one thing that is definitely true and that is democracy is better for your economy.\u201d Rival pub operator and brewer Greene King was warier about the economy than Martin. In a trading update, the company said consumer confidence and leisure spending were threatened by the referendum result \u201cand we are alert to a potentially tougher trading environment ahead\u201d. Having been proved wrong about the damaging effects of a Brexit vote, Martin said, the establishment was raising unnecessary fears about whether Britain could do a trade deal with the EU and that trade would continue with or without a formal agreement. \u201c\u2018Scare story two\u2019 is that if we don\u2019t join the single market, we are in deep trouble, and that is across mainstream economists. That is also in my view absolute twaddle,\u201d he said.",

In 2008 he oversaw Lloyds TSB\u2019s rescue of HBOS to form Lloyds Banking Group and a government bailout that left taxpayers owning 43% of the company.</p> <p>Lloyds was the biggest seller of payment protection insurance (PPI) during Daniels\u2019s tenure. The bank has had to set aside more than \u00a316bn to compensate buyers of the product, which was often sold without the buyer\u2019s knowledge and failed to pay out. </p> <p>Three years ago Lloyds<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/mar/25/lloyds-clawback-eric-daniels-bonus\"> claimed back most of Daniels\u2019s \u00a31.45m bonus for 2010, leaving him with \u00a3300,000, as the bill for PPI claims mounted</a>. Daniels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/14/former-lloyds-boss-eric-daniels-defends-ppi\">told MPs in 2013 he thought Lloyds was on \u201cthe side of the angels\u201d on PPI</a> and that most of the policies his bank sold to cover people during illness or unemployment were sold correctly.</p> <p>Daniels, who likes to wear coloured shirts with white collars and cuffs, was briefly shortlisted in 2011 to be chairman of the insurer Aviva <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/247fc648-532c-11e0-86e6-00144feab49a\">but was reportedly dropped after opposition from investors unhappy about the HBOS takeover</a>.

      "bodyText": "Eric Daniels, who ran Lloyds TSB during the financial crisis and presided over a \u00a316bn mis-selling scandal, has emerged as a director of the peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle. Daniels, 65, retired from Lloyds in 2011 after eight years in charge of Britain\u2019s biggest retail bank. In 2008 he oversaw Lloyds TSB\u2019s rescue of HBOS to form Lloyds Banking Group and a government bailout that left taxpayers owning 43% of the company. Lloyds was the biggest seller of payment protection insurance (PPI) during Daniels\u2019s tenure. The bank has had to set aside more than \u00a316bn to compensate buyers of the product, which was often sold without the buyer\u2019s knowledge and failed to pay out. Three years ago Lloyds claimed back most of Daniels\u2019s \u00a31.45m bonus for 2010, leaving him with \u00a3300,000, as the bill for PPI claims mounted. Daniels told MPs in 2013 he thought Lloyds was on \u201cthe side of the angels\u201d on PPI and that most of the policies his bank sold to cover people during illness or unemployment were sold correctly. Daniels, who likes to wear coloured shirts with white collars and cuffs, was briefly shortlisted in 2011 to be chairman of the insurer Aviva but was reportedly dropped after opposition from investors unhappy about the HBOS takeover. He will serve on Funding Circle\u2019s risk and audit committees, he told Bloomberg News, which was first to report his appointment. \u201cThere has been a sea change in traditional banking,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cNew capital and risk-weighting requirements have turned the industry upside down, and it\u2019s become difficult for institutions to continue lending the way they did before. That\u2019s left an opening, and Funding Circle has deftly taken advantage of that.\u201d Funding Circle is one of the biggest of the peer-to-peer lenders that have sprung up with the avowed purpose of taking business from the big banks. It specialises in funding businesses ranging from chocolate makers to small housebuilders and has arranged $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) of loans mainly in the UK but also in the US and Europe. Peer-to-peer lenders match borrowers with lenders online, promising higher rates for lenders than bank savings and cheaper deals for borrowers. They flourished after the financial crisis triggered a period of low interest rates and reluctance by some banks to lend to small businesses. The appointment of Daniels, a former mainstream banker, appears at odds with peer-to-peer lenders\u2019 claims to be shaking up the lending market with new levels of transparency.

The announcement confirms widespread rumours about the future of Street, who has headed the department store for nine years and spent more than 30 years at its parent group, the John Lewis Partnership. Street, who is from the West Midlands and is chair of the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership (GBSLEP), the body tasked with driving economic growth in the region, has yet to be formally selected by the local Conservative party. Selection will be decided on 29 September by Tory members of the local devolved authority before the party conference on 2 October, where it has been reported that Street is to welcome the prime minister to Birmingham. John Lewis said: \u201cShould Andy be successful in his application, he has agreed with the chairman that he should step down from his role and a further announcement will be made to confirm the succession plan for the future leadership of the John Lewis brand.\u201d Resigning will be a big gamble for Street as the mayoral election next May and will be a tough fight in the Labour heartland. If selected as the Tory party candidate, he will be up against Labour Si\u00f4n Simon, MEP for the West Midlands and a former Birmingham MP. Frontrunners to replace Street at John Lewis are retail director Mark Lewis, a former managing director of eBay UK who joined to lead the group\u2019s online business in 2013, and commercial director Paula Nickolds, who has worked at John Lewis since 1994. Street, who was educated at King Edward\u2019s school in Birmingham, is an Oxford graduate, and was a member of the prime minister\u2019s business advisory group. He is also vice chairman of Performances Birmingham, which is responsible for running the city\u2019s symphony and town halls. Steve Hollis, deputy chair of GBSLEP, said Street had used his John Lewis experience to drive transformation in the region. \u201cIt has been a privilege to work with Andy and witness the Greater Birmingham Solihull economy move from being the laggard in the UK five years ago to now being the leader across many measures,\u201d he said. Street\u2019s political ambitions come after the former managing director of Waitrose, Mark Price, left the supermarket and became minister for trade and investment.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct shareholders have told founder Mike Ashley and chairman Keith Hellawell they still want a fully independent review of working practices and governance after City investors voted for Hellawell\u2019s removal. At a summit on Wednesday after Sports Direct\u2019s fraught annual general meeting, the Investor Forum, which represents the company\u2019s institutional shareholders, told the board a further review being carried out by a law firm linked to the company was not independent enough. Phineas Glover, senior adviser at the Investor Forum, said the meeting was the most constructive shareholders had held with Hellawell and Ashley. He added that Hellawell appeared to understand the gravity of the situation, but he said independent shareholders, who voted on Wednesday against Hellawell\u2019s reappointment, wanted results and that an independent review of the company was needed. Referring to the likelihood that a further vote on Hellawell will be held once a three-month embargo expires, in which Ashley can use his 55% stake to overrule independent investors, he said: \u201cThe next three months are very crucial, not least for the business but for Keith as well. We have committed to work with Keith and he has committed to work with us and we have expectations from that and we will see where we get to. If you have received [more than] 50% opposition from your independent shareholders it\u2019s a very clear message and we expect it to be heeded.\u201d Legal &amp; General, one of the UK\u2019s most powerful investment firms, had called for Hellawell\u2019s immediate resignation after Wednesday\u2019s vote but Ashley asked for 12 months to turn the business around. The Investor Forum was set up in 2014 to represent investors with \u00a3850bn invested in UK shares to push for change at companies. It usually operates behind the scenes but it broke cover last month by publicly criticising Sports Direct and calling for an independent report into the company. Glover said Ashley, who controls Sports Direct from his position as executive deputy chairman, attended the Investor Forum meeting and that he also seemed to understand the need for reform after revelations about the company battered its reputation and share price. \u201cThere was a very open exchange of views and it was very helpful. There is a much better understanding having that direct dialogue with the whole board.\u201d Sports Direct published a report of working practices on Tuesday in which the company accepted it had not treated employees properly. It followed months of pressure after the Guardian revealed a climate of fear at Sports Direct\u2019s giant warehouse in Derbyshire, which MPs likened to a Victorian workhouse. The report was compiled by RPC, a law firm that has worked extensively for Sports Direct and Ashley in the past. In an effort to assuage shareholders, Sports Direct said RPC would conduct a further review, taking in corporate governance, that would report in the next year. At the meeting on Wednesday, shareholders told the board RPC was not independent enough to carry out the review alone and that they wanted a report much earlier. A trade union resolution at the AGM calling for an independent review received strong backing from independent shareholders. Glover said options for an independent review included using a different law firm or having RPC\u2019s report overseen by an expert acceptable to shareholders. The Investor Forum did not disclose which shareholders were at the meeting with the board but Standard Life, Legal &amp; General and Aviva Investors, three of the biggest owners of UK shares, were in attendance. Hellawell, the former chief constable of West Yorkshire police, said on the day of the AGM he would prove to his opponents that he had a contribution to make to Sports Direct. He said he would leave in a year if independent shareholders still wanted him to go. Shareholders have been pressing for better corporate governance at Sports Direct for the past few years as suspicions increased that Hellawell and other non-executive directors did not keep a check on Ashley\u2019s dominance. The Investor Forum said shareholders had jointly held eight meetings with Sports Direct since March 2014. Glover said: \u201cOver the last three or four years there has been a sense that we are making progress but \u2026 the changes, we found, were not enough or nowhere near what was expected to improve the overall corporate governance framework of the company.\u201d",
