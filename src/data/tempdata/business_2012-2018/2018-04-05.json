      "bodyText": "And finally.... the closing bell of Wall Street has just been rung, ending a positive day on the markets. The Dow was up 1% at the close, up 242 point, meaning it has posted a three-day winning streak. That follows a strong session on the other side of the Atlantic: Commodity prices have also recovered some ground; soybeans are up 1.5% today while corn gained 2.3%. That may show that the soothing words from US officials, such as Larry Kudlow, is working. Or we might be reading too much into it! Pinning a narrative on the market action is tempting, but not always accurate.... We\u2019ll be back tomorrow to track whether the recovery continues, or stumbles. Goodnight! GW Not so fast, markets! The Financial Times is reporting that China could launch a legal challenge to America\u2019s proposed tariffs, at the World Trade Organisation. The FT says: Beijing signalled it was willing to escalate its fight with Donald Trump over his plan for anti-China tariffs on Thursday by launching a legal challenge against Washington\u2019s newly proposed duties on more than 1,300 Chinese products. The Chinese move to open a World Trade Organization case came despite efforts by White House officials to ease fears of a looming trade war and is likely to feed doubts over the ability of the world\u2019s two largest economies to reach an amicable settlement. Beijing said the US\u2019s proposed tariffs, unveiled earlier this week, represented a \u201cserious violation\u201d of global trading rules because they discriminated against Chinese goods and violated the tariff limits Washington had made commitments to.... Investors don\u2019t seem too alarmed, though; the Dow is up almost 1% still, with the S&amp;P 500 0.6% higher in late trading. Here\u2019s a taste of the New York stock exchange today, as traders rode the market higher: With 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow is up 0.7% - or 173 points - on Wall Street. Larry Kudlow has certainly hit the ground running, since joining the White House as National Economic Council Director. During his tour of media outlets, the former Reagan adviser even told Fox that US growth could hit the heady heights of 5%. CNBC has the details: Asked whether the economy could post 5 percent annual GDP as it recovers from the financial recession, Kudlow said \u201cwe could.\u201d \u201cWill we get 5 percent forever? No. But there\u2019s a catch up here,\u201d Kudlow told Fox Business Network. \u201cAny economist will show you the long-term trend line for GDP versus the actual now: We\u2019re like several trillion dollars below where we should be based on the long-term trend lines. I want to get back to that full potential.\u201d Frankly, that seems awfully ambitious. And if the US economy did rattle along at such a heady pace, the Federal Reserve would surely raise interest rates promptly for fear of inflation surging. Time will tell.... The New York stock market is extending its gains. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 1% today at 24,495, a gain of 231 points. Quite a recovery from yesterday\u2019s tariff-fuelled panic: Today\u2019s rally was the FTSE 100\u2019s best day since the aftermath of the EU referendum, says Marketwatch: U.K. stocks on Thursday logged the best one-session gain in nearly two years as investors grew hopeful that negotiations would lead the U.S. and China to de-escalate brewing trade tensions. The FTSE 100 index rose 2.4% to 7,199.50, marking its best daily advance since June 29, 2016, a rally that occurred in the aftermath of the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. Here are the details of how the European markets surged to a three-week high tonight: UK\u2019s FTSE 100: up 165 points at 7,199.50, a gain of 2.35% Germany\u2019s DAX: up 347 points at 12,305, a gain of 29% France\u2019s CAC 40: up 134 points at 5,276.6, a gain of 2.6% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: up 526 points at 22,969, a gain of 2.35% Fiona Cincotta of City Index says a relief rally swept the markets today: Markets across the globe continued to bounce back as optimism increases that the US and China are willing to work towards avoiding an all-out trade war. The FTSE was led 169 point higher by tech stocks and the heavyweight commodity sector; the miners gaining support from higher metal prices, on hopes that China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of metals won\u2019t be entering a trade war with the world\u2019s largest economy. Boom! European market stock have roared back today, as traders wager that trade war fears have been overblown. In London the FTSE gained over 2%, boosting its value by some \u00a342bn. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says buyers came back with a vengeance on Thursday. It was a complete one-eighty from Wednesday\u2019s rout. The bounce-back attributed to White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow easing trade war fears has gained some traction. The DAX index hit a 2-week high while the FTSE 100 reached its highest in 3-weeks. In this volatile environment, there is still scope to blind-sided again by the next official comment or Tweet about US-China trade negotiations. Markets, eh? Shares in major US exporters are rallying today, as Larry Kudlow\u2019s comments help to reassure investors. The Dow is now up 200 points, or 0.8%. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 1.8%, or 120-odd points. Just in: Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s chief economic advisor, has played down the risks of a trade war. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Kudlow argues that the spat with China could have a happy ending - if it forces Beijing to play fairly. Ding Ding! Shares are rising on the New York stock market, on hopes that a trade war between the US and China can be avoided. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 165 points, or 0.7%, to 24428. That extends yesterday\u2019s late rally. The US president has found some time in his busy schedule to correct the Washington Post\u2019s headlines: Sports fans keen to watch the Winter Olympics helped to drive America\u2019s trade deficit to a nine-year high. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that service imports rose by $1.1bn in February, to $47.8bn. That includes a $1.0bn increase in charges for the use of intellectual property, which \u201creflects payments for the rights to broadcast the 2018 Winter Olympic Games\u201d. That payment was made by NBC, which splashed out up $963 million for the rights to air the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. It\u2019s not clear that the money was well-spent. Viewing figures were 7% lower than for Sochi in 2014, making the 2018 Winter Olympics the least-watched on record. Newsflash: America\u2019s trade gap has widened to its highest level in almost a decade. The difference between US imports and exports hit $57.6bn in February, the biggest gap since October 2008, up from $56.7bn in January. Exports rose by 1.7% to $204.4bn, but imports also increased by 1.7% to $262.0bn. That means Donald Trump hasn\u2019t, yet, made any progress in reducing America\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world. The trade gap with China did narrow -- possibly due to the impact of the lunar New Year? -- but the deficit with Mexico widened. Reuters has more details: The deficit has now risen for six straight months. The goods trade deficit was the highest since July 2008 and the surplus on services was the lowest since December 2012. Part of the rise in the trade deficit in February reflected commodity price increases. The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China fell 18.6% to $29.3 billion. The deficit with Mexico surged 46.6% in February. The president may not be best pleased.... The number of new vans bought in the UK fell by 5.6% in March. The SMMT has reported that UK new van registrations dropped to 59,764 last month, from 63,316 a year ago. That\u2019s a smaller decline than for cars, but it could also be a sign of economic uncertainty - and that March\u2019s bad weather curbed spending. They add: Uplift in demand for smaller vans (1.8%) and pickups (6.8%) fails to offset declines for medium (-2.0%) and heavier (-10.5%) models. More than 94,000 new van registrations in Q1 \u2013 dropping -3.7% compared to the same period in 2017. SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says: \u201cA decline in the important plate change month of March is a concern and we need the right economic conditions to restore market stability and encourage buyers to invest in new commercial vehicles. The new van market is a key barometer of business confidence and while uncertainty remains, a degree of fluctuation in demand is to be expected this year. The SMMT\u2019s rolling tally of van sales suggests demand has been cooling since the EU referendum: Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada suspect that UK economy growth could have halved in the last quarter. They\u2019ve crunched through today\u2019s service sector PMI report, as well as the manufacturing and construction reports earlier this week. The upshot - growth in the first three months of 2018 won\u2019t match the 0.4% recorded in October-December 2017. Sam Hill of RBC explains: The UK IHS Markit / CIPS Composite PMI dropped to 52.5 in March, a full two points lower than the previous month, on account of a large drop in the service sector survey. Whilst the manufacturing sector survey didn\u2019t contain too much evidence of weather-related disruption to activity, widespread snow early in March did appear to account for a good deal of the weakness in the construction and service sectors. The result is that our PMI-based GDP indicator now suggests Q1 GDP growth will be just 0.2% q/q, rather than 0.3% q/q previously. Given the margin for error in the indicator, and the relatively brief period of weather-related disruption we maintain our forecast of 0.3% q/q for Q1 GDP for the time being. Newsflash: Another sign that China and the US could avoid a trade war: Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, has warned American politicians not to drive the world economy into a new protectionist era. In his annual letter to shareholder, Dimon gives a clear signal to Donald Trump not to undermine international institutions including NATO and the World Trade Organisations. Such groups, Dimon points out, underpin the world order and allows democratic principles such as free speech and equality to spread. As he puts it: Reversing the interconnectedness built by our post-World War II institutions is neither desirable nor feasible. As a nation, we cannot isolate ourselves any more than we can stem the ocean\u2019s tide. The international system provides agreed-upon rules of the road \u2013 and mechanisms for enforcing them. It serves as the basis upon which we can insist on fairer trade practices from competitors and adequate burden-sharing from allies. It is the means by which we can continue to improve people\u2019s lives and livelihoods. The system, built at great sacrifice, continues to serve our interests. It should be preserved and defended \u2013 ideally under strong U.S. leadership. [President Trump, of course, has criticised fellow NATO members for not spending enough on defence] And on trade, Dimon writes that US does have some legitimate issues with China. China has realized significant economic and employment gains since joining the WTO in 2001. China was expected to continue on an aggressive path of opening up its economy, but this has happened at a much slower pace than most nations expected. Now, more than 16 years later, it has the second-largest economy in the world and is home to 20% of the Fortune 500 companies, yet it still considers itself a \u201cdeveloping\u201d nation that should not be subject to the same WTO standards as the United States and other \u201cdeveloped\u201d countries. However, simply imposing new tariffs on its goods in a unilateral fashion is not the answer. Instead, Dimon proposes a five-point plan: The United States should define very clearly, and in detail, what it wants from China. The United States should lay out a distinct timeline \u2013 and determine what the reaction would be if it is not met. The United States should listen closely to China about any legitimate complaints it may have. This should be done in partnership with our largest allies, particularly Japan and Europe. The United States should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fix the parts considered unfair. The TPP could be an excellent economic and strategic agreement between America and its allies, particularly Asia. This is not against China: The country could at some point be offered the opportunity to enter the TPP if it demonstrates a willingness to meet its standards, which would improve upon the rules-based global trading system under American leadership. Back in the markets, mining companies are helping to drive the London stock market higher. Resource giants such as Glencore, Anglo American and Antifagasta are among the top risers on the FTSE 100. Mining companies would all suffer from a global trade war, as slower growth would hit demand for coal, iron ore, copper, aluminium. So today\u2019s rally suggests that the City is hopeful that a full-blown protectionist clash can be avoided. Lena Komileva of (g+)economics says there have been encouraging noises from officials in China and the US, following the news yesterday that both sides could enforce tariffs on $50bn of imports. It is encouraging that the Chinese side has offered antidote to the escalation of language coming from the new While House China hawks around Trump: The US Chinese ambassador said that \u201cnegotiation would still be our preference but it takes two to tango\u201d. Clearly, the ground is set for an intensive round of talks stretching over the next half year, into the US midterm elections on 6 November, during which time markets will face continued headline risk, but trade wars is not the endgame on the radar. But still..... investors should be prepared for significant market volatility this year, she adds: This may not be a trade war, but China and the US are caught in a long term economic cold war for global market share in new technologies. Geopolitical risk, and the market fragmentation that comes with it, is not a transitory wave but a climate sea change. Breaking away from the car sales figures...we have evidence that the UK economy slowed in March as wintery weather gripped Britain. Activity in the dominant UK service sector slowed last month, growing at its slowest rate since July 2016. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, whose UK service sector PMI fell to just 51.7 last month from 54.5 in February (any reading over 50 shows growth). Companies reported that bad weather disrupted business operations, and contributed to subdued consumer spending in March. Britain suffered some of its worst weather in years last month; a bitter cold spell, heavy snow and dangerous ice caused transport disruption and forced thousands of schools to close. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says March\u2019s PMI surveys suggest the economy weakened: \u201cThe UK economy iced up in March, suffering the weakest increase in business activity since the Brexit vote amid widespread disruptions caused by some of the heaviest snowfall in years. As a result, first quarter economic growth will likely have been adversely affected. The PMI surveys collectively signal a quarterly GDP growth rate of just under 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the fourth quarter, albeit with the rate of growth sliding to just 0.15% in March alone. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees: With construction activity also being hit markedly, the March purchasing managers\u2019 surveys overall fuel belief that the severe weather may well have caused GDP growth to dip to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2018. Alex Buttle, director of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says the auto industry is failing to persuade drivers to buy new, less-polluting, diesel cars: \u201cWhat a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago the car industry was celebrating record new car sales, today, it\u2019s facing something of a crisis with no clear plans to reverse its fortunes. \u201cThe car industry has tried but failed to promote the benefits of Euro 6 diesel cars without government support and sales figures are telling. Consumers aren\u2019t buying the sales patter with new diesel proving a confusing area for potential buyers. \u201cDiesel car owners are choosing instead to keep their current vehicles running longer than commit right now to a big ticket purchase. And instead of moving towards cleaner, greener motoring, British roads will remain clogged up with older, more polluting cars until the tide meaningfully turns towards electric. He\u2019s also concerned by the modest rise in electric car sales: While new diesel registration figures are weak, the more worrying statistic is slow growth in AFV sales. \u201cAlthough electric and hybrid sales are up in March, a 5.7% rise is nowhere near rapid enough to keep us on track for the 2040 electric-hybrid switch over. The UK auto sector suffered a \u2018triple whammy\u2019 this year, says Ian Plummer, Manufacturing and Agency Director at Auto Trader. First, Q1 of 2017 was always going to be a hard act to follow because sales were artificially inflated by consumers pulling forward purchases ahead of changes to Vehicle Excise Duty. Second, we had several days of Arctic weather and this impacted deliveries to dealers and deterred consumers from visiting showrooms. And third, the ongoing negative impact of Brexit. Not only has it severely dented consumer confidence but falling exchange rates has reduced the scope for manufacturers to entice consumers with strong offers due to the impact of a falling pound on the profitability of cars sold in the UK. Factor in the diesel crisis, and there\u2019s plenty of reasons for people to put off buying a new car. Britain\u2019s car industry has now suffered its longest drop in sales in over six years. The last time it fell for so many consecutive months was between July 2010 and July 2011 (13 months). Ian Gilmartin, head of retail &amp; wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, is also worried by the drop in car sales: \u201cThere\u2019s no disguising the fact that it\u2019s another disappointing month for the new car sector. Achieving strong sales when new plate models hit the road is central to most sellers overall strategy, so there will be some concern at the continued slump revealed in these figures. However, the comparison with last March is a little misleading, as the record result posted then was in part due to sales being brought forward ahead of tax changes that came into place in April 2017. Some of the fall can also be attributed to a prolonged natural correction following a bumper couple of years, which we always knew was going to be unsustainable in the long run. The 15.7% slump in UK car registrations last month is a disappointment, says Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance: Traditionally March is a popular month to buy vehicles as the new number plates are out, and this month\u2019s figures should have been boosted by a spike in demand before the new VED changes set in. That said, petrol and alternative fuels remain the heroes of the forecourts, with diesel suffering and seeing yet another month of decline. Bosworth also predicts turbulence in the car sector as Britain exits the European Union: Dealers need to be willing and able to offer the most appropriate finance and stock to their customers, whether that\u2019s diesel, petrol, or electric. The strong pound should ease the way and allow them to buy better value stock, while also offering breathing space for the losses incurred by cars sat on the forecourt. Confirmation that drivers are shunning diesel cars, in the light of the Volkswagen emissions scandal: NEWSFLASH: UK car sales slumped by 15.7% last month, according to new industry data which confirms that car buyers are shunning diesel cars. That means that, as feared, car registrations have now declined for 12 months in a row. Sales so far this year are down 12.4% compared to the first three months of 2017. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders say: As predicted, the UK new car market fell in March, down -15.7%, but still the fourth biggest March ever for the sector. Fall in diesel demand continues, down -37.2% compared to same month last year, with AFVs up 5.7% and petrol holding steady at 0.5%. The slump was broad-based; sales to business fell by 14.3%, while sales to private buyers shrank by 16.5%. The SMMT blame Brexit uncertainty, and the move towards banning diesel cars from some UK cities to combat air pollution. Economic and political uncertainty and confusion over air quality plans continued to affect confidence, resulting in declines across all sales types. As this chart shows, March 2017 was a bumper month -- making last month\u2019s decline all the sharper: European stock markets have hit a two-week high in early trading. Shares have rallied in London, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid and Milan, on hopes that America and China will step back from launching a damaging trade war. What a difference a day makes -- yesterday, shares were sliding after China announced 25% tariffs on key US exports like soybeans, cars and aeroplanes Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, explains: Risk appetite turns positive as US and China seem willing to negotiate a way out of their trade spat helping equities move the upside and pushing the yen and Gold further lower. China did announce a new round of tariffs worth $50 billion but said that they will only come into effect when the US implement their own measures. This suggests that China\u2019s decision is yet another move on the negotiating table which explains why risk sentiment didn\u2019t decline. March 2017 was a record-breaking month for the UK car industry. Sales jumped by 8% as drivers rushed to buy new vehicles before changes to vehicle excise duty pushed up the cost. So it\u2019s not surprising that sales fell last month. However.... a double-digit slump would be a serious reversal, and it would also mean sales have declined steadily for year. That\u2019s more than a blip. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of the Unite Union, tweets: Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, has confirmed that March\u2019s UK car sales figures (due in 50 minutes) were \u201cundoubtedly grim\u201d. Hawes also warned that Brexit uncertainty continues to cast a shadow over the sector. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cAll the indicators are that consumer and business confidence has declined, especially for the big ticket items. A car is the second biggest thing you\u2019re likely to buy. \u201cThe industry is facing this uncertainty since the referendum. We\u2019re an industry that operates on wafer thin margins so anything that\u2019s going to affect the competitiveness of each of those plants is going to put a lot of pressure on. Now models, allocations tent to happen every four, maybe five years, so we can see ahead to when some of those decision points are. What we need is as much certainty in an uncertain world and trying to retain as many of the benefits as we currently have with our relationship with Europe, because it is by far our biggest market and it\u2019s right on our doorstep. \u201cThe transitional deal has given us a bit of certainty for an additional 21 months and it gives us the time to be able to negotiate what that future relationship is going to look like. For us we\u2019ve been very clear, we need to make sure there\u2019s no tariffs, ideally staying within the customs union and indeed the single market. That\u2019s what\u2019s made us so competitive and enabled us to grow since the recession. We don\u2019t want to see that go backwards.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s car industry has suffered another slump in car sales, as economic uncertainty and the diesel emissions scandal continues to bite. Figures released at 9am today are expected to show that new registrations shrank by around 15% last month, compared to March 2017. That would mean the industry has racked up 12 months of falling sales in a row, As Reuters explains: After record-high sales in 2015 and 2016, full-year demand dropped in 2017 due to uncertainty about future environmental levies on diesel cars and weaker consumer spending after June 2016\u2019s Brexit vote, which pushed up prices. Demand was also artificially inflated in March last year, when customers brought forward purchases to beat a tax rise which came into force in April 2017. Britain\u2019s automobile industry is already concerned that it could suffer badly if new trade barriers are introduced after Brexit; sliding domestic sales will only add to its anxiety. Also coming up today After yesterday\u2019s turmoil, the financial markets are calmer as the White House tries to calm fears of a trade war. Wall Street staged a late rally last night, as Larry Kudlow, president Trump\u2019s new top economic adviser, insisted \u201cThere\u2019s no trade war here,\u201d. Kudlow argued that people shouldn\u2019t over-react to the news that America and China are threatening to slap tariffs on $50bn of each other\u2019s good, suggesting that there is time to stave them off. The City has got the message; the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has just jumped by 95 points at the start of trading. We get fresh US trade figures later today, which will show whether Trump has had any success narrowing the trade deficit. Plus, data firm Markit is releasing its latest healthcheck on Europe\u2019s service sector.

As a nation, we cannot isolate ourselves any more than we can stem the ocean\u2019s tide. The international system provides agreed-upon rules of the road \u2013 and mechanisms for enforcing them. It serves as the basis upon which we can insist on fairer trade practices from competitors and adequate burden-sharing from allies. It is the means by which we can continue to improve people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.</p> <p>The system, built at great sacrifice, continues to serve our interests. It should be preserved and defended \u2013 ideally under strong U.S. leadership.</p> </blockquote> <p>[President Trump, of course, has criticised fellow NATO members for not spending enough on defence]</p> <p><strong>And on trade, Dimon writes that US does have some legitimate issues with China.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>China has realized significant economic and employment gains since joining the WTO in 2001. China was expected to continue on an aggressive path of opening up its economy, but this has happened at a much slower pace than most nations expected.</p> <p>Now, more than 16 years later, it has the second-largest economy in the world and is home to 20% of the Fortune 500 companies, yet it still considers itself a \u201cdeveloping\u201d nation that should not be subject to the same WTO standards as the United States and other \u201cdeveloped\u201d countries.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, simply imposing new tariffs on its goods in a unilateral fashion is not the answer. Instead, Dimon proposes a five-point plan:<br></p> <ul> <li>The United States should define very clearly, and in detail, what it wants from China.<br></li> <li> The United States should lay out a distinct timeline \u2013 and determine what the reaction would be if it is not met. <br></li> <li>The United States should listen closely to China about any legitimate complaints it may have. <br></li> <li>This should be done in partnership with our largest allies, particularly Japan and Europe. <br></li> <li>The United States should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fix the parts considered unfair. The TPP could be an excellent economic and strategic agreement between America and its allies, particularly Asia. This is not against China: The country could at some point be offered the opportunity to enter the TPP if it demonstrates a willingness to meet its standards, which would improve upon the rules-based global trading system under American leadership.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sonalibasak/status/981835905370648576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomkeene?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tomkeene</a> on Jamie Dimon&#39;s annual letter: &quot;He&#39;s almost running for Treasury Secretary&quot; halfway through. <a href=\"https://t.co/NDIzzpEtI6\">https://t.co/NDIzzpEtI6</a></p>&mdash; Sonali Basak (@sonalibasak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sonalibasak/status/981835905370648576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 5, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-05T11:18:55.409Z\">at 12.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ac5f6a3e4b059f638f16dc4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-05T10:26:14.389Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Markets rally as trade fears ease</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the markets, mining companies are helping to drive the London stock market higher.</strong></p> <p>Resource giants such as Glencore, Anglo American and Antifagasta are among the top risers on the FTSE 100.</p> <p>Mining companies would all suffer from a global trade war, as slower growth would hit demand for coal, iron ore, copper, aluminium.

      "bodyText": "It took less than four weeks for a firm worth more than half a billion pounds to fall apart. On 8 March, Conviviality \u2013 not a household name, but a big firm with more than 4,000 staff \u2013 had a stock market value of more than \u00a3550m. Fast-forward less than a month and its finances have fallen apart, its bankers have balked at rescue plans and shares then worth 300p are now worth nothing. It will be remembered as one of the quickest corporate collapses ever seen in the UK. On Wednesday the firm went into administration; the best parts of the operation were immediately sold to new operators and 2,000 workers suddenly have a new employer. For the other staff, the outlook is far less certain. Conviviality was a big player in the drinks business. It was the wine and spirits supplier to JD Wetherspoon\u2019s 900 pubs, to chains including Slug &amp; Lettuce and Yates, and to Hilton\u2019s UK hotels. It ran the bars at major outdoor events including the Isle of Wight festival and the Henley regatta. Conviviality also owned the Wine Rack and Bargain Booze chains and a handful of upmarket wine merchants, including Bibendum and the royal warrant holder Walker &amp; Wodehouse. It expanded rapidly via a dizzying sequence of acquisitions, which delivered impressive growth and transformed the company from a little-known, downmarket drinks chain into a darling of the stock market. That strategy, it now seems, is where it all went so badly wrong. Industry observers say that Conviviality\u2019s acquisitions, while delivering stunning revenue growth that looked impressive, ended up exposing underlying weaknesses in its management. Now, as the hangover kicks in, the recriminations are beginning. Former investors in Conviviality are considering a lawsuit, while the chair of the work and pensions committee, MP Frank Field, has questioned the role of the auditor KPMG, which also ran the rule over the books of the government contractor Carillion before it failed. Conviviality\u2019s chairman, David Adams, who on Thursday cited the company\u2019s collapse as he resigned from the board of mixer-drinks firm Fever-Tree, can add another name to the list of ill-fated directorships on his CV: Jessops (bust), JJB Sports (bust) and HMV (also bust). As administrators from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) start to pick through the remains, they are understood to be severely hampered by poor record-keeping \u2013 in line with the chaotic picture of Conviviality that has emerged during its decline. The death blow came when investors refused to pump \u00a3125m into the company. But that followed three profit warnings in as many weeks, the first of which was blamed on an arithmetical error by a member of the finance team. A week later, Conviviality revealed it had also forgotten that it owed \u00a330m to HM Revenue and Customs. So convivial was the company, it seems, that it forgot how to do its sums, forgot its taxes were due and forgot how to keep proper records. On Thursday C&amp;C, the Dublin-based cider company behind Magners, stepped in to buy the distribution division, which supplied 25,000 pubs and restaurants. But a further 2,000 workers in the high street retail business face uncertainty as PwC tries to find a buyer. A story about Conviviality\u2019s former chief executive Diana Hunter may offer some insight. According to a newspaper interview with Hunter, whose early career included stints at Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose, she liked to use her Porsche Cayenne as a \u201cmobile office\u201d, with a printer on the back seat that allowed her to print out takeover agreements and sign them on the go. The sequence of acquisitions began with the takeover of Punch Taverns\u2019 drinks wholesaler Matthew Clark for \u00a3200m in 2015. That was followed by the purchase of outdoor bars firm Peppermint and, in 2016, a \u00a360m deal for Bibendum. At one point the business was valued at \u00a31bn. The company was sometimes as bold in its marketing as it was in its deal-making, confronting Aldi head-on with an advert boasting of its prices in comparison with those of the German discounter. \u201cAldi Schmaldi\u201d read the slogan, a line that resulted in an out-of-court settlement. It all seemed to be paying off. Revenues soared by 85% to \u00a31.65bn in the year to April 2017, while profits more than doubled to \u00a322.5m. The combination of chutzpah and meteoric growth won plaudits among stock investors, and the share price increased more than threefold between the start of 2015 and October last year. Investors were handed \u00a320m in dividends in 2017, more than double the payout in 2016. All this triggered hefty rewards for directors, with Hunter\u2019s overall pay package at just under \u00a31m. But, according to a source, Conviviality \u201cmassively overpaid\u201d for Bibendum. It is also believed to have paid \u00a31m to JD Wetherspoon for the right to be its exclusive supplier.

Fast-forward less than a month and its finances have fallen apart, its bankers have balked at rescue plans and shares then worth 300p are now worth nothing. It will be remembered as one of the quickest corporate collapses ever seen in the UK.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday the firm went into administration; the best parts of the operation were immediately sold to new operators and 2,000 workers suddenly have a new employer. For the other staff, the outlook is far less certain.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/04/magners-cider-owner-cc-group-to-buy-bargain-booze-owner-conviviality\">Magners cider owner, C&amp;C Group, to buy wholesale arm of Conviviality</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Conviviality was a big player in the drinks business. It was the wine and spirits supplier to JD Wetherspoon\u2019s 900 pubs, to chains including Slug &amp; Lettuce and Yates, and to Hilton\u2019s UK hotels. It ran the bars at major outdoor events including the Isle of Wight festival and the Henley regatta. Conviviality also owned the Wine Rack and Bargain Booze chains and a handful of upmarket wine merchants, including Bibendum and the royal warrant holder Walker &amp; Wodehouse.</p> \n<p>It expanded rapidly via a dizzying sequence of acquisitions, which delivered impressive growth and transformed the company from a little-known, downmarket drinks chain into a darling of the stock market.</p> \n<p>That strategy, it now seems, is where it all went so badly wrong. Industry observers say that Conviviality\u2019s acquisitions, while delivering stunning revenue growth that looked impressive, ended up exposing underlying weaknesses in its management.</p> \n<p>Now, as the hangover kicks in, the recriminations are beginning. Former investors in Conviviality are considering a lawsuit, while the chair of the work and pensions committee, MP Frank Field, has questioned the role of the auditor KPMG, which also ran the rule over the books of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/04/government-let-slip-chance-to-retrieve-364m-from-carillion\">government contractor Carillion</a> before it failed.</p> \n<p>Conviviality\u2019s chairman, David Adams, who on Thursday cited the company\u2019s collapse as he resigned from the board of mixer-drinks firm Fever-Tree, can add another name to the list of ill-fated directorships on his CV: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/10/jessops-administration-staff-react\">Jessops</a> (bust), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/01/jjb-administration-shop-closures-job-losses\">JJB Sports</a> (bust) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/15/hmv-administrators-4500-jobs-at-risk\">HMV</a> (also bust).</p> \n<p>As administrators from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) start to pick through the remains, they are understood to be severely hampered by poor record-keeping \u2013 in line with the chaotic picture of Conviviality that has emerged during its decline. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3d00a59c-c737-46a4-8094-f4fd6acbab4d\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Matthew Clark </b>Distributes wines and spirits to hotels, pubs and restaurants.

But that followed three profit warnings in as many weeks, the first of which was blamed on an arithmetical error by a member of the finance team. A week later, Conviviality revealed it had also forgotten that it owed \u00a330m to HM Revenue and Customs.</p> \n<p>So convivial was the company, it seems, that it forgot how to do its sums, forgot its taxes were due and forgot how to keep proper records.</p> \n<p>On Thursday C&amp;C, the Dublin-based cider company behind Magners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/04/magners-cider-owner-cc-group-to-buy-bargain-booze-owner-conviviality\">stepped in to buy the distribution division</a>, which supplied 25,000 pubs and restaurants. But a further 2,000 workers in the high street retail business face uncertainty as PwC tries to find a buyer.</p> \n<p>A story about Conviviality\u2019s former chief executive Diana Hunter may offer some insight. According to a newspaper interview with Hunter, whose early career included stints at Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose, she liked to use her Porsche Cayenne as a \u201cmobile office\u201d, with a printer on the back seat that allowed her to print out takeover agreements and sign them on the go.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52c6ac034cba2e0d5ada4f8377080d093b2cf5e1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52c6ac034cba2e0d5ada4f8377080d093b2cf5e1/0_336_5612_3367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diana Hunter, former chief executive of Conviviality.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diana Hunter, former chief executive of Conviviality.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The sequence of acquisitions began with the takeover of Punch Taverns\u2019 drinks wholesaler Matthew Clark for \u00a3200m in 2015. That was followed by the purchase of outdoor bars firm Peppermint and, in 2016, a \u00a360m deal for Bibendum. At one point the business was valued at \u00a31bn.</p> \n<p>The company was sometimes as bold in its marketing as it was in its deal-making, confronting Aldi head-on with an advert boasting of its prices in comparison with those of the German discounter. \u201cAldi Schmaldi\u201d read the slogan, a line that resulted in an out-of-court settlement.</p> \n<p>It all seemed to be paying off. Revenues soared by 85% to \u00a31.65bn in the year to April 2017, while profits more than doubled to \u00a322.5m.</p> \n<p>The combination of chutzpah and meteoric growth won plaudits among stock investors, and the share price increased more than threefold between the start of 2015 and October last year. Investors were handed \u00a320m in dividends in 2017, more than double the payout in 2016.</p> \n<p>All this triggered hefty rewards for directors, with Hunter\u2019s overall pay package at just under \u00a31m.</p> \n<p>But, according to a source, Conviviality \u201cmassively overpaid\u201d for Bibendum. It is also believed to have paid \u00a31m to JD Wetherspoon for the right to be its exclusive supplier. On tiny margins, this is the sort of arrangement that would take years to pay for itself, if ever.</p> \n<p>Mark Brumby, chief executive of the retail analyst Langton Capital, said Conviviality was always running a risk. \u201cIf you\u2019re bombing along at 120mph on a straight road, that\u2019s great.

Its shares tumbled 15% to a three-year low after the company said annual profits would come in at around \u00a377m rather than the \u00a383m forecast by City analysts. Rank blamed much of the profits fall on the squeeze on consumer spending, with its board expecting tough trading conditions to continue into 2019. Underlying sales in its Mecca bingo halls declined by 2% in the 13 weeks to 1 April as bingo fans stayed home during the recent snows. The situation was worse at its Grosvenor Casino chain, with where sales down 9% as weaker than expected visitor numbers were compounded by the run of good luck among high-rollers. \u201cThe board is cautious about the UK consumer outlook and as a result expects venues to continue to be impacted for the remainder of the 2017-18 financial year and into 2018-19,\u201d said Rank. The uncertainty created by the Brexit negotiations, coupled with rising inflation and stagnant real wage growth, has eroded consumer confidence with a string of high street retailers and mid-market restaurants reporting weak sales. The downturn comes at a difficult time for Rank, which last month announced that Henry Birch, the chief executive, was leaving to run the online retailer Shop Direct. To offset the slowdown at its halls and casinos, Rank has expanded its online operation with websites such as meccabingo.com and grosvenorcasinos.com to attract younger people who use mobile apps. This was the one area in which Rank has performed strongly, with digital sales up 17% in the 13-week period. As part of its fightback Rank has also launched a high street bingo chain called Luda, which with a coffee shop and bar, is aimed at a younger audience. It has opened three venues to date, but the results have so far been mixed, the company said. Rank\u2019s shares closed at 180p on Thursday, their lowest since February 2015. The decline of retail gambling has triggered a wave of consolidation in the sector. In February Ladbrokes Coral was bought by GVC, the Isle of Man-based firm behind Foxy Bingo, in a deal worth up to \u00a33.9bn. In 2016 Rank tied up with online gaming firm 888 Holdings to bid for William Hill but the proposal was rejected.",

Although by training and instinct a Keynesian, sceptical of the claims of monetary control as a panacea, he was judicious in analysing the strengths and weaknesses of any argument. He saw inflation-targeting as a sensible goal of monetary policy but believed fiscal policy was the key to achieving an optimal balance of inflation and output. Chris was recruited to the Bank of England in 1974 by Christopher Dow. He spent eight years as head of the economics division, after a couple of years in Washington as the UK\u2019s alternate executive director of the IMF. Later, as chief adviser in the European division, he explored the ramifications of European monetary integration, work he continued after retiring from the Bank in 1995, first at Chatham House and then at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. He published several articles and books on the subject. Chris was born in Mold, North Wales, to Doris (nee Bell) and John Taylor, a clerk. They spent the second world war years in Manchester, after which the impoverished family moved to Sheffield, where Chris won a scholarship to High Storrs grammar school for boys, becoming head boy, cricket captain and an exhibitioner at King\u2019s College, Cambridge. His experience led him to be a firm believer in state action. After graduating with an economics degree in 1960, he spent five years in Montreal, obtaining an MA with distinction at McGill University while working as an economic researcher with Canadian Pacific Railway. There he met Rosemary Peel, a doctor; they married and returned to Cambridge in 1964 when he was offered a job at the department of applied economics, of which he later became deputy director. He also lectured in macroeconomics at the Judge Business School in Cambridge, and contributed substantially to a project to put an economics course online. His last book was as editor (with Graham Hacche) of Dow\u2019s memoir, Inside the Bank of England, 2013. Rosemary died in 1995 of colon cancer. Soon afterwards Chris met Leslie Turano, then a fellow in Spanish at New College, Oxford, who was embarking on a new career as a lawyer. They married in 1999. His other major activity was conserving medieval buildings \u2013 he had moved a derelict barn to an Essex village and restored it as a prospective retirement home with Rosemary.

      "bodyText": "The US private equity firm Carlyle Group has agreed to buy the Australian wine producer behind the Hardys and Echo Falls labels for A$1bn (\u00a3547m) as it hopes to capitalise on China\u2019s growing thirst for wine. Accolade is the biggest wine company by volume in both Australia and the UK, and the company\u2019s brands also include Banrock Station and Kumala. Carlyle said it was keen to tap into Accolade\u2019s growth opportunities in Asia. \u201cThis is a company with great brands and strong market positions, with multiple growth opportunities, particularly in Asian markets,\u201d Carlyle said. The sale of Accolade by its owners, the Australian private equity firm Champ, comes at a time of rapid growth in demand for wine by China\u2019s swelling middle classes. Sales of Australian wines to China have been bolstered by a free-trade agreement struck between the two countries that came into force in 2015 in which China cut import tariffs on Australian wine from up to 20% to about 3%. In 2017, Australian wine exports to mainland China jumped 63% to a record A$848m, putting Australia just behind France in sales of wine to the world\u2019s second largest economy. Australian winemakers also stand to benefit from Beijing\u2019s decision to raise tariffs on US wine imports in retaliation to higher import tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on a range of Chinese products. China is the biggest export market for Australian wine, ahead of the US and the UK. Accolade does not publish a breakdown of its exports to China but the chief executive, John Haddock, told Reuters the company expected to increase them by 80% in 2018, albeit from a small base. \u201cThat\u2019s a growth that will be around for many years to come,\u201d he said. Carlyle is making a big bet on Accolade\u2019s potential, having agreed to pay triple the A$290m Champ paid for an 80% stake in the company in 2011. Constellation Brands, a beer, wine and spirits company, is also selling its 20% stake to Carlyle. Last year Champ abandoned plans to publicly list Accolade, citing Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union as one of the reasons behind the decision. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the United Kingdom is a changing landscape and we are adjusting to that,\u201d Haddock said at the time. \u201cThe fall in the pound makes it much harder for exporters selling into the UK, who must sacrifice margins to stay competitive on the shelves of supermarket retailers.\u201d Accolade has a bottling facility in Bristol, where more than 500 people are employed and more than 600,000 bottles are filled every day. It is the largest wine warehouse and distribution centre in Europe, according to the company.",

      "bodyText": "The UK services sector has had its weakest month since the Brexit vote, after arctic weather brought businesses to a standstill. The latest snapshot of the economy from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply found that services \u2013 which account for almost 80% of national output \u2013 registered virtually no growth in March. While the damage to the economy is not expected to be permanent, Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the the severe cold snap would have affected overall growth in the first three months of 2018. \u201cThe UK economy iced up in March, suffering the weakest increase in business activity since the Brexit vote amid widespread disruptions caused by some of the heaviest snowfall in years. As a result, first-quarter economic growth will likely have been adversely affected,\u201d Williamson said. He said the economy was on course to have expanded by 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the previous quarter. He added the weather-related slowdown in March was unlikely to deter the Bank of England from considering an interest-rate rise at the meeting of its monetary policy committee in May. The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index is a closely watched guide to the wellbeing of the economy, and showed that service sector activity slipped from 54.5 in February to 51.7 last month. A reading above 50 represents growth, but the expansion in March was the weakest since July 2016, the month immediately after the EU referendum. The report said there was anecdotal evidence that unusually bad weather had disrupted business operations and contributed to subdued consumer spending in March. In addition, firms also reported that Brexit-related uncertainty was putting the brakes on growth. Service sector firms said there had been a sharp rise in costs during March, with the rate of inflation the strongest for three months. Higher input prices were attributed to greater staff salaries, rising utility bills and increased raw material costs, particularly of food and drink. Economist James Smith at ING Bank said: \u201cSeveral bouts of snow over recent weeks mean we\u2019ll have to wait until next month to see if the latest dip in the UK PMI signals something more sinister. Whilst we suspect this [dip] will prove temporary, we don\u2019t expect an imminent acceleration in economic growth either. The consumer squeeze \u2013 while past its worst \u2013 looks set to persist, with real incomes set to remain relatively flat. With consumer confidence not far off post-Brexit lows, we expect the economy to continue struggling to regain full speed.\u201d",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Sales of new cars in UK slumped in March", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sales of new cars in the UK plunged in March as economic uncertainty weighed on demand and consumers turned their backs on diesel, extending the run of falling sales to 12 months. A total of 474,069 new cars were driven off the forecourts of car showrooms last month, down 15.7% compared with March 2017 and the sharpest monthly fall since April last year. The drop reflects a broader trend over the past year, as cash-strapped consumers have been less willing to commit to big spending decisions since the Brexit vote, which triggered a sharp fall in the pound and pushed up prices. New car sales have also been hit by a slump in demand for diesel cars, sales of which dropped 37.2% in March, according to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The last time car sales fell for a longer period was between July 2010 and July 2011, after the government\u2019s scrappage scheme had ended. \u201cConsumer and business confidence has taken a knock in recent months and a thriving new car market is essential to the overall health of our economy,\u201d said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the trade body. \u201cThis means creating the right economic conditions for all types of consumers to have the confidence to buy new vehicles.\u201d March is a plate-change month, which typically drives a spike in demand, but the SMMT pointed out that it was always going to be tough to beat last March, when new car registrations hit a record high as consumers brought forward purchases to beat a tax rise which came into force in April 2017. The industry\u2019s weak performance last month meant car sales were down 12.4% in the first quarter overall, compared with the same period last year, with 720,000 driven off UK forecourts. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, said the sector would be hoping car sales in March were partly hampered by the snow, which might have prevented some buyers from reaching showrooms. \u201cIf this is the case, there could be some catch-up in April, with car purchases delayed rather than lost,\u201d he said. The most popular car in 2018 so far is the Ford Fiesta, followed by the Volkswagen Golf and the Nissan Qashqai. While demand for diesel has fallen sharply since the emissions scandal and amid uncertainty about future environmental levies on diesel cars, sales of new petrol cars rose 0.5% in March, and plug-in and hybrid sales were up 5.7%. \u201cAll technologies, regardless of fuel type, have a role to play in helping improve air quality while meeting our climate change targets, so government must do more to encourage consumers to buy new vehicles rather than hang on to their older, more polluting vehicles,\u201d Hawes said. Ian Gilmartin, head of retail at Barclays corporate banking, said the UK industry still had some reasons to be cheerful. \u201cCar sellers shouldn\u2019t be too disheartened \u2013 the industry is still producing very high quality products, with most cars, including diesel models, more environmentally friendly than ever. \u201cIf manufacturers and the motor supply chain can retain their focus on the future, they will be able to help retailers attract drivers back to the showrooms.\u201d Sales of new vans also fell in March, down 5.6% to just under 60,000, according to the SMMT. Hawes said a drop in a plate-change month was concerning. \u201cThe new van market is a key barometer of business confidence and while uncertainty remains, a degree of fluctuation in demand is to be expected this year.\u201d Britain\u2019s automotive industry was a vocal supporter of the remain camp in the run-up to the Brexit vote, and has since urged the government to secure a tariff-free deal with the EU to keep the sector competitive in the UK. There was some good news for the UK industry on Wednesday, when the French owner of Vauxhall said it would invest about \u00a3100m in its Luton plant, despite Brexit uncertainty. However, PSA, the manufacturer of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn, also said a decision on the future of its Vauxhall plant at Ellesmere Port would not be made before 2020, when there would be more clarity on Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biggest mobile operators have smashed expectations by spending almost \u00a31.4bn in the race to secure spectrum to launch next-generation 5G services. BT-owned EE, Vodafone, O2 and Three have paid close to double what many City analysts had expected Ofcom\u2019s auction to raise, as the mobile operators seek to open up a world of internet-connected world of driverless cars, smart home appliances, delivery drones and superfast video on the go. City analysts had a wide range of predictions on what the auction would net the government \u2013 spanning \u00a3630m to \u00a31bn \u2013 with the attractiveness of 5G services to consumers and mobile operators proving much more valuable. \u201cMobile network operators are willing to dig deep to acquire 5G spectrum \u2013 evidently seeing it as a strategic necessity,\u201d said Dhananjay Mirchandani, a telecoms analyst at Bernstein. The big four operators have secured broadly the same amount of 5G spectrum to use after the auction. Vodafone won 50MHz of spectrum in the 3.4GHz frequency band auctioned paying \u00a3378m, BT-owned EE won 40Mhz paying \u00a3303m, Telef\u00f3nica-owned O2 picked up 40MHz for \u00a3318m, and Hutchison-owned Three spent \u00a3151m on 20Mhz. Three UK had already secured a 40Mhz of 5G spectrum prior to the auction. 5G is set to be rolled out in the UK in the next decade and the mass connectivity it allows will help expand the so-called internet of things (IoT), in which appliances and devices wirelessly connect to the internet and each other. IoT technology is being used in everything from smart homes to wearables and 5G could be used to enable driverless cars to communicate with each other and other road users, as well as develop \u201csmart manufacturing\u201d \u2013 connecting all the various machines involved in a production chain \u2013 and the drone delivery networks that companies such as Amazon would like to develop. \u201cThis is good news for everyone who uses their mobile phone to access the internet,\u201d said Philip Marnick, spectrum group director at Ofcom. \u201cAs a nation we\u2019re using ever more mobile data on smartphones and mobile devices. Releasing these airwaves will make it quicker and easier to get online on the move. It will also allow companies to prepare for 5G mobile, paving the way for a range of smart, connected devices.\u201d Ofcom\u2019s auction also saw O2 win 40MHz of 4G spectrum (2.3Ghz) that was made available paying \u00a3206m. The win was considered essential by analysts as O2 had the smallest share of the UK\u2019s usable mobile spectrum. Parent company Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s plans for a \u00a310bn stock market flotation of O2 have been hampered over the last two years because of Brexit vote and market uncertainty. \u201cThe outcome for O2 UK is of particular importance given the potential IPO of this business after the auction,\u201d said Mirchandani. \u201cO2 went into the auction with the smallest spectrum portfolio. Expect news flow on an IPO in the near future, possibly in the summer.\u201d While significantly beating expectations the \u00a31.4bn 5G auction is a far cry from the \u00a322.5bn raised for 3G spectrum two decades ago. The expectation had been for \u00a35bn. Winning bidders subsequently found themselves making multibillion-pound writedowns after revenues and profits failed to match prices paid. Memories of overpaying hampered the auction of 4G spectrum in 2013 which raised \u00a32.3bn about \u00a31.2bn less than the Treasury had forecast \u2013 prompting an investigation from the National Audit Office into what went wrong.",

      "bodyText": "The consumer body Which? has described 250 of the most popular fridges and freezers on sale in the UK as \u201cpotentially unsafe\u201d, adding that they could be putting lives at risk. The organisation demanded that retailers immediately stop selling the models it had identified after an investigation showed that the backing material on almost half of all the fridges, freezers and fridge-freezers tested was made of an unsafe plastic that posed a fire risk. Its list of the 250 \u201cdon\u2019t buy\u201d models includes appliances made by most if not all of the leading manufacturers, including AEG, Kenwood, Hotpoint, Smeg, Candy, Hotpoint, Zanussi, Indesit, Whirlpool, Hoover, Bush and Ikea. The Which? warning comes after the London fire brigade (LFB) said that even though there was on average one fridge or freezer fire a week in the capital, it believed most manufacturers were still dragging their heels on making fire safety improvements. The LFB said doors and side panels of most fridges and freezers were usually covered in metal but many still used a flammable plastic backing which offered very little protection against the highly flammable foam insulation contained within the appliance catching alight if a fire started. Which? said the industry-wide investigation \u2013 the largest of its kind in the UK \u2013 looked at more than 500 of the most popular products on the market, and said it was releasing its findings now because of \u201ca lack of government action\u201d. The organisation said it accepted that fires due to refrigeration faults were rare, with its own research showing that fridge-freezers, fridges or freezers were to blame in only 8% of fires caused by faulty appliances. It also said the plastic backing material did not in itself cause fires but rather accelerated them, which was why it was not demanding a product recall but for retailers to immediately stop selling these products. Asked whether a homeowner who had one of its \u201cdon\u2019t buys\u201d should unplug it, a spokeswoman said: \u201cYou can\u2019t really do that with a fridge-freezer \u2013 it will ruin your food.\u201d She said the advice to people who had such an appliance was \u201cnot to panic \u2013 the risk is low\u201d. UK safety rules require refrigeration appliances to pass a glow wire test to assess their fire resistance. This involves putting a hot wire through a sample of the fridge or freezer backing material and seeing whether it catches alight. However, when conducting more stringent tests, Which? found that no plastic backing sample was able to withstand a flame for 30 seconds, indicating that, in the event of a fire, it would not sufficiently prevent the flame from reaching the flammable insulation inside. In similar testing of metal and aluminium laminate backed refrigeration products, none caught alight after the 30 seconds test. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: \u201cManufacturers selling white goods in the UK must meet some of the strictest safety laws in the world and we are working with Which? and other parties to see whether standards can be made even more stringent.\u201d \u2022 Consumers can use Which?\u2019s new tool to check the backing material of hundreds of the most popular fridges, freezers and fridge-freezers currently on the market.",

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, proposed the creation of a People\u2019s Bank in which customers were able to borrow from the Reserve Bank. The proposal is being pitched as a housing affordability measure, but in reality the impact would be limited. And yet the possible wider economic benefits make it a policy worth considering. The idea of a People\u2019s Bank is not a new one. In 2009 a group of economists, including Joshua Gans, Nicholas Gruen and John Quiggin, argued for a public entity \u2013 operated through Australia Post \u2013 that would offer basic savings, payments and wealth management products. Last year Gruen argued for the Reserve Bank to compete for home loans and superannuation. He argued that we don\u2019t really have a private banking sector \u2013 it is a \u201cpublic-private partnership\u201d given the RBA operates in effect as the wholesale supplier to the banks and is \u201ceffectively guaranteeing their debts if they can\u2019t meet them\u201d. The banks then \u201cupsell\u201d RBA services back to us. His analogy is that while the internet has meant consumers are able to deal directly with the wholesaler and get great benefits (such as buying a plane ticket from the airline\u2019s site rather than a travel agent), in banking we still operate as though the split between wholesaler and retailer is set in stone. And that split is, to say the least, quite profitable for the retailers. Consider that the cash rate is now 1.5% points below the 3% bottom that occurred during the GFC. But the current average mortgage rate for owner occupiers is just 0.55% points below the bottom reached in 2009: Prior to the GFC, the average standard variable mortgage rate was just 1.8% points above the cash rate; now it is 3.7% points. For small businesses it is even worse \u2013 the average small-business overdraft loan has shifted from 3.85% points above the cash rate to now 7.15%points: Yes, the cost of financing has increased since the pre-GFC times of cheap money, but it has not continually become more expensive for banks to raise finance, despite the increasing margin between the cash rate and their loans. The Greens proposal \u2013 which follows that advocated by Gruen \u2013 is for the RBA to lend up to 60% of the value of a home loan to owner occupiers at the cash rate plus 0.5% points. The rest of the loan would be covered by having a 40% deposit or by borrowing from a commercial bank. Now clearly, this would distort the market. Gruen suggested last year that such a proposal would see \u201cblood on the streets\u201d as the banks would fight hard to protect their businesses. The reality is the current home loan market doesn\u2019t have much competition. In February, the big four banks accounted for 81% of owner-occupier home loans and 85% of investor loans: Now this in itself is not a great concern. Certainly our top five banks account for an above-average slice of the market compared with other nations, but other nations have a bigger share controlled by the top three banks than does Australia: But just because the system is not out of the ordinary doesn\u2019t mean it is not in need of a shake-up. The concern is the impact of the policy. The Greens propose limits the loan size to $500,000 \u2013 which is currently just above the $450,000 average owner-occupier mortgage in New South Wales, and well above the $400,000 average mortgage size in Victoria \u2013 and also offers it only to those with no other property holdings. This would limit its impact on housing prices \u2013 especially if combined with the removal of first-home buyer grants. Given as well such loans would not be available for investors, it would involve owner occupiers being able to operate more equally with those who are valuing their ability to purchase on the basis of using negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts. But while the Greens are pitching it as a housing affordability measure, as a demand side measure it would see an increase in prices of houses to account for the ability to borrow more. Also, given the 60% cap it would benefit most those who could raise a 40% deposit and not have to go to a commercial bank for the other 30% to 40%, which would likely be at a higher rate than is currently offered. Overall, the amount repaid on the loan might be smaller but the initial affordability improvement would likely be minimal. And the issue at the moment with housing affordability is not the loan repayments but the initial hurdle of the deposit and the price of the house. Nicholas Gruen does not really pitch this as a housing affordability measure but an economic reform that would put the money supply more in the hands of government, make the bank system more efficient and more akin to a public utility, and which would raise revenue \u2013 possibly around $10bn a year at the current cash rate level. He suggests such a change could lift our GDP by up to 3% due to this increased revenue not actually being a tax increase but just shifting money from banks to the government, and it then also being able to allow other tax cuts. But it would also mean the RBA would be the major player in a system in which the central bank itself is the lender of last resort and regulator. How would this affect the stability of the system \u2013 because surely the commercial banks would face higher lending costs given the most stable side of their business has just been sliced away? Would the RBA\u2019s lending standards be maintained \u2013 and who would ensure that they are maintained? How would it affect Australia\u2019s credit AAA rating? All of these questions, coupled with the extreme level of banking lobbying that would occur, do make it a politically toxic proposal. But just because it might upset the status quo of the financial system and anger the hell out of the big four banks, does not mean the policy should be dismissed out of hand. Indeed that very anger alone possibly makes it worth considering.",
