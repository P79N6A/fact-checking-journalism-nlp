      "bodyText": "Global markets have ended a difficult month on a stronger note after the Bank of Japan stepped in to boost its economy with negative interest rates. However, weak economic growth figures in the US underscored the scale of a global slowdown that has rattled investors. Policymakers at Japan\u2019s central bank stunned markets with a narrow vote to impose a 0.1% fee on deposits left with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) \u2013 in effect a negative interest rate. The central bank was spurred into action as volatile markets, flagging global growth and a downturn in China threatened major economies around the world. In the US, news that the economy barely grew in the final three months of 2015 prompted speculation that its central bank would rein in plans to raise interest rates this year, having tightened borrowing costs for the first time in almost a decade in December. GDP rose at an anaemic annual rate of 0.7% as consumers and businesses cut back on spending, while US exports were hurt by weaker overseas markets. Rob Carnell, economist at ING Financial Markets, said: \u201cAll in all, these GDP data support the sense given by recent monthly numbers that the US economy lost momentum into the end of 2015. We are struggling to see how this story is reversed in the coming quarters.\u201d Stock market investors were cheered by the prospect of US interest rates rising at a slower pace and by the Japanese move, which followed the similarly aggressive precedent set by the European Central Bank (ECB) in June 2014. The negative rate is designed to encourage commercial banks to use excess reserves \u2013 which they normally keep with the central bank \u2013 to lend to businesses instead. The radical intervention provided an immediate boost to stock markets around the world after a dramatic start to the year that saw trillions of dollars wiped off their value in a matter of days. On Friday, the FTSE 100 in London closed up 2.6% at 6,084, to be back within a whisker of its starting level for 2016 of 6,242. That rise was mirrored around European bourses and followed a rally in Asian stock markets, where Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped 2.8% to a two-week high. At the time of the London close, Wall Street was also higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 1.7%. Chinese shares also rallied following the Japanese rate move but still suffered their biggest monthly fall for seven years. The Shanghai Composite Index has lost 22.6% since the start of the year. The surprise negative rates decision came just days after the BoJ\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, suggested he had dismissed any drastic easing measures to boost business confidence. On Friday, the bank said it had not ruled out a further cut. \u201cThe BoJ will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary,\u201d it said in a statement. It said the move was intended to lessen the risk to Japanese business confidence from turbulence in the global economy, a week after data showed the Chinese economy had grown at its slowest pace for a quarter of a century in 2015. The ECB held back from injecting more electronic cash into markets at its meeting this month but it too fired up share prices with a promise to consider more action in March. The prospect of central banks pumping more stimulus into a struggling global economy has also helped stabilise oil prices. Brent crude, which earlier in January hit a 13-year low below $28 a barrel, stood at about $33.86 on Friday. It is still down 30% from a year ago. Highlighting global unease about the global outlook following China\u2019s slowdown, gold prices have gained almost 5% in January. Friday\u2019s estimate of US GDP from the Commerce Department was less than half the 2% annual growth rate in the third quarter and was the weakest showing since a severe winter reduced growth to a 0.6% annual rate in the first quarter of 2015. Economists cautioned that this early estimate could yet be revised but said it still pointed to global headwinds buffeting the world\u2019s biggest economy and suggested the US Federal Reserve would not go ahead with all four interest rate rises slated for this year. Some said the latest signs of a US slowdown left the US central bank looking unwise after December\u2019s rate rise. \u201cThe GDP growth slowdown sheds a rather critical light on the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates in December,\u201d said Nina Skero, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cFor the sake of credibility, it is unlikely that the Fed will reverse its December decision, but rates are likely to stay at their current level until 2017.\u201d",

Watching world stock markets rally after the Bank of Japan cut interest rates gave a sense of relief to many in the financial community. Oil prices, which slumped to just $27 (\u00a319) a barrel a fortnight ago, stood at $34, up 40 cents on the day. Yet the reverse is true. If anything, investors are worried that governments and central banks have failed to realise how weak the global economy still is, seven years after the crash. Dangerous levels of private debt in China, bad debts lurking in Europe\u2019s banking system, nervous consumers everywhere: it\u2019s a nuclear device that needs careful handling. When a central bank shows that it understands cheap money \u2013 in the form of lower interest rates \u2013 is a necessary underpinning for investment and growth, investors cheer. When central bankers talk about a world that is healing and should be ready for higher debt costs, they panic. And no wonder, when the smallest possible rise in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve last month \u2013 from 0.25% to 0.5% \u2013 appeared to send American consumers running home to stash their savings in a piggy bank. New car sales were down in December and consumer sentiment dipped in January after a weak last quarter when, according to the Fed, a rate rise would be largely ignored by a US consumer as resilient as Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s terminator. The interest rate cut by the Japanese central bank is another signal of global weakness. Tokyo wants to generate some domestic growth after 25 years of stagnation and the decision to follow the European Central Bank with a negative interest rate, effectively a charge on deposits, is designed to deter foreign funds from coming to Japan, driving down the currency, and encouraging domestic businesses and consumers to spend not save. It did the trick. The yen fell against the dollar. We must wait and see what happens to domestic demand. The Bank of England, meanwhile, has already put aside its hopes of following the Fed. Governor Mark Carney once hinted that a UK rate rise might be on the horizon. But those days have now passed. His recent speeches show he is now more circumspect. If the Fed is going to struggle to add another half a percentage point to interest rates this year, in part because it would send the dollar soaring, Britain cannot even consider such a move. The pound would jump, leaving exports priced out of foreign markets and domestic businesses at the mercy of cheap imports. Carney is only too well aware that the Scunthorpe steel closure, a victim of cheap Chinese steel, would just be the start.",

      "bodyText": "He first ventured underground at the age of 13 when his father guided him into the cramped, dark, soggy tunnels under the Forest of Dean. And Robin Morgan was still scrabbling for coal and iron the day before he died last week aged 80, possibly the oldest working miner in the UK. Tributes have poured in from the forest, one of the most tucked-away and delightfully eccentric corners of the UK. His daughter, Jane, who helped her father run Hopewell colliery in Coleford, Gloucestershire, said: \u201cHe loved the pit, he virtually died with his boots on. It was a pleasure to work with him.\u201d Fellow miner and friend Rich Daniels, who was with him during his last shift at Hopewell, said: \u201cHe had immense knowledge of the trade that is unique to the forest. He was straightforward, reliable and honest. If he said he was going to be there at nine, then he would be there at nine.\u201d Describing him as \u201cone of a kind,\u201d Daniels said: \u201cHe was a true forester and he leaves a huge legacy in his commitment to mining in the Forest of Dean.\u201d Morgan was a \u201cfreeminer\u201d \u2013 one of a proud band allowed to open their own gales (small mines) in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. The right was apparently first granted after local miners helped Edward I in military operations by tunnelling under castle fortifications in the 13th and 14th centuries. In the 19th century, the Dean Forest (Mines) Act enshrined the freeminer right in law and covered all men aged 21 and over who were born and living within the \u201cHundred of St Briavels\u201d (the forest and parishes adjoining its boundary) and had worked a year and a day mining for coal or iron. Morgan first took up his pick in earnest at the age of 15. He spent some time away, working in deep mines for the old National Coal Board, but the forest was his first love. In recent years, the Hopewell colliery has been both a working mine, supplying power stations and domestic hearths, and a tourist attraction. In an interview with West Country Life magazine in 2013, Morgan described how he still worked mostly with a pick and shovel, lying down because the tunnels are so low. \u201cI begin at eight in the morning, come to the surface for a break at 1pm and knock off at 4pm,\u201d he said. \u201cA few years ago I\u2019d have come back down to work after tea. But I\u2019m getting on now.\u201d Despite his years underground he was remarkably fit and had never been in a serious accident. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything worse than a lump drop on my head. I reckon it\u2019s safer working in a mine than driving down the road.\u201d Times are changing in the forest. In 2010, the Guardian reported how Elaine Mormon had become the first female freeminer after a two-year legal wrangle. She is specialising in the extraction of ochre for artists\u2019 paints and the cosmetics industry. But the closure of a maternity unit in the area means that fewer people \u2013 male or female \u2013 are born within the \u201cHundred\u201d so fewer can qualify as freeminers. There are about 300 now, but that number will almost certainly begin to decline. Plus, in Morgan\u2019s words: \u201cKids today are too educated to work with a pick and shovel.\u201d Friends and admirers of Morgan \u2013 who was freeminer number 4,215 \u2013 paid tribute in the forest\u2019s independent newspaper, The Forester. Jonathan Wright, secretary of the Freeminers Association, said: \u201cHis death is a terrific loss to the mining world as he had a vast knowledge and experience of mining in the forest. He was a unique character and such a hard-working chap.\u201d Daniel Howell, deputy gaveller (an age-old post that oversees mining in the forest), said: \u201cRobin was always prepared to help other colliers with mining difficulties and knew the geology of the Dean like the back of his hand. If Robin spoke, you would be wise to listen \u2013 he was almost certainly right. He was held in the highest regard within the mining fraternity.\u201d Howell added: \u201cHe was from the generation of miners that were expected to keep going \u2013 defiant of all mortality.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Trade unions have said a government-backed support package for Sheffield Forgemasters demonstrates that ministers can do more to support Britain\u2019s embattled steel industry. Manufacturing group Rolls-Royce, defence contractor BAE Systems and military services firm Babcock International have agreed to underwrite about \u00a330m of bank loans to the steelmaker. They have done so as industrial stakeholders in Submarine Enterprise Partners, which runs the programme for replacing Britain\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet. The Ministry of Defence brokered the loan guarantee at the end of last year to safeguard Sheffield Forgemasters, according to Sky News. The 211-year-old company, which makes parts for the submarines carrying Trident nuclear weapons, has come under financial pressure due to the crisis afflicting Britain\u2019s steel industry. The government, which has been criticised for a weak response to the steel sector\u2019s woes, stepped in to negotiate a deal because it was concerned about the prospect of a Chinese-backed steelmaker investing in Sheffield Forgemasters. EU rules on state aid for companies would have prevented the government providing support directly. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, Britain\u2019s biggest steelworkers\u2019 union, said: \u201cBy helping to broker this deal, the MoD has shown that government can indeed play a role in helping the industry survive. The government should now go further and develop a full industrial strategy which seeks not to simply manage decline. \u201cThis is a small step in the right direction for the UK steel industry. The fact that companies like BAE, Babcock and Rolls-Royce have guaranteed this loan for Sheffield Forgemasters is further evidence of just how important steel is to the whole manufacturing sector, particularly the defence industry.\u201d Sheffield Forgemasters announced plans last week to cut up to 100 staff from its 800-strong workforce, as it reported its first ever loss. The company blamed tumbling steel prices and high energy costs for the loss of \u00a39.4m in the 18 months to the end of 2014. The same factors, exacerbated by China dumping cheap steel on global markers, have cost thousands of jobs across the UK steel sector in recent months. The MoD declined to confirm that ministers had intervened to encourage support for Sheffield Forgemasters. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe responsibility for managing the submarine supply chain rests with the main suppliers.\u201d The steel industry and unions have criticised the government\u2019s response to the crisis, which threatens thousands more jobs in the industry and the wider economy. After initially claiming there was little they could do about falling prices and EU restrictions, ministers have pledged to reduce energy costs and to encourage the purchase of UK steel for big projects. Graham Honeyman, Sheffield Forgemasters\u2019 chief executive, said last week there was more the government could do to support the sector. He declined to comment on the company\u2019s financing arrangements on Friday. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary for manufacturing at Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union, said: \u201cThe thousands of workers, who depend on Forgemasters in some way for their job will rest a bit easier today, but we are still deeply concerned about the plight of the UK steel sector. We say to the government, yet again, take a lead from these businesses and invest in our steel makers.\u201d Babcock, the engineering consultant, said it worked closely with suppliers such as Sheffield Forgemasters to ensure continuity for customers.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stock markets are pushing higher after the weak US GDP data triggered expectations that the Fed will go slow on future interest rate hikes. The dollar has also strengthened, as the figures \u2013 while disappointing \u2013 were in line with forecasts. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq are both up more than 1%, at 16,245 and 4553 respectively. The FTSE 100 index in London is more than 100 points ahead at 6034.70, a 1.7% gain Germany\u2019s Dax is up more than 80 points at 9723.3, a 0.9% rise France\u2019s CAC is up nearly 50 points at 4371.68, a 1.2% gain Markets were already in buoyant mood after the Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise move to negative interest rates. Have a great weekend everyone. We\u2019ll be back on Monday. Back to US GDP. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: Anxious sighs echoed through the chambers of the Federal Reserve as the first estimate for Q4 GDP fell below forecasts at 0.7%. Given recent strong labour data these growth figures will disappoint Janet Yellen with the added pressure of global risk sentiment weighing on the domestic recovery. F OMC Minutes this Wednesday showed the notable defiance of the Fed in the face of global growth pressures originating from China, but a contraction for the last quarter of 2015 could start to weigh on Yellen\u2019s outlook in the coming months. As the US made the first significant steps to recovery in the form of a rate hike last December, the Fed will be keen for this to be backed up swiftly by positive macro-news in the coming weeks. These figures won\u2019t cause panic, but more a gentle reminder of the uphill struggle central banks face in 2016.\u201d Belgium has also released GDP numbers for the fourth quarter: up 0.3% quarter-on-quarter (the same growth as in Austria, and slightly better than France\u2019s 0.2% gain). Its economy grew 1.4% in 2015. ING economist Philippe Ledent said: All in all, the figure released is positive. It shows that the gradual recovery is still resilient to the slowdown of the global economy. Moreover, even if one could have feared a negative impact of the 5-days-long lockdown of Brussels, for the time being, the impact seems limited. To conclude, the recovery is still on track with the labour market likely to improve further in the coming quarters, making the recovery self-sustaining. In 2016, we expect a full year GDP growth of 1.5%.\u201d Wall Street has opened higher, as the weak GDP numbers raised hopes that the Fed will be in no rush to hike rates again. The Dow Jones is up nearly 50 points, or 0.3%, at 16,117.92 The Nasdaq is up nearly 6 points, or 0.1% at 4512.35 The S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 5 points, or 0.2% at 1897.98 The dollar has strengthened after the US GDP numbers came in in line with expectations. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, is also sceptical that we could see another Fed rate hike any time soon. Although net external demand will remain a drag, inventories should be broadly neutral for growth in the first half of this year, while the drag on investment from the mining sector implosion should also fade. Assuming that consumption growth accelerates, as the fundamentals suggest, then GDP growth should rebound to between 2.5% and 3.0% in the first half of this year. Whether we will see evidence of a rebound soon enough to persuade the Fed to raise rates again in March, however, is debatable.\u201d At least some of the weakness looks temporary, but there are also signs that the underlying pace of expansion is on the wane, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at economic pollsters Markit. He said the slowdown adds more pressure on the Fed to consider the timing of future interest rate hikes. Rising inventories meanwhile took almost half a percentage point off the pace of growth, and the mild weather also led to reduced demand for energy for heating, adding further to evidence that the slowdown may prove temporary and suggesting GDP could rebound in the first quarter. \u201cHowever, the recent increase in financial market uncertainty, and expectations of an upward trend in interest rates in 2016, may mean consumers and businesses will continue to show reluctance to spend. There are already signs that we should expect a further disappointment in the first quarter GDP number. Markit\u2019s flash PMIs pointed to a further slackening-off in the rate of economic growth at the start of the year. The official first quarter GDP data have also typically been weak in recent years, appearing to retain some seasonality, a pattern which may well be repeated in 2016. The slowdown... suggests that policymakers may pare back their current expectations of a further four quarter-point hikes in 2016.\u201d The stock markets have taken the data in their stride. London\u2019s leading share index is still hovering around the 6000 mark, up 1.1% while the Dax in Frankfurt is up 0.4% and the CAC in Frankfurt is 0.65% ahead. The dollar is also holding up remarkably well, and is even extending gains against the yen, now up 2%, following the Bank of Japan\u2019s move to negative interest rates. The euro has hit a session low against the dollar, falling below $1.09. You can download the US GDP release here. It\u2019s worth noting that this is the flash estimate based on incomplete data, and could be revised in coming months. The US economy clearly lost momentum into the end of 2015, said ING economist Rob Carnell. We are struggling to see how this story is reversed in the coming quarters, and will likely be trimming our growth, inflation and Fed rate forecasts accordingly.\u201d Here\u2019s his analysis: 1) The trend in US growth has clearly slowed. Even allowing for the fact that this data is choppy, and considering the last two quarters as a moving average, growth is now barely 1.5%, and is probably consistent with a widening, not a closing output gap. If this feeds through into softer hiring trends, then we can forget further rate hikes from the Fed anytime soon. 2) The slowdown in growth is mainly based on a slowdown in domestic demand. Consumer spending growth has slowed from 3.0%+ in early 2015 to only 2.0% now. Whilst many pundits have been asking where the low oil price effect has been on US consumers, the reality is that they have indeed been spending it. Now the windfall has passed, and spending is returning to its pre-oil trends. 3) Investment is another key element of domestic demand that has declined, with business investment of -2.5%QoQ in 4Q15 a worrying new development \u2013 though admittedly following very strong 3Q15 growth. Structures investment is likely to remain soft until oil prices stage a rebound. 4) The fall in inventories took 0.45pp from the overall growth total. This could have been a lot worse, but that may mean we will have a further inventory drawdown in coming quarters, weighing on overall growth. 5) The drag from net exports was also about 0.5%, dominated by weaker exports \u2013 this is a combination of soft overseas demand and stronger USD. As such, the US export sector still looks vulnerable to currency appreciation, and is another reason for the Fed to tread very carefully with respect to rate decisions. The US economy expanded 2.4% in 2015, the same as in 2014, according to the figures from the Commerce Department.https://twitter.com/darioperkins/status/693065392328175616 However, lower oil prices have fed through to gasoline prices, around $2 per gallon, and this combined with rising wages should help underpin consumer spending in coming months. Economists believe the slowdown in consumer spending will be short-lived. Here\u2019s more detail. The slump in oil prices has undermined investment by energy companies and demand for heating, and unusually mild weather meant shoppers didn\u2019t splash out on winter clothes. Consumer spending rose 2.2%, down from 3% in the third quarter. Breaking news: The American economy stepped sharply on the brakes at the end of last year. GDP rose at an annual rate of 0.7% in the fourth quarter, down from 2% in the third quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter \u2013 but in line with expectations. More reaction to today\u2019s main news, the Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise move to negative interest rates. Fung Siu, analyst for Japan at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: The move to adopt a negative interest rate policy is symbolic and it has had the desired effect of prompting a sell-off in the yen, which has weakened to Yen121 compared with 118 the day before the move. A weaker yen will mean higher import price inflation, which in turn will help to push up overall consumer prices. Despite the latest move, the Economist Intelligence Unit still thinks that the Bank of Japan will struggle to meet its 2% inflation target and that the pursuit of expanding the monetary base by Yen 80 trln a year through its quantitative easing programme will remain in place this year and possibly the next.\u201d Let\u2019s have a quick look at the markets. Global stock markets bounced back today after the Bank of Japan surprised traders (in a pleasant way) with a move to negative interest rates. The FTSE 100 index in London is holding on to its gains, trading 1.2% higher at 6005.05, a gain of more than 70 points. The Dax in Frankfurt and the Cac in Paris have given up some of their earlier gains, however, and are now 0.5% and 0.8% ahead respectively (they were up more than 1% earlier). Economic data out this morning was mostly negative: growth in the French economy, the eurozone\u2019s second-largest, slowed to 0.2% in the fourth quarter while Spain powered ahead with another 0.8% rise, and German retail sales were weak in December. Just over an hour to go until the flash estimate for US fourth-quarter GDP is released. Oil prices continue their recovery, with Brent crude up 0.65% at $34.11 a barrel. HSBC has suspended its personal banking websites in the UK after a cyber attack. This is its second major outage this month. The bank, Europe\u2019s largest lender, said in a statement that it had successfully defended its systems against the attack. HSBC internet banking came under a denial of service attack this morning, which affected personal banking websites in the UK. HSBC has successfully defended against the attack, and customer transactions were not affected. We are working hard to restore services, and normal service is now being resumed. We apologise for any inconvenience this incident may have caused.\u201d A denial of service attack overwhelms a website with traffic, taking it offline, and is sometimes used as a smokescreen for other attacks. Inflation in the eurozone picked up this month, figures showed this morning \u2013 but this won\u2019t stop the European Central Bank announcing more economic stimulus at its March meeting, economists said. Headline inflation rose to 0.4% from 0.2% while core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose to 1% from 0.9%, reversing a fall in December. Nordea economist Jan von Gerich said: Don\u2019t be fooled by today\u2019s rise in euro area inflation, it was affected by base effects that will likely be more than reversed in February. The recent bounce in oil prices is of limited consolation for the ECB, as inflation expectations have not seen a similar rise. More monetary stimulus will be in store in March.\u201d Bundesbank president Jens Weimann warned on Thursday that inflation could turn negative in the months ahead. Inflation has hovered near zero for more than a year, well short of the ECB\u2019s 2% target. ECB chief Mario Draghi has dropped heavy hints that the central bank will unveil further stimulus measures in March. It has been buying \u20ac60b of assets a month and kept interest rates low. The ECB next meets on 10 March and analysts expect it to cut its deposit rate to -0.4% from -0.3%, but they are divided over whether they expect the central bank to boost its monthly asset purchase programme. Russia\u2019s central bank has left its key interest rate unchanged for a fourth month, as expected. The key rate stayed at 11%. The key rate decision has been made in recognition of the current economic situation, with elevated risks of continued recession provoked by falling oil prices. The high debt load of Russian companies and interest rate risks for banks and their borrowers have also been factored in.\u201d The central bank highlighted increased risks of a pick-up in inflation, and did not rule out a rate hike. It expects annual inflation to fall from 12.9% now to below 7% next January, and reach its 4% target by late 2017. However, the risks have grown that inflation may deviate from the target in late 2017, the bank said, pointing to the weaker rouble, which hit record lows against the dollar last week. Should inflation risks amplify, the Bank of Russia cannot rule out a tightening of its monetary policy.\u201d The bank is now expecting \u201ca more sizeable GDP contraction in 2016\u201d than before. Russia is mired in recession, hit by the collapse in global oil prices and western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. The central bank said: The additional adjustment may take several quarters. The GDP growth rate will enter positive territory in 2017, but will be low.\u201d Meanwhile, takeover talks between Sainbury\u2019s and Argos owner Home Retail Group have stalled over price, the Financial Times is reporting. The news sent shares in Home Retail down nearly 10% to 128.3p, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index. Sainsbury\u2019s is (unsurprisingly) up, by 3.4% to 244.8p, making it the second-biggest gainer on the FTSE 100. Here\u2019s the FT story (\u00a3): Takeover talks between supermarket group J Sainsbury and Home Retail Group, owner of the Argos catalogue business, have stalled over a disagreement on price, according to people close to the matter. Both companies remain entrenched in their positions, the people said on Friday, with a wide gap between their valuation of shares in Home Retail \u2014 just days before the deadline for Sainsbury\u2019s to table a formal offer, write Arash Massoudi and Mark Vandevelde. One of the people added that the two sides are still in contact and that there may yet be a breakthrough before the 5pm cut-off point on Tuesday. However, Sainsbury\u2019s has indicated that it is unwilling to pay more than around 150p a share for Home Retail, which would value the retailer\u2019s equity at \u00a31.22bn. Meanwhile, Home Retail is holding out for an offer of around 170p a share, one of the people said. Tesco will scale back opening hours at some of its 24-hour stores \u2013 turning them into 18-hour stores. It said 76 out of its 400 24-hour shops will now close at midnight and reopen at 6am. The move forms part of efforts by chief executive Dave Lewis to turn the supermarket around. Tony Hoggett, Tesco\u2019s retail director, said in a statement, according to Reuters: With the growth of online grocery shopping, these stores saw very few customers during the night. We\u2019ll continue ot make changes in store in way that will make shopping at Tesco a better experience for our customers, at the times they want to shop.\u201d Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, did better than expected over Christmas, posting like-for-like sales growth of 1.3%, in a sign that Lewis\u2019 efforts are starting to pay off. The company reduced prices, improved its ranges and stepped up its customer service. US stock markets are set to join in the global euphoria and open higher, with the Dow Jones expected to rise some 150 points to 16,220 at the bell. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The Bank of Japan\u2019s move shows how twitchy policy makers are getting about faltering global growth and the potential for deflationary pressures to get out of control. The UK is not immune to this malaise, and indeed interest rate markets over here are now pricing in a higher probability of a cut in rates this year, than a rise. However there\u2019s nothing like a bit of loose monetary policy to get stock markets excited, and true to form, global indices have reacted positively to the news from Japan. Taking a step back it seems that if throwing 80 trillion yen at the problem each year has proved insufficient, the Bank of Japan may soon find itself unscrewing the kitchen sink.\u201d The Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise move is just what stock markets needed after the recent turmoil. London\u2019s leading share index has pushed 70 points higher, to 6002.34, a 1.2% gain. Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.2% ahead and France\u2019s CAC has risen 1.4%. \u201cFTSE says hello to 6000 again\u201d \u2013 but seems unable to push much higher, noted Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at at online trading firm IG. The Bank of Japan completed the trio of central bank meetings that over the past week or so have kept investors enthralled. The statements from the ECB, the Fed and the BoJ have not been quite like the great actions of old, when the merest utterance could send markets flying higher, but they have been enough to enable stock markets to add to gains as the recovery off the January lows goes on. Miners have been some of the chief beneficiaries of the rally over the past week, but if the sector begins to sag it will point to tough times ahead for the broader index.\u201d Let\u2019s return to the Bank of Japan for a minute. Sean Yokota, head of Asia strategy at SEB, the Nordic corporate bank, explained the BOJ\u2019s move to negative interest rates, which he thinks will push the yen down towards 126 against the dollar. The BoJ is adopting a multiple-tier system where the interest rate on financial institution\u2019s current account are not all set at -0.1%. It will be divided into positive interest rate (for basic balance of reserves), zero interest rate and negative interest rate for \u2018excess reserves\u2019. On a weighted basis, the current account will likely have a rate closer to 0% instead of -0.1%. The BoJ moved to the tiered system because it is worried that negative rates on all of banks\u2019 current account will eat into their earnings and tighten lending standards. Yokota said annual spring wage negotiations will be key to the inflation outlook. Compared to 2.4% increase in 2015, 2016 is expected to be lower at 2.0%. However, dipping below 2.0%, lower than BoJ inflation target of 2%, would be a negative development and hurt inflation expectations, he said. Second, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may delay the VAT hike from 8% to 10% scheduled for April 2017, which will be positive for the equity market and negative for the yen. Abe reiterated this week that he still plans to increase the VAT as scheduled. His party has also recently excluded certain food items from the tax hike to reduce the impact on the economy.\u201d Economists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale also think the US GDP numbers will be weak. In stark contrast to an impressive acceleration in job creation, real business activity likely slowed to a near crawl during the fall quarter. We expect Q4 GDP growth of 0.5% seasonally adjusted annualised rate (from 2% in Q3), in part due to a considerable deceleration in real consumer spending which we forecast to also have slowed to 1.5% quarter-on-quarter from 3% in Q3. At lunchtime (13:30 GMT), we are getting US GDP numbers for the fourth quarter \u2013 the first estimate. Weak, but how weak? And will it even remain positive? asks ING economist Rob Carnell. Preliminary GDP estimates are difficult to forecast accurately, and are also prone to massive revisions subsequently. But there is a growing body of evidence pointing to this latest GDP outcome being even weaker than the fairly soft 2.0% (annualised) reading delivered for 3Q15. A negative figure, though unlikely, cannot be ruled out. Business investment looks very weak after the latest negative durable goods orders and shipments for December, and could even be negative, he said. A further drag looks likely from inventories. This leaves only residential construction spending, which remains strong, though is probably beginning to wane, and consumer spending, which has definitely slowed to about a 2.0% pace from 3.0% in 3Q15. If you put all this together, you get a GDP figure of about 0.9%, the same as the consensus prior to the durable goods release. But the real consensus is likely lower now, and the risk is that the inventory figure is closer to zero than +US$50bn, and if so, then GDP will be closer to zero too \u2013 a negative number cannot be ruled out. Even the consensus figure is going to make it an uphill struggle for the Fed to hike rates any time soon. And with markets pricing in only one rate hike from the Fed in 2016, it is our forecast of two hikes, not the market expectations, that seems in need of revision.\u201d Pantheon Macroeconomics said German retail sales were disappointing. Assuming no major revisions next month, retail sales fell 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q4, down from a 0.9% surge in Q3. These data then confirm our suspicion that consumers\u2019 spending slowed towards the end of last year, but overall 2015 was a spectacular year for the German consumer, with record growth rates. Fundamentals look solid for strong growth in 2016 too, but momentum likely will slow in the short run.\u201d In other economic news this morning, German retail sales unexpectedly dropped 0.2% on the month in December. Sales rose 1.5% year-on-year in December, down from a 2.4% rate in November and the lowest pace of growth for seven months. A weak end to a strong year \u2013 retail sales rose 2.7% in 2015, the highest annual increase since 1994. Russia has poured cold water on the idea of a deal between oil-producing nations... Brent crude is still up 1.8% at $34.51 a barrel though. Are we heading for a crash? Economists can\u2019t agree if gyrating financial markets mean we face a global meltdown. We asked leading analysts to debate the question \u2026 you can read the piece here. Julien Manceaux, economist at Capital Economics, has looked at the French GDP numbers in more detail. The eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy grew just 0.2% in the fourth quarter as consumer spending declined, partly due to the terrorist attacks in Paris but also the warm weather. The economy expanded just 1.1% in 2015 as a whole. If these figures are confirmed next month, it would mean that last year\u2019s hopes to see 2015 showing a stronger recovery of 1.5% will never materialise. Worse, this is now all we can hope for in 2016. Indeed, 2015 had all the reasons to be better: some structural reforms, tax cuts for households and companies, a weaker euro and low energy prices should have made of 2015 the year of the recovery. But confidence never returned enough to ensure that, leaving business investments and job creations too low. Looking ahead, we expect the labour market to gradually stabilise and reinforce confidence in coming months, mostly because of new measures announced to the government. This means that the recovery is likely to continue to unfold in coming months, albeit at a slower pace than expected. If better labour market figures do not materialise soon, the risk is to see domestic demand faltering when temporary factors like low energy prices will see their effects abate. The IMF recently forecast a tiny recovery for France in 2016 (1.3%). It may look pessimistic now, but if 2016 unfolds as 2015, it may become reality. However, there are still reasons to hope for a more dynamic recovery: if private consumption rebounds once more thanks to a more stable job market and that investments increase faster (because of the end of the downward housing cycle and important tax rebates for SME investments), we still believe that GDP growth could reach 1.6% in 2016. However, the risks already look oriented to the downside.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy explainer on how negative interest rates work, following the Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise move overnight. In 2014 the European Central Bank imposed negative interest rates of -0.1% on eurozone banks \u2013 to encourage them to lend to small firms rather than to hoard cash. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has looked at the markets: After a shaky end to Thursday the markets have surged into life this Friday morning following the decision by the Bank of Japan to implement negative interest rates. The move follows the latest failing of \u2018Abenomics\u2019 to significantly boost Japan\u2019s inflation, and has helped (temporarily) ease some of the macro-tensions that have plagued the start to 2016. This has led to a rather robust rebound from the European markets; the FTSE, also aided by a steady $35 per barrel level for Brent Crude, jumped 80 points after the bell, leaving the UK index just about back above the 6000 mark.\u201d Oil is continuing its recovery, with Brent crude now up half a dollar, or 1.5%, at $34.40 a barrel. It is heading for its fourth day of gains, spurred by hopes of a deal among oil producers to rein in the supply glut. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: While the move higher has been helped in no small part by vague chatter of some form of output deal between Russia and Opec, without agreement from Iran which seems unlikely, there is about as much chance of that happening as Aston Villa winning the Premier League this year. The main reason oil prices appear to have found a base is a weaker US dollar, as well as some position covering heading into month end, which is helping support prices.\u201d The yen is sliding after the Bank of Japan stunned markets by moving into negative interest rates. It imposed a 0.1% fee on some deposits parked with the central bank, which means it will charge banks interest. The dollar jumped more than 2% against the yen at one stage to 121.495 yen, its highest level in more than a month, and is now trading at 120.82 yen, up 1.7% on the day. European stock markets have got off to a strong start: FTSE 100 index is up some 60 points at 5991.81, a 1% gain Germany\u2019s Dax up nearly 140 points at 9776.91, a 1.4% gain France\u2019s CAC up 67 points at 4389.05, a 1.6% gain ....and Spain has just followed suit with strong GDP figures: the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy posted another 0.8% gain in the fourth quarter. \u00a1Ay, caramba! But economists at Capital Economics say a pick-up in eurozone growth in the fourth quarter is now unlikely, because France was relatively weak. Austria grew 0.3% between October and December, the same as in the previous quarter. The French economy \u2013 the second largest in the eurozone \u2013 grew just 1.1% in 2015, Insee said. Again, it was outperformed by Britain with 2.2% growth, although that was down from 2.9% in 2014. France is the first country in the eurozone to publish growth figures for the end of 2015. French GDP data out this morning was bang in line with expectations: the flash estimate for the fourth quarter showed the French economy expanded by 0.2%, a slight slowdown from 0.3% in the third quarter. This compares with 0.5% growth in the UK between October and December. Consumer spending in France dropped 0.4%, the national statistics agency Insee said. Insee warned earlier this month that the Paris terror attacks in November had a significant impact on hotel trade. Unusually warm weather in France also weighed on consumer spending by reducing demand for heating and clothing. Meanwhile, the Russian central bank is expected to leave interest rates on hold today, because further easing could exacerbate the rouble\u2019s weakness. The bank slashed rates by 6 percentage points to 11% in the first half of 2015 when western sanctions over Ukraine led to a deepening economic decline, but has left them unchanged since July. The country, which relies heavily on oil exports, has been hit hard by the slump in crude oil prices over the past year. The rouble plummeted to all-time lows against the dollar last week when oil prices fell to fresh 13-year lows and global stock markets tumbled. Some economists are even speculating that rate hikes could be back on the agenda soon. At its last meeting in December Russia\u2019s central bank said it had drawn up a risk scenario that projected oil prices at $35 for the next three years, but they have since fallen below that level. Brent crude, the global benchmark, dropped below $27 a barrel last week but has since recovered to $34.72. But Russia\u2019s recession is far from over. A spate of economic data on Monday showed how dire the situation is: the economy shrank 3.7% last year, retail sales slumped more than 15% year-on-year in December, real wages fell 10% and capital investment declined 8.7%. William Jackson, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said while the worst of Russia\u2019s crisis has now passed, another year of recession looks likely. The root of the BOJ\u2019s decision today to effectively charge banks for new deposits is the dire state of the Japanese economy. Today\u2019s inflation figures showed that prime minister\u2019s Shinzo Abe\u2019s much-heralded attempts to kickstart the economy after years of stagnation are failing \u2013 dubbed \u201cAbenomics\u201d. Prices are rising at just 0.5%, nowhere near the 2% Abe needs to lift Japan out of years of falling prices which have conditioned consumers to delay purchases in the expectation that things will eventually become cheaper. For useful background, economics editor Larry Elliott wrote this analysis piece about Japan last year: It looks like being a decent start to the European trading day. FTSE forecast to rise 71 points at the opening. Investors and market experts have been caught out by the BOJ\u2019s decision, which comes days after Kuroda said that the board was not considering negative rates. Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA based in Tokyo, told Reuters: Kuroda had been saying that he didn\u2019t think something like this would help so it is a bit surprising and it\u2019s clear the market has been surprised by it. But some felt it might not work very well because rates have been so low for long that banks have had plenty of opportunity to increase lending. Martin King, co-managing director at Tyton Capital Advisors in Tokyo, said: This is an aggressive all-stick-no-carrot approach to spurring investment, as depositors are essentially penalised for holding cash. Today\u2019s steps don\u2019t mean that we\u2019ve reached limits to our [Japanese government bond] buying. We added interest rates as a new easing tool to our existing QQE framework. Kuroda again: We won\u2019t hesitate taking additional (easing) steps by (expanding) the quantity, quality of money, as well as through interest rate (cuts) if needed to achieve our price target, while scrutinising risks to the economy and prices. Kuroda adds: Japan\u2019s economy continues to recover moderately and the underlying price trend is improving steadily. But there\u2019s a risk recent further falls in oil prices, uncertainty over emerging economies, including China, and global market instability could hurt business confidence and delay the eradication of people\u2019s deflationary mindset. The BOJ decided to adopt negative interest rates ... to forestall such risks from materialising. Kuroda has told journalists in Tokyo that the decision to adopt negative interest rates was taken with the 2% inflation target in mind, and in consideration of risks to Japanese business confidence posed by factors that include concern over the health of the global economy. Kuroda refused to comment on Thursday\u2019s resignation of the economy minister, Akira Amari, but added: As before, the aim is to see Abenomics succeed. Kuroda is working his way through the statement issued earlier by the Bank of Japan, according to our man in Tokyo, Justin McCurry. The decision sent the yen plunging by up to 2% as capital seeks higher rates of return elsewhere. Quite how long the yen\u2019s fall will last remains to be seen however because persistent low rates in Japan has done little to discourage investors from ploughing money into the country\u2019s markets, which are seen as safe haven. Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda is speaking now ... Updates shortly. Stock markets in Asia Pacific have yo-yoed wildly in the wake of the BOJ move, which spells yet another round of monetary easing in Japan. Generally speaking, traders have embraced quantitative easing in its various forms across the globe as it means cheap money and rising asset prices. The Nikkei in Tokyo has just closed up 2.85%. The ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia closed up 0.6%. The CSI300 index and Shanghai Composite index in China are up 3% Hang Seng in hong Kong is up 2.23% The Kospi in Korea is up 0.27% In Europe, shares are expected to open up strongly this morning, according to futures trading. Earlier on Friday, official figures showed inflation in Japan was 0.5%, way off the bank\u2019s target of 2%. The BOJ hopes that the rates decision will encourage commercial banks to lend more, rather than keeping cash at the BOJ, and stimulate investment and growth. The BOJ\u2019s statement added that Japan\u2019s economy was still recovering but headwinds from volatile global financial markets could undermine confidence. The statement said: Japan\u2019s economy has continued to recover moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating in both the household and corporate sectors, and the underlying trend in inflation has been rising steadily. Recently, however, global financial markets have been volatile against the backdrop of the further decline in crude oil prices and uncertainty such as over future developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly the Chinese economy. For these reasons, there is an increasing risk that an improvement in the business confidence of Japanese firms and conversion of the deflationary mindset might be delayed and that the underlying trend in inflation might be negatively affected. The BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda will give a press conference in about 30 minutes which should help explain the thinking behind the decision, which sneaked through on a 5-4 vote of the bank\u2019s board. The BOJ said it was adopting an interest rate of -0.1% for new excess reserves parked at the bank by financial institutions. The rate will not apply to existing deposits. Existing current account balances will earn a 0.1% positive interest rate. Required reserves held at the central bank by financial institutions will earn zero interest. Any additional current account deposits would incur the minus 0.1 percent rate, the BOJ said. But the bank added: The BOJ will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary. Read the full statement here. Hello and welcome to the business live blog. It\u2019s been a very eventful night in the world of finance with Japan making the surprise (to some, at least) decision to adopt negative interest rates. More on the detail of the decision very shortly but here\u2019s a catch-up on what has happened: The Bank of Japan announced it would cut rates below zero \u2018if judged necessary\u2019. Bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda is giving a news conference at 3.30pm Tokyo time (6.30am GMT) Shares in Asia surged strongly before falling back just as quickly and recovering again The value of the yen against the US dollar plunged on the prospect of more cheap money.

Even allowing for the fact that this data is choppy, and considering the last two quarters as a moving average, growth is now barely 1.5%, and is probably consistent with a widening, not a closing output gap. <strong>If this feeds through into softer hiring trends, then we can forget further rate hikes from the Fed anytime soon.</strong><br>2) The slowdown in growth is mainly based on a slowdown in domestic demand. Consumer spending growth has slowed from 3.0%+ in early 2015 to only 2.0% now. Whilst many pundits have been asking where the low oil price effect has been on US consumers, the reality is that they have indeed been spending it. Now the windfall has passed, and spending is returning to its pre-oil trends.<br>3) Investment is another key element of domestic demand that has declined, with business investment of -2.5%QoQ in 4Q15 a worrying new development \u2013 though admittedly following very strong 3Q15 growth. Structures investment is likely to remain soft until oil prices stage a rebound.<br>4) The fall in inventories took 0.45pp from the overall growth total. This could have been a lot worse, but that may mean we will have a further inventory drawdown in coming quarters, weighing on overall growth.<br>5) The drag from net exports was also about 0.5%, dominated by weaker exports \u2013 this is a combination of soft overseas demand and stronger USD. As such, the US export sector still looks vulnerable to currency appreciation, and is another reason for the Fed to tread very carefully with respect to rate decisions.<br><br><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56ab6df4e4b079b5028b1a94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-29T13:51:53.599Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US economy expanded 2.4% in 2015, the same as in 2014, according to the figures from the Commerce Department.https://twitter.com/darioperkins/status/693065392328175616</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RussKamp/statuses/693067642450644992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KampConsulting\">@kampconsulting</a> Still think that the US Fed will raise rates anytime soon?

The eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy grew just 0.2% in the fourth quarter as consumer spending declined, partly due to the terrorist attacks in Paris but also the warm weather. The economy expanded just 1.1% in 2015 as a whole.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If these figures are confirmed next month, it would mean that last year\u2019s hopes to see 2015 showing a stronger recovery of 1.5% will never materialise. Worse, this is now all we can hope for in 2016. Indeed, 2015 had all the reasons to be better: some structural reforms, tax cuts for households and companies, a weaker euro and low energy prices should have made of 2015 the year of the recovery. But confidence never returned enough to ensure that, leaving business investments and job creations too low. </p> <p>Looking ahead, we expect the labour market to gradually stabilise and reinforce confidence in coming months, mostly because of new measures announced to the government. This means that the recovery is likely to continue to unfold in coming months, albeit at a slower pace than expected. If better labour market figures do not materialise soon, the risk is to see domestic demand faltering when temporary factors like low energy prices will see their effects abate. </p> <p>The IMF recently forecast a tiny recovery for France in 2016 (1.3%). It may look pessimistic now, but if 2016 unfolds as 2015, it may become reality. However, there are still reasons to hope for a more dynamic recovery: if private consumption rebounds once more thanks to a more stable job market and that investments increase faster (because of the end of the downward housing cycle and important tax rebates for SME investments), we still believe that GDP growth could reach 1.6% in 2016. However, the risks already look oriented to the downside.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b308000f854e50e727503f9ddb7f6627801dcc0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b308000f854e50e727503f9ddb7f6627801dcc0f/0_0_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pain d\u2019\u00c9pices - dolls shop, Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pain d\u2019\u00c9pices - dolls shop, Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pain d\u2019\u00c9pices</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56ab25f3e4b079b5028b1364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-29T08:45:14.406Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/05/negative-interest-rates-european-central-bank\">handy explainer on how negative interest rates work</a>, following the Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise move overnight.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest lenders will be required to hold more capital than smaller rivals to ensure they can keep credit flowing into the economy, under proposals from the Bank of England. In the latest effort to avoid another taxpayer bailout of the banking system, Threadneedle Street will require the divisions of banks involved in lending to businesses and individuals to keep some capital in a \u201csystemic risk buffer\u201d. This buffer will be set separately for each bank depending on their importance to the UK economy and will be in addition to its existing regulatory capital cushion. The Bank said it could be used \u201cwhere there is a risk of disruption in the financial system with the potential to have serious negative consequences for the financial system and the real economy of a specific member state [of the European Union]\u201d. Policymakers do not expect banks to raise more capital from shareholders or bondholders to meet the new rules but rather to reallocate existing capital. Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor responsible for financial stability, said: \u201cThese new rules will mean that large UK banks and building societies are more resilient to adverse shocks, enabling them to continue to lend to households and businesses even in times of stress. \u201cThe financial crisis demonstrated the long-lasting damage that can be caused when large banks become distressed and have to cut back lending to the economy. These proposals are intended to reduce the risk of this happening again.\u201d The capital rules apply to the part of a bank inside the \u201cringfence\u201d, which banks must erect between their high street and investment banking arms to comply with the recommendations set out by Sir John Vickers in his 2011 review into banking. Banks such as HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland must comply with these rules by 2019.",

      "bodyText": "The short-back-and-sides haircut has been replaced by a sophisticated side-parting and the thin-rimmed glasses have been replaced by more fashionable thick black frames, but it really is James Murdoch returning to Sky as chairman. Whether Murdoch has changed more than his appearance since quitting as Sky chairman in 2012 at the height of the phone-hacking saga will be a key concern of investors in the company. He resigned from the role in April 2012 as Ofcom, the industry regulator, conducted an investigation into whether Sky was fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence. The inquiry was launched as a result of the phone-hacking scandal at the Sun, which was owned by the Murdochs\u2019 News International. The investigation cleared Sky but castigated Murdoch, stating that he \u201crepeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of him as a chief executive officer and chairman\u201d. Murdoch\u2019s departure led to predictions that his chances of inheriting control of the family empire had been severely damaged. But now he\u2019s back. James, the youngest of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s two sons, was not exactly cast into the wilderness after stepping down as chairman of Sky and executive chairman of News International in 2012. He kept a seat on the board of Sky as a non-executive director and retained his title as deputy chief operating officer of News Corporation, the parent company of News International and the owner of a 39% stake in Sky. Now based in New York, Murdoch played a key role in helping to split the family\u2019s news and entertainment businesses into two separate companies, News Corp and 21st Century Fox. However, Murdoch\u2019s comeback from the phone-hacking scandal was really kick-started when he was promoted to co-chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox in 2014. He had previously been the deputy chief operating officer and head of international. The appointment was a clear signal that Rupert was preparing to hand over control of his empire to his sons, Lachlan and James. James\u2019s return was sealed when he was named chief executive of Fox last year, just three years after he quit his role at Sky. Murdoch\u2019s rise to the top of Fox prompted rumours of discord within the company, but he has said he does not pay attention to the criticism. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get into a position where you\u2019re obsessing over what people are saying \u2013 is this fair, is that unfair, etc \u2013 because people are going to write what they are going to write,\u201d he said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. Now one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, Murdoch has changed his look and insists he has learned from the hacking scandal. \u201cEvery professional experience you learn a lot from,\u201d he said last year. \u201cYou learn about yourself, you learn about the company, you learn about people\u2019s interests around the place. In a situation like that, you learn a lot about politics. It was a very intense period, but you know, what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u201d Murdoch has been used to criticism and allegations of nepotism ever since he was named chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting at the tender age of just 30, back in 2003, when Rupert was still chairman. That move provided \u201cclear evidence for a pretty serious review of the corporate governance practices in the company,\u201d said the Association of British Insurers, which represented big investors at the time. But his four years as Sky\u2019s boss were regarded as successful. Murdoch was credited with significantly growing Sky\u2019s subscriber numbers and expanding the company into broadband. He was then promoted from chief executive to chairman \u2013 another move shareholders generally dislike \u2013 and served in the role between 2007 and 2012. Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, in 1972, three years after Rupert Murdoch arrived on Fleet Street by buying the News of the World. He has dual US and British citizenship and three children with his wife, Kathryn. He went to school in New York before getting a place at Harvard University, but at one time gained a reputation as the rebel of the family after getting piercings and tattoos and dropping out of Harvard after just three terms. After Harvard, Murdoch helped to create a hip-hop record label called Rawkus Records, which was eventually bought by his father. That marked the start of James\u2019s career in the family business, and after stints in charge of News Corp\u2019s music and internet strategy and the Asian television service Star TV, he was named the boss of Sky. Despite the hacking scandal and his past status as a rebel, he has always been backed by his father, so it is arguably not a surprise that James has now returned to the top job at Sky. \u201cEveryone talks about hacking in London. That all happened long before James took charge,\u201d Rupert Murdoch told Fortune last year. \u201cHe took Star television and [made it] the number one broadcaster in India, with about eight channels, and is making a big difference to that country. Then he went to BSkyB, where people said, \u2018Oh, that must be nepotism.\u2019 \u201cBut in fact, he went through a lot of tests, and when we took him out of his day-to-day role there and made him chairman, the same shareholders complained and said we can\u2019t lose him. \u201cHe completely changed BSkyB and lifted the bar there in every way \u2013 and added huge value to News Corp.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Drones in four near-misses at major UK airports, air investigators reveal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Airline pilots have called for a clampdown on drones, warning of potential disaster after four separate near-miss incidents at UK airports were reported in a single month, including one in a passenger jet taking off from London Stansted. The pilots have called for urgent action after the four \u201ccategory A\u201d incidents in which a serious risk of a collision occurred. The pilot of a Boeing 737 passenger jet taking off from Stansted in September said a 6ft (2-metre) long remote-controlled plane passed less than 15ft above its path, at 4,000ft, in controlled airspace where any drone flight is illegal. Nine days later, the pilot of a Boeing 777 airliner taking off from Heathrow saw an 18-inch small drone passing \u201cless than a wingspan\u201d away from the plane. Other incidents were reported around London City and Manchester airports. Pilots believe that a collision with an airliner could be catastrophic, and that the impact of a drone strike on a light plane or helicopter would almost certainly bring those aircraft down. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) warned that the number of incidents could soar as people fly drones received as Christmas presents, often with little or no handling experience or understanding of the rules. Existing rules on drones restrict their use in built-up areas and in controlled airspace. Small unmanned aircraft should not be flown above 400 feet or in the vicinity of airports without air traffic control approval. The UK Civil Aviation Authority rules state, \u201cThe operation must not endanger anyone or anything.\u201d None of the operators responsible for the recent near-misses were identified but they could have faced imprisonment, the CAA said. On Friday Balpa called for a registration system so drone users can be easily traced and prosecuted for any irresponsible flying. Details of the four confirmed near-misses were released on Friday by aviation investigators, but pilots warned that these may be the tip of the iceberg. The UK Airprox Board \u2013 which monitors the threat of mid-air collisions \u2013 last month investigated seven incidents involving drones, four of which were classified as being in the most serious bracket. A total of 30 incidents involving drones and unmanned aircraft were confirmed in 2015, compared to just six in 2014. Steve Landells, a Balpa flight safety specialist, said: \u201cThe reports that UK Airprox gets are the ones that are seen. But when you\u2019re flying at more than 100mph, the chances of seeing a typical, 18-inch wide drone are small. We don\u2019t know if this is the tip of the iceberg. With the massive increase in drone sales, we fear we might see a dramatic rise in close calls.\u201d Given the number and severity of the latest reported incidents, Landells said: \u201cIt was only by pure luck there wasn\u2019t a collision. The fact the severity and number of these incidents is rising is extremely worrying.\u201d He said a category-A incident in the holding pattern around Heathrow at 8,000ft was particularly concerning: \u201cThat means the problem is getting higher and drones are getting into more conflict.\u201d Balpa has called for more research into drone impact to match that done into the risk from bird strikes. Landells said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what would happen, but because drones have hard, lithium ion batteries, if one hits a jet engine, it will not only stop it but potentially cause an uncontained engine failure, with bits of metal flying off penetrating the cabin and fuel tanks. And if a drone hits a helicopter or light aircraft that will almost certainly result in catastrophe.\u201d Pilots also want technology to be routinely fitted to drones to stop them flying in areas where they could meet commercial traffic Landells said drone designers should liaise with air traffic controllers \u201cto look at ways they can adapt drones to ensure they can be seen easily on radars\u201d. A CAA spokesperson said: \u201cAnyone operating a drone must do so responsibly and observe all relevant rules and regulations. Drone users have to understand that when taking to the skies they are potentially flying close to one of the busiest areas of airspace in the world \u2013 a complex system that brings together all manner of aircraft including passenger aeroplanes, military jets, helicopters, gliders and light aircraft. \u201cThe rules for flying drones are designed to keep all airspace users safe and anyone flouting these rules can face severe penalties including imprisonment.\u201d",

With the massive increase in drone sales, we fear we might see a dramatic rise in close calls.\u201d</p> <p>Given the number and severity of the latest reported incidents, Landells said: \u201cIt was only by pure luck there wasn\u2019t a collision. The fact the severity and number of these incidents is rising is extremely worrying.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/11/drones-terrorist-attacks-security-thinktank\">UK should prepare for use of drones in terrorist attacks, says thinktank</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said a category-A incident in the holding pattern around Heathrow at 8,000ft was particularly concerning: \u201cThat means the problem is getting higher and drones are getting into more conflict.\u201d</p> <p>Balpa has called for more research into drone impact to match that done into the risk from bird strikes. </p> <p>Landells said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what would happen, but because drones have hard, lithium ion batteries, if one hits a jet engine, it will not only stop it but potentially cause an uncontained engine failure, with bits of metal flying off penetrating the cabin and fuel tanks. And if a drone hits a helicopter or light aircraft that will almost certainly result in catastrophe.\u201d</p> <p>Pilots also want technology to be routinely fitted to drones to stop them flying in areas where they could meet commercial traffic</p> <p>Landells said drone designers should liaise with air traffic controllers \u201cto look at ways they can adapt drones to ensure they can be seen easily on radars\u201d.<br></p> <p>A CAA spokesperson said: \u201cAnyone operating a drone must do so responsibly and observe all relevant rules and regulations. Drone users have to understand that when taking to the skies they are potentially flying close to one of the busiest areas of airspace in the world \u2013 a complex system that brings together all manner of aircraft including passenger aeroplanes, military jets, helicopters, gliders and light aircraft.</p> <p>\u201cThe rules for flying drones are designed to keep all airspace users safe and anyone flouting these rules can face severe penalties including imprisonment.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has imposed negative interest rates on banks to encourage them to lend to businesses, instead of hoarding cash, to support the flagging economy and the country\u2019s battle to break free of deflation. The Japanese central bank\u2019s board shocked markets on Friday by imposing a 0.1% fee on deposits left with it to encourage lending amid increasing uncertainty over the state of the global economy. How do negative interest rates work? Instead of earning interest on money left with the BoJ, banks are charged to park their cash. The idea is that instead of depositing money with the central bank or each other, they lend it to businesses and consumers. Banks may also cut deposit rates paid to customers, encouraging them to spend or invest instead of earning low or negative returns. Japan has been plagued by deflation \u2013 falling prices \u2013 for two decades, deterring consumer spending and business investment in the expectation that goods will become cheaper. Negative interest rates are an example of \u201cunconventional\u201d monetary policy, which also includes quantitative easing \u2013 the buying of bonds from commercial banks by central banks, leaving them with excess cash. The BoJ said the move to negative interest rates was intended to support Japanese business confidence and to signal its determination to get inflation moving towards the target of 2%. The negative rate will only apply to reserves in addition to existing deposits and those the central bank requires banks to have with it. This is designed to cushion banks\u2019 earnings so that they do not become less willing to lend. The BoJ said, in a question and answer document, that interest rates and asset prices in financial markets would nevertheless be set on the basis of the negative rate. Will it work? It\u2019s far from clear. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has argued his unconventional policies \u2013 including negative rates \u2013 have helped the eurozone economy to ward off deflation. In theory the policy sounds attractive, but it could have unintended consequences. For example, banks could choose to pass on to customers the costs they incur for depositing money with the central bank through fees, or depositors could decide to keep their money under the mattress instead of in a bank. A negative return on parking funds with the central bank might also encourage banks to invest in riskier assets to secure a return, potentially driving new asset bubbles and more pain further down the line. In search of alternative investments, banks are likely to increase their purchases of government bonds. However, this has potentially serious consequences if banks are holding bonds to such an extent that government borrowing costs are artificially low. If a financial shock occurs, the banks and governments could find themselves so intertwined that they drag each other \u2013 and the economy \u2013 down. Has it happened before? In announcing its move, the BoJ cited examples of European central banks adopting negative interest rates. The main example is the ECB\u2019s decision to pay negative interest rates from June 2014 in an attempt to stop the eurozone falling into a deflationary spiral. Switzerland also adopted the measure last year to deter investors from buying francs, making Swiss imports uncompetitive. Sweden and Denmark have also introduced negative deposit rates on a temporary basis in recent years. In Denmark, the aim was to cap an unwanted rise in its currency, which was pushed higher when foreign money flooded into the country as investors looked for safety outside the crisis-ridden eurozone. The move to negative deposit rates did not cause financial meltdown, with the Danish central bank issuing plenty of advance warning. Nor did it lead to a noticeable change in the interest rates charged by banks for bank loans.",

The idea is that instead of depositing money with the central bank or each other, they lend it to businesses and consumers. Banks may also cut deposit rates paid to customers, encouraging them to spend or invest instead of earning low or negative returns. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/quantitative-easing-around-the-world-lessons-from-japan-uk-and-us\">Japan has been plagued by deflation</a> \u2013 falling prices \u2013 for two decades, deterring consumer spending and business investment in the expectation that goods will become cheaper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/29/bank-of-japan-shocks-markets-by-adopting-negative-interest-rates\">Bank of Japan shocks markets by adopting negative interest rates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Negative interest rates are an example of \u201cunconventional\u201d monetary policy, which also includes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/20/quantitative-easing-unconventional-monetary-policy\">quantitative easing</a> \u2013 the buying of bonds from commercial banks by central banks, leaving them with excess cash. The BoJ said the move to negative interest rates was intended to support Japanese business confidence and to signal its determination to get inflation moving towards the target of 2%.</p> <p>The negative rate will only apply to reserves in addition to existing deposits and those the central bank requires banks to have with it. This is designed to cushion banks\u2019 earnings so that they do not become less willing to lend. The BoJ <a href=\"http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/release_2016/k160129b.pdf\">said, in a question and answer document</a>, that interest rates and asset prices in financial markets would nevertheless be set on the basis of the negative rate.</p> <h2><strong>Will it work?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s far from clear. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has argued his unconventional policies \u2013 including negative rates \u2013 have helped the eurozone economy to ward off deflation. In theory the policy sounds attractive, but it could have unintended consequences. For example, banks could choose to pass on to customers the costs they incur for depositing money with the central bank through fees, or depositors could decide to keep their money under the mattress instead of in a bank.</p> <p>A negative return on parking funds with the central bank might also encourage banks to invest in riskier assets to secure a return, potentially driving new asset bubbles and more pain further down the line.</p> <p>In search of alternative investments, banks are likely to increase their purchases of government bonds. However, this has potentially serious consequences if banks are holding bonds to such an extent that government borrowing costs are artificially low. If a financial shock occurs, the banks and governments could find themselves so intertwined that they drag each other \u2013 and the economy \u2013 down.</p> <h2>Has it happened before?</h2> <p>In announcing its move, the BoJ cited examples of European central banks adopting negative interest rates. The main example is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/05/european-central-bank-cuts-deposit-rates\">the ECB\u2019s decision to pay negative interest rates from June 2014</a> in an attempt to stop the eurozone falling into a deflationary spiral. </p> <p>Switzerland also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2014/dec/18/swiss-negative-interest-rates-fed-stock-markets-rouble-live\">adopted the measure last year</a> to deter investors from buying francs, making Swiss imports uncompetitive. </p> <p>Sweden and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/05/negative-interest-rates-european-central-bank\">Denmark have also introduced negative deposit rates</a> on a temporary basis in recent years. In Denmark, the aim was to cap an unwanted rise in its currency, which was pushed higher when foreign money flooded into the country as investors looked for safety outside the crisis-ridden eurozone. The move to negative deposit rates did not cause financial meltdown, with the Danish central bank issuing plenty of advance warning. Nor did it lead to a noticeable change in the interest rates charged by banks for bank loans.</p>",

      "bodyText": "HSBC customers were locked out of internet banking for several hours on Friday after the company was targeted by online criminals in a denial of service attack. The bank, which has 17 million personal banking and business customers in the UK, said its website had been attacked, but it had successfully defended its systems. Customers were unable to log into their accounts until late in the afternoon, on what is likely to have been a busy day for online banking, as many employees received their first pay packet of the year. A denial of service attack overwhelms a website with traffic, taking it offline, and is sometimes used as a smokescreen for other attacks. The bank said there were no indications of customer data theft. It is now working with the government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team, Cert-UK, to pursue the criminals responsible. News of the cyber-attack broke mid-morning a couple of hours after customers started reporting that they were unable to access their accounts. Shortly before 5pm, John Hackett, HSBC\u2019s UK chief operating officer, said the bank was continuing to experience attempted denial of service attacks and was closely monitoring the situation with the authorities. \u201cHSBC\u2019s internet and mobile services have partially recovered, and we continue to work to restore a full service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe apologise for the disruption and inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d It is the second time in a month that the bank\u2019s customers have been locked out of online services, although last time the bank said it was not the result of a cyber-attack but a technical issue in HSBC\u2019s systems. Robert Capps of tech company NuData Security said distributed denial of service attacks [DDoS] were not direct attacks on the accounts held at financial institutions. \u201cThey are attacks on the public image and consumer goodwill towards those institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are meant to harass, intimidate and embarrass a targeted institution, but the DDoS attacks rarely result in any lasting impact on individual accounts at an institution.\u201d However, he said the attacks had been used as cover for other activities, such as cyber-heists, at a targeted institution. \u201cThey are sometimes meant to draw away the attention of the information security teams of a financial institution from the real intent of the attacks, such as large value money transfers, or the bulk theft and removal of consumer account data. \u201cOnly time will tell if the HSBC cyber-attack is simply a DDoS attack or a cover for a much more damaging intrusion into their systems.\u201d Andrew Tyrie MP, chairman of the Treasury committee, said he had recently written to regulators asking them to take action on banks\u2019 IT systems. \u201cBank IT systems just don\u2019t seem to be up to the job. This leaves bank customers with a substandard service,\u201d he said. \u201cIncidents like these are unacceptably frequent, and sometimes serious. Until this is sorted out, the public will remain more exposed than necessary to the risks of IT banking failures, including delays in paying bills, an inability to obtain their own money, and unauthorised access to their accounts.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Almost 70 years after the first model appeared in the aftermath of the second world war, the last Land Rover Defender has rolled off a production line in the West Midlands. The steel and aluminium vehicle has transported James Bond, Winston Churchill and various members of the royal family, for whom it is a fixture. The Queen\u2019s association with Land Rover dates back to 1951 when, as Princess Elizabeth, she stood in an open-top vehicle to present the King\u2019s colour to the Royal Air Force at a parade in Hyde Park. She has been filmed and pictured driving Land Rovers on her estate many times since. However, the demise of the Defender has been long forecast and its clunky, box-like form had been kept on industrial life-support for years by nostalgists and canny marketeers. But on Friday, Jaguar Land Rover bowed to the inevitable and ended production at Solihull. At 9.15am, the 2,016,933rd Defender built at Solihull became the last: a Heritage 90 softtop 4x4 with a special number plate recalling the famous \u201cHuey\u201d, the very first Series 1 \u2013 the Defender\u2019s ancestor \u2013 that Land Rover built. Among the hundreds of employees witnessing the event were those who had worked on the Defender\u2019s steel and aluminium frame for decades. Some had seen generations working on the same line: Tim Bickerton, 55, had worked for 40 years, having started as an apprentice, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father, with his daughter and son later joining him on the line. \u201cWe\u2019re like a stick of rock with Defender running through us,\u201d he said. JLR said while some employees had chosen to retire with the Defender, the rest would be redeployed without redundancies. Some will work on a heritage vehicle restoration line, repurposing old Defenders, to be launched in Solihull later this year. Originally conceived as a no-frills, off-road vehicle, the Land Rover was marketed as the \u201cgo anywhere\u201d option \u201cfor the farmer, the countryman and general industrial use\u201d. The Defender, which got its name in 1990, was driven by British troops in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan as well as by farmers, and was the precursor to the more luxurious four-wheel drives bought by wealthy London families that came to earn the name \u201cChelsea tractors\u201d. Its rugged design has ensured that an estimated two-thirds of Defenders and their predecessors are still on the road. However, the model\u2019s popularity as an on-road vehicle has waned and it has been overtaken by legislation and technology, rendering some features illegal or, at best, out of date. Its side-facing back seats were banned by the EU after 2007 and tighter environmental and safety standards have made it virtually obsolete. The Defender is the Land Rover model that links directly back to the first vehicle of the type designed by Rover\u2019s chief engineer, Maurice Wilks. He drove a Jeep, the workhorse of the US and British armies during the second world war, on his Anglesey farm and in 1947 decided to build on that design to create a better vehicle. The four-wheel drive vehicle has been produced since 1948 in Solihull by various owners including British Leyland, BMW, Ford and, now, the Indian conglomerate Tata through Jaguar Land Rover. Orders at Solihull boomed to meet nostalgia-fuelled demand as the end drew near for the Defender, which is built to order from an array of bodies and bases. The 2,000,000th Defender \u2013 a one-off \u201cDefender 2,000,000\u201d \u2013 was auctioned last month for \u00a3400,000 with proceeds going to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Born Free Foundation, the animal conservation charity. Jaguar Land Rover will produce a new model bearing the Defender name in the next couple of years but it will sit among the modern 4x4s without the distinctive features that link it to Wilks\u2019s great utilitarian creation.",

Labour\u2019s shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, Kerry McCarthy, will on Friday take her food waste (reduction) bill for its second reading in the House of Commons. \u201cThe supermarkets need to step up and massively reduce the waste they cause in the food supply chain and that\u2019s exactly what the food waste (reduction) bill calls on them to do,\u201d said Fearnley-Whittingstall. \u201cThey need to adhere to the principle that food that is fit to be eaten by people, should be eaten by people. It\u2019s ridiculous that so much good food is going into anaerobic digestion, rather than being redistributed to people in need.\u201d A report from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, published this week, showed that the UK was throwing away 15m tonnes of food a year. Only 2% of our surplus food waste is currently redistributed to charities. McCarthy, MP for Bristol East, said voluntary action by the food industry was failing to reduce food waste and that legislation was essential. \u201cMy bill commits us to the UN goal of halving food waste by 2030, setting out a clear path for reducing food waste and ensuring perfectly good surplus food is donated to charities,\u201d she said. Fearnley-Whittingstall said that supermarkets needed to be transparent about how much food they were wasting \u201cfrom farm, to production, through to retail\u201d and come up with coherent, credible plan for reducing that waste. \u201cI welcome this bill, and hope MPs get behind it, so we can put to an end the scandal of food being wasted on a huge scale,\u201d he said. This bill has cross-party support and its named supporters include Conservative London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith, the Green party\u2019s only MP, Caroline Lucas, chairman of the work and pensions select committee, Frank Field, and shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Seema Malhotra. In August, the United Nations claimed that if the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25% there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished. The organisation said that 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted each year, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of fish and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
