    "webTitle": "China's green industry expands in the west to offset slowing profits at home", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China's green energy industry has long been seen as a world-beater. But domestic pressures are mounting on its renewables firms as growth slows; and analysts are warning that Chinese companies could respond by accelerating their expansion overseas, stoking a rising east-west tension in the race towards a low-carbon economy. The European commission has just followed up US trade action against China by announcing its own investigation into allegations that Bejing firms are \"dumping\" cheap solar panels in European markets. But Chinese green companies are being hit at home by logjams on the power grid, the wider national economic downturn and increased competition of their own. Longyuan, China's biggest wind farm operator, has cut its projected new power installations from 2 gigawatts (GW) in 2011 to 1.6GW this year and says it now wants to expand in the US, South Africa and Hungary. It has just pushed rival Iberdrola of Spain off the global top slot, according to a new report from Make Consulting. Meanwhile, the grid problems and other issues have led Chinese wind-turbine maker Sinovel to report a 96% dive in first-half profits, while sales income was down by almost half. Sinovel is the second largest of its kind in the world behind Vestas of Denmark, while Goldwind (third biggest) recently reported an 83% plunge in first-half profits on the back of a 42% slump in sales. These setbacks may be temporary and are expected to increase Chinese activity overseas, rather than reduce it, according to Robert Clover, research director of Make Consulting. He says: \"China has seen 50% compound growth [in wind energy] since 2005 but is now taking a pause \u2026 There is no doubt that manufacturers of turbines and asset owners [wind-farm operators] are now looking at international markets for growth.\" And there are already signs that Chinese and other Asian firms are buying European rivals that have been hit by the credit crunch, the running-down of local subsidies and low-cost competition from abroad. One high-profile example of this has been revelations that Mitsubishi of Japan has been talking about buying a stake in Vestas, whose share price has been hit by a series of problems. The Danish wind-turbine maker, which has issued a series of profit warnings and has been through a major board and management team upheaval, has already sold off a wind turbine tower factory at Varde in Denmark to China's Titan Wind Energy. And this comes at the same time as the financially stricken German solar business Q-Cells, once a world leader, has been rescued from the liquidators by Hanwha Chemical of South Korea. Another major German solar business, Solon, which has also in been in financial trouble, was bought earlier this year by the Indian firm, Microsol. Meanwhile, China's Guangdong Aiko Solar Energy this summer bought collapsed Dutch business Scheuten Solar, while Ascent Solar \u2013 maker of solar-powered iPhone chargers \u2013 has fallen under the majority control of Chinese-Singaporean joint venture TFG Radiant. But while these takeovers are creating controversy, there is also considerable relief that hundreds of jobs are potentially being saved by Asian-backed rescue missions. The insolvency administrator handling the Q-Cells collapse, Henning Schorisch, said: \"I am very happy Q-Cells has found a strong partner in Hanwha, which has the means to provide company, brand and staff with long-term perspectives again.\" And state-owned Chinese energy company Three Gorges Corporation helped the Portuguese government by buying a major stake in the local utility, EDP, which is now a backer of plans to construct the world's largest wind complex \u2013 1.5GW \u2013 off Caithness in northern Scotland. Britain itself has made no secret of its desire to allow state-owned Chinese companies to become involved in a range of new atomic power stations as well as buy North Sea oil fields. Clover says: \"Companies such as Three Gorges not only bring their own fresh capital but Chinese lines of credit at a time when lending from many western banks is constrained.\"",

But domestic pressures are mounting on its renewables firms as growth slows; and analysts are warning that Chinese companies could respond by accelerating their expansion overseas, stoking a rising east-west tension in the race towards a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>The European commission has just followed up US trade action against China by announcing its own investigation into allegations that Bejing firms are \"dumping\" cheap solar panels in European markets.</p> <p>But Chinese green companies are being hit at home by logjams on the power grid, the wider national economic downturn and increased competition of their own.</p> <p>Longyuan, China's biggest wind farm operator, has cut its projected new power installations from 2&#xa0;gigawatts (GW) in 2011 to 1.6GW this year and says it now wants to expand in the US, South Africa and Hungary. It has just pushed rival Iberdrola of Spain off the global top slot, according to a new report from Make Consulting.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the grid problems and other issues have led Chinese wind-turbine maker Sinovel to report a 96% dive in first-half profits, while sales income was down by almost half.</p> <p>Sinovel is the second largest of its kind in the world behind Vestas of Denmark, while Goldwind (third biggest) recently reported an 83% plunge in first-half profits on the back of a 42% slump in sales.</p> <p>These setbacks may be temporary and are expected to increase Chinese activity overseas, rather than reduce it, according to Robert Clover, research director of Make Consulting. He says: \"China has seen 50% compound growth [in wind energy] since 2005 but is now taking a pause \u2026 There is no doubt that manufacturers of turbines and asset owners [wind-farm operators] are now looking at international markets for growth.\"</p> <p>And there are already signs that Chinese and other Asian firms are buying European rivals that have been hit by the credit crunch, the running-down of local subsidies and low-cost competition from abroad.</p> <p>One high-profile example of this has been revelations that Mitsubishi of Japan has been talking about buying a stake in Vestas, whose share price has been hit by a series of problems.</p> <p>The Danish wind-turbine maker, which has issued a series of profit warnings and has been through a major board and management team upheaval, has already sold off a wind turbine tower factory at Varde in Denmark to China's Titan Wind Energy.</p> <p>And this comes at the same time as the financially stricken German solar business Q-Cells, once a world leader, has been rescued from the liquidators by Hanwha Chemical of South Korea. Another major German solar business, Solon, which has also in been in financial trouble, was bought earlier this year by the Indian firm, Microsol.</p> <p>Meanwhile, China's Guangdong Aiko Solar Energy this summer bought collapsed Dutch business Scheuten Solar, while Ascent Solar \u2013 maker of solar-powered iPhone chargers \u2013 has fallen under the majority control of Chinese-Singaporean joint venture TFG Radiant.</p> <p>But while these takeovers are creating controversy, there is also considerable relief that hundreds of jobs are potentially being saved by Asian-backed rescue missions.</p> <p>The insolvency administrator handling the Q-Cells collapse, Henning Schorisch, said: \"I am very happy Q-Cells has found a strong partner in Hanwha, which has the means to provide company, brand and staff with long-term perspectives again.\"</p> <p>And state-owned Chinese energy company Three Gorges Corporation helped the Portuguese government by buying a major stake in the local utility, EDP, which is now a backer of plans to construct the world's largest wind complex \u2013 1.5GW \u2013 off Caithness in northern Scotland.</p> <p>Britain itself has made no secret of its desire to allow state-owned Chinese companies to become involved in a range of new atomic power stations as well as buy North Sea oil fields.</p> <p>Clover says: \"Companies such as Three Gorges not only bring their own fresh capital but Chinese lines of credit at a time when lending from many western banks is constrained.\"</p>",

I meant, of course, principally the foreign-owned vehicle companies operating in the UK \u2013 companies such as the Japanese firm, Honda, which has just reported an impressive export performance and announced expansion plans. Yes, new investment: the sort that, if there is enough of it around the economy \u2013 and at present, there most certainly is not \u2013 then more jobs will be created, and output and spending will rise. As a result, the beneficiaries of that process will themselves, via their own extra spending, create more demand elsewhere in the economy \u2013 what economists, after Keynes and his colleague Richard Kahn, refer to as \"multiplier effects\". By far the greater part of the British vehicle industry is foreign-owned, and this has caused understandable concerns. Two recent books, Surrender \u2013 How British Industry Gave up the Ghost 1952-2012, by Nicholas Comfort, and Britain for Sale, by Alex Brummer, highlight the development and raise concerns. My friend Alex Brummer's book is subtitled British Companies in Foreign Hands \u2013 the Hidden Threat to our Economy. Brummer, who is less critical of the Thatcher period than I have ever been, nevertheless concludes that \"the pendulum swung against British business which, at times, became a plaything for the international speculators\". It is, he says, \"time to redress the balance\". Comfort \u2013 in common, I suspect, with the current government \u2013 places his hopes for revival on \"the innovative spirit\" which he believes is \"alive and well\" and capable of producing \"world beaters\", if governments give it a chance. We shall come to that in a minute. First, however, I think someone should put in a few words for some of these foreign owners. It is true that, at times, British business is a plaything for international speculators. It is also true that it can be a plaything for home-grown speculators. But it is worth remembering that foreign owners often came to the rescue of parts of British industry that were badly damaged by the antipathy to manufacturing that was characteristic of the Thatcher years. This antipathy was manifested not only in the absurd view that manufacturing hardly mattered and our future lay entirely in services. It was also seen in erroneous economic policies that damaged British manufacturing, with that damage sometimes being terminal. That we have such a thriving, foreign-owned motor industry is a result, not least, of the good work of dissident members of Mrs Thatcher's cabinets, such as Michael Heseltine and the late Peter Walker, who actively courted foreign investment to fill the gaps. Regional development agencies were also important, as were some excellent civil servants in the department that has suffered many a name change over the years, but which I prefer to call the Department of Trade and Industry. They kept the industrial flag flying. But if much of British industry is foreign-owned, the same cannot be said for British economic policy, which is home-grown and home-owned \u2013 with occasional exceptions, as in 1976, when Jim Callaghan's Labour government had to take dictation from the International Monetary Fund, which itself was taking dictation from the US government. Recognising, although not officially, that its strategy of \"expansionary fiscal contraction\" has failed, the current government has now unveiled, in a curious, piecemeal way, a so-called growth strategy. This is a ragbag of ideas that have been on the back burner for some time, ranging from financial guarantees for private-sector infrastructure investment to assistance for house building and the encouragement of bank lending. It would be churlish to dismiss any effort aimed at kickstarting this economy, but the basic problem is that the government has still not got the message. And it pains me to say this, but it is not obvious yet that the offer of some kind of roving economic brief to my old friend Kenneth Clarke will make a lot of difference \u2013 unless he recognises that his achievement, of which he is proud, of presiding over a successful deficit reduction plan in the 1990s took place in far more auspicious circumstances. Those were times of rapid economic growth here and abroad. The position now is that there is what analysts term a \"synchronised slowdown\" in the world economy. The time has come for policymakers to take another look at the conclusions of the late Christopher Dow's great work \u2013 Major Recessions. Dow found that recovery from a major recession required \"stimulatory measures equivalent to between 1% and 3% of GDP per year for a period of years\". He was referring to fiscal measures, and the only cautionary note was that \"output growth should not be more than 0.5-1% above the trend rate\". We are nowhere near the trend rate. Indeed, we have no growth at all. And the fiscal measures are contractionary, not expansionary. When is the coalition going to come to its senses?",

      "bodyText": "The foolish man built his house upon sand; the wise man built his house on a rock. The ambitious entrepreneurs of Datang chose a sturdy nylon and wool foundation. \"People always need socks,\" points out Xu Leile, whose company clothes the feet of the British and US armies, European hikers and pampered pet dogs. Thanks to Xu and hundreds more like him, \"Sock City\" \u2013 north-west of Tie Town, east of Sweater Town \u2013 epitomised China's economic success story. The obscure settlement in eastern Zhejiang province became an export-driven boomtown, producing as much as a third of the world's sock supply and thriving even through the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent global recession. Last year, Datang made roughly two pairs of socks for every person on earth. Long and short, Argyle or polka-dotted, they cram the stores of the nearby wholesale market. In Xu's spacious new factory, the shelves are stacked with huge reels of red, blue and orange thread. But ask Xu about the future and he grimaces. \"I'm very worried. This year is much worse than 2008-9,\" he says. The biggest of his rivals to have gone under in May \u2013 the Anli Sock Group, which produced 60m pairs of socks annually \u2013 could prove to be \"the Lehman Brothers of Datang\", according to Fan Jianping, chief economist of the State Information Centre. Failures such as Anli's and a slew of disappointing data in recent weeks are raising fears far beyond China that a slowdown in the world's second largest economy is turning into a hard landing. In the face of Europe's woes and the weak US recovery, Chinese growth has become more important than ever: the ripples are already being felt globally, with commodities analysts blaming tumbling prices on falling demand from China. The country's premier, Wen Jiabao, has issued repeated warnings about the economy, saying growth is under pressure and exports need support. Last week's announcement of approval for infrastructure projects, which some estimate to be worth 1tn yuan (\u00a399bn), appears to be an indication of just how alarmed authorities have become about the largely investment-driven economy. Until now, they have taken a series of milder measures, such as cutting the reserve ratio requirement and reducing interest rates, mindful of the painful hangover that resulted from the huge 4tn yuan stimulus they adopted to stave off the last crisis. That inflated property prices again and left a legacy of massive local government debt and questionable loans and infrastructure projects. China's economy saw second-quarter growth of 7.6% year-on-year: enviable to US or European eyes, but the lowest rate in three years, and the sixth straight quarter of slowing growth. Export growth slid to 1% in July \u2013 the lowest rate for three years, bar January, which was skewed by the lunar New Year holiday \u2013 and earlier this week, the official factory purchasing managers' index fell to 49.2 \u2013 the first time since November that it had dropped below the 50 barrier separating expansion from contraction. \"We should be very worried,\" says Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of Beijing-based J Capital Research. \"The economy has been in a hard landing since the fourth quarter of last year, but seems to have been helped by the consumer economy \u2026 That's now down as well.\" Most analysts are more optimistic, at least for now. While growth has fallen from a peak of 11.9% in the first quarter of 2010, when there were concerns about overheating, the decline is far less steep than last time, when it plummeted from a peak of 14.8% in the second quarter of 2007 to a low of 6.6% in early 2009. But Alistair Thornton of IHS Global Insight warns: \"More of the indicators we are looking at are showing strain and weakness. It's nowhere near what we were looking at four years ago, but nonetheless pretty ugly. \"There are huge stockpiles of coal at Qinhuangdao; steel factories in Hebei are over capacity; in retail, auto dealers have two, three, four months' more stock than they are used to.\" Cranes still tower over construction sites, but no one is working in them, says Yu Wankun, the sales manager for SANY Excavators in Jiangsu, the neighbouring province to Zhejiang. \"I feel like a blossoming summer has suddenly turned into a dull winter,\" he laments. \"In 2008, we didn't feel the crisis at all. This year, we do feel the crisis has really struck. The government's stimulus created a bubble. But many local governments are in debt now and the central government's financial support has stopped.\" The knock-on effects hit people hard when exports started falling in May, says Xiao Zhou, boss of another Datang firm. \"A lot of sock companies started doing real estate in Jiangsu \u2013 they went bust because of the property market, not because of sales,\" he says. Back in the sock factory, Xu has heard that 73 clothing firms have gone under this year, with some leaving behind debts of billions of yuan. Things have not been so bad since 2003, when foreign buyers stayed away because of the Sars crisis. Usually Xu goes to the US once a year; this time, he has made three trips \u2013 but one major customer halved its usual $5m order anyway. Sales to civilian customers are down by at least a fifth. It is a sign of the times that his firm, Huazhong, considers the boom in sales to the Syrian army as a rare bright spot. \"Last year they bought 870,000 pairs. This year it's 960,000 already,\" he says. Few might imagine that camouflage or khaki ribbed socks came in so many varieties, but French, Singaporean and Saudi Arabian soldiers have proved exacting customers. But Datang also has its strengths. Smart entrepreneurs have moved away from piling high and selling cheap to targeting foreigners. Xu decided early on to focus on high-quality products and military sales, which he hoped would prove more stable and more lucrative. Though his company has dabbled in producing woolly hats, lacy tights and dog booties, Xu's latest target is the medical market, with products such as support stockings. Others in Datang have focused on domestic consumers or sought new markets in rival developing countries. The rise in Chinese purchases and the increase in trade to the Middle East should also help to offset problems elsewhere, says Hou Zhiping, general manager of the city's hosiery market. So far, there is little sign of rising unemployment \u2013 admittedly a trailing indicator \u2013 which might fuel fears of social unrest. At the labour market in nearby Yiwu, a recruiter for the Xialaite sock company grumbled about the difficulties of finding enough employees. Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based group supporting mainland workers, says there have been noticeably more layoffs than last year, especially in Zhejiang and Guangdong, \"but nothing like 2008-9, when 20m workers were laid off \u2026 I don't think there's a huge number of unemployed migrant workers wandering around.\" Recruiters in those provinces had previously complained of severe labour shortages, he points out, and opportunities in migrants' home provinces have improved: \"Recently it was reported that, for the first time, there were more rural labourers from Sichuan working within the province than outside it.\" Beijing's push to develop inland areas has also had some success, as Crothall points out: while Zhejiang's economy grew 5.2% in the first half of 2012, down from 12.1% in the same period last year, western areas like Sichuan, Chongqing, Shaanxi and Guizhou all saw rates of above 16%, according to official figures. But growth is now slowing in those regions, too \u2013 and because their economies are so much smaller, they have less effect on the overall situation. \"You would have to triple Xinjiang's economy to have an impact on the national picture \u2026 If you can't fix Guangdong, you can't fix China,\" says Thornton. Yet, says Patrick Chovanec of Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management, the outlook is not uniformly negative: \"This is an economic adjustment and, in the long run, will be good for China and the world, but it doesn't mean it won't be painful.\" Officials and analysts have long warned that the Chinese economy is unsustainable; that the years of double-digit growth were fuelled by investment and exports, and that rebalancing and reform were desperately needed. A powerful editorial in Caixin, the country's most influential business magazine, raised fears that local governments were ignoring the centre's cautious approach and instead attempting another major stimulus that would crowd out smaller private enterprises, deter competition and increase distortions in the system. Continuing to pursue high-speed growth, fuelled by government investment, will mean that \"growth will fall; discrimination will become pervasive, and rent-seeking and corruption rampant; our society and environment will be pushed to their limits; and development cannot be sustained. The mass protests, riots and environmental disasters we have seen are just some of the consequences of this distorting growth model. They are a warning,\" it said. \"If we continue to hanker for economic 'miracles', we must be prepared to pay a high price in future.\" Additional research by Cecily Huang and Kathy Gao \u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2012 to correct comments made by Xu Leile.",

Export growth slid to 1% in July \u2013 the lowest rate for three years, bar January, which was skewed by the lunar New Year holiday \u2013 and earlier this week, the official factory purchasing managers' index fell to 49.2 \u2013 the first time since November that it had dropped below the 50 barrier separating expansion from contraction.</p> <p>\"We should be very worried,\" says Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of Beijing-based J Capital Research. \"The economy has been in a hard landing since the fourth quarter of last year, but seems to have been helped by the consumer economy \u2026 That's now down as well.\"</p> <p>Most analysts are more optimistic, at least for now. While growth has fallen from a peak of 11.9% in the first quarter of 2010, when there were concerns about overheating, the decline is far less steep than last time, when it plummeted from a peak of 14.8% in the second quarter of 2007 to a low of 6.6% in early 2009.</p> <p>But Alistair Thornton of IHS Global Insight warns: \"More of the indicators we are looking at are showing strain and weakness. It's nowhere near what we were looking at four years ago, but nonetheless pretty ugly.</p> <p>\"There are huge stockpiles of coal at Qinhuangdao; steel factories in Hebei are over capacity; in retail, auto dealers have two, three, four months' more stock than they are used to.\"</p> <p>Cranes still tower over construction sites, but no one is working in them, says Yu Wankun, the sales manager for SANY Excavators in Jiangsu, the neighbouring province to Zhejiang.</p> <p>\"I feel like a blossoming summer has suddenly turned into a dull winter,\" he laments. \"In 2008, we didn't feel the crisis at all. This year, we do feel the crisis has really struck. The government's stimulus created a bubble. But many local governments are in debt now and the central government's financial support has stopped.\"</p> <p>The knock-on effects hit people hard when exports started falling in May, says Xiao Zhou, boss of another Datang firm. \"A lot of sock companies started doing real estate in Jiangsu \u2013 they went bust because of the property market, not because of sales,\" he says.</p> <p>Back in the sock factory, Xu has heard that 73 clothing firms have gone under this year, with some leaving behind debts of billions of yuan. Things have not been so bad since 2003, when foreign buyers stayed away because of the Sars crisis. Usually Xu goes to the US once a year; this time, he has made three trips \u2013 but one major customer halved its usual $5m order anyway. Sales to civilian customers are down by at least a fifth.</p> <p>It is a sign of the times that his firm, Huazhong, considers the boom in sales to the Syrian army as a rare bright spot. \"Last year they bought 870,000 pairs. This year it's 960,000 already,\" he says. Few might imagine that camouflage or khaki ribbed socks came in so many varieties, but French, Singaporean and Saudi Arabian soldiers have proved exacting customers.</p> <p>But Datang also has its strengths. Smart entrepreneurs have moved away from piling high and selling cheap to targeting foreigners. Xu decided early on to focus on high-quality products and military sales, which he hoped would prove more stable and more lucrative. Though his company has dabbled in producing woolly hats, lacy tights and dog booties, Xu's latest target is the medical market, with products such as support stockings. Others in Datang have focused on domestic consumers or sought new markets in rival developing countries.</p> <p>The rise in Chinese purchases and the increase in trade to the Middle East should also help to offset problems elsewhere, says Hou Zhiping, general manager of the city's hosiery market.</p> <p>So far, there is little sign of rising unemployment \u2013 admittedly a trailing indicator \u2013 which might fuel fears of social unrest. At the labour market in nearby Yiwu, a recruiter for the Xialaite sock company grumbled about the difficulties of finding enough employees.</p> <p>Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based group supporting mainland workers, says there have been noticeably more layoffs than last year, especially in Zhejiang and Guangdong, \"but nothing like 2008-9, when 20m workers were laid off \u2026 I don't think there's a huge number of unemployed migrant workers wandering around.\"</p> <p>Recruiters in those provinces had previously complained of severe labour shortages, he points out, and opportunities in migrants' home provinces have improved: \"Recently it was reported that, for the first time, there were more rural labourers from Sichuan working within the province than outside it.\"</p> <p>Beijing's push to develop inland areas has also had some success, as Crothall points out: while Zhejiang's economy grew 5.2% in the first half of 2012, down from 12.1% in the same period last year, western areas like Sichuan, Chongqing, Shaanxi and Guizhou all saw rates of above 16%, according to official figures.</p> <p>But growth is now slowing in those regions, too \u2013 and because their economies are so much smaller, they have less effect on the overall situation. \"You would have to triple Xinjiang's economy to have an impact on the national picture&#xa0;\u2026 If you can't fix Guangdong, you can't fix China,\" says Thornton.</p> <p>Yet, says Patrick Chovanec of Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management, the outlook is not uniformly negative: \"This is an economic adjustment and, in the long run, will be good for China and the world, but it doesn't mean it won't be painful.\"</p> <p>Officials and analysts have long warned that the Chinese economy is unsustainable; that the years of double-digit growth were fuelled by investment and exports, and that rebalancing and reform were desperately needed.</p> <p>A powerful editorial in <em>Caixin</em>, the country's most influential business magazine, raised fears that local governments were ignoring the centre's cautious approach and instead attempting another major stimulus that would crowd out smaller private enterprises, deter competition and increase distortions in the system.</p> <p>Continuing to pursue high-speed growth, fuelled by government investment, will mean that \"growth will fall; discrimination will become pervasive, and rent-seeking and corruption rampant; our society and environment will be pushed to their limits; and development cannot be sustained. The mass protests, riots and environmental disasters we have seen are just some of the consequences of this distorting growth model. They are a warning,\" it said.</p> <p>\"If we continue to hanker for economic 'miracles', we must be prepared to pay a high price in future.\"</p> <p><em>Additional research by Cecily Huang and Kathy Gao</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2012 to correct comments made by Xu Leile.</p>",
