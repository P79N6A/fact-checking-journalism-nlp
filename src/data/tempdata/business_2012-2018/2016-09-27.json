      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay $1.1bn (\u00a3846m) to a US regulator to resolve allegations it missold mortgage bonds to credit unions in the run up to the 2008 banking crisis. The settlement with the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) board is one of three major issues facing the bailed-out bank relating to the way it sold so-called residential-mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) before its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. The sum is included in the \u00a33.8bn of provisions the bank has already made to tackle upcoming litigation, but the bank\u2019s chief executive, Ross McEwan, has been warning that RBS faces other penalties from the US authorities. In a presentation on Tuesday he said settlement talks were under way with the NCUA and the Federal Housing Finance Agency but not with the US Department of Justice (DoJ). Analysts have estimated a settlement with the DoJ could amount to \u00a39bn. Anxiety about the scale of the penalty facing Deutsche Bank from the DoJ has helped drive shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank to near 30-year lows. As it announced the settlement with the NCUA, RBS reiterated it might need to increase its provisions. It said it was responding to \u201cinvestigations by the civil and criminal divisions of the US Department of Justice and various other members of the RMBS working group of the financial fraud enforcement task force (including several state attorneys general). \u201cAs previously stated, RMBS litigation and investigations may require additional provisions in future periods that in aggregate could be materially in excess of the (current) provisions,\u201d the bank said. McEwan had hoped to have resolved the discussions with the DoJ by now but the bank has signalled this might not happen until next year.

      "bodyText": "Motherwell\u2019s Dalzell steelworks, which were closed last winter amid an industry-wide crisis, will be formally reopened by Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on Wednesday. The international industrial group, Liberty House, which rescued the plant in March, confirmed that at least 70% of those starting work at Dalzell this week are former employees. The event will officially mark the restart of the plant following its mothballing in December 2015 after Tata Steel confirmed it was cutting 1,200 jobs at its plants in Scunthorpe, Motherwell and Clydebridge in Cambuslang. Tata, which owned the remnants of the former British Steel, blamed cheap Chinese imports, the strong pound and high electricity costs for its decision to stop production of steel plate. Sturgeon described Dalzell\u2019s revival as \u201ca very positive signal that the steel and engineering industries still have a future here in Scotland\u201d. Liberty House said it had spent the last five months rebuilding the workforce and recommissioning equipment at the site, which includes the UK\u2019s largest and most versatile plate mill. Liberty has already recruited about 120 staff for Dalzell, including a majority of returning employees, with the aim of increasing to more than 200 within 18 months as production rises. Liberty aims to initially produce 150,000 tonnes of plate a year at Dalzell, with the longer-term aim of building up to previous levels of output as the market allows. The executive chairman of the Liberty House Group, Sanjeev Gupta, thanked the Scottish government and Scottish Enterprise for assisting the rescue package: \u201cThere is an impressive spirit of partnership here and a determination to give the Scottish steel industry a real future.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s sharp rise up the league table for global competitiveness to its highest place in a decade risks being reversed by the vote for Brexit, according to the World Economic Forum. The body that runs the annual Davos event said Britain had risen three places in the past year to rank seventh, but said the analysis for its Global Competitiveness report had used data collected before the 23 June referendum. Noting that the UK was currently one of the most competitive economies in the world, the WEF said: \u201cAlthough the process and the conditions of Brexit are still unknown, it is likely to have a negative impact on the United Kingdom\u2019s competitiveness through goods and financial markets as well as market size and, potentially, innovation\u201d. The WEF study chimes with reports from other global institutions - including the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - which said ahead of the referendum that Brexit would have a long-term impact on the UK in terms of weaker inward investment and less trade. The studies have been challenged by Brexit supporters, who say the UK will be able to forge closer trade links with countries outside the EU and will benefit from a reduction in the red tape generated in Brussels. The WEF\u2019s report is published at a time when the government is mulling over its exit strategy from the EU. Some ministers favour a soft Brexit under which the UK would prioritise access to the single market, while others back a hard Brexit that would make immigration control the priority in negotiations. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cToday\u2019s report demonstrates our ability to sharpen our edge and improve our competitiveness. This government will build on that progress, as we demonstrate to the world that Britain continues to be highly competitive and open for business.\u201d Speaking at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva on Tuesday, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, said the UK would push for more trade liberalisation after Brexit. \u201cThe decision of the British people to leave the EU is not symptomatic of looking inwards, but a people who want to take more control over our laws, our money and our borders,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe are a proud and outward-looking trading nation.\u201d The WEF said the UK\u2019s competitiveness relied on highly efficient goods and labour markets, in which it ranked 9th and 5th respectively out of the 138 countries assessed. The UK was third for technological readiness and scored more highly than the EU as a whole in11 of the 12 categories covered. Britain scored less well than the EU for its macro-economic environment, largely because of its large budget deficit, high debt ratio and weak performance in savings. Despite a rise of 23 places in the category, the UK still ranks only 85th in the world. The three top countries in the league table \u2013 Switzerland, Singapore and the US \u2013 remain unchanged from 2015, with the rest of the top 10 made up of the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Japan, Hong Kong and Finland. European countries made up half of the top 10, but the WEF said there was a marked divide between the north and south of the continent. Spain was up one place to 32nd, Italy dropped a spot to 44th and Greece dropped five places to 86th. France, the second biggest country in eurozone rose one position to 21st. \u201cFor all economies in Europe, maintaining and improving prosperity levels will depend heavily on their ability to harness innovation and the talents of their workforces\u201d, the WEF said. The report also noted an increase in both the developed and developing world in non-tariff barriers to trade, more burdensome customs procedures and tighter rules affecting both foreign direct investment and foreign ownership. The trend was most evident in high and upper middle-income countries. Klaus Schwab, the WEF\u2019s founder and executive chairman, said: \u201cDeclining openness in the global economy is harming competitiveness and making it harder for leaders to drive sustainable, inclusive growth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "At the end of last year, it was reported that the Financial Conduct Authority was dropping its review into banking culture. This led to a number of commentators saying the FCA doesn\u2019t care about culture in financial services. I have been chief executive of the FCA for three months and I can tell you that nothing could be further from the truth. Culture matters a great deal. However, culture is not a tangible thing that can be taken down from a shelf and inspected. Culture is a way of doing things and a set of attitudes that determine behaviour by everyone involved in the organisation. It is shaped by many influences \u2013 incentive structures, risk management, the effectiveness of management and governance \u2013 all of which are examined by FCA supervisors in the firms we regulate. Getting the culture right means that the senior management of firms needs to set the right tone from the top \u2013 they need to take responsibility for the culture in their firms. Just over six months ago, thesenior managers and certification regime was introduced for all banks and building societies, and a parallel regime came in for insurers. These changes place responsibility at the heart of how these firms conduct themselves. As chief executive of the FCA, I am responsible for the organisation that regulates the conduct of over 56,000 financial firms. I am rightly held to account \u2013 byparliament and ultimately by the public we serve. I believe in taking responsibility for my actions and that the FCA must live by the principles it espouses. Just before the new accountability regime was introduced, I was at an event debating the concept of responsibility \u2013 with many arguing that it is a difficult thing to define. A young lady stood up and said that she didn\u2019t know what all the fuss was about \u2013 she was teaching her children to take responsibility for their actions \u2013 so why should people who work in financial services be any different? Six months on is a good amount of time to see how the new regime is bedding in. Generally, we have observed that firms are taking their responsibilities seriously and have broadly got the regime right. But we recognise culture change takes time and there is still more to do. So we have to keep a watchful eye on the progress firms are making. Since the regime was introduced, we have been undertaking work to ensure that senior manager responsibilities are properly allocated and understood in firms. In some cases, we have seen evidence of overlapping or unclear allocation of responsibilities. In other cases firms appear to be sharing responsibility amongst more junior staff, obscuring who is genuinely responsible. This goes against the intention of the senior managers and certification regime and should not continue. The regime will be extended in 2018 to cover all financial services firms, including asset managers and hedge funds. This means that the same high standards will apply in both the banking and the \u201cshadow banking\u201d sectors and supports a level playing field for competition. Trust in financial services will only be rebuilt when the public truly believe that senior managers in our financial institutions are taking responsibility for the actions they take.",

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank has endured another turbulent day on the stock market amid questions about its ability to pay a penalty to the US authorities and whether Angela Merkel will need to intervene in the plight of Germany\u2019s biggest bank. As shares in Deutsche Bank fell to fresh lows, the German chancellor was quoted by news agencies as saying: \u201cDeutsche Bank is one part of the German banking and financial sector, and of course we wish all companies, even when they are experiencing temporarily difficulties, to perform well. Apart from this, I don\u2019t want to comment.\u201d She had been asked whether she believed the German government should support Deutsche Bank, which has endured a torrid year on the stock market where its shares have fallen more than 50%. The latest slide began on Monday after the bank was forced to deny it had asked for help from Merkel over the potential $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) penalty it faces from the Department of Justice over mortgage bond mis-selling a decade ago. Deutsche Bank \u2013 which has insisted it does not need government help and has no intention of paying that sum \u2013 has also said it had enough capital although analysts said fears it would need to tap investors for funds was one of the reasons the shares were under pressure. Following Monday\u2019s 7.5% fall to levels last reached in the 1980s, the shares fell another 3% on Tuesday to \u20ac10.19 before ending the day on the Frankfurt stock exchange flat at \u20ac10.55. The market is fixated on how the bank will tackle the negotiations with the DoJ and how large the penalty will eventually be. \u201cIf the DoJ\u2019s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary,\u201d said Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at stockbroker MUFG Securities. \u201cEquity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank, as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015,\u201d said Tomas Kinmonth at Dutch bank ABN Amro. \u201cTheir capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if Deutsche Bank wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders,\u201d said Kinmonth. Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief executive, John Cryan, is also selling off its Chinese bank, Hua Xia, but there are some suggestions that its asset management division could also be put on the block. Some are pondering the wider ramifications. Paresh Davdra, co-founder of RationalFX, said the situation was rattling investors and raising parallels with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The German bank is not the only one facing discussions with the DoJ over the sale of the so-called residential mortgage-backed securities. Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s chief executive, Ross McEwan, told a conference on Tuesday that the bank had not yet begun discussions with the DoJ over the bailed-out bank\u2019s possible settlement. Analysts have calculated this could reach \u00a39bn. Shares in RBS, 73% owned by taxpayers, fell 2.5% as McEwan also warned of \u201cunchartered territory\u201d if the bank failed to dispose of 600 branches mandated by the EU under the terms of its bailout. Other bank shares were also lower after another German bank, NordLB, postponed a bond issue. Former chancellor Norman Lamont told the Institute of Directors conference that German banks were in a dangerous situation: \u201cThe biggest threat, I think, to Europe is the banking crisis. I think Italian banks are in a very serious situation; I think German banks are probably in a very serious situation, too.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on Thursday 29 September to correctly assert that Deutsche Bank had insisted it does not need government help.",

      "bodyText": "A fine of \u00a35m represents loose change for Merlin Entertainments. It is equivalent to about a week\u2019s profit, which is one reason why there is not a clamour in the City for senior resignations over the Alton Towers rollercoaster crash that injured 16 people, including two women who suffered leg amputations. But the two men at the top at Merlin \u2013 the chair, Sir John Sunderland, and the chief executive, Nick Varney \u2013 should consider the remarks of the judge at Stafford crown court and ask themselves whether they can continue in their posts with credibility. The answer is surely no. Merlin\u2019s safety systems were deemed to be \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and a \u201cshambles\u201d. Michael Chambers QC went on: \u201cThis was a needless and avoidable accident in which those injured were fortunate not to have been killed or bled to death.\u201d Engineers at the park were \u201cdoing their best in a flawed system\u201d and the lack of proper safety systems was \u201ca serious breach of a high duty of care, which put thousands at risk of death or serious injury over a long period of time, and which caused devastating injuries to a significant number of people\u201d. The contrast with Merlin\u2019s early attempt to blame \u201chuman error\u201d could hardly have been more stark. The judge explicitly rejected that suggestion and said: \u201cThe underlying fault was an absence of a structured and considered [safety] system.\u201d The only small consolation for Merlin was that the sentencing remarks did not include a reference to the company\u2019s controversial bonus policy for engineers, which used low levels of \u201cdowntime\u201d on rides as one measure of success. In all other respects, however, the verdict was damning. Varney, issuing yet another apology outside the court, declined to say whether he would resign. He should make up his mind quickly \u2013 say, before Thursday\u2019s trading update. As for Sunderland, who stayed away from the cameras, the case for his resignation is probably stronger because he has chaired Merlin\u2019s health, safety and security committee since 2010. \u201cWe will never ... become complacent in this area,\u201d he told shareholders in this year\u2019s annual report. Come on, Sir John, a court has said Merlin\u2019s version of vigilance at Alton Towers was a shambles. It\u2019s time to go. Will Williams &amp; Glyn ever appear? Remember when Royal Bank of Scotland said the name Williams &amp; Glyn would be seen again \u201csoon\u201d on UK high streets? That boast was made three years ago and the question now is whether Williams &amp; Glyn will ever appear. The 300 branches must be sold by the end of next year on the orders of the European commission to satisfy the terms of RBS\u2019s bailout in 2008. That implies a signed agreement to sell by the end of this year, but the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, does not sound even remotely confident. He warned on Tuesday that RBS is sailing into \u201cuncharted territory\u201d. Well, yes, it\u2019s hard to know what failure to obey the commission would mean in practice. McEwan talked vaguely of \u201calternative options\u201d. A messy compromise could probably be reached, but the \u00a31.5bn spent on trying to separate Williams &amp; Glyn is starting to look suspiciously like dead money. HS2 is going nowhere fast Terrific news. The government wants to spread wealth across the nation and address the \u201cvisibly uneven\u201d makeup of the British economy. If Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, is serious in this ambition, he should lobby his boss, the prime minister, to scrap HS2. The proposed north-south high-speed railway line would only entrench London\u2019s economic dominance by bringing more commuters more quickly to the capital. If the country must have a high-speed railway, the one to build is HS3, which would link Leeds and Manchester and relieve some pressure on the M62. Or, if there is an HS2-style \u00a350bn up for grabs, upgrade the roads to Cornwall or provide fast fibre broadband to all corners of the kingdom. If HS2 is judged to be the priority, regard the government\u2019s localism agenda as so much tosh.",

Michael Chambers QC went on: \u201cThis was a needless and avoidable accident in which those injured were fortunate not to have been killed or bled to death.\u201d Engineers at the park were \u201cdoing their best in a flawed system\u201d and the lack of proper safety systems was \u201ca serious breach of a high duty of care, which put thousands at risk of death or serious injury over a long period of time, and which caused devastating injuries to a significant number of people\u201d.</p> <p>The contrast with Merlin\u2019s early attempt to blame \u201chuman error\u201d could hardly have been more stark. The judge explicitly rejected that suggestion and said: \u201cThe underlying fault was an absence of a structured and considered [safety] system.\u201d The only small consolation for Merlin was that the sentencing remarks did not include a reference to the company\u2019s controversial bonus policy for engineers, which used low levels of \u201cdowntime\u201d on rides as one measure of success. In all other respects, however, the verdict was damning.</p> <p>Varney, issuing yet another apology outside the court, declined to say whether he would resign. He should make up his mind quickly \u2013 say, before Thursday\u2019s trading update.</p> <p>As for Sunderland, who stayed away from the cameras, the case for his resignation is probably stronger because he has chaired Merlin\u2019s health, safety and security committee since 2010. \u201cWe will never ... become complacent in this area,\u201d he told shareholders in this year\u2019s annual report. Come on, Sir John, a court has said Merlin\u2019s version of vigilance at Alton Towers was a shambles. It\u2019s time to go.</p> <h2>Will Williams &amp; Glyn ever appear?</h2> <p>Remember when Royal Bank of Scotland said the name Williams &amp; Glyn would be seen again \u201csoon\u201d on UK high streets? That boast was made three years ago and the question now is whether Williams &amp; Glyn will ever appear.<br></p> <p>The 300 branches must be sold by the end of next year on the orders of the European commission to satisfy the terms of RBS\u2019s bailout in 2008. That implies a signed agreement to sell by the end of this year, but the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, does not sound even remotely confident. He warned on Tuesday that RBS is sailing into \u201cuncharted territory\u201d.</p> <p>Well, yes, it\u2019s hard to know what failure to obey the commission would mean in practice. McEwan talked vaguely of \u201calternative options\u201d. A messy compromise could probably be reached, but the \u00a31.5bn spent on trying to separate Williams &amp; Glyn is starting to look suspiciously like dead money.</p> <h2>HS2 is going nowhere fast</h2> <p>Terrific news. The government wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/new-uk-industrial-strategy-greg-clark-iod\">spread wealth across the nation and address the \u201cvisibly uneven\u201d makeup of the British economy</a>. If Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, is serious in this ambition, he should lobby his boss, the prime minister, to scrap HS2.<br></p> <p>The proposed north-south high-speed railway line would only entrench London\u2019s economic dominance by bringing more commuters more quickly to the capital. If the country must have a high-speed railway, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/build-a-better-hs3-now-to-rebalance-economy-and-boost-north-says-ippr\">the one to build is HS3</a>, which would link Leeds and Manchester and relieve some pressure on the M62.</p> <p>Or, if there is an HS2-style \u00a350bn up for grabs, upgrade the roads to Cornwall or provide fast fibre broadband to all corners of the kingdom. If HS2 is judged to be the priority, regard the government\u2019s localism agenda as so much tosh.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Deutsche Bank: how did a beast of the banking world get into this mess?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank is facing questions about whether it can afford a penalty of $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) from the US Department of Justice for mis-selling mortgage bonds a decade ago. Shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank have sunk to near-30-year lows and are trading just above \u20ac10 a share, illustrating investors\u2019 concerns that they will be asked to bolster the institution\u2019s coffers through a cash call. Shareholders are in turn wondering whether the bank should have acted sooner to preserve its financial health and whether the German government will step in to prevent a collapse. How did it come to this? Once a big beast of the banking world, Deutsche Bank is grappling with a string of problems that are raising questions about its need to gain more funds in order to survive. John Cryan, the Briton who took the helm at the bank 14 months ago, already faced a daunting task in turning around the bank even before its situation worsened in the face of reports it could face a $14bn penalty from the US Department of Justice for bond mis-selling. Cryan is tackling the problems in the investment banking arm that generated 85% of its revenue but lost its shine after a string of scandals \u2013 including a \u00a31.7bn fine for rigging Libor \u2013 hit the bank. The reputational hits were accompanied by new regulations put in place after the banking crisis that made it tougher for banks to make profits. The bank\u2019s costs are also too high, so Cryan has embarked on a plan to axe a quarter of the workforce and raise capital by selling its Chinese arm and retail business Postbank. However, matters have been complicated by a prolonged low interest rate environment, which has made Deutsche Bank investors realise it would be difficult for the bank to generate as much revenue as it did in the past. It also expected the penalty for mortgage bonds mis-sold a decade ago in the US to be closer to $2.5bn. \u201c[Deutsche Bank] finds itself in the position it is because of a failure to shrink its balance sheet, cut costs and restructure when times were good,\u201d said Tim Crockford, European equities portfolio manager at fund manager Hermes. Why does Deutsche Bank matter? The bank\u2019s assets are valued at about \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.5tn), which is half the size of the German economy. This illustrates the size and scale of the bank. Even before the bank\u2019s latest crisis emerged, the International Monetary Fund had been sounding the alarm about the significance of Deutsche Bank on the world stage, saying it \u201cappears to be the most important net contributor to systemic risks\u201d. It is a key player in the market for derivatives, which are complex financial instruments used in a range of activities from insuring against interest movements to taking bets on stock market movements. These products were at the heart of the 2008 global crisis when a collapse in US property prices hit valuations of certain derivatives. What would happen if it collapsed like Lehman Brothers did? On the basis of the IMF\u2019s assessment, the consequences of a Deutsche Bank collapse could be worse than the signature event of the global banking crisis. However, few are predicting that the bank will go the way of Lehman. Christopher Wheeler, banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, points out that Deutsche Bank is not running out of cash, as it has \u20ac250bn of readily sellable assets it can sell to meet any demands from customers. Shareholders are alarmed, though. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have fallen more than 50% this year and so far that its stock market value is now approximately \u20ac14.5bn \u2013 or in dollar terms barely $2bn more than the proposed $14bn penalty. Will the German government bail out its flagship bank? This looks unlikely. Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, would not want to prop up a bank that survived the 2008 crisis without a bailout. And even if she wanted to do so, new rules mean bond holders would be forced to take losses first. But if it was a last resort, analysts have said they expect her to intervene. What are the options? The one that shareholders fear is a cash call on shareholders, although the shares have fallen so low that any capital raising would dilute existing investors. The market reckons Deutsche can afford a DoJ settlement of up to \u20ac6bn without raising cash. Other options involve more restructuring. Crockford said: \u201cOne option would be to sell asset management, or other parts of the business that have a more attractive return profile than the core business and investment bank, such as private wealth management.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Worries about Deutsche Bank vied with an attempted rally after Hillary Clinton was deemed by many pundits to have won the first presidential debate, leaving European markets in an uncertain mood. For most of the day the concerns about the banking sector won out, but a revival in Deutache Bank itself - which ended the day unchanged - helped produce a mini-recovery. US markets did better, helped by a strong set of consumer confidence figures. And then there was the oil price, which fell sharply as the chances of a deal to curb output at this week\u2019s producers\u2019 meeting seemed to recede. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets have confounded the initial enthusiasm generated off the back of the US presidential debate...This pessimistic continuation of Monday\u2019s sharp losses says a lot about the expectations ahead of the oil-producers meeting conclusion. Today\u2019s losses also say a lot about the wary nature of markets as we head into the business end of this election race, for we have seen before Donald Trump\u2019s ability to defy any bumps along the way. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 10.37 points or 0.15% at 6807.67 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.31% to 10,361.48 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.21% at 4398.68 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.36% to 16,134.71 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.27% to 8688.2 In Athens the Greek market lost 0.21% to 562.40 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 132 points or 0.7%. Meanwhile in the oil market, Brent crude is down 3.2% at $45.79 while West Texas Intermediate has lost 3.4% to $44.36. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, recently said there were too many banks in Europe, and now he has backing from a member of the Bundesbank: As we reported earlier, the Mexican currency bounced back from record lows in the immediate aftermath of the US presidential debate, with Hillary Clinton deemed by many to have won the day. And it could recover further, reckon Capital Economics. The consultancy\u2019s David Rees writes: The Mexican peso appreciated by more than 2% against the US dollar shortly after the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, appeared to prevail in the first US presidential debate on Monday. The fortunes of the peso in recent months have been closely tied with the likelihood that the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, will triumph in the upcoming presidential election. That is hardly surprising, given that Mr. Trump has taken a particularly bellicose stance towards Mexico. And he has repeatedly talked about pursuing more protectionist trade policies, which would be bad news for Mexico\u2019s open and US-dependent economy. In the first instance, a victory for Mr. Trump on 8th November would probably cause the peso \u2013 and indeed most emerging market (EM) currencies \u2013 to weaken against the US dollar. And uncertainty regarding future trade policy, including a possible re-negotiation of the NAFTA trade accord, could weigh on the Mexican currency and ensure that it remains volatile. But we do not believe that the worse fears of protectionism will be borne out...And once the dust settles on the US election and a probable Fed rate hike in December, we would not be surprised to see the peso stage something of a comeback in the next couple of years, as prior structural reforms help economic growth to finally build momentum. And maybe there isn\u2019t an oil deal after all: The oil price continues to slide as the prospect of any deal to curb output at this week\u2019s producers meeting in Algeria recedes. Despite the reported proposal to cut production by 1m barrels a day - to be discussed on Wednesday - it seems unlikely Iran will agree, keen as it is to return output to the levels it enjoyed before the economic sanctions on the country. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The price of oil dropped on Tuesday, leaving the price of Brent crude within the $46-$48 range it has been in for the last week in the lead-up to the meeting in Algiers. The drop came as Iranian oil minister Zanganeh indicated that Iran was not willing to freeze oil output at current levels. More interestingly Zanganeh said Iran is targeting its pre-sanctions oil market share of 12-13%. The assumption had been that Iran was targeting 4m barrel per day, but 12-13% of a higher OPEC total output since Iran was sanctioned implies a higher figure. Iran could be targeting something closer to 4.5-5m barrels per day in output, making a freeze agreement unlikely this year. Brent crude is down 2.8% at $46.02 while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has lost 2.94% to $44.58. Returning to the positive US consumer confidence figures, which seem to give more ammunition to the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be delighted to see an above-expectations rise in consumer confidence for September, which follows on from an already strong August. Yellen was singled out for criticism by Donald Trump during last night\u2019s presidential debate, with the presidential hopeful accusing Yellen of keeping interest rates low for political reasons. The question now is whether Yellen pulls the trigger on a rate hike at the next Fed meeting \u2013 which happens to take place just days before the polls open and America votes for its next president. Back with oil, and the producers\u2019 meeting in Algeria. The Wall Street Journal is reporting a deal would be put on the table involving an output cut of 1m barrels a day, but it is unlikely to be agreed tomorrow: The positive US data seems to have help inspire Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up 67 points or 0.37%. American consumers are not being put off by worries about the global economy, oil prices, Brexit or the forthcoming election, to judge from the latest Conference Board figures. The consumer confidence index came in at 104.1, higher than the 99 reading analysts had expected and better than August\u2019s 101.8. This is the best level since August 2007. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence increased in September for a second consecutive month and is now at its highest level since the recession. Consumers\u2019 assessment of present-day conditions improved, primarily the result of a more positive view of the labor market. Looking ahead, consumers are more upbeat about the short-term employment outlook, but somewhat neutral about business conditions and income prospects. Overall, consumers continue to rate current conditions favorably and foresee moderate economic expansion in the months ahead. The Markit survey may have shown an improvement in September but the outlook is not all rosy. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The service sector sent mixed signals in September, with faster growth of activity during the month offset by gloomy forward-looking indicators. Although business activity showed the largest monthly rise since April, inflows of new business slowed and employment growth was the weakest for three-and-a-half years. A drop in optimism about the year ahead to a near post-crisis low meanwhile cast a shadow over the outlook. What\u2019s more, even with the latest uptick in activity, the overall rate of economic growth remains subdued. Add these service sector results to the manufacturing data and the PMI surveys suggest that the economy is growing at an annualised rate of only around 1% again in the third quarter. The slowdown in hiring means the survey results are consistent with a 120,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September, which is a solid rate of expansion but somewhat disappointing compared to the gains seen earlier in the year. The slowdown in hiring is perhaps a natural symptom of the economy reaching full employment, but companies also reported a reduced appetite to hire and job losses due to weaker inflows of new business and worries about the outlook. Back with the US, and more better than expected economic data. Markit\u2019s initial purchasing managers\u2019 index for the service sector in September came in at 51.9, higher than the forecast 51.1 and August\u2019s final reading of 51. The composite index was up from 51.5 last month to 52. The outlook for Deutsche Bank continues to be uncertain, analysts reckon. Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities, said: We don\u2019t see any immediate catalysts that could change the uncertain outlook on Deutsche Bank and the weakness in Deutsche Bank spreads is hard to reverse in the absence of proper constructive news on the capital story. Profitability will remain challenging but capital is certainly the most pressing factor right now. We believe that the sub and senior will be subject to volatility but that they are essentially money good. On the AT1s [CoCo bonds] our central scenario is that they won\u2019t switch off coupons, but it can\u2019t be ruled out. We still see risk as significant and that needs to be priced in. However, if the Department of Justice\u2019s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary (which would most likely be very beneficial to the AT1s). ABN Amro analysts believe significant restructuring is required: Equity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank (DB), as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015.... Crucially, despite restructuring, continual low and even negative net income quarters are draining the ability DB has to naturally increase its capital position. Their capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if DB wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders. The delayed sale of DB\u2019s stake in Hua Xia will be vital to help facilitate a suitable capital position for this year end. However, this is not a silver bullet and would only add a temporary \u20ac1.6bn uplift to [its Tier 1 capital ratio]. So more is needed... The payment request from the DoJ is just the tip of the iceberg of issues surrounding DB, as a number of other litigation suits remain open. The potential fines dwarf the \u20ac5.5bn DB have set aside for litigation. AT1 coupons are potentially at risk dependent on the timing/amount of the recent DoJ fine. Anything over \u20ac6bn will cause real problems for the payments. At present, we believe, the bank could weather short term capital issues for AT1 write-downs not to be an issue... In February DB were adamant in protecting their AT1 investors, but it is something that may not be so happy with going forward as already embattled equity holders would get stung for providing this benefit. The going concern for the company should be maintained provided the payment of the litigation charges is not demanded in the short term. We see a demand for the fines to be paid urgently as an unlikely scenario. It is both in the interest, of the bank to continue to function, and of the authorities to receive payment. More on Deutsche Bank and the repercussions if there was to be state aid from Germany, with some saying the country\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble will be the key player: Meanwhile Thomas Oppermann of the Social Democratic Party has weighed in: As has Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem: The Clinton rally in US markets has fizzled out before it even began. Banks - in the wake of Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price fall - and Brexit continue to weigh on investors\u2019 minds, while a fall in the oil price is also undermining confidence. With fading expectations of a deal to support the price at this week\u2019s meeting of oil producers, Brent crude is down 2.66% at $46.09. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up just 5 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have opened slightly lower. US house prices have continued to rise sharply, perhaps dangerously so, according to the latest Case-Shiller index. Prices rose by 5% year-on-year in July, slightly lower than June\u2019s 5.1%. That\u2019s more than twice as fast as consumer price inflation. And David Blitzer of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which produces the report, reckons it can\u2019t last. \u201cGiven that the overall inflation is a bit below 2%, the pace is probably not sustainable over the long term.\u201d Wall Street is expecting the next few weeks to be pretty fraught, in the run-up to the election on November 8th. Art Hogan, chief market strategistat Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets, says: \u201cVolatility is going to be the norm, not the exception over the next several weeks.\u201d At one stage, we expected the US stock market to jump by around 0.7% at the open. But now we\u2019re heading towards a flat start. Reuters has now published the full quotes from Angela Merkel about the Deutsche Bank crisis: German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed hope on Tuesday that problems at Deutsche Bank could be solved after the lender made clear it needed no state aid with a $14 billion U.S. demand to settle claims it missold mortgage-backed securities. Asked during a news conference if Berlin was concerned about Deutsche Bank and was considering assistance for the lender, Merkel said: \u201cI only want to say that Deutsche Bank is a part of the German banking and financial sector. And of course we hope that all companies, also if they face temporary problems, can develop in the right direction.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment beyond that,\u201d she added. Deutsche Bank said on Monday it had no need for German government help. Wall Street is expected to open a little higher in an hour\u2019s time, after New York has digested last night\u2019s debate. Court news.... A rogue trader who scammed investors out of millions of pounds to fuel a hedonistic lifestyle of nightclubs and champagne has been sentenced to an extra 603 days imprisonment. Alex Hope, who was jailed for 7 years in 2015, incurred the extra penalty for failing to obey a confiscation order made against him. He had been ordered to repay \u00a3166,696, but has actually only handed over \u00a31,00 so far. FCA director Mark Stewart says: As a result of the work of the FCA, almost \u00a32.65 million was identified and frozen in accounts controlled by Mr Hope, which was returned to investors earlier this year. Mr Hope spent a significant proportion of the remainder of the funds on a lavish lifestyle, including gifts to family and friends. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the value of tainted gifts can be recovered and Mr Hope was ordered to pay a sum equal to the value of the gifts he made to friends and family. Hope\u2019s outstanding penalty is accruing \u00a336 interest per day, and he\u2019ll still owe the full amount once released. Here\u2019s Hope back in January 2015 - he originally hit the headlines for running up a huge bar bill. German chancellor Angela Merkel has told reporters in Berlin that she hopes the \u2018temporary\u2019 problems at Deutsche Bank can be solved. She\u2019s holding a press conference with Malaysia\u2019s PM, Najib Razak. But she doesn\u2019t seem to have said much about the possible need for state aid to recapitalise the bank (something Deutsche insists isn\u2019t needed). Never work with animals, children, or the Scottish weather. That\u2019s the lesson from Grangemouth this morning, where energy company Ineos is celebrating the first arrival of its first shipment of US shale gas. My colleague Rob Davies has raced to see the big moment, but reports that it\u2019s too blustery for the boat to dock! Rob\u2019s still doing his best to keep us entertained, though: The World Trade Organisation has added to the gloom this morning, by slashing its forecast for trade growth this year to just 1.7%, down from 2.8%. That would be the first time since 2001 that trade has grown slower than the world economy. Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s shares are getting a hoofing, down 4% today. It\u2019s being hit by the worries over Deutsche Bank; RBS is also facing the prospect of a large penalty from the DoJ, for mis-selling toxic mortgage securities. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: The German bank is now down another 3%, and is threatening to drop under \u20ac10 for the first time in around 30 years. This has sparked another round of losses in the European banking sector, with Barclays, HSBC and Societe Generale all seeing notable declines. Royal Bank of Scotland actually surpassed Deutsche Bank\u2019s morning drop, percentage-wise at least, with investors fearful that the same kind of fine could hit RBS when its settlement with the US Department of Justice is finally revealed. That rally in the Mexican peso is fizzling out too, as the Clinton debate bounce comes to a halt: The sudden swings in the markets this morning show that volatility is back with a bang. With the US presidential election still up for grabs, and Deutsche Bank still troubled, this could be a wild autumn. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga is concerned that this morning\u2019s \u2018Clinton bounce\u2019 didn\u2019t last: Stock markets received a slight welcome boost on Tuesday with most major arena\u2019s swinging back into gains as talks of Hillary Clinton winning the first US presidential debate renewed risk appetite. Although Asian equities managed to charge into green territory post-debate, gains were swiftly relinquished in Europe amid the heavy losses in banks and carmakers. Wall Street could be exposed to steeper losses if the bearish domino effect from Europe provides a solid foundation for sellers to attack. It is becoming increasingly clear that the short term gains observed in stocks are becoming unsustainable with the ingredients of bear market potentially leaving stock markets exposed to heavy losses in the future. If this selloff continues, Deutsche Bank shares will fall below the \u20ac10 mark for the first time in three decades: The Financial Times is reporting that one of Germany\u2019s smaller banks has cancelled a bond sale, in a sign of edginess in the markets. Here\u2019s a flavour: A regional German bank has pulled a bond sale citing \u201cmarket conditions\u201d, as Deutsche Bank shares have tumbled to fresh multi-decade lows. NordLB was due to sell a seven-year senior unsecured bond, but informed investors they would not proceed on Tuesday morning, report Thomas Hale in London and James Shotter in Frankfurt. The senior unsecured bond was initially expected to price around mid-swaps plus 90 basis points. The pulled Landesbank bond comes after Lufthansa also cancelled a debt sale on Monday, also pointing to the \u201cpricing achievable in the current market\u201d Oh dear, this morning\u2019s stock market rally is fizzling out -- before some Europeans have fully caught up with the drama in America. Deutsche Bank is to blame -- its shares have slipped to fresh record lows in the last few minutes. Currently down 2.65% at \u20ac10.29, a level not seen since the 1980s. This has send Germany\u2019s stock market down 1% into the red, and erased the early gains in London too. Worries about Deutsche Bank\u2019s financial strength are, well, trumping any relief following last night\u2019s debate. Other European banks are also falling, with Germany\u2019s Commerzbank down 2.9%. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Declines in prominent German and Swiss banks have revived fears of a European banking crisis. Stocks had opened moderately higher in a small nod to establishment candidate Hilary Clinton winning the US presidential debate. As explained earlier, investors are worried that Angela Merkel might not step in to protect Deutsche from the possibility of a $14bn fine from US authorities. Deutsche\u2019s market value is now just $16bn, meaning it could struggle to raise enough capital to pay off the fine. Writing in the Telegraph today, Matthew Lynn argues that the situation is terribly serious: If the German government does not stand behind the bank, then inevitably all its counter-parties \u2013 the other banks and institutions it deals with \u2013 are going to start feeling very nervous about trading with it. As we know from 2008, once confidence starts to evaporate, a bank is in big, big trouble. In fact, if Deutsche does go down, it is looking increasingly likely that it will take Merkel with it \u2013 and quite possibly the euro as well. More here: The Deutsche Bank crisis could take Angela Merkel down \u2013 and the Euro The surge in the Mexican peso shows that investors are pleased with Clinton\u2019s performance, says Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK. She says: A vote for Clinton is considered a vote for the status quo and markets will welcome sustained accommodating monetary policy under her administration. City investors have been backing Hillary Clinton to win November\u2019s election, according to IG: Gambling firm Betway have also cut the odds of a Clinton victory, to just 2/5: Betway\u2019s Alan Alger, said: \u201cDonald Trump was forced to backtrack and defend himself against Hillary Clinton for much of last night\u2019s debate. The betting now firmly suggests the Democrat candidate has stretched her lead in the race to the White House. \u201cClinton may have appeared weak during her bout of ill health earlier this month, but punters think she looked strong last night and we\u2019ve cut here odds from 4/6 to 2/5. \u201cThose that think the Donald can talk his way back into the election battle can take 15/8 \u2013 the longest his odds have been in over a fortnight.\u201d However... we have been here before, in June, when the betting markets suggested Britain would remain in the EU. Back to last night\u2019s debate... and Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit argues that Donald Trump didn\u2019t do too badly: But The Economist itself reckons the Republican gaffed over his tax bill: FT editor Lionel Barber also calls it for Clinton: And polling expert Nate Silver shows how Trump kept shoving his oar in: It\u2019s a bad morning for British workers at building supplies firm Wolseley. It has announced plans to close 80 UK stores, with the loss of 800 jobs, as part of a major restructuring. It hopes to redeploy some workers, but the axe could fall heavily at its distribution centre in Worcester. Wolseley shares have slumped by 3.8% this morning, after it also missed profit expectations. In other news....Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares are becalmed this morning, up just 0.1% at \u20ac10.31, after yesterday\u2019s 7.5% tumble. Investors were rattled on Monday, following reports that German chancellor Angela Merkel was refusing to provide state aid to the lender. Deutsche Bank insists that it hasn\u2019t even asked for help, but with a $14bn fine looming \u2013 close to Deutsche\u2019s market value \u2013 the situation is tough. City veteran David Buik says the uncertainty over Deutsche is worrying: I feel sorry for CEO John Cryan who inherited a hospital pass, when he stepped up to the plate in June 2016. These shares have lost significant value \u2013 down from \u20ac39 in January 2014 and \u20ac23.51 a year ago to \u20ac10.64 \u2013 down 71% and 54% respectively. Just to put some meat on the bone in July 2007 Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price was \u20ac99.60! What markets cannot cope with is uncertainty and that sensation is there in spades, with John Cryan, probably very frustrated in being able to say very little. You can catch up with all the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the debate here: US Election 2016 Here\u2019s our expert panel verdict: And here\u2019s David Smith\u2019s account of how Clinton scored points against her rival: Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to order on Monday night in probably the most watched \u2013 and certainly the weirdest and wildest \u2013 presidential debate in American history. She demanded explanations over his tax returns, his treatment of workers, his temperament as the man with his finger on the nuclear trigger. As he ducked and dived with incoherent excuses, she stared at him with thinly veiled contempt. Then, right at the end, like a long-suffering, frosty school principal, she decided to expel the ranting, sniffling, whining 70-year-old schoolboy who had not done his homework. Trump had said she did not have the stamina to be president. Icy and deadly, Clinton replied: \u201cWell, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u201d The Canadian dollar has also strengthened, in another sign that Clinton performed better last night (in the markets\u2019 view, anyway). Arnaud Masset, analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The foreign exchange market reacted sharply to yesterday\u2019s first US presidential debate. Emerging market currencies were broadly better bid, especially the Mexican peso but it was the Canadian dollar, which appreciated the most as experts concurred that Hillary Clinton had won this first round. The Canadian dollar was also in demand after the debate with USD/CAD falling back below the 1.32 threshold, down to 1.3166. Here are some video clips of last night\u2019s debate, for those European readers who weren\u2019t awake in the middle of the night FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says the markets have awarded last night\u2019s debate to the Democratic candidate, but it\u2019s not all over.... Round one of the U.S. presidential debate is over and as expected big punches were exchanged from both sides, but clearly no knockout blows were landed. Although polls were showing different outcomes of who won the debate, financial markets obviously declared Clinton as the winner. Asian shares recovered some of yesterday\u2019s losses and European stocks opened higher, meanwhile U.S. futures are also indicating a positive open. However, the best financial asset proxy to the U.S. presidential race is the Mexican Peso which rose by more than 1.5% against the U.S. dollar after declining to a new record low yesterday. The higher the Mexican currency goes suggests higher probability for Clinton reaching the White House as Trump repeatedly raged against globalisation and free trade agreements. The Aussie, Kiwi and Yen also supported the opinion that Hillary Clinton won the first presidential debate. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale agrees: A snap poll by CNN/ORC has found that Hillary Clinton won last night\u2019s debate, pretty conclusively. They report that: Hillary Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday night\u2019s debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Donald Trump had the better night, according to a CNN/ORC Poll of voters who watched the debate. That drubbing is similar to Mitt Romney\u2019s dominant performance over President Barack Obama in the first 2012 presidential debate. Voters who watched said Clinton expressed her views more clearly than Trump and had a better understanding of the issues by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Clinton also was seen as having done a better job addressing concerns voters might have about her potential presidency by a 57% to 35% margin, and as the stronger leader by a 56% to 39% margin. If you want a clear sign of which candidate won last night\u2019s debate, in investors\u2019 eyes, then look at the Mexican currency. The Mexican peso has surged overnight, gaining 1.5% against the US dollar. That\u2019s a decent recovery from the record low it plumbed yesterday. That means $1 is worth 19.575 peso, down from 19.9 peso before the debate began. The peso has become the market\u2019s preferred measure of tracking the chances of a Trump victory, given his attacks on free trade and his pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Asian stock markets also rose overnight, as Trump and Clinton swapped blows over everything from the Trans-Pacific Partnership to the \u2018Birther row\u2019 over Barack Obama\u2019s origins. Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei jumped 1%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng gained 1.3%, and China\u2019s main markets closed 0.6% higher. And that\u2019s feeding through to Europe\u2019s markets this morning, as this graphic shows: Shares are rallying across Europe this morning, as investors digest the first US presidential debate (which took place while most of them were asleep). In London, the FTSE 100 index has gained 26 points or 0.4% in early trading. European markets are showing bigger gains, with the Paris market up by 0.7%. Traders appear to be taking the view that Hillary Clinton came out best yesterday, after a 90 minute battle in which Donald Trump lost his cool more than once. Although Clinton didn\u2019t deliver a knock-out blow, the Democratic candidate did seem more sure-footed on the key issues. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx points out that we\u2019ve not recovered all of Monday\u2019s losses yet: With Clinton seemingly stumping Trump in the first presidential debate a semblance of calm has returned to the markets. Yesterday saw a series of market-wide declines prompted, among other things, by the reminder that come November Donald Trump could be the new President of the United States of America. This morning, however, the European indices have taken anywhere between 0.6% and 0.8% back, arguably thanks to Hilary Clinton\u2019s better received performance at last night\u2019s debate. Whether or not that translates to a boost in the polls, especially given the contrarian, disenfranchised mind-set of many of Trump\u2019s supporters, is unclear (perhaps explaining why the market\u2019s good mood isn\u2019t as good as its bad mood was bad on Monday). For now, however, the European indices are rebounding and, considering Brent Crude is flat and Deutsche Bank is still effectively at all-time lows, it\u2019s hard not to pin the turnaround on the results of yesterday\u2019s presidential nominee showdown. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors have a lot to think about today, both in the financial markets and the world of politics. Firstly, the US presidential race has gathered steam overnight after a bruising clash between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The two candidates to take control of the White House traded blows over economic policy, trade, and climate change. Personal issues, including Trump\u2019s coyness to release his tax returns and Clinton\u2019s deleted emails, added extra spice to the battle. Listening under the duvet in Britain, the Democratic candidate appeared to outshine her rival. But here\u2019s what my US colleagues thought: Donald Trump\u2019s freewheeling approach spun wildly out of control in the first presidential debate as he was forced on the defensive during a chaotic clash with Hillary Clinton. Goaded by Clinton and pressed hard by moderator Lester Holt, the Republican nominee angrily defended his record against charges of racism, sexism and tax avoidance for much of the 90-minute clash at Hofstra University, outside New York. Trump hit Clinton on trade and her political record \u2013 issues that have helped him draw level in recent polls and may yet dominate the election \u2013 but the property tycoon appeared thin-skinned and under-prepared as he sniffled his way through the debate. Clinton shows strength over Trump in one of history\u2019s weirdest, wildest debatesRead more \u201cIt\u2019s all words, it\u2019s all soundbites,\u201d he retorted after a particularly one-sided exchange, adding that Clinton was a \u201ctypical politician: all talk, no action\u201d. More here: And here: Closer to home, traders are watching Germany\u2019s largest bank with growing concern. Yesterday, Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares hit their lowest level in a generation as it fought to persuade investors that it doesn\u2019t need to be bailed out by the Berlin government. But Deutsche Bank still faces the threat of a $14bn fine for mis-selling US mortgage securities, so concerns over its future aren\u2019t going away. And then there\u2019s the oil price; energy ministers are expected to hold an informal Opec meeting on Wednesday to discuss a potential deal to cap production. Brent crude rallied late last night, on hopes Also coming up today Britain\u2019s business leaders are gathering for the Institute of Directors\u2019 annual convention. We\u2019re expecting to hear a lot about Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, after fears of a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 sent the pound down to a five-week low yesterday. At 11am BST, the CBI publishes its retail sales figures for September. That will show if consumers kept spending despite Brexit uncertainty. The latest US house prices figures are due at 2pm BST (9am in New York), followed an hour latest by the consumer confidence stats. And in the City, we\u2019re getting results from holiday group Thomas Cook and building supplies firm Wolseley.",

And it could recover further, reckon Capital Economics. The consultancy\u2019s David Rees writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Mexican peso appreciated by more than 2% against the US dollar shortly after the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, appeared to prevail in the first US presidential debate on Monday.</p> <p>The fortunes of the peso in recent months have been closely tied with the likelihood that the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, will triumph in the upcoming presidential election. That is hardly surprising, given that Mr. Trump has taken a particularly bellicose stance towards Mexico. And he has repeatedly talked about pursuing more protectionist trade policies, which would be bad news for Mexico\u2019s open and US-dependent economy.</p> <p>In the first instance, a victory for Mr. Trump on 8th November would probably cause the peso \u2013 and indeed most emerging market (EM) currencies \u2013 to weaken against the US dollar. And uncertainty regarding future trade policy, including a possible re-negotiation of the NAFTA trade accord, could weigh on the Mexican currency and ensure that it remains volatile.</p> <p>But we do not believe that the worse fears of protectionism will be borne out...And once the dust settles on the US election and a probable Fed rate hike in December, we would not be surprised to see the peso stage something of a comeback in the next couple of years, as prior structural reforms help economic growth to finally build momentum. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8c6be4b04cbd30bc3a55\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T15:12:59.937Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And maybe there isn\u2019t an oil deal after all:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HermsTheWord/status/780783664393314304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Iran&#39;s Zanganeh emerges from meeting with Russia&#39;s Novak.

Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The price of oil dropped on Tuesday, leaving the price of Brent crude within the $46-$48 range it has been in for the last week in the lead-up to the meeting in Algiers. The drop came as Iranian oil minister Zanganeh indicated that Iran was not willing to freeze oil output at current levels. More interestingly Zanganeh said Iran is targeting its pre-sanctions oil market share of 12-13%.</p> <p>The assumption had been that Iran was targeting 4m barrel per day, but 12-13% of a higher OPEC total output since Iran was sanctioned implies a higher figure. Iran could be targeting something closer to 4.5-5m barrels per day in output, making a freeze agreement unlikely this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brent crude is down 2.8% at $46.02 while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has lost 2.94% to $44.58.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T15:10:45.383Z\">at 4.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea82a8e4b091b7fa2b5a3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:32:07.024Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Returning to the positive US consumer confidence figures, which seem to give more ammunition to the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates.</strong> Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be delighted to see an above-expectations rise in consumer confidence for September, which follows on from an already strong August.</p> <p>Yellen was singled out for criticism by Donald Trump during last night\u2019s presidential debate, with the presidential hopeful accusing Yellen of keeping interest rates low for political reasons.

Although business activity showed the largest monthly rise since April, inflows of new business slowed and employment growth was the weakest for three-and-a-half years. A drop in optimism about the year ahead to a near post-crisis low meanwhile cast a shadow over the outlook.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, even with the latest uptick in activity, the overall rate of economic growth remains subdued. Add these service sector results to the manufacturing data and the PMI surveys suggest that the economy is growing at an annualised rate of only around 1% again in the third quarter.</p> <p>The slowdown in hiring means the survey results are consistent with a 120,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September, which is a solid rate of expansion but somewhat disappointing compared to the gains seen earlier in the year.</p> <p>The slowdown in hiring is perhaps a natural symptom of the economy reaching full employment, but companies also reported a reduced appetite to hire and job losses due to weaker inflows of new business and worries about the outlook.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"531855a6a86e79d451b3227c4afa6c1efb9c2062\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/531855a6a86e79d451b3227c4afa6c1efb9c2062/0_0_736_558/500.jpg\" alt=\"US service sector\" width=\"500\" height=\"379\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US service sector</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IHS Markit</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:03:57.641Z\">at 3.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea79f8e4b091b7fa2b5a06\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:58:06.056Z\">2.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with the US, and more better than expected economic data.</strong></p> <p>Markit\u2019s initial purchasing managers\u2019 index for the service sector in September came in at 51.9, higher than the forecast 51.1 and August\u2019s final reading of 51.</p> <p>The composite index was up from 51.5 last month to 52.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/780767223510134784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics\">@MarkitEconomics</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/US?src=hash\">#US</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDP?src=hash\">#GDP</a> only grew around 1% q/q AR in Q3 supporting our view that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> will not hike this year <a href=\"https://t.co/zCRXavmbDT\">pic.twitter.com/zCRXavmbDT</a></p>&mdash; Danske Bank Research (@Danske_Research) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/780767223510134784\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea77e1e4b091b7fa2b59fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:53:53.529Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The outlook for Deutsche Bank continues to be uncertain, analysts reckon. Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t see any immediate catalysts that could change the uncertain outlook on Deutsche Bank and the weakness in Deutsche Bank spreads is hard to reverse in the absence of proper constructive news on the capital story. Profitability will remain challenging but capital is certainly the most pressing factor right now.</p> <p>We believe that the sub and senior will be subject to volatility but that they are essentially money good. On the AT1s [CoCo bonds] our central scenario is that they won\u2019t switch off coupons, but it can\u2019t be ruled out. We still see risk as significant and that needs to be priced in. However, if the Department of Justice\u2019s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary (which would most likely be very beneficial to the AT1s). </p> </blockquote> <p>ABN Amro analysts believe significant restructuring is required:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank (DB), as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015....</p> <p> Crucially, despite restructuring, continual low and even negative net income quarters are draining the ability DB has to naturally increase its capital position. Their capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if DB wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders.</p> <p> The delayed sale of DB\u2019s stake in Hua Xia will be vital to help facilitate a suitable capital position for this year end. However, this is not a silver bullet and would only add a temporary \u20ac1.6bn uplift to [its Tier 1 capital ratio]. So more is needed...</p> <p>The payment request from the DoJ is just the tip of the iceberg of issues surrounding DB, as a number of other litigation suits remain open. The potential fines dwarf the \u20ac5.5bn DB have set aside for litigation. </p> <p>AT1 coupons are potentially at risk dependent on the timing/amount of the recent DoJ fine. Anything over \u20ac6bn will cause real problems for the payments. At present, we believe, the bank could weather short term capital issues for AT1 write-downs not to be an issue...

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned that free trade is increasingly seen as benefiting only the well-off and that help is needed for those whose job prospects have been damaged by globalisation in order to put fresh momentum behind removing barriers to international commerce. In a chapter from the half-yearly World Economic Outlook study released ahead of its annual meeting next week, the IMF said the weakness of the global economy, rather than a wave of protectionism, had been largely responsible for the sharp slowdown in trade growth over the past four years. But it said the uptick in protectionist measures since the financial crisis had \u201cnot been innocuous\u201d and stressed that anti-trade sentiment could harden. The IMF noted there had been studies showing \u201csignificant and long-lasting adjustment costs\u201d for those whose job opportunities had been impaired by the structural changes associated with the trend, even if the lower prices generated by globalisation helped those on low incomes. \u201cAn increasingly popular narrative that sees the benefits of globalisation and trade accrue only to a fortunate few is also gaining traction,\u201d the IMF study said. \u201cPolicymakers need to address the concerns of trade-affected workers, including through effective support for retraining, skill building and occupational and geographic mobility, to mitigate the downsides of further trade integration for the trade agenda to revive.\u201d The IMF said global trade had grown by just over 3% per year since 2012, less than half the average rate of expansion during the previous three decades. \u201cThe slowdown in trade growth is remarkable, especially when set against the historical relationship between growth in trade and global economic activity. Between 1985 and 2007, real world trade grew on average twice as fast as global GDP, whereas over the past four years it has barely kept pace. Such prolonged sluggish growth in trade volumes relative to economic activity has few historical precedents during the past five decades.\u201d Calls for greater protectionism have featured in the US presidential race, but the IMF said three-quarters of the decline in trade growth since 2012 relative to 2003\u201307, the four years prior to the global crisis, was the result of weaker economic activity and in particular subdued investment growth. However, it said other factors \u2013 including the lack of new trade deals \u2013 had also shaved 1.75 percentage points off trade growth. \u201cThe pace of new trade policy initiatives at the global level has slowed notably. At the same time, the uptick in protectionism since the global financial crisis is not innocuous. \u201cWhile the quantitative contribution of trade policies to the slowdown in trade growth has been limited so far, protectionist measures could significantly weigh on global trade if they become more widespread.\u201d In a separate chapter, the IMF said there were signs that the anti-deflation policies being pursued by central banks around the world were becoming less effective, and urged a broader mix of actions to increase demand. \u201cGiven the broad-based nature of the disinflation and the corresponding fact that many countries are easing monetary policy at the same time, dampening the downward pressure that monetary policy easing exerts on the exchange rate, monetary policy stimulus on its own may not be sufficient to keep medium-term inflation expectations anchored at central bank targets. \u201cA comprehensive package consisting of a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policy, an expansionary fiscal stance where fiscal space is available, demand-supportive structural reforms and measures aimed at addressing weaknesses in bank and corporate balance sheets should play a complementary role in mitigating the risk of protracted weak demand and low inflation.\u201d",

The CBI\u2019s health check of retailers and wholesale businesses found that the balance of firms reporting a fall in sales over the last year dropped to -8 from a high of +9 in August. Good weather in much of the country failed to prevent a decline in sales of groceries, food and drink and leather.

The CBI survey may simply indicate that consumers took a breather in September after spending at a robust clip over the summer and through the second quarter,\u201d he said. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics show that retail sales volumes were up 6.2% in August on the year before after a huge post-Brexit vote bounce in July, when sales volumes increased by 1.9% on June. Archer said there was little sign of a sudden drop in sales, despite the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \u201cThe fundamentals are currently still pretty healthy for consumers with employment at a record high and purchasing power benefiting from earnings growth running well above consumer price inflation. \u201cSpecifically, employment was up 174,000 in the three months to July while earnings growth of 2.3% in the three months to July (the usual benchmark used) was 1.7 percentage points above consumer price inflation of 0.6% in both July and August.\u201d Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the situation for shoppers may worsen over the next six months as inflation increases and wage rises stagnate or fall back towards 1%, squeezing real disposable incomes.

      "bodyText": "The owner of Alton Towers has been fined a record \u00a35m for the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d rollercoaster crash that left five passengers with life-changing injuries and others seriously hurt. The judge, Michael Chambers QC, said Merlin Attractions Operations\u2019 safety procedures were \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and a \u201cshambles\u201d in scathing criticism over the Smiler crash on 2 June last year. He added: \u201cThis was a needless and avoidable accident in which those injured were fortunate not to have been killed or to have bled to death.\u201d The two-day sentencing at Stafford crown court heard how the crash was like a 90mph car accident, and that the victims waited nearly an hour in mid-air before paramedics were able to access the \u00a318m rollercoaster. Chambers said Vicky Balch and Leah Washington, who each lost a leg, were fortunate not to have bled to death in the four to five hours they were trapped in the Smiler. On that day Alton Towers \u201cfell well short\u201d of the safety standards expected of the UK\u2019s biggest theme park, the judge added. Outside court, the victims\u2019 lawyer, Paul Paxton, welcomed the record-breaking fine but said \u201cmoney alone will never repair limbs or heal the psychological scars\u201d. Standing on the steps of the court alongside the victims, he said: \u201cSymbolically and practically, today marks a closure for what has been a long painful chapter for my clients, one in which they have frequently been exposed to the horrors of that day back in June last year. \u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that this hearing is the first time that my clients have heard the full extent of the criticism against Merlin. To be candid, they have been shocked and disappointed by the catalogue of errors. The list goes on and on. \u201cThe catastrophic failure to assess risk, the inadequate training, inadequate supervision, inadequate management, failure to communicate, failure to put in place safe systems of work. \u201cBut this has not been about retribution. This has been about finding out why this accident happened and making sure that lessons have been learned, not just by Merlin but by others throughout the industry, and I think my clients can take comfort from that.\u201d In his sentencing, the judge rejected Merlin\u2019s assertion that the crash was down to \u201chuman error\u201d. It was, he said, the company\u2019s \u201ccatastrophic failure to assess risk and have a structured system of work\u201d. Investigators from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which brought the prosecution, found that a chain of errors led staff to override a safety warning when an empty test carriage got stuck on the track in strong winds. Engineers mistakenly believed the safety warning was a false alarm, the investigation found, and released the next carriage full of passengers, with the disastrous effect that it crashed at high-speed into the empty test carriage. Engineers were \u201cdoing their best in a flawed system\u201d, the judge said, describing the lack of proper safety systems as \u201ca serious breach of a high duty of care which put thousands at risk of death or serious injury over a long period of time and which caused devastating injuries to a significant number of people\u201d. Chambers said he did not believe the crash had affected Merlin\u2019s business, which turns over \u00a350m a year, and said the fine would have been \u00a37.5m if the case had gone to trial. It was reduced by a third, to \u00a35m, after the company\u2019s early guilty plea. On the steps of the court alongside Balch, Washington and seriously injured passengers Joe Pugh, Daniel Thorpe and Chandaben Chauhan, the HSE\u2019s head of operations for the Midlands, Neil Craig, said Merlin \u201clet them badly down\u201d and failed to protect their customers. \u201cIt is right that they have been held to account for those failings in a criminal court,\u201d he said. \u201cThis avoidable incident happened because Merlin failed to put in place systems that would have allowed their engineers to work safely on the ride while it was running. This made it all too easy for a whole series of unchecked mistakes, not just the single push of a button, to result in tragedy. Nick Varney, the chief executive of Merlin, refused to say whether he would resign when he gave a short statement outside court. He repeated the company\u2019s apology to the victims and offered them support \u201cfor as long as they need it\u201d and added: \u201cAlton Towers and the wider Merlin group are not emotionless corporate entities, they are made up of human beings who care passionately about what they do. \u201cIn that respect the far bigger punishment for all of us is that on this occasion we let people down with such devastating consequences. It is something none of us will ever forget and it is something we are absolutely determined will never be repeated.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Shale gas ban 'would cement decline of UK manufacturing'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The billionaire hoping to become Britain\u2019s biggest fracker has said banning shale gas would cement the decline of UK manufacturing, as he brushed off environmental concerns about the hotly disputed energy source. Speaking as his petrochemicals firm Ineos took delivery of the first ever shipment of shale gas from the US, Jim Ratcliffe addressed Labour\u2019s announcement that it would ban fracking, which he insists could create jobs in some of the party\u2019s former industrial heartlands. Asked about the impact fracking could have, Ratcliffe said: \u201cI\u2019m from the north and there are parts of the north that are not happy places.\u201d He added that some towns that once thrived on industries such as coal or steel were now \u201ca bit grim\u201d. \u201cThe future for manufacturing in the UK will look quite gloomy if we don\u2019t exploit shale,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see otherwise what is going to arrest the decline in British manufacturing.\u201d As well as importing ethane from the US for use in the chemicals industry, Ineos has licences to frack in the UK covering 1m acres, double the size of the Yorkshire Dales national park. Ratcliffe said the shale gas revolution in the US \u2013 which has brought down energy prices and created jobs but stoked fierce environmental protests \u2013 could be replicated in Britain. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason [shale] can\u2019t do the same things to the UK manufacturing industry as it has done in America. It dragged them out of recession in 2008 on the back of the shale revolution. The UK is clearly sat on a lot of potential shale in the same way the US is.\u201d He also brushed off environmental fears about fracking, a controversial technique that critics say needlessly prolongs fossil fuel use, risks polluting the water table and has been linked to earthquakes. One of Ineos\u2019s gas suppliers, Range Resources, was slapped with a $4m fine in the US for environmental breaches earlier this week. Ratcliffe said: \u201cOccasionally things happen despite our best efforts. We do have spills, we do have environmental issues and accidents. That\u2019s very unfortunate and we spend time trying to minimise that. \u201cLife is a balance. You like your hot shower, you like your iPhone and you like to drive your motor car. That\u2019s the balance.\u201d In an earlier interview with BBC Radio Scotland, Ratcliffe likened environmental accidents to getting a puncture in a tyre. Friends of the Earth responded angrily, saying the comparison was \u201ccavalier\u201d. \u201cYou can fix a puncture in a matter of minutes,\u201d said Friends of the Earth Scotland\u2019s head of campaigns Mary Church. \u201cIt may never be possible to fix groundwater contamination from leaking fracking wells.\u201d Ratcliffe\u2019s comments on shale came as Ineos\u2019s Grangemouth plant prepared to take delivery of 27,500 cubic metres of ethane delivered by tanker from the US, the culmination of an investment that Ineos says has reached $2bn. The firm fought a bitter battle with trade unions in 2013 after warning that the plant might have to close unless it was converted into a shale gas import terminal. Ratcliffe said Grangemouth, near Edinburgh, had been \u201con its knees\u201d before Ineos decided to spend \u00a3450m on converting the plant to accept shale gas imports. Ethane shipped from the US will replace waning North Sea supplies, allowing the plant to run profitably, a plan the company says will secure 10,000 jobs for at least 20 years. The company said the arrival of imports would render the plant profitable \u201covernight\u201d, a few years after it was losing around \u00a3100m a year. But the gas to be processed at Grangemouth is also part of a lengthy and extremely carbon-intensive journey. Ethane is separated from gas fracked from the Marcellus shale formation in western Pennsylvania before being sent via a pipeline to the Marcellus Hook export terminal on the US east coast. There it is cooled to -90C, turning it into liquid for shipping more than 3,500 miles across the Atlantic in \u201cDragon Class\u201d tankers, burning high-emission shipping fuel, over about 10 days. The company expects to take around one shipment a week once the transatlantic supply chain is up and running. It will convert the ethane into ethylene, which it can sell for use in a wide range of plastic products, such as plastic bags and food packaging.

So investors are looking for safer stocks, and utility companies are fitting the bill. Severn Trent is up 20p at \u00a324.83 with SSE 18p better at \u00a315.46. And United Utilities has climbed 12p to 998p after the business issued a positive trading update. It said first half operating profits were expected to be marginally higher than the same period last year, with infrastructure renewal spending slightly lower but picking up in the second half. Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: Although bid speculation has raised its head recently the main appeal for investors in United Utilities remains its defensive nature, healthy yield and aim of increasing its dividends in line with inflation through to at least 2020. In the volatile and uncertain markets post Brexit, and in a very low interest rate environment, those are powerful attractions for investors seeking income with lower risk. But overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 15.01 points at 6803.03.

      "bodyText": "Wolseley will cut 800 jobs in Britain, or about 13% of its UK workforce, in a move that takes job losses unveiled by the plumbing and heating products group so far this year to 1,000. Wolseley said it would shut 80 UK branches and a distribution centre in Worcester to save \u00a325m-\u00a330m a year. The job reduction programme, prompted by a drop in demand for materials to maintain and upgrade buildings, will start soon. Wolseley announced 200 job cuts in March in the UK, where the company makes 8% of its profit. Repair and maintenance sales for the plumbing and heating trade, which make up most of Wolseley\u2019s British business, have fallen sharply, leading to an 18% drop in UK annual profit. Group trading profit for the year to 31 July \u2013 excluding exceptional items and impaired assets \u2013 rose 7% to a record \u00a3917m. Pre-tax profit rose to \u00a3727m from \u00a3508m. John Martin, Wolseley\u2019s chief executive, told analysts: \u201cFinancial performance [in the UK] has deteriorated and that\u2019s not where we want it to be. I\u2019m not happy with this performance \u2026 Regrettably this will result in job losses which we will handle sensitively.\u201d Wolseley\u2019s shares, which are up 12% this year, fell 3.8% to \u00a341.35 in early trading. The company employs almost 6,100 people in the UK and has 737 branches including 600 serving the plumbing and heating trade. After the overhaul, which will take two or three years, plumbing and heating branches will trade under the Wolseley name, scrapping brands including Pipe Center and Drain Center. After the closures, Wolseley will have 440 branches aimed at small UK traders and about 80 bigger stores. Demand from tradesmen has been dented by the government scrapping of public subsidies for efficient boilers amid the cutting of green energy measures. Martin, who took over as chief executive last month, said Wolseley had been too optimistic about its UK business and that the cuts were not a response to uncertainty caused by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. \u201cWe have probably overestimated where we thought the market demand would be. A lot of people overestimated UK growth \u2026 I think this strategy would have been very similar [without the vote to leave] and Brexit looks too early to call.\u201d Group profit rose due to strong trading at Wolseley\u2019s US business, which makes up more than 80% of profit. US trading profit rose 6.3% to \u00a3775m. Martin was Wolseley\u2019s finance director before becoming chief executive. The company was forced in May to scrap plans to hire his successor from the engineering group Cobham amid shareholder concerns.",

      "bodyText": "An immediate rally after the US presidential debates has run out of steam, with the FTSE 100 now off its best levels. The index is currently down 3.80 points at 6814.24 having earlier climbed as high as 6865, albeit nowhere near recovering Monday\u2019s losses. Although most pundits feel Hillary Clinton got the best of Donald Trump in the first head-to-head debate, it is early days yet. Mike van Dulken and Henry Croft at Accendo Markets said Trump should not be discounted yet: Markets suggest victory for Clinton in the first of three US Presidential Debates. Not so much for her own performance, more because rival Trump failed to keep his cool and/or appear more presidential as many had expected. It\u2019s still early days. Trump could be setting the bar low for the remaining face-offs. And he does have a bouncebackability that has already helped his campaign get within touching distance of the oval office. The US election is not the only concern for the market. Investors are awaiting any news from the oil producers\u2019 meeting in Algeria, although there is little real expectation of a deal this week to help halt the slide in the crude price. Meanwhile the banking sector is still jittery after the slump in Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares on concerns about its ability to pay huge fines demanded by the US Department of Justice. Amid the nerves in the sector Royal Bank of Scotland has slipped 1.7p to 175.8p while Barclays is down 0.45p at 167.65p. Among the fallers is budget airline easyJet, down 15p at \u00a310.01 as UBS cut its price target from \u00a311.50 to \u00a310.70. The bank\u2019s analysts said: We think after two profit warnings over the last 3 months or so the risk to 2016 consensus earnings expectations are broadly neutral with 2016 estimated pretax profit consensus forecasts in the range of \u00a3475m to \u00a3596m. Nevertheless, we have slightly reduced our estimates for 2016 (previous \u00a3541m) on the back of currency movements and are now on 2016 pretax profit of \u00a3524m compared to consensus \u00a3530m. Looking into 2017 visibility unsurprisingly remains poor with uncertainties around winter pricing. Nevertheless, we see risk on the downside given industry capacity indications. British Airways owner International Airlines Group is also lower, down 6.9p at 387.6p. Elsewhere in the travel sector, Thomas Cook has dropped 1% to 69.3p after it reported a 4% drop in summer bookings, due to a slump in demand for holidays in Turkey. Rival Tui, less exposed to Turkey, is up 9p to \u00a310.79 while Carnival has climbed 101p to \u00a336.56 in the wake of Monday\u2019s better than expected results. In a hold note, Numis said: We believe that today\u2019s update is reassuring, given concerns about weak demand for European sailings from the core US market and also concerns about what the Zika virus might do to demand for Caribbean sailings (about 33% of 2016\u2019s capacity is expected to be in the Caribbean). We have increased our earnings per share forecast from $3.30 to $3.35, in line with guidance. But Saga is down 8.3p to 210.4p as Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on the travel and insurance group from buy to hold. The biggest FTSE 100 faller so far is building materials group Wolseley, down 146p to \u00a341.54 after disappointing results and news of 800 job cuts. The cautious outlook has also hit Travis Perkins, down 35p at \u00a314.83. Lower down the market Redx is up nearly 15% to 58.5p The drug discovery business had seen its shares fall by 50% in the last twelve months but they have been lifted by news it had discovered a series of compounds which could create the first novel class of antibiotics for 30 years. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said: Redx has announced this morning that in vivo testing has confirmed that its novel antibiotic programme targeting bacterial topoisomerase has delivered preclinical results that confirm its activity against drug resistant Gram negative bacteria when compared to a current broad spectrum antibiotic. Gram negative bacteria such as E Coli and Pseudomonas are particularly difficult to eliminate (compared to Gram positive bacteria such as Staph Aureus) indicating the importance of developing novel treatments, particularly for more insidious drug resistant infections. We believe these data once again demonstrate the broad capability that Redx possesses to deliver potentially first-in-class as well as best-in-class therapies. Meanwhile life science group ValiRx was steady at 6.75p as it issued a positive update. Half year losses increased from \u00a31.37m to \u00a32.12m as it increased its research expenditure, but it said it was making good progress in clinical trials. Northland Capital Partners said: ValiRx is close to dosing patients in its VAL401 programme, which will be a major milestone for the group, as it will move a second programme into the clinic. Moreover, the kick-off of a new programme, VAL301, further expands the group\u2019s pipeline.",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook\u2019s summer bookings fell 4% as the travel operator was hit by a slump in demand for holidays in Turkey following a series of terrorist attacks and an attempted coup. In a trading update, Thomas Cook said summer bookings excluding Turkey rose 4% but that a 40% drop in trips to Turkey caused total bookings to fall. Bookings fell heavily in continental Europe, where German tourists shunned Turkey, but rose 1% in the UK. Thomas Cook has been hit hard since summer 2015 by terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Egypt and Turkey. It offered customers with bookings to Turkey free cancellation after a failed military coup in July. Bookings from Belgium also fell following the terrorist attacks on Brussels in March. The company warned later in July that it had slumped to a quarterly loss and would miss its annual profit target. Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, has said the travel industry is suffering the greatest turmoil he can recall in his 30 years in the business as terrorist attacks and other incidents knock confidence. Thomas Cook shares rose 4% to 73p as the group stuck by reduced guidance for an operating profit of \u00a3300m for the year ending on 30 September \u2013 down from \u00a3310m a year earlier. Group bookings were in line with expectations as customers switched from Turkey to the Balearic and Canary islands, the US and other destinations such as Bulgaria and Cuba. Fankhauser said: \u201cThe summer season has progressed largely as expected. Customers\u2019 desire to go abroad on holiday has remained strong with the exception of Turkey where demand continues to be volatile. To date, sales for the winter season are in line with last year while sales so far for summer 2017 suggest customers are booking early in an effort to secure their first-choice destination and hotel.\u201d Demand for holidays among UK consumers appeared undimmed by uncertainty following the vote for Brexit on 23 June. Excluding Turkey, UK summer bookings rose 13% making Britain Thomas Cooks\u2019 strongest region. Fankhauser said the winter season had started well in the UK with bookings up 8%.",

    "webTitle": "Deutsche Bank shares fall to lowest level since mid-1980s", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank has been scrambling to reassure investors it has enough cash to pay a multibillion-dollar fine for alleged wrongdoing a decade ago as its shares crumbled to new lows and knocked sentiment across the banking sector. Shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank lost more than 7.5% to \u20ac10.55 on Monday despite attempts by its senior executives to insist the bank would not need help from Angela Merkel\u2019s government with the potential fine for mis-selling mortgage bonds. Deutsche, run by Briton John Cryan, had taken a pounding on markets even before the threat earlier this month of a $14bn (\u00a311bn) demand from the US Department of Justice for mis-selling of the bonds between 2005 and 2007. The shares have more than halved this year on mounting concerns about its financial position. They have dropped to a level not seen since the mid-1980s and are at a record low, according to some calculation methods. Deutsche\u2019s woes were a focus in the markets when investors were already rattled by the prospect of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d by the UK \u2013 which could be denied access to the EU single market \u2013 and the political situation in the US ahead of the debate between presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The FTSE 100 index dropped 1.3% \u2013 its biggest one-day fall since the immediate aftermath of the 23 June referendum \u2013 with shares in just seven companies up on the day. Banks\u2019 shares were down, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, which is awaiting settlement talks with the US authorities along similar lines to those in which Deutsche is embroiled. Some analysts warn RBS, which is 73% owned by taxpayers, could face a \u00a39bn penalty. \u201cTalk of a hard Brexit has not been welcomed by the market,\u201d said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown. In other parts, Europe\u2019s stock markets were also lower and Wall Street was down ahead of the key presidential debate. Monday\u2019s drop in the Deutsche share price came after Germany\u2019s Focus magazine said Merkel had refused to intervene in the bank\u2019s dispute with the US justice department and that the German chancellor had ruled out state assistance before the national election in September 2017. J\u00f6rg Eigendorf, head of communications at Deutsche, told CNBC: \u201c[At] no point [in] time has John Cryan asked the chancellor for support in the negotiations with the Department of Justice and he doesn\u2019t intend to do that. He\u2019s very strong in that position.\u201d Asked whether Deutsche needed to raise capital \u2013 the fine is around 80% of its stock market value \u2013 Eigendorf said: \u201cThis is just not a question for us right now. We fulfil the capital requirements. We have time to fulfil future capital requirements and that\u2019s what we are working on.\u201d The potential penalty from the DoJ \u2013 which Deutsche is contesting \u2013 is more than twice the \u20ac5.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) that the bank has set aside for litigation costs. Even a fine some way below the \u00a311bn demanded could strain Deutsche\u2019s fragile finances and further dent investor confidence. It faces other potentially expensive inquiries into alleged currency manipulation, precious metals trading and billions of dollars of funds transferred out of Russia. Steffen Seibert, Merkel\u2019s spokesman, also tried to play down the situation facing Deutsche. \u201cThere is no reason for such speculation as presented there and the federal government doesn\u2019t engage in such speculation,\u201d he said. Deutsche\u2019s shares have been under pressure since early this year when the bank became the focal point of fears over European banking\u2019s financial strength and profitability. In June, the International Monetary Fund said Deutsche was a bigger risk to the global financial system than any other bank because of its intertwined relationships with other international lenders. One investor expressed doubts about whether Germany would really stand aside. Andreas Utermann, chief investment officer of Allianz Global Investors, told Bloomberg television: \u201cI don\u2019t buy at all what\u2019s coming out of Germany in terms of Germany not wanting to step in ultimately if Deutsche Bank was really in trouble ... It\u2019s too important for the German economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "London has been given almost 100 times more housing zone funding than the rest of England combined, but has only built twice as many houses, new research has revealed. Calling for housebuilding investment to be more fairly distributed across the country, the Housing and Finance Institute thinktank concludes that it is a \u201ccultural myth\u201d that the greatest need for homes is in the biggest cities. The organisation cited figures that show nearly 80,000 more people are on housing waiting lists in regional local councils than in the capital and metropolitan areas combined. The IHF report used housing-zone funding \u2013 money awarded to councils by central government to aid development on specific brownfield sites \u2013 to support its argument that funding is skewed towards major urban centres. London has secured \u00a3600m of housing-zone funding, which will be used to build 75,000 homes, while \u00a36.3m has been allocated to the rest of England in the same period that will be used to build 34,000 new homes. The privately funded body was launched by the coalition government in March 2015 to provide advice to local authorities on housebuilding. It argues that the housing crisis should be solved by refocusing government funding efforts on coastal communities, country villages, market towns and the historic cities and counties of England. \u201cUndoubtedly there is more that can be done in London and other major urban centres to build more homes, but those areas already have huge resources to do more,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe demand for new homes is as great in the regional local areas, the opportunity to turn planning permissions into new homes is greater, and they need a fairer share of funding. They should not be asked to pay over a greater and greater share of their, much smaller, resources.\u201d The institute argues there has been a longstanding emphasis on funding housebuilding in big cities and metropolitan areas, while they were only responsible for building about 30% of new homes planned and built in 2015/16. Some 70% of homes planned and built over the same time period are in district and unitary councils. HFI chief executive, Natalie Elphicke, said energetic local councils that were working hard to build houses without the help of comfortable cash flow or big balance sheets should be rewarded. \u201cToo often it has been the noisy major metropolitan cities or the massive housing associations already awash with cash who ask for even more,\u201d she said. \u201cYet the beating heart of sustainable housing delivery is in the counties, ordinary towns and districts of England. It\u2019s time to harness the energy across the country in building homes and regenerating communities. The government needs to put more of its housing money where the opportunity to deliver is, and that means right across the country. \u201cIf a council can show it is housing-business-ready, has a good track record and will commit to minimum housing targets, why shouldn\u2019t it get the type of individual deals, powers and money given to the big devolved city authorities.\u201d When it came to housing delivery, Elphicke said biggest was not always best. \u201cSome of our coastal communities, country villages and market towns, post-industrial heartlands and historic cities and counties of England are absolutely brilliant at making housing delivery happen and are delivering the majority of our new homes.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The first ever shipment of shale gas from the US is set to arrive in Britain less than 24 hours after the Labour party vowed to ban fracking, the method by which the controversial energy source is extracted. Ineos, the petrochemical company founded and chaired by a billionaire, Jim Ratcliffe, will take delivery of a tanker full of ethane at its Grangemouth plant in Scotland on Tuesday, marking the first fruit of a $2bn investment. Fracking is subject to a moratorium imposed by the devolved government in Holyrood. But the Grangemouth plant will receive 27,500 cubic metres of ethane extracted from beneath western Pennsylvania in the US, where shale gas production has boomed. The imports are due to replace dwindling supplies from the UK\u2019s North Sea reserves. The gas has travelled more than 3,500 miles via a \u201cvirtual pipeline\u201d of eight tankers to reach Grangemouth, where Ineos has built an import terminal as part of an overhaul costing \u00a3450m. The ethane will be fed into \u201ccrackers\u201d that convert the gas into ethylene, used in the production of a range of plastic products. \u201cShale gas can help stop the decline of British manufacturing and today is a first step in that direction,\u201d said Ratcliffe. But consignments such as this one, due to arrive on a giant tanker named the Ineos Insight, will be the only source of shale gas for Grangemouth if the Labour party wins a general election. Speaking at Labour\u2019s annual party conference the shadow energy minister, Barry Gardiner, said the party would ban fracking and focus on low carbon energy sources if it wins the next general election. \u201cFracking locks us into an energy infrastructure that is based on fossil fuels long after our country needs to have moved to clean energy,\u201d said Gardiner. \u201cSo today I am announcing that a future Labour government [would] ban fracking.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, Labour\u2019s leader, has previously said that fracking is \u201cnot compatible\u201d with tackling climate change. Although Ineos has begun importing from the US, where an abundance of shale gas has left the world\u2019s largest economy with more than it needs, it would like to become the leading player if fracking takes off in the UK. Ineos, which slashed its tax bill by moving its headquarters to Switzerland in 2010, was awarded 21 new licences in December, including sites in North Yorkshire, the north-west and east Midlands. The awards increased the area of land over which it holds licences to 1m acres, nearly twice the area of the Yorkshire Dales national park. But Ineos\u2019s ambitions have been curtailed by slow progress in obtaining planning permission, which is necessary before it can exploit the licences. A spokesperson for Ineos said earlier this year that it hoped to have 30 planning applications lodged before the end of the year but the company has since scaled back its plans to five, followed by a further 25 over the next 12 months. Its ambitions have also been constrained by a moratorium on fracking imposed by the Scottish government. The setbacks have made for a chastening climbdown for Ineos, given the confidence with which Ratcliffe announced his intentions in 2014. Ineos promised investment of \u00a3640m and bumper payouts for communities and landowners of up to 6% of revenues, which it estimated could amount to \u00a32.5bn. Fracking is a controversial gas extraction technique that involves the injection of water and chemicals at high pressure into shale rocks, forcing gas trapped inside to the surface. Critics of the process say it causes environmental problems including pollution of the water table and it has also been blamed for causing earthquakes. Ineos\u2019s plans became even more controversial after emails emerged that showed the company planned to dump treated wastewater from the process into the sea. Supporters of fracking claim it could help rein in rising energy prices, offer greater energy security in case supplies from abroad are disrupted and provide a low carbon bridge while the UK weans itself off energy produced from coal. They also claim it could support thousands of jobs and deliver financial benefits to communities near the industry\u2019s infrastructure.",

Ineos promised investment of \u00a3640m and bumper payouts for communities and landowners of up to 6% of revenues, which it estimated could amount to \u00a32.5bn.</p> <p>Fracking is a controversial gas extraction technique that involves the injection of water and chemicals at high pressure into shale rocks, forcing gas trapped inside to the surface. Critics of the process say it causes environmental problems including pollution of the water table and it has also been blamed for causing earthquakes.</p> <p>Ineos\u2019s plans became even more controversial after emails emerged that showed the company planned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/15/uk-fracking-firm-plans-dump-wastewater-in-sea-ineos\">dump treated wastewater from the process into the sea</a>.</p> <p>Supporters of fracking claim it could help rein in rising energy prices, offer greater energy security in case supplies from abroad are disrupted and provide a low carbon bridge while the UK weans itself off energy produced from coal.</p> <p>They also claim it could support thousands of jobs and deliver financial benefits to communities near the industry\u2019s infrastructure.</p>",
