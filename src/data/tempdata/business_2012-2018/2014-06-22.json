      "bodyText": "Morrisons has opened up another front in the supermarket price wars by cutting the cost of 135 more products. The supermarket chain, which is under sustained pressure to halt its declining sales, announced a range of price cuts to woo back customers. Chief executive Dalton Philips, who has faced criticism over the group's performance, insisted that the move would help slash household shopping bills. \"These are permanent price cuts, not promotions, and they won't be the last,\" he said on Sunday. The latest discounts are part of Morrisons's pledge to make price reductions worth \u00a31bn over the three years. The chain is also shedding 2,600 staff in a bid to reduce costs and streamline its operations. Among the items reduced are giant pineapples \u2013 chopped from \u00a32 to \u00a31.25 each \u2013 and a 400g can of Don Mario tomatoes cut by a third, to 69p. Households had suffered inflation-busting food price increases for most of the last decade. But recent tit-for-tat discounts in the sector have finally pushed prices down. The latest inflation figures show that food and non-alcoholic drinks were 0.6% cheaper in May than a year ago, helping to drag inflation down to a five-year low of 1.5%. Asda's latest Income Tracker shows the average UK household is now \u00a34 a week better off than in May last year. It found a typical family was left with \u00a3171 a week of discretionary income once taxes and essentials bills had been paid, up from \u00a3167 last year. However, wage increases are still lagging behind inflation \u2013 rising just 0.9% in the last year. Rob Harbron, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, is hopeful that real wages will soon rise. He said: \"The latest fall in essential item inflation and the slowdown in inflation are both providing welcome boosts to household spending power. \"Although wage growth slowed recently, a strengthening economy is expected to push up earnings over 2014. It's encouraging to see the cost of such essentials as clothing, food and mortgage interest payments actually lower now than a year ago.\" The recent falls in inflation are partly due to lower energy costs, and some economists fear that the insurgency in Iraq could drive crude oil prices higher. The oil price hit its highest level in nine months last week, and Barclays economist Christian Keller believes it could spike by another 10 or 15%. \"Just as oil prices had become increasingly stable, we reckon the risk for an oil price spike is now the highest since the global crisis,\" Keller said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lawyers for workers sacked when electrical goods retailer Comet collapsed in 2012 have asked a government investigation to consider whether Deloitte, the administrators involved, should face criminal charges. The lawyers have passed on the details of a tribunal judgment, published this month, which states that Chris Farrington, one of three Deloitte administrators, signed a letter to the secretary of state, Vince Cable, in November 2012 stating that there were \"no proposed redundancies at present\" at Comet. The tribunal found that redundancies were being actively considered at this time. The judgment noted that failure to notify the business secretary is a criminal offence under section 194 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. The law makes clear that it is the employer who must make the notification. However, Victoria Robertson, a lawyer at Needle Partnership who acted for sacked staff at the tribunal, said: \"The law needs clarifying on this matter. The employer makes the redundancies but the administrator signs the form.\" She said the company's directors could not be held liable as they step aside during the insolvency process. The investigation is being handled by the Insolvency Service, a government body which will have to pay out millions of pounds in compensation to workers as a result of the mishandling of redundancies at Comet. As part of that investigation, which has so far taken 18 months, it is considering whether to refer the matter to police or the administrators' authorising body. Anyone found guilty of a criminal offence under Section 194 could face a fine of up to \u00a35,000. The administrators' authorising body, the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICAEW), has powers to issue fines in certain cases. If an insolvency practitioner is found to have acted dishonestly, it can withdraw its licence. At a Leeds employment tribunal this month, Judge Forrest ruled that former Comet employees should receive compensatory payments of 90 days' pay which could reach \u00a325m, after finding that the company and its administrator Deloitte failed to organise proper consultations when 7,000 people were made redundant in 2012. Forrest will decide next month exactly how many ex-Comet workers will receive additional compensation, as 4,000 staff did not stake a claim within the time limit. If he rules that all 7,000 staff are eligible, the total will reach \u00a325m, with the bill being footed by the taxpayer since Comet is insolvent. Deloitte declined to comment on the potential criminal charges. Last week Comet's joint liquidators Neville Kahn and Chris Farrington of Deloitte said they were disappointed with the tribunal ruling. \"Comet Group Limited made significant efforts to consult with its nearly 7,000 employees across more than 250 sites during the administration, whilst a purchaser for the business was sought.\" The Comet ruling is embarrassing for Deloitte, as it was previously involved in the administration of Woolworths, where the government had to pay out \u00a367m in compensation to 24,000 workers who were made redundant when the high-street store collapsed in 2008. An employment tribunal in that case found the administrators had failed in their legal duty to consult with Usdaw before making redundancies. Some Woolworths employees have yet to receive compensation, but as many as 3,000 more could receive cash if a case headed to the European court of justice in Luxembourg is successful. At present, UK law limits government redundancy payments to those working in \"establishments\" \u2013 taken to mean individual shops or warehouses \u2013 where more than 20 people work. However, an employment appeal tribunal in Britain has already ruled the \"less than 20 workers\" condition should relate to a business as a whole, not individual sites. The government has appealed against that ruling and the case is now headed to Luxembourg. If the court rules against the government, its potential liability for redundancy payments at insolvent companies when staff have not been properly consulted could soar. Comet workers would be among the beneficiaries. The Comet case has led to fresh calls for the British insolvency system to be reviewed. Comet was initially saved from collapse in late 2011 when it was sold to turnaround specialist OpCapita for \u00a32, with former owners Kesa including a \u00a350m \"dowry\". But it continued to lose money, and collapsed in November 2012. It later emerged that the company's owners had received about \u00a3117m from the administration process.",

      "bodyText": "Online fashion retailer Asos has been forced to suspend its website and stop taking orders, possibly for several days, after a fire at the firm's main warehouse in Barnsley. The fire, which South Yorkshire police believe was started deliberately on Friday night, ripped through several floors of Asos's vast distribution centre. It took 10 fire engines and more than 60 firefighters to bring the blaze under control. Around 500 workers were evacuated from the premises. The company now faces a battle to get its operations moving and it is unclear when orders already placed will be delivered. On Sunday shoppers trying to order clothing were greeted by a brief message from the firm saying: \"We have pressed pause on the Asos website this is due to a fire in our Barnsley distribution centre in the early hours of Saturday morning.\" It added: \"We expect to be back to normal for you in the next day or so.\" The Barnsley warehouse is critical to Asos \u2013 every product it sells is checked there before being shipped by air, land or sea to be delivered. Last year the group had sales of \u00a3770m. A spokesman was unable to say when the Asos site might resume taking orders. \"Asos are still evaluating the situation,\" he said. \"They are striving to get the website up and running as soon as they can.\" Asos is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Given the scale of the disruption, the company is likely to make a statement to shareholders before trading resumes on Monday morning. Loyal Asos customers were quick to offer sympathy on social media networks, creating hashtags such as #poorasos and #asosfire. But others were left fretting that their orders had been lost. Several Twitter users lamented that their clothes would not arrive in time for the Glastonbury festival. The company is no stranger to drama \u2013 in December 2005 its previous warehouse, in Hemel Hempstead, was damaged when explosions ripped through the Buncefield fuel depot. After that incident \u2013 which founder and chief executive Nick Robertson said was the worst fate an online retailer could suffer \u2013 the company was forced to suspend its shares, and refund about 19,000 orders. But it fought back rapidly, reopening in mid-January and doubling its profits in the next financial year. Retail analyst Nick Bubb pointed out that Asos now has many more competitors than in 2005, with customer expectations on order delivery much higher than nine years ago. \"The best case scenario is that the business is quickly back in action, via temporary facilities nearby, and that the insurance companies settle up to cover the direct costs of the disruption,\" said Bubb. \"The worst case scenario is that customer confidence is affected for a longer period of time and that the suspicion of arson delays the insurance companies' response.\" Asos has come under pressure recently as traditional retailers get to grips with online shopping; Marks and Spencer, for example, has recently launched a new website in an attempt to profit from the boom in e-commerce. Less than three weeks ago, Asos issued a shock warning to investors that its profits would be less than expected. The warning wiped almost a third off the company's stockmarket value. It blamed a slowdown in sales growth, and increased competition which was forcing down profit margins. That left analysts speculating whether the company had tried to expand too fast, in the face of tougher competition from bricks-and-morter operations. Robertson founded Asos \u2013 the business was originally called As Seen on Screen \u2013 in 2000 and built a reputation for making the latest fashions available to customers quickly, at affordable prices. Its shares surged from 30p a decade ago to more than \u00a370 four months ago. But they have more than halved since then, to \u00a327.52 on Friday evening, hours before the fire broke out in Barnsley.",

      "bodyText": "Although measured and deliberate in his responses, there is one moment when the softly spoken Chuck Hull \u2013 known as the father of 3D printing \u2013 tells of his surprise about what exactly his creation was capable of achieving. In 1996, surgeons at the Wilford Hall medical centre in Texas working to separate a pair of conjoined twins thought that only one would be able to walk after the operation. After a model of the girls' bone structure was generated using 3D printing, however, they found a shared upper leg bone to be bigger than expected and split it successfully, resulting in both twins being able to walk. Hull said: \"This is extremely difficult for surgeons, to figure out how they are going to separate the two twins so that you will have two separately living people. When some of those surgeries were first done using the help of our technology, it was really touching for me.\" Now 75 and still working as chief technology officer of 3D Systems, the company he co-founded, Hull is enjoying some minor celebrity 31 years after he first printed a small black eye-wash cup using a new method of manufacturing called stereolithography, now known as 3D printing. At the time, he was working for a company that used UV light to put thin layers of plastic veneers on tabletops and furniture. Like others within the industry, he was frustrated that the production of small plastic parts for prototyping new product designs could take up to two months. He had an idea that if he could place thousands of thin layers of plastic on top of each other and then etch their shape using light, he would be able to form three dimensional objects. After a year of tinkering with ideas in a backroom lab after hours, he developed a system where light was shone into a vat of photopolymer \u2013 a material which changes from liquid to plastic-like solid when light shines on it \u2013 and traces the shape of one level of the object. Subsequent layers are then printed until it is complete. After patenting the invention in 1986, he set up 3D Systems in order to commercialise the new method of production and went on the road to secure both funding \u2013 eventually getting $6m (\u00a33.5m) from a Canadian investor \u2013 and customers, using videotapes to show the equipment. The first commercial product came out in 1988 and proved a hit among car manufacturers, in the aerospace sector and for companies designing medical equipment. Soon General Motors and Mercedes-Benz were using 3D Systems' technology \u2013 the company sold printers, materials and software \u2013 to build prototypes, but it was developments in medicine that stunned him, such as when models in advance of surgery could be created. \"That was just startling to me, that someone used the technology like that.\" When Hull originally came up with his invention, he told his wife that it would take between 25 and 30 years before the technology would find its way into the home. That prediction proved correct as the realistic prospect of widespread commercial 3D printers has only emerged in recent years. The possibilities appear endless \u2013 from home-printed food and pharmaceuticals to suggestions that pictures of ceramics will be able to be taken in shops and then recreated using plans downloaded from the internet. Hull, an unassuming man who has 93 patents to his name in the US and 20 in Europe, says he is \"humbled\" by the possibilities but stops short of predicting what his technology could eventually deliver, although he is confident printers could soon be in every home. \"It's nice to get some recognition, it was a lot of hard work but other than that I just keep working,\" he said last week in Berlin, where he received a European Inventor Award. Controversy has arisen with the possibility that guns will be able to be produced using 3D printing, again using blueprints downloaded from the internet. A group called Defense Distributed last year successfully tested a 3D printed gun in Texas. Hull said: \"My first thought is that people messing with that \u2013 I hope they don't hurt themselves. Building and testing guns of that nature could be dangerous. I think the people doing that were trying to make a point. \"I don't know that people are going to be printing guns around the world but in any case our company, we are not the government or the police agencies. It is more their business and all technology, the governments and the police have to be aware [of], it is not just 3D printing.\" After finding that retirement was not for him, Hull returned to the company he co-founded and is now vice-president as well as chief technology officer, and holds shares worth $20m (\u00a312m). Last year, 3D Systems brought in revenues of more than $500m (\u00a3294m) and has three bases in the UK, in Hemel Hempstead, High Wycombe and Clevedon. New systems of 3D printing have emerged over the years and various other firms have been added to the 3D Systems stable. Last week the company launched the Ekocycle Cube printer in a collaboration with the singer Will.i.am, named chief creative officer in January, which is touted as being for everyday use and priced at $1,199 (\u00a3705). Stepping down is not an option at the moment for Hull, who declares the products of 3D printing, now including ranges of jewellery, as \"all his children\". Future projects include working with Google on the company's next generation phone. \"We always say which room is it going to be in? I am not much of a futurist. It is really difficult for me to project. I sit there and work on the projects I have and I don't have a lot of say on where this is going.\" What can be printed? On a small plot in the north of Amsterdam, architects are building what they hope will be the first 3D-printed house. They are laying blocks that have been printed using a scaled-up version of an open-source 3D printer to be stacked like Lego bricks \u2013 one of the more elaborate examples of what can be produced using 3D printing. The recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas showcased printers that could produce foods such as ravioli and chocolate printed patterns, while Harvard researchers have recently unveiled what they say is the first 3D printed battery, which can be constructed in minutes. New in Tech this week \u2022 Will your next phone be 3D? Amazon's new Fire Phone uses a system of four cameras to constantly track its user's face and makes objects appear 3D using \"dynamic perspective\" \u2013 shifting the image around as the user tilts their head. Users can nod and use other gestures to navigate the phone too, which uses Amazon's own version of the Android software. But a camera on the back that can instantly recognise objects, books, art and goods is the killer feature for the online superstore. Point the phone at a book, snap a picture and buy it from Amazon with one tap. Yet another attack on the high street. \u2022 Paranoid about drones watching your every move? The personal drone detection system could be for you. The black box, which claims to beep when a non-military drone flies within 15 metres of it, is available on the crowd funding site Kickstarter. What you actually do about a drone intruding on your airspace is left to you. \u2022 Yo! A single word that has gone viral thanks to a stupidly simple app. The Yo app for Android and iPhone literally just sends the word \"yo\" to friends, contacts or complete strangers. One word can mean so many things with the right context, enough to earn the free app's creators more than $1m (\u00a3588,000) in funding at least. \u2022 Microsoft has taken strides towards delivering longer battery life. The software giant has launched new wireless charging smart trousers that power up your phone while it's in your pocket. Designed by British fashion designer Adrien Sauvage for the \"Modern Man\" (what about the rest of us?), the trousers use inductive charging to power a Nokia Lumia smartphone without wires. Never be left with a dead phone battery again. \u2022 What do the Vulcan salute, a chipmunk and chilli have in common? They are all brand new emoji \u2013 small cartoons of objects that can be sent instead of words. More than 250 new emoji have been added to the Unicode 7 specification, which defines how text is handled or expressed in computer programs. The little characters could soon be winging their way across your chat apps, email, internet and Word documents. Samuel Gibbs",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British Airways is facing the threat of renewed strikes after cabin crew said they were prepared to take industrial action after their pay claims were rebuffed. In a consultative ballot last week among members of the mixed fleet, 95% of crew who voted said they would go on strike. About a third of the eligible crew voted in the ballot, taken to gauge feeling in a fleet which unionised rapidly under Unite in 2012. The mixed fleet is a predominantly younger crew, employed under inferior terms and conditions to pre-existing crew. The fleet was set up in 2010 during the last wave of bitter industrial action at the airline, when cost-cutting led to 22 days of walkouts. Willie Walsh, the then BA boss and now chief executive of parent company IAG, argued that traditional airlines needed to cut costs to survive, and has since pushed through thousands of job losses and salary cuts at BA's sister airline Iberia in Spain. But the new BA recruits have been angered by schedules and salaries that see them earning less than counterparts at low-cost competitors easyJet and Ryanair. Unions claim many BA cabin crew are now reliant on working tax credits to supplement basic salaries, believed to be a little over \u00a312,000 a year, though the airline says earnings should reach around \u00a320,000 with full-flying rosters. BA has offered a pay rise in line with inflation to other cabin crew on pre-2010 contracts, who work exclusively either long-haul or short-haul in the worldwide or European fleets. The new flexible crew had been hoping to close the wage gap with their better-paid colleagues and counterparts, but have made no progress. Anger has been further stirred among employees by news that Walsh earned \u00a35m in 2013, a pay rise of 400% on the previous year, while BA boss Keith Williams was paid \u00a33m. A BA spokesman told the Guardian: \"Our cabin crew positions attract a high level of applicants due to the competitive package offered, our extensive route network and promotional opportunities. We are currently conducting pay talks with all parts of the airline and any talk of industrial action by one of four cabin crew groups is completely speculative.\" Holidaymakers heading to France also face travel disruption this week, as two French air traffic controller unions begin a six-day walkout. The SNCTA and Unsa-ICNA unions announced last Friday that the strike will begin on 24 June. Travellers have been warned to expect heavy disruption during the period, with officials aiming to run at least 50% of scheduled flights.",

      "bodyText": "John Le Carr\u00e9's Smiley's People was published in 1979, straight after the Winter of Discontent, and there's a scene where spymaster George Smiley travels to Hamburg to make contact with Claus Kretzschmar, the owner of a sleazy nightclub, the Blue Diamond. Smiley has to pay 200 marks for entry and obligatory drink \u2013 a considerable sum in the late 1970s \u2013 but it is later refunded after he and Kretzschmar do business together. \"You English are poor these days. Too many trade unions,\" Kretzschmar says. This was the accepted wisdom at the time. Britain was the sick man of Europe and over-mighty labour was to blame. Germany had rebuilt its economy in the 1950s and 1960s; Britain had slipped further and further behind. The solution, or at least one part of it, was to make labour markets more \"flexible\". There were two possible ways of achieving this. There was the consensual German way, with trade unions seen by management as partners rather than adversaries, or there was the American model, which saw labour as an enemy. Britain went down the American route. New laws made it harder for unions to recruit, organise and operate. De-industrialisation destroyed the old strongholds of union power. The full force of the state was used to win two big industrial struggles \u2013 the miners' strike and the Wapping dispute. Welfare changes were introduced to make it more attractive for the unemployed to take low-paid jobs. Globalisation has further strengthened the bargaining power of employers. Britain now has a flexible labour market and as far as workers are concerned is virtually indistinguishable from the US. Increasingly, though, the transition to the 51st state looks like a hollow victory. As the International Monetary Fund noted in its annual health check on the US economy last week, the American labour market is characterised by falling participation rates, high levels of long-term unemployment, stagnant wages and 50 million people living below the poverty line. US-style flexibility has also been marked by a relentless squeeze on wages and the capture of the proceeds of growth by those at the top. A recent article by David Blanchflower and Stephen Machin says that in 2013, median real weekly wages (pay adjusted for inflation for someone smack in the middle of the income distribution) were about the same in 2013 as they were in 1979. \"This is probably of concern for the UK's prospects since the United States went through a number of labour market changes some time before similar shifts in the UK. These include greater \"flexibility\" and a massive reduction in the extent of union bargaining over wages,\" they wrote. Up until around a decade ago it would have been hard to draw this conclusion. While US median earnings were flatlining, the average UK worker was getting better off. Median full-time weekly earnings were 40% higher in 2003 than they had been 15 years earlier. But from then on, three or four years before the onset of the \"great recession\", real wage growth tailed off markedly. It then plummeted during the crunch and has still not recovered. Confounding the predictions of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and the Bank of England, the real wages of the median worker have dropped by 8-10% \u2013 or about 2% a year \u2013 since 2008. This is entirely unprecedented in Britain's recent history. The OBR and the Bank assume that the tide will eventually turn. Falling unemployment will make labour scarcer, forcing firms to pay more to obtain new workers. Businesses will also respond to stronger demand by investing more and this will make their employees more productive. A tighter labour market and higher productivity will result in more generous pay settlements. Real wage growth will resume. There are two parts to this assumption. The first is that productivity will return to its previous growth trend of 2% or so a year. The second is that if productivity does indeed rebound, the benefits will be shared more or less equitably between those on high, middle and high incomes. Both are questionable. Far from becoming a high-skill, high-productivity, high-wage economy, Britain seems to be going in the other direction. Labour is plentiful and cheap; capital, by contrast, is relatively expensive. Employers can dip into a reserve army of labour for some short-term contract workers any time they see demand rise. But even assuming that the OBR and the Bank are right in their first assumption, what evidence is there that the benefits of higher productivity will be shared? Certainly, there is none from the US \u2013 and not much from Britain either. In both countries, those at the top have been extremely successful at capturing the fruits of growth, leaving little left for anybody else. \"Even if productivity were to rise rapidly, the tendency for longer-run inequality trends to cause an unequal division of wages from productivity gains to the top (like bankers' bonuses) would need to be addressed,\" say Blanchflower and Machin. \"Until that happens or until policy starts to address these issues seriously, it seems that the prospects of significant, rather than modest, real wage increases for typical workers are bleak.\" This seems a fair assessment. Power resides with employers and there seems no reason why they would willingly hand over productivity gains to their workers. Unless forced to do so, they will keep the gains for themselves. It is here that the absence of trade unions is felt. In 1980, 64% of workplaces in which there were 25 or more employees had a recognised trade union. By 2011, the percentage had fallen to 37%. In the private sector, unions are even weaker. Only 17% of firms with more than 25 staff recognise a union; for those with five or more the figure is still lower: 11%. More than that, though, organised labour represented an alternative political force to business. Andrew Gamble, in his new book Crisis Without End? (Palgrave Macmillan) notes that one reason there has been so little reform of the underlying economic model since the \"great recession\" is that there is no countervailing force to stand up to the business and financial interest. \"Although there are divisions within business, it no longer faces significant opposition outside itself,\" he writes. All of which makes the role of labour and unions in the current political debate rather curious. The left of centre thinktank the IPPR has just published its strategy for national renewal which has no mention of unions in its 280 pages. Thomas Piketty, best-selling author, calls for a 75% wealth tax but neglects to say how it might be achieved. The answer comes back to George Smiley. If the spy met Herr Kretzschmar in 2014 the message would be slightly different. \"You English are poor these days. Not enough trade unions.\"",

Too many trade unions,\" Kretzschmar says.</p> <p>This was the accepted wisdom at the time. Britain was the sick man of Europe and over-mighty labour was to blame. Germany had rebuilt its economy in the 1950s and 1960s; Britain had slipped further and further behind. The solution, or at least one part of it, was to make labour markets more \"flexible\".</p> <p>There were two possible ways of achieving this. There was the consensual German way, with trade unions seen by management as partners rather than adversaries, or there was the American model, which saw labour as an enemy.</p> <p>Britain went down the American route. New laws made it harder for unions to recruit, organise and operate. De-industrialisation destroyed the old strongholds of union power. The full force of the state was used to win two big industrial struggles \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/miners-strike-1984-85\" title=\"\">the miners' strike</a> and the Wapping dispute.

      "bodyText": "The sun might be shining on our own back gardens but 25 million holidaymakers are expected to head overseas between now and the end of summer, according to the Association of British Travel Agents. A sizeable slice of those will hire a car when they get to their destination \u2013 and, unfortunately, a fair number of those will wish they had never bothered. From pricey petrol to paintwork scratches that surface post-hire period, lots of car rental firms have various ways to try and sting you for extra cash. Here we look at the most common causes for complaint and how to avoid them. Book early It may seem like astoundingly obvious advice to \"book early, pay less\" but this doesn't stop hundreds of holidaymakers leaving their car hire until the last minute. Even \u2013 god forbid \u2013 waiting until they're at the airport. But it's not too late to save money even if you are going away in a few weeks. Research for The Observer from travelsupermarket.com shows that if you book an intermediate sized car (a Peugeot 508 or similar) now from Nice airport for a two-week break starting at the end of July you could save as much as \u00a3980 compared to the walk-up price on the day. Check out both the car rentals own websites and broker sites such as travelsupermarket and carrentals.co.uk for the best deal. Beware the excess waiver Picture the scene. You turn up at the airport with the voucher for the fully inclusive rate you have paid \u2013 but at the desk the friendly sales assistant paints a horror story picture of the \u20ac1,000 excess you could be hit with should the slightest scratch appear. You would, she tells you, be better to take out its excess waiver insurance \u2013 just in case. \"This is the biggest rip-off in the book and the hard sell for it has got a lot worse, especially in Spain and Portugal where companies are having their margins squeezed through fierce competition,\" says Bob Atkinson of travelsupermarket.com. The best way to get around this is to take out a cheap, standalone excess policy before you leave the UK. These are not only cheaper than hire car firms' own, but are generally a lot more comprehensive. Buy them from companies like iCarhireinsurance.com and direct-carexcess.co.uk from around \u00a340 for an annual European policy. Watch out for fuel costs Some car hire companies use a full-empty fuel policy where you pay for a full tank of petrol when you pick up your car, but are not offered a refund for returning it with unused fuel (see below). On many holidays, especially short breaks, you have no chance of using all the fuel. Consumer group Which? estimates that someone hiring a Fiat 500 would need to drive 550 miles to empty the tank. In Mallorca this would be enough to make the 80-mile round-trip from Palma airport to Port de Pollenca on the other side of the island nearly seven times. Thankfully, the practice is becoming less common but the only way to avoid it is to check the small print of any policy you are interested in before you sign up. Which? recommends Alamo, Enterprise and Autoreisen as companies that operate a fair fuel policy. Bring your child's car seat Paying to hire a child's car seat is an easy way to get hit by sky-high charges \u2013 typically up to \u20ac10 euro a day. Bringing your own will not only save you money but might also reassure your child and be easier to install \u2013 car hire companies won't install it for you. Most airlines, even Ryanair, let you take it for free either on board the aircraft or as extra hold luggage. There are also inflatable or folding portable car seats you can buy such as bubblebum and Boostapak. These are not particularly cheap (up to \u00a345 new) but could be worth it if you use hire cars a lot. Take your satnav Car hire companies will charge you extra for satnavs \u2013 and other extras, such as portable DVD players for the kids. That's fine if you're prepared to pay the prices \u2013 otherwise bring your own portable satnav and preload it with the maps for the country you're travelling in. If you've got a smartphone, you can download a free app called Navfree that does the job for you. You don't need to worry about roaming charges as the data is stored on the phone itself rather than using the internet. Cost of an extra driver If more than one of you plans to drive while you're away, factor in the cost before you pay for your car hire. We looked at a week's car hire in Malaga in August and found the cost of adding an extra driver, on the same model of car, on different websites, ranged from \u20ac4.45 a day to \u20ac12.69 a day. Damage you didn't do It is an all too common scenario that mystery scratches and unexplained dents are \"discovered\" by a car hire company on a vehicle only once the keys have been handed back and the driver has left the building. And, according to research given to The Observer, one in four people who have hired a car said they had found damage which was not highlighted on the collection check-out sheet. \"When you pick up a hire car it's essential to check it over thoroughly and note every mark, no matter how insignificant on the checkout sheet, including any damage and scuffs to the wheels,\" says Ernesto Suarez, chief executive of iCarhireinsurance.com, which carried out the research. \"We see plenty of people getting charged for minor wheel damage, or scratches on the bumper which they know were on the car when they picked it up, but were not noted on the paperwork when they collected the vehicle.\" It might be time-consuming, but when you return the car take photos of all the panels, wheels, lights, bumpers and so on. You should also make sure that you get someone to sign your rental agreement to confirm that there has been no damage to the car before you walk off. Charged for the wrong hire car If you get to the car hire desk only to find the vehicle grade you paid for (such as economy, standard or prestige) is not available, don't be left out of pocket for a car you didn't ask for. \"The car hire company should give you a better car free of charge or refund you for a smaller car,\" says Atkinson. Pay by credit card This gives you extra protection as your credit card company is equally liable if anything goes wrong (assuming the cost of your hire exceeds \u00a3100). Beware the tank trap There can be few things more galling than thinking you've found a great deal on your holiday car hire, only to have costs more than double when you collect the keys, writes Mel Wright, left. Earlier this month, my husband and I, along with another couple, went on a four-day break to Ibiza. We hired a compact four-door manual car with air-conditioning through Auto Europe UK at a cost of \u00a348.56 (although the car itself was supplied by a firm called Interrent). On arrival at the airport, we were told we had to pay for a full tank of petrol in advance before we could pick up the car, at an eye-watering cost of \u20ac77, or around \u00a362 - considerably more than it would have cost to fill up the tank at a local petrol station. This is known as a full-empty fuel policy, and you don't get any refund for returning the car with unused fuel. We emphasised there was no way we would possibly use anyway near a full tank during our short stay and we hadn't been informed of this at the outset. Sure enough, however, buried in the small print of the policy was a clause stating that for rentals of four days or longer, customers are charged for a full tank of petrol in advance. Even though we used the car a great deal during our four-day stay, we barely made a dent in that tank, using about \u20ac5 of petrol at the most. As a result, the car hire company pocketed \u20ac72 of our money, or around \u00a358, only to charge the next poor person hiring the car the same \u20ac77. Auto Europe has apologised and acknowledges that the full-empty fuel option is \"a poor choice\" for customers who are renting a car for a few days only. A spokesman said: \"We have tried to make our website more transparent by presenting the fuel policy on our car display at the point of reservation, but there is more we can do to prevent clients having a poor experience with our product. \"We are happy to refund you the extra cost and will continue to improve our website to avoid similar issues in the future.\"",
