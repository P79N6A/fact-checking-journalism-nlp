    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "The packaging bump that could cut a 4m tonne mountain of UK food waste", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britons throw away more than 4m tonnes of consumable food and drink from their homes ever year and a revamp of the sell-by-date label could save perfectly edible food from the bin bag. It was while researching how blind people utilise public transport that an industrial designer came across an innovation to keep our fridges stocked a little bit longer. Solveiga Pakstaite, 22, says the study led to her question how blind people can check sell-by dates. \u201cOne day I thought \u2018how on Earth do blind people know when their food expires because they can\u2019t read the expiry dates and they don\u2019t know what to eat in the fridge first?\u2019\u201d she says. The result of her curiosity is a work in progress called the Bump Mark; a label which is attached to food packaging and changes shape when the produce deteriorates. When the food is fresh to eat, the label is smooth and curved, but when it has decayed, a plastic bump emerges when fingers are run over it. Stretching beyond the needs of blind people from where the idea originated, the new labelling is being offered as an alternative to traditional best before and expiry dates. Pakstaite, an industrial design and technology graduate from Brunel University, claims it will give a more accurate indication of freshness and save on wastage from consumers throwing out produce which may be good to eat despite being past the date on the packaging. According to the UK government, \u00a312bn worth of food and drink is binned each year, most of it edible. And it is a worldwide problem. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN estimates that one-third of all food which is produced for human consumption is wasted, with fruit and vegetables going in the bin more than any other produce. In Europe, around 100m tonnes of food are thrown away each year. Pakstaite says: \u201cOnly one third of visually impaired people are in paid employment so the rest of them have to survive on very small benefits and they can\u2019t really afford to be throwing food away willy-nilly. They also don\u2019t want to get ill so they definitely [have] caution but they realise how much money they are wasting, not just food waste.\u201d She says: \u201cI knew straight away that it couldn\u2019t just be a solution that could just help blind people because no retailer would take on and spend money on helping this very small group, unfortunately. That is when I went back to my original question, \u2018How do blind people know when their food expires\u2019 and then I thought \u2018How does anyone know?\u2019 We have trusted these random dates that are put on and no one actually knows when their food expires and that is why we are throwing away so much food.\u201d She developed her device by using gelatine, a foodstuff made from the bones of animals and typically used as a setting agent for desserts. When it sets, it becomes a solid jelly but then turns to liquid when it expires. Prototypes for Pakstaite\u2019s invention appear on the corner of food packets as a modest triangle. It consists of a layered pod: on the bottom is a sheet of plastic with bumps on it, which is then topped with a gelatine solution and sealed. Gelatine, being an organic material, deteriorates at the same rate as the food that is in the packaging. So when the jelly-like gelatine goes \u201cbad\u201d and turns to liquid, it means the food has gone bad too. But how can you tell that the gelatine, sealed in its little corner on a packet of cheese, has gone bad? The plastic bumps can be felt at the bottom of the triangle because the tough jelly buffer has gone. The gelatine solution mimics the reaction of the food to changing temperatures. If it is kept in the cold, it will remain solid for longer whereas if it is put in warmer conditions such as a car boot or on a kitchen worktop, it will deteriorate quicker, just as a piece of meat would. The amount of gelatine used in packaging reflects the expected lifespan of the food. Smaller amounts of gelatine deteriorate more quickly, so a piece of cooked chicken \u2013 which needs to be eaten within days \u2013 requires less gelatine than, for instance, a piece of cheese. \u201cThis [plastic bump] would be stuck onto the package at the same time as the food is at its freshest and this basically starts decaying at the same time. If you take it out of the fridge, the food starts expiring quicker obviously because of the higher temperature and this is going to start expiring quicker as well,\u201d Pakstaite says. \u201cI have basically taken another food to tell you what is happening to the food inside the package. It is just that this type of food [gelatine] has the unique property of changing states and gelatine has this property of when it completely expires, it releases its bonds because all of the bacteria has eaten those bonds and it turns back into a liquid. So when you run your finger over the top, you can feel the bumps underneath. It is really simple \u2013 it is a sandwich which breaks down and reveals the bumps underneath.\u201d The advantage of the system, she says, is that it avoids the existing calculation of best before dates which can be too conservative, resulting in food being thrown out. Under her plans, the Bump Mark would be applied at the time of food packaging so that if crates of food were left for periods outside of refrigeration, the effect on the food would be clear \u2013 the gelatine would deteriorate at the same rate as the food. \u201cBy having this the store is having to be completely diligent and regimented and honest.\u201d The disadvantage of using gelatine is borne out in the number of vegetarians who have said they would not buy goods that have labelling made from animal by-products, says Pakstaite, adding that she will either source an alternative or limit its use to dairy and meat products. How the system will operate in large-scale food production is not yet clear. One possibility would be for manufacturers to licence the technology and the Bump Mark being activated when the food is packaged although they will have to decide how to ensure the devices are activated at the time of production, she says. Nonetheless, last year the invention won the prestigious James Dyson award, set up by the British inventor to encourage a new generation of design engineers. Outside of the food industry, there is also the possibility that the packaging could be used for fresh cosmetics, also a perishable product. So far, tests have shown the gelatine can be extended to a lifespan of one month, although Pakstaite believes it may last longer. She hopes that the invention could be formally introduced as a part of food packaging by the end of the year, and reduce Britain\u2019s mountain of food waste.",

      "body": "<p>Britons throw away more than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/07/uk-households-food-waste\">4m tonnes of consumable food and drink</a> from their homes ever year and a revamp of the sell-by-date label could save perfectly edible food from the bin bag.</p> <p>It was while researching how blind people utilise public transport that an industrial designer came across an innovation to keep our fridges stocked a little bit longer. Solveiga Pakstaite, 22, says the study led to her question how blind people can check sell-by dates.</p> <p>\u201cOne day I thought \u2018how on Earth do blind people know when their food expires because they can\u2019t read the expiry dates and they don\u2019t know what to eat in the fridge first?\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>The result of her curiosity is a work in progress called the Bump Mark; a label which is attached to food packaging and changes shape when the produce deteriorates. When the food is fresh to eat, the label is smooth and curved, but when it has decayed, a plastic bump emerges when fingers are run over it.</p> <p>Stretching beyond the needs of blind people from where the idea originated, the new labelling is being offered as an alternative to traditional best before and expiry dates. Pakstaite, an industrial design and technology graduate from Brunel University, claims it will give a more accurate indication of freshness and save on wastage from consumers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/10/half-world-food-waste\">throwing out produce which may be good to eat</a> despite being past the date on the packaging.</p> <p>According to the UK government, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-and-managing-waste/supporting-pages/food-waste\">\u00a312bn worth of food and drink is binned each year</a>, most of it edible. And it is a worldwide problem. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN estimates that one-third of all food which is produced for human consumption is wasted, with fruit and vegetables going in the bin more than any other produce. In Europe, around 100m tonnes of food are thrown away each year.</p> <p>Pakstaite says: \u201cOnly one third of visually impaired people are in paid employment so the rest of them have to survive on very small benefits and they can\u2019t really afford to be throwing food away willy-nilly. They also don\u2019t want to get ill so they definitely [have] caution but they realise how much money they are wasting, not just food waste.\u201d</p> <p>She says: \u201cI knew straight away that it couldn\u2019t just be a solution that could just help blind people because no retailer would take on and spend money on helping this very small group, unfortunately. That is when I went back to my original question, \u2018How do blind people know when their food expires\u2019 and then I thought \u2018How does anyone know?\u2019 We have trusted these random dates that are put on and no one actually knows when their food expires and that is why we are throwing away so much food.\u201d</p> <p>She developed her device by using gelatine, a foodstuff made from the bones of animals and typically used as a setting agent for desserts. When it sets, it becomes a solid jelly but then turns to liquid when it expires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbcd1fe48ba5e0eea1c31f5f40cfdf071ccd3233\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/25/1422198078932/ae27d222-aeda-41ff-a02a-766c7395570b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Solveig Pakstaite's Bump Mark.

Photo by Linda Nylind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prototypes for Pakstaite\u2019s invention appear on the corner of food packets as a modest triangle. It consists of a layered pod: on the bottom is a sheet of plastic with bumps on it, which is then topped with a gelatine solution and sealed. Gelatine, being an organic material, deteriorates at the same rate as the food that is in the packaging. So when the jelly-like gelatine goes \u201cbad\u201d and turns to liquid, it means the food has gone bad too. But how can you tell that the gelatine, sealed in its little corner on a packet of cheese, has gone bad? The plastic bumps can be felt at the bottom of the triangle because the tough jelly buffer has gone. The gelatine solution mimics the reaction of the food to changing temperatures. If it is kept in the cold, it will remain solid for longer whereas if it is put in warmer conditions such as a car boot or on a kitchen worktop, it will deteriorate quicker, just as a piece of meat would.</p> <p>The amount of gelatine used in packaging reflects the expected lifespan of the food. Smaller amounts of gelatine deteriorate more quickly, so a piece of cooked chicken \u2013 which needs to be eaten within days \u2013 requires less gelatine than, for instance, a piece of cheese.</p> <p>\u201cThis [plastic bump] would be stuck onto the package at the same time as the food is at its freshest and this basically starts decaying at the same time. If you take it out of the fridge, the food starts expiring quicker obviously because of the higher temperature and this is going to start expiring quicker as well,\u201d Pakstaite says.</p> <p>\u201cI have basically taken another food to tell you what is happening to the food inside the package. It is just that this type of food [gelatine] has the unique property of changing states and gelatine has this property of when it completely expires, it releases its bonds because all of the bacteria has eaten those bonds and it turns back into a liquid. So when you run your finger over the top, you can feel the bumps underneath. It is really simple \u2013 it is a sandwich which breaks down and reveals the bumps underneath.\u201d</p> <p>The advantage of the system, she says, is that it avoids the existing calculation of best before dates which can be too conservative, resulting in food being thrown out. Under her plans, the Bump Mark would be applied at the time of food packaging so that if crates of food were left for periods outside of refrigeration, the effect on the food would be clear \u2013 the gelatine would deteriorate at the same rate as the food. \u201cBy having this the store is having to be completely diligent and regimented and honest.\u201d</p> <p>The disadvantage of using gelatine is borne out in the number of vegetarians who have said they would not buy goods that have labelling made from animal by-products, says Pakstaite, adding that she will either source an alternative or limit its use to dairy and meat products.</p> <p>How the system will operate in large-scale food production is not yet clear. One possibility would be for manufacturers to licence the technology and the Bump Mark being activated when the food is packaged although they will have to decide how to ensure the devices are activated at the time of production, she says.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of academics in Japan and elsewhere who argue it is impossible for a high-wage nation like Japan, struggling against low-cost competitors, to ever go back to a high yen. There is a growing feeling that the UK is in the same position. British holidaymakers will benefit hugely from the falling euro, but exports are going to be hit hard. John Mills, the businessman and Labour donor, will argue in a book published later in the spring that sterling should be nearer parity with the dollar and not the current $1.50. He says manufacturers cannot be expected to expand production in any meaningful way until the currency falls. Will the Americans find their recovery faltering under pressure from a high dollar? In response, Congress might put pressure on the president to impose tariffs on artificially low-cost imports. Anger at China over its policy of depreciation might spill over into disputes with Japan and Europe for the same reason. And the US Federal Reserve chief, Janet Yellen, could come under pressure to block a planned increase in interest rates to halt the dollar\u2019s rise. If she does, global currency wars will be in full flow. Climate change should keep us all awake The first day of the World Economic Forum in Davos was dominated by calls for 2015 to be a year of action on climate change. But while some in the business community worry about sustainability, there is plenty of evidence that the vast bulk of business executives give it no consideration at all. \u201cWe are seeing the accelerated impact of climate change,\u201d World Bank boss Jim Yong Kim said in a speech on Wednesday. \u201cLast year was the hottest on record. That matters. Extreme weather is real. It\u2019s a complete no-brainer to move towards cleaner, more livable cities.\u201d Former US vice-president Al Gore teamed up with pop star Pharrell Williams to launch a second round of Live Earth concerts to raise awareness before crucial UN talks in November. He accused fossil fuel companies in particular of using the atmosphere as \u201can open sewer\u201d for carbon emissions, which are in danger of driving global warming to ruinous levels. Yet according to PwC\u2019s 18th annual survey of global chief executives, climate change is not among the top 19 risks that keep them awake at night. \u201cOverregulation\u201d is their top worry \u2013 government policies that interfere in business and undermine growth prospects. Skills, tax systems and cybersecurity are also among their concerns, but the future of the planet is not something that most chief executives lose sleep over. The odd organisation, such as insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London, which is seeing a huge increase in weather-related claims, understands the risks of doing nothing about climate change. But a far wider pool of executives still seem to think no further than their next quarterly financial results. Gore has a seven-point programme that involves fighting for a moratorium on new coal-burning power plants, cutting dependence on oil, and people and corporations making themselves \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d. Will business respond with a sense of urgency? No. All hail the Sophisticated Fraud Office Mayfair hedge fund manager Magnus Peterson began a 13-year jail term on Friday for forgery, fraud and false accounting. It is one of the heaviest sentences ever imposed for a white-collar crime, and Peterson is planning to appeal. Two years ago, then Serious Fraud Office director Richard Alderman dropped the case against him for lack of evidence. In truth, Alderman bottled it. He took the view that some financial crimes are too complex to put before easily confused jurors. That decision, sadly, was an abdication of the agency\u2019s central function: ensuring no one in the financial world is beyond the law. Common sense prevailed under Alderman\u2019s successor, David Green, who reopened the case. Peterson nevertheless maintained he was a misunderstood sophisticated investor. That was hogwash. \u201cSophisticated dishonesty on this scale calls for the maximum sentence possible,\u201d the sentencing judge told Peterson. Those words now ring out over Mayfair and the City. The SFO has its teeth back.",

      "bodyText": "This weekend, with President Barack Obama making his second visit to the Indian capital, many international eyes are on the Indian economy which, after having flagged for several years, is showing significant signs of renewed vitality. A decade ago, India was frequently bracketed with China as one of the Bric economies \u2013 rising global powers whose young population and sheer size gave them huge potential. But while China has romped ahead, growing at double-digit rates, India, the world\u2019s largest democracy, has sometimes struggled to live up to those hopes. But last week the IMF predicted that India could overtake China to become the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy by 2016, with a growth rate of 6.5%, topping China\u2019s 6.3%. In 2014, India\u2019s economy grew by only 5.8%, against China\u2019s 7.4%, according to forecasts published by the IMF, and by 5% compared with 7.8% for China in 2013. \u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable assessment. China has hit a demographic trap. But India\u2019s working population is increasing all the time, producing, saving and consuming,\u201d said Mohan Guruswamy, a Delhi-based economist and analyst. Some observers are more conservative in their assessment, but few doubt the dramatic change in atmosphere attributable to the landslide victory of Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata party in last year\u2019s election, and the appointment of respected economist Raghuram Rajan as governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Rajan surprised financial markets by cutting interest rates earlier this month, as the falling cost of oil dampened the risks of inflation. Modi, who was elected on a pro-development platform, has promised to push through some of the major reforms long called for by financial institutions and foreign investors, cutting red tape, slashing subsidies and easing the path for overseas firms. Though some are growing impatient at the delay in big-ticket measures, the difference to the sense of drift of the later years of the last administration \u2013 led by the centre-left Congress party \u2013 is marked. Low oil prices have also given India\u2019s public finances a big boost. However, the IMF warned that the prospects for a pick-up in growth could be threatened by \u201cany slackening in the reform momentum\u201d. \u201cI think the reform plans of the new prime minister are promising. We are going to have to see the speed of the implementation,\u201d said Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, deputy director of the IMF\u2019s research department. \u201cThe main challenge for India is creating jobs,\u201d added Guruswamy. \u201cThere needs to be rapid industrialisation in India, and that needs reforms of labour laws and land acquisition procedures, among many other things.\u201d Few doubt, however, the scale of the obstacles that remain. Bureaucracy and red tape, as well as a huge deficit in infrastructure and a severe lack of skilled workers, could all combine to put the brakes on growth. Bad loans are a major issue for India\u2019s banks, and much of the country remains mired in poverty. Ministers admit privately that skill levels are very low. The government also currently lacks a majority in the upper house of the national assembly, a problem which, thanks to India\u2019s voting system, is unlikely to be resolved until 2017 or later. This makes passing major reforms significantly more difficult.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fracking, fashion and fanzines are not the sort of conversation topics your average businessman might bring up, especially not liberally interspersed with a different F-word. But then Joe Corr\u00e9 is not your average entrepreneur. The multimillionaire founder of racy lingerie retailer Agent Provocateur \u2013 who has now moved on to a make-up business and two clothing labels \u2013 is on a wider social and political mission. What is less surprising is that the 47-year-old has a nostalgic interest in the heyday of 1970s punk: his parents, Vivienne Westwood and the late Malcolm McLaren, helped spawn the Sex Pistols. First, though, fracking. Corr\u00e9 (and his fashion-legend mother) are not fans of the technique, and they\u2019re about to put time and money into trying to derail any UK shale gas revolution through their support for the Green party before this year\u2019s general election. \u201cI spend a hell of a lot of time on this issue because it has woken me up to the fact that something has to change \u2013 in the political world and in the way government is run. When I first started looking at fracking, I thought it was not that important: we probably need this gas. But once you start to peel back the curtain, it\u2019s like looking at this pond of slime, and that has encouraged me to become much more politically focused on this election and to get these people [government ministers] out of positions of authority. \u201cAnd I think the chances are really high because everybody is waking up in this country \u2013 not just to [environmental and other concerns around] fracking \u2013 but to the fact that the prime minister is just an errand boy to the corporations.\u201d Corr\u00e9 reckons that the fossil fuel companies, in cahoots with compliant scientists, politicians and media, are collectively trying to railroad through legislation to allow shale gas exploration without justification and without the consent of the British people. He is incensed that, on Monday, the coalition will try to push through an infrastructure bill which, Corr\u00e9 argues, will allow companies to drill for shale gas underneath schools and other buildings without landowners\u2019 consent. The businessman and, now, Green party supporter believes the dangers of water contamination and air pollution \u2013 never mind the impact on climate change of having more fossil fuels to burn \u2013 are being swept aside in a rush for profit: something the government and the corporations involved strongly deny. \u201cThere are plenty of horror stories [from America, where fracking is well-established] if you look for them: cattle dying, respiratory diseases and birth defects. It goes on and on. It is like Erin Brockovich (the 2000 film about a legal-clerk-turned-environmental-campaigner), but on an epic scale.\u201d Corr\u00e9, who was given his grandmother\u2019s Portuguese surname by his mother, says all he really wants is the opportunity for an open debate about the issues, which he believes has never happened. He has set up a website, talkfracking.org, and organised a series of events around the country, but says it was effectively boycotted by industry and pro-shale politicians. His involvement \u2013 and that of his mother \u2013 opens up the intriguing possibility that the traditionally dour Green party could be given a streetwise, punkish makeover. Corr\u00e9 plays down that possibility, however, insisting that the party has a long tradition of activism, and it will be entirely up to its leadership and fast-growing membership to decide how the Corr\u00e9/Westwood skills are utilised. Alongside this campaigning, Corr\u00e9 is continuing to support sustainability projects, via his Humanade charity, and to expand his businesses. The punk philanthropist sold his stake in Agent Provocateur in 2007 when the firm was bought for \u00a370m by venture capital group 3i. Corr\u00e9 was kept on for a while as a creative director, but left in a row about the use of controversial models in marketing campaigns. Since then he has devoted himself to Illamasqua, the beauty brand founded by Yorkshire marketing guru Julian Kynaston, which Corr\u00e9 joined in 2010, and his fashion shops, A Child of the Jago and the newer Jack Sheppard, which recently moved into adjoining premises on London\u2019s Charing Cross Road. Illamasqua has grown quickly beyond a presence in Selfridges and Debenhams department stores to outlets in Croatia, the Middle East and, increasingly, south-east Asia. The company, whose name is a combination of the words \u201cillusion\u201d and \u201cmasquerade\u201d, has \u201cbeen through the mill a bit\u201d, according to Corr\u00e9, because it expanded too fast. But he says it is now back on a successful track: \u201cThe product is fucking brilliant. People fall in love with it \u2026 It is based on proper theatrical make-up, of the kind that started in the Weimar Republic and the Cabaret era of Berlin. It is highly pigmented and high quality. Under bright lights and heat, it stays on.\u201d The clothing businesses also have a historic bent: A Child of the Jago is named after a 19th-century novel; Jack Sheppard was an 18th-century prison breaker who was hanged at Tyburn. The shops are really a throwback to the days when his parents ran punk shop Sex \u2013 later renamed Seditionaries \u2013 on King\u2019s Road in Chelsea. Seditionaries was billed as \u201cclothes for heroes\u201d; Jago\u2019s tagline is \u201coriginal terrorist clothing\u201d. Corr\u00e9 tells of being picked up from school by members of the Sex Pistols \u2013 \u201cit was embarrassing really\u201d \u2013 and taken to his parents\u2019 shop. \u201cIt\u2019s in the blood. You use a shop to put forward ideas. I worked for my mum for nine years after my father left and I\u2019ve grown up with retail. I am proud of being a shopkeeper, but you have to remain small and use local materials, otherwise all you get is supermarkets and megabrands or shopping centres like Westfield. What\u2019s that all about? Small scale brings pleasure to consumer and shopkeeper. It\u2019s much better for the economy and for our general well-being.\u201d As Corr\u00e9 smilingly looks through a print-out of old punk fanzine covers, it is tempting to ask him whether he isn\u2019t just nakedly trying to commercialise teenage rebellion. \u201cWhose fucking teenage rebellion is that then?\u201d he asks. \u201cNo one rebels any more. Most of them wear M&amp;S, Topman or Jack Wills. But I do see hope in the Scottish referendum. They [those who voted for independence] almost did it, and this was because a younger age group became really inspired.\u201d Corr\u00e9 is hoping to see something similar happen in the forthcoming general election, and believes opposition to fracking can be a catalyst for wider political change. \u201cThere is a chance to really unite people across the board. If you think of Balcombe [the site of a successful anti-shale protest in 2013], it is a microcosm of everything about fracking. Balcombe is a staunchly Conservative, blue-rinse, bridge-playing village in Sussex. It\u2019s not lefty, greeny. And yet a lot of people were hopping mad about it. \u201cThere is an alliance of people right across the political spectrum. Fracking has opened their eyes to the whole way in which government is corrupted by lobbyists, and scientists are corrupted by corporations. That is why fracking is such a hot election issue.\u201d GOING GREEN Vivienne Westwood, 73, is to throw her cash, time and skills behind the Green party in the runup to the general election on 7 May. The designer has long campaigned on climate change and against fracking. But now there are hopes that Westwood, and her commercially successful and ecologically aware son Joe, will bring some extra glitz to the Green party as it starts moving up in the opinion polls. \u201cThe Green party are against austerity, against fracking and pro-community. Starting from this platform we could build a true economy based on real human values,\u201d said Westwood. \u201cI am investing in the Green party because I believe it is in the best interests of our country and our economy. I hope that by my example other individuals and businesses will follow suit.\u201d",

Corr\u00e9 was kept on for a while as a creative director, but left in a row about the use of controversial models in marketing campaigns.</p> <p>Since then he has devoted himself to Illamasqua, the beauty brand founded by Yorkshire marketing guru Julian Kynaston, which Corr\u00e9 joined in 2010, and his fashion shops, A Child of the Jago and the newer Jack Sheppard, which recently moved into adjoining premises on London\u2019s Charing Cross Road.</p> <p>Illamasqua has grown quickly beyond a presence in Selfridges and Debenhams department stores to outlets in Croatia, the Middle East and, increasingly, south-east Asia. The company, whose name is a combination of the words \u201cillusion\u201d and \u201cmasquerade\u201d, has \u201cbeen through the mill a bit\u201d, according to Corr\u00e9, because it expanded too fast.</p> <p>But he says it is now back on a successful track: \u201cThe product is fucking brilliant. People fall in love with it \u2026 It is based on proper theatrical make-up, of the kind that started in the Weimar Republic and the <em>Cabaret </em>era of Berlin. It is highly pigmented and high quality. Under bright lights and heat, it stays on.\u201d</p> <p>The clothing businesses also have a historic bent: A Child of the Jago is named after a 19th-century novel; Jack Sheppard was an 18th-century prison breaker who was hanged at Tyburn. The shops are really a throwback to the days when his parents ran punk shop Sex \u2013 later renamed Seditionaries \u2013 on King\u2019s Road in Chelsea. Seditionaries was billed as \u201cclothes for heroes\u201d; Jago\u2019s tagline is \u201coriginal terrorist clothing\u201d.</p> <p>Corr\u00e9 tells of being picked up from school by members of the Sex Pistols \u2013 \u201cit was embarrassing really\u201d \u2013 and taken to his parents\u2019 shop. \u201cIt\u2019s in the blood. You use a shop to put forward ideas. I worked for my mum for nine years after my father left and I\u2019ve grown up with retail. I am proud of being a shopkeeper, but you have to remain small and use local materials, otherwise all you get is supermarkets and megabrands or shopping centres like Westfield. What\u2019s that all about? Small scale brings pleasure to consumer and shopkeeper. It\u2019s much better for the economy and for our general well-being.\u201d</p> <p>As Corr\u00e9 smilingly looks through a print-out of old punk fanzine covers, it is tempting to ask him whether he isn\u2019t just nakedly trying to commercialise teenage rebellion.</p> <p>\u201cWhose fucking teenage rebellion is that then?\u201d he asks. \u201cNo one rebels any more. Most of them wear M&amp;S, Topman or Jack Wills. But I do see hope in the Scottish referendum. They [those who voted for independence] almost did it, and this was because a younger age group became really inspired.\u201d</p> <p>Corr\u00e9 is hoping to see something similar happen in the forthcoming general election, and believes opposition to fracking can be a catalyst for wider political change.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a chance to really unite people across the board. If you think of Balcombe [the site of a successful anti-shale protest in 2013], it is a microcosm of everything about fracking. Balcombe is a staunchly Conservative, blue-rinse, bridge-playing village in Sussex. It\u2019s not lefty, greeny. And yet a lot of people were hopping mad about it.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an alliance of people right across the political spectrum. Fracking has opened their eyes to the whole way in which government is corrupted by lobbyists, and scientists are corrupted by corporations. That is why fracking is such a hot election issue.\u201d</p> <h2>GOING GREEN</h2> <p>Vivienne Westwood, 73, is to throw her cash, time and skills behind the Green party in the runup to the general election on 7 May.</p> <p>The designer has long campaigned on climate change and against fracking. But now there are hopes that Westwood, and her commercially successful and ecologically aware son Joe, will bring some extra glitz to the Green party as it starts moving up in the opinion polls.</p> <p>\u201cThe Green party are against austerity, against fracking and pro-community. Starting from this platform we could build a true economy based on real human values,\u201d said Westwood.</p> <p>\u201cI am investing in the Green party because I believe it is in the best interests of our country and our economy. I hope that by my example other individuals and businesses will follow suit.\u201d</p>",
