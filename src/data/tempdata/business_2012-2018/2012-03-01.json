The worst-hit plant will be Brough in East Yorkshire, where BAE is to make 750 compulsory redundancies and end manufacturing \u2013 a move described by trade unions as a \"disgraceful dereliction of duty\". The future of manufacturing at the facility \u2013 which built Hawk jets used by the Red Arrows display team \u2013 was put in doubt last September, along with others around the UK. Workers and MPs including the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, campaigned to save Brough, while the prime minister promised defence staff he would put their case at a meeting with BAE boss Ian King. But the company said on Thursday it expected to save only about 1,000 of the 3,000 jobs it had targeted in the autumn. A spokeswoman said BAE had done all it could to transfer workers around the company and use a voluntary redundancy scheme to mitigate the cuts demanded by a downturn in UK, US and other national defence spending. \"BAE Systems has informed employees that it has now concluded consultation on the business proposal to potentially end manufacturing at Brough,\" the company said in a statement. \"This is due to no viable and practical alternative being found despite the extensive and meaningful consultation that has taken place with the trade unions and executive representatives.\" The company originally intended to cut 900 jobs at the plant, but 50 staff have been redeployed and 100 have taken voluntary severance. Brough has been operating as a plane-building plant since 1916, when it was owned by the Blackburn Aeroplane &amp; Motor Company. Among the famous products developed and constructed there were the Harrier jump jet and the Buccaneer, used by the Royal Navy as recently as the first Gulf war. BAE said the timing of cuts elsewhere would depend on various factors such as consultation periods. It said Hawks would be made in Lancashire and the company was still winning plane contracts in countries such as India, Oman and Australia. The Unite union said it was meeting with lawyers to pursue legal action on behalf of the workers at the site. \"BAE Systems has displayed a disgraceful dereliction of duty to a world-class workforce,\" said Ian Waddell, from Unite. \"Management has chosen to take the most extreme decision by unnecessarily opting to close Brough entirely.

The Spanish predicament is even worse as the new regime comes into force. The conservative government of Mariano Rajoy is grappling with a budget deficit last year of 8.5%, well above the pact's ceiling of 3%, making it virtually impossible to get the deficit down to the target of 4.4% this year.

In the Netherlands, too, there are growing calls for the terms of the fiscal pact to be ignored \u2013 most notably the 3% budget deficit limit. The official Dutch economics analysis office predicted budget deficits of 4.5%, 4.1%, and 3.3% for the next three years, all in breach of the new rules, presenting a dilemma for the minority coalition of liberals and Christian Democrats. The figures mean the government will need to deliver savings of up to \u20ac15bn next year, compared to the \u20ac18bn in cuts over four years promised only six months ago. The Dutch government has been among the strongest advocates of austerity for Greece and other bailed-out countries throughout the crisis and Thursday's figures triggered a certain amount of glee on the debtors' side of the eurozone. \"There may be some schadenfreude,\" said a senior EU official. \"But this is about credibility. The Dutch are the ones who have been insisting on strict fiscal rules. They will have to do something.\" While Spain is asking Brussels for more time to put its fiscal house in order, there is no sign of the Dutch doing so. The new fiscal pact was the price exacted by Germany for agreeing to a second Greek bailout and to the new permanent bailout fund. While eurozone finance ministers in Brussels failed to fully approve the new Greek deal, they set the ball rolling by posting \u20ac35 bn of collateral with the European Central Bank. But at German insistence, it appeared that the summit, which is formally focused on finding ways to boost EU growth, would not discuss increasing the bailout fund, as demanded by Washington, Beijing, and London. The permanent fund, the European stability mechanism, is to hold \u20ac500bn, but is viewed as an inadequate firewall to stem a bond market attack on, say, Italy. Merkel, virtually alone in the eurozone, has been resisting intense pressure to increase the firewall capacity, but German media reports on Thursday suggested she would perform a U-turn by the end of the month. \"We will not be able to resist this pressure for long,\" she was quoted as telling cabinet colleagues in reference to urging from Washington and the International Monetary Fund.

      "bodyText": "George Culmer, the new finance director of part-nationalised Lloyds Banking Group, is in line for a salary and perks package worth up to \u00a36m after three years, it has emerged. His total remuneration includes compensation of close to \u00a32m for forfeiting a bonus at his previous employer, the insurance company RSA. The pay of senior executives at Lloyds and rival Royal Bank of Scotland has come under intense political and public scrutiny since the government bailed out both banks to the tune of \u00a366bn during the 2008 financial crisis. RBS boss Stephen Hester agreed to forgo his bonus after an outcry that led to heated exchanges in the House of Commons and tensions in the RBS boardroom. Lloyds, which is 40% owned by the taxpayer, said Culmer, 49, would take up his position on 16 May and receive an annual salary of \u00a3720,000, as well as a discretionary annual bonus worth up to a maximum of 200% of his salary. The appointment brings to an end a drawn-out process in trying to agree a start date for Culmer, who was required to work a 12-month notice period for RSA. In addition, Culmer is eligible for a long-term performance share award of up to 225% of his salary for 2012, which would vest in full in three years' time if he meets his targets. He will also get an allowance to fund personal pension arrangements worth 25% of his salary, taking his potential annual pay, bonus and benefits to \u00a34m. On top of that, Lloyds will compensate Culmer for deferred awards and a cash bonus he will forfeit after quitting RSA by giving him \u00a31.9m worth of shares, which vest in 2013 and 2014. Culmer agreed to join Lloyds at the end of last year but has been involved in difficult negotiations with RSA over when he could legally begin his new role. The previous finance boss at Lloyds, Tim Tookey, left the company last week to take on the same role at insurer Resolution, leaving Lloyds with a gaping hole in its boardroom in March and April. But Lloyds said members of chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio's finance team would plug the gap until Culmer's arrival in mid-May. \"We look forward to him joining us in time for our annual meeting on 17 May,\" said Lloyds chairman Win Bischoff. Horta-Os\u00f3rio returned to work last month after a two-month absence brought on in October when he could not sleep for five days and was diagnosed as suffering from exhaustion. But after unveiling Lloyds figures last week that showed a loss in 2011 of \u00a33.5bn, he joked he was now sleeping \"like a baby\", and was looking forward to returning the bank to rude financial health. Horta-Os\u00f3rio asked not to be considered for a bonus for 2011 partly because of his absence but also, he said, because of \"the tough financial circumstances that many people are facing\". On Friday, he said the prolonged low interest rate environment would mean some key targets would not be met on time, but that the bank would benefit from a faster than expected reduction in impairment charges in 2012. The outlook was \"not a profit warning\", just \"realistic\" about the economy, where he expects house prices to be \"broadly flat\" for the next two years, with \"fairly modest\" growth in the economy in the second half of 2012.",

      "bodyText": "Toymaker Lego has been thinking pink for the first time \u2013 and new product ranges have helped the plastic brick firm improve profits and sales as it launched its first successful product for young girls since its inception in 1934. Drew Brazer, Lego's director for the UK and Ireland, said the company had tried on previous occasions to come up with something specifically aimed at girls, but nothing had worked. Now, alongside the usual policemen, helicopters and dustbin lorries is \"Stephanie's cool convertible\" \u2013 a purple car with pink accessories \u2013 and the \"Butterfly Beauty Shop\", complete with lipsticks. Brazer said: \"After four years of research involving mums and daughters, we've come up with something called Lego Friends that is selling extremely well; it will help drive growth in 2012.\" Lego Friends, aimed at six to 12-year-olds and launched on Boxing Day, is centred around five characters: Olivia, Emma, Stephanie, Mia and Andrea. Girls can build a cafe, veterinary hospital or tree house with bricks that include six new colours, mostly pastels, yellow and purple. Brazer said: \"Boys and girls have always been attracted to Lego, but the girls have tended to drift off at around the age of seven. Now we have in place the key elements to make a girls' product a success.\" Lego's figures for 2011 show global sales soaring by 17% to nearly \u00a32.2bn while operating profit jumped from \u00a3573m to \u00a3660m. Models licensed from popular film franchises like Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter were among the star peformers, together with the new Ninjago line and the City series for five-to-10-year-olds. Brazer said Lego had prospered because of \"product innovation and the tendency of consumers to fall back on trusted brands during hard times\". The children's building toy was not long ago in danger of looking outdated and obsolete among PlayStations, remote-controlled cars and interactive robotic film characters. Today, it is the third most popular toy brand in Britain after Hasbro and Mattel. However, Lego cancelled development of its online Universe game, which was launched in late 2010, after a disappointing reception. J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp, Lego's group chief executive, said: \"It is a highly satisfactory result reflecting a solid growth in profit. Growth in the north American market continued undiminished, and also in most European and Asian markets we were able to report double-digit increases in sales.\" Lego said it expected continued growth but that the \"economic crisis in certain European markets will mean slower growth during the coming year\".",

Now, alongside the usual policemen, helicopters and dustbin lorries is \"Stephanie's cool convertible\" \u2013 a purple car with pink accessories \u2013 and the \"Butterfly Beauty Shop\", complete with lipsticks.</p> <p>Brazer said: \"After four years of research involving mums and daughters, we've come up with something called Lego Friends that is selling extremely well; it will help drive growth in 2012.\"</p> <p>Lego Friends, aimed at six to 12-year-olds and launched on Boxing Day, is centred around five characters: Olivia, Emma, Stephanie, Mia and Andrea. Girls can build a cafe, veterinary hospital or tree house with bricks that include six new colours, mostly pastels, yellow and purple.</p> <p>Brazer said: \"Boys and girls have always been attracted to Lego, but the girls have tended to drift off at around the age of seven. Now we have in place the key elements to make a girls' product a success.\"</p> <p>Lego's figures for 2011 show global sales soaring by 17% to nearly \u00a32.2bn while operating profit jumped from \u00a3573m to \u00a3660m.</p> <p>Models licensed from popular film franchises like Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter were among the star peformers, together with the new Ninjago line and the City series for five-to-10-year-olds.</p> <p>Brazer said Lego had prospered because of \"product innovation and the tendency of consumers to fall back on trusted brands during hard times\".</p> <p>The children's building toy was not long ago in danger of looking outdated and obsolete among PlayStations, remote-controlled cars and interactive robotic film characters. Today, it is the third most popular toy brand in Britain after Hasbro and Mattel.</p> <p>However, Lego cancelled development of its online Universe game, which was launched in late 2010, after a disappointing reception.</p> <p>J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp, Lego's group chief executive, said: \"It is a highly satisfactory result reflecting a solid growth in profit. Growth in the north American market continued undiminished, and also in most European and Asian markets we were able to report double-digit increases in sales.\"</p> <p>Lego said it expected continued growth but that the \"economic crisis in certain European markets will mean slower growth during the coming year\".</p>",

That's why, when they cut a dividend, bosses often use the cheesy euphemism \"rebased\" to describe the new level: they are trying to gain some credit for setting a new floor from which dividends can rise. But here's something novel. Say hello to the volatile dividend policy \u2013 a distribution that could go up, down or sideways in any given year. Naturally, Man Group didn't use the word \"volatile\", it prefers \"revised\". If you suspect that's another euphemism for a cut, you may turn out to be correct. But not necessarily. Here's how it works. From next year, Man's shareholders will get \"at least 100% of adjusted management fee earnings per share\". In other words, all Man's basic earnings \u2013 the fees collected automatically from managing funds, minus the cost of doing business \u2013 will be passed to shareholders. Those fees are currently running at about 12 cents a share. So, yes, a big cut from the current dividend level of 22 cents could be in the offing. Much depends on the level of assets under management, which declined from $69.1bn (\u00a343.3bn) to $58.4bn between March and December last year. The slide has been halted since new year \u2013 $1bn has been added \u2013 but it's early days. But the new dividend policy only describes a formula for a minimum payment. What if Man's funds actually start to perform better? What if performance-related fees, which slumped last year, return? In that case, a decent slice of those performance fees will also be directed to the shareholders. Indeed, Man has about $550m of excess capital to tap if it wishes. So, if you're optimistic about the chances of Man's funds returning to form (especially the huge AHL black-box trend-following system) and attracting inflows again, there's an interesting bet here for an income investor. In 2012, the management says you'll still get a 22-cent dividend, equating to a 10% yield. When the new policy kicks in next year, you should get a 5%-ish yield if Man merely stabilises its business \u2013 but you might get more if management achieves a recovery. It's a gamble on a company whose business model looks substantially less stable than in the past. But the market seems to like the terms \u2013 Man's shares rose 12% \u2013 and one can understand why. Hedge funds' fees are volatile, so a volatile dividend policy makes sense. It is certainly more logical than pledging to pay a dividend that is not covered by earnings. Of course, it is also a mighty come-down from Man's pre-2008 glory days, when the progressive policy progressed as far as 44 cents a share. But, as a way of distributing more meagre and unpredictable rations, the new thinking looks friendly to shareholders. Viva volatility.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK needs shorter factory leases and looser employment laws if it is to thrive in manufacturing, the industrialist Sir James Dyson said. Speaking in London, he told journalists that a key problem that remained for businesses looking to get into manufacturing was the challenge of having to sign long leases on property, and the overheads involved in hiring new staff. \"Nobody wants the expenditure of a lease on a factory which lasts 21 years,\" he said. \"You can't plan 21 years ahead.\" His company of the same name, meanwhile, has its eyes on providing components for electric cars and batteries, using a new digital motor that it has developed. The Dyson engineers are also working on a robot vacuum cleaner \u2013 although \"it's very hard to do\" because of the problems of navigating around a room. Dyson said he had seen too many occasions where unions did not act in everyone's interests. \"I don't think trade unions have been helpful because they show things as divisive. As a modern employer you have to treat people well.\" In February Dyson, which employs 3,600 people worldwide, announced that it was looking to recruit another 300, of whom 200 will be in engineering roles. At least half the new roles will be taken up by graduates \u2013 what Dyson called \"agile minds that are unsullied by other companies\" \u2013 at salaries of up to \u00a328,000, with a \u00a33,000 joining bonus. Dyson, famous for his vacuum cleaner range \u2013 for which he has fought a number of court battles over patents \u2013 also railed at the way many companies put themselves forward as akin to manufacturers: \"I heard the head of British Airways on the radio the other day talking about his 'European product'. He doesn't have a product, he offers a service,\" said Dyson. \"Insurance companies don't make anything. Architects don't make things. We aren't prepared to do the hard job of setting up technology companies in this country.\" Dyson's company is one of the biggest in British manufacturing, with annual revenues heading towards \u00a31bn annually as it emerges from a slowdown in sales in 2005/6. It is highly focused on engineering and design, having shifted manufacturing offshore to Malaysia \u2013 a highly controversial move \u2013 10 years ago. He declined to say what the company's next product will be. \"When we have something, we'll launch it,\" he said. Dyson has been a consistent champion of engineering and science, writing a report called Ingenious Britain for the Conservative party ahead of the 2010 election. He said he was pleased with the changes that the coalition has implemented by offering tax relief for startups and on research and development, and a reduction in capital gains tax on those selling from their companies. \"[The government] gave us more than we asked for,\" he said. \"I think the government is being bold and brave. But there's not a lot the government can really do. They can create the environment where it can all happen.\" But he said that there are still anomalies in the tax regime \u2013 such as that which meant that the British designers of the new Raspberry Pi computer discovered it was cheaper to have it assembled in China than in Britain, because the unassembled individual components would each attract more import tax than the finished item. \"It's good that there has been an uptick of people studying physics in schools,\" he said, while criticising TV and media for failing to offer role models: \"If you watch TV there's a lot about media and acting \u2013 which girls generally want to do,\" he commented. \"But I'm encouraged by a statistic that says that 12% of girls want to be scientists. The trouble is, they want to be pathologists, because they've seen the CSI series.\" Dyson denied that the company's washing machine range, first launched in 2000 but discontinued after what were seen as disappointing sales, had been a failure. \"It was too cheap \u2013 we didn't make enough money from it,\" he insisted. Dyson exports more than 80% of its products: the US is its largest market \u2013 where its upright vacuum cleaner is the best selling by value, according to US market researchers NPD \u2013 followed by Japan.",

Analyst James Hollins said the company's shares had more than doubled since Investec began coverage with a buy recommendation just over a week ago. Cutting his recommendation to hold, Hollins said:</p> <blockquote> Our positive stance was based on the prediction that Thomas Cook would survive in its current form, with (1) a supportive banking syndicate, (2) the short-term appointment of a new chief executive [now expected by the end of March], (3) operational turnaround opportunities, and (4) the likelihood of asset disposals. However, the shares now offer less than 10% upside to our unchanged 30p price target and we therefore move from buy to hold. <br> </blockquote> <p>He said the company's banks were supportive in the short term, but might demand a reduction in its total debt, which could push the company into mounting a rights issue:</p> <blockquote> Asset disposals (around \u00a3200m organic, around \u00a3100m from Thomas Cook India and, we estimate, more than \u00a3300m from a mooted sale of Condor, its German airline) could negate the requirement of an equity raise, but the risk remains of existing shareholder dilution. </blockquote> <p>He said there was still uncertainty about asset disposals, as there was about any takeover.</p> <p>Elsewhere bid speculation also surrounded <strong>Shire</strong>, up 8p to \u00a322.06 on renewed talk of a possible \u00a335 a share offer for the pharmaceutical group. Traders said <strong>AstraZeneca</strong>, 15p better at 28o22.5p and Pfizer were two of a number of possible predators.</p> <p>And <strong>International Power</strong> added 4.2p to 350.1p. GDF Suez owns nearly 70% and there have been repeated suggestions it might want to acquire the outstanding stake, with a price of 410p a share mentioned.</p> <p>Meanwhile the prospect of an auction for <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide</strong> sent its shares climbing 4.1p to 31.98p. Following earlier speculation, India's Tata Communications confirmed it was considering a cash offer for the company. <strong>Vodafone</strong>, 2.45p higher at 171.8p, has already announced it may bid for the business.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 59.74 points better at 5931.25 as investors took the latest eurozone events - including the start of a two day EU summit which has so far not progressed Greece's bailout very far - in their stride. There was a mixed economic picture, with the UK manufacturing survey for February coming in better than expectations, but the US equivalent missing forecasts.</p> <p>Hedge fund group <strong>Man</strong> led the way, up 16.6p to 147.5p after a positive nine month trading update, while advertising group <strong>WPP</strong> rose 24p to 827.5p following an 18% increase in full year profits to just over \u00a31bn.</p> <p>But <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 47p lower at \u00a310.62, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, after reporting flat profits of $1.9bn. With analysts expressing some concern about the size of its $6bn capital expenditure programme, the company also disappointed its followers by saying it would not complete a planned $250m share buy-back programme. So far it has bought $83m worth of shares, and it said:</p> <blockquote> The board is mindful of the impact of a share buy-back on the free float and trading liquidity and it is unlikely this programme will be completed. </blockquote> <p>Liam Fitzpatrick at Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote> While we like the outlook for copper, Kazakhmy's capital expenditure plans are a concern. Given long dated volume growth and cost pressures we expect earnings and cash flow growth to be negative over the next three years. <br> A potential sale of Kazakhmys's 26% stake in Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation is a potential catalyst and, alongside higher copper prices, presents the main upside to the shares. However, potential timing and deal structure is difficult to predict. </blockquote> <p>Numis analyst Cailey Barker was also unimpressed:</p> <blockquote> Costs remain under pressure and we now expect to see gross cash costs moving over $3.00 a pound. Dividend is up 28% which is positive but this is to offset the partially failed buy-back programme. We reduce our target price to \u00a39.50, from \u00a311, and downgrade to a reduce recommendation [from hold] on the back of the lower outlook. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Spirent Communications</strong>, which makes telecoms testing equipment, added 10.9p to 151.8p, after a 10% rise in full year profits to $123.3m. But defence group <strong>Chemring</strong> closed down 20.2p at 418.6p as the company reported continuing delays in orders from the US.</p> <p>Finally loss making infrastructure business <strong>Mouchel</strong>, which is still trying to recover from damage done by government spending cuts, rose 2.5p to 15.75p as it appointed Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor.</p>",

Traders said AstraZeneca, 15p better at 28o22.5p and Pfizer were two of a number of possible predators. And International Power added 4.2p to 350.1p. GDF Suez owns nearly 70% and there have been repeated suggestions it might want to acquire the outstanding stake, with a price of 410p a share mentioned. Meanwhile the prospect of an auction for Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide sent its shares climbing 4.1p to 31.98p. Following earlier speculation, India's Tata Communications confirmed it was considering a cash offer for the company. Vodafone, 2.45p higher at 171.8p, has already announced it may bid for the business. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 59.74 points better at 5931.25 as investors took the latest eurozone events - including the start of a two day EU summit which has so far not progressed Greece's bailout very far - in their stride. There was a mixed economic picture, with the UK manufacturing survey for February coming in better than expectations, but the US equivalent missing forecasts. Hedge fund group Man led the way, up 16.6p to 147.5p after a positive nine month trading update, while advertising group WPP rose 24p to 827.5p following an 18% increase in full year profits to just over \u00a31bn. But Kazakhmys closed 47p lower at \u00a310.62, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, after reporting flat profits of $1.9bn. With analysts expressing some concern about the size of its $6bn capital expenditure programme, the company also disappointed its followers by saying it would not complete a planned $250m share buy-back programme. So far it has bought $83m worth of shares, and it said: The board is mindful of the impact of a share buy-back on the free float and trading liquidity and it is unlikely this programme will be completed. Liam Fitzpatrick at Credit Suisse said: While we like the outlook for copper, Kazakhmy's capital expenditure plans are a concern. Given long dated volume growth and cost pressures we expect earnings and cash flow growth to be negative over the next three years. A potential sale of Kazakhmys's 26% stake in Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation is a potential catalyst and, alongside higher copper prices, presents the main upside to the shares. However, potential timing and deal structure is difficult to predict. Numis analyst Cailey Barker was also unimpressed: Costs remain under pressure and we now expect to see gross cash costs moving over $3.00 a pound. Dividend is up 28% which is positive but this is to offset the partially failed buy-back programme. We reduce our target price to \u00a39.50, from \u00a311, and downgrade to a reduce recommendation [from hold] on the back of the lower outlook. Spirent Communications, which makes telecoms testing equipment, added 10.9p to 151.8p, after a 10% rise in full year profits to $123.3m. But defence group Chemring closed down 20.2p at 418.6p as the company reported continuing delays in orders from the US. Finally loss making infrastructure business Mouchel, which is still trying to recover from damage done by government spending cuts, rose 2.5p to 15.75p as it appointed Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor.",

That is what the <a href=\"http://www2.isda.org/attachment/NDA1Ng==/Not%20a%20Credit%20Event%20FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">International Swaps and Derivatives Association ruled</a> at lunchtime on Thursday, when it announced that the deal to cut Greece's debt did not constitute a \"credit event\". The ISDA added that the situation is evolving and the debt swap could still be classified a credit event at a later date.</p> <h2>What is the ISDA? </h2> <p>Considering it governs a market worth a whopping $700tn - more than 10 times the size of the global economy - the <a href=\"http://www2.isda.org/\" title=\"\">International Swaps and Derivatives Association</a> keeps a very low profile. Made up of banks, hedge funds, and investment houses, it governs the murky world of complex financial instruments that are traded directly between parties rather than on exchanges.</p> <h2>Why is it in the news? </h2> <p>A small part of this market is made up of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/credit-default-swaps\" title=\"\">credit default swaps</a> (CDSs), a sort of insurance contract against a country or company defaulting. These have shot into the limelight as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece\" title=\"\">Greece</a> teeters on default.</p> <h2>What's the ISDA's part in all this?</h2> <p>The ISDA gets to decide <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/01/eurozone-crisis-summit-greece#block-8\" title=\"\">whether the deal to cut Greece's debt constitutes a \"credit event\"</a> \u2013 effectively a default. If it does, that would lead to the payout of billions of dollars to the holders of Greek CDSs. So far, two CDS holders have put questions to the ISDA asking whether the deal represents a default. The ISDA held a conference call to discuss the questions and announced at lunchtime on Thursday that a credit event had not occurred. It noted that \"the situation in the Hellenic Republic is still evolving\" and market participants could submit more questions to the committee as more facts come to light.</p> <h2>Who holds Greek CDSs? </h2> <p>Intriguingly, a number of them will be sitting on the committee that gets to decide. But, so are the investors sat on the other side of the CDSs. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204571404577253781273708956.html\" title=\"\">The Wall Street Journal reports</a> (\u00a3\u00a3) that in September last year, three banks on the committee \u2013 Barclays, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas \u2013 had sold more Greek CDSs than they bought. If that is still the case, it means they would have to pay out if the CDSs were triggered.</p> <h2>What is likely to happen? </h2> <p>An industry veteran says: \"I don't think anyone will be surprised if it was called a default.\" If holders of Greek debt all agreed to the debt swap, which sees their holdings cut in half, it wouldn't. But, Athens has included a Collective Action Clause in the deal, which would force creditors that did not want to swap the debt to do so. The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's has already said it would consider this to be \"selective default\".</p> <h2>Could anything go wrong? </h2> <p>Quite a lot.

      "bodyText": "Greece has not yet defaulted on its debt. That is what the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ruled at lunchtime on Thursday, when it announced that the deal to cut Greece's debt did not constitute a \"credit event\". The ISDA added that the situation is evolving and the debt swap could still be classified a credit event at a later date. What is the ISDA? Considering it governs a market worth a whopping $700tn - more than 10 times the size of the global economy - the International Swaps and Derivatives Association keeps a very low profile. Made up of banks, hedge funds, and investment houses, it governs the murky world of complex financial instruments that are traded directly between parties rather than on exchanges. Why is it in the news? A small part of this market is made up of credit default swaps (CDSs), a sort of insurance contract against a country or company defaulting. These have shot into the limelight as Greece teeters on default. What's the ISDA's part in all this? The ISDA gets to decide whether the deal to cut Greece's debt constitutes a \"credit event\" \u2013 effectively a default. If it does, that would lead to the payout of billions of dollars to the holders of Greek CDSs. So far, two CDS holders have put questions to the ISDA asking whether the deal represents a default. The ISDA held a conference call to discuss the questions and announced at lunchtime on Thursday that a credit event had not occurred. It noted that \"the situation in the Hellenic Republic is still evolving\" and market participants could submit more questions to the committee as more facts come to light. Who holds Greek CDSs? Intriguingly, a number of them will be sitting on the committee that gets to decide. But, so are the investors sat on the other side of the CDSs. The Wall Street Journal reports (\u00a3\u00a3) that in September last year, three banks on the committee \u2013 Barclays, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas \u2013 had sold more Greek CDSs than they bought. If that is still the case, it means they would have to pay out if the CDSs were triggered. What is likely to happen? An industry veteran says: \"I don't think anyone will be surprised if it was called a default.\" If holders of Greek debt all agreed to the debt swap, which sees their holdings cut in half, it wouldn't. But, Athens has included a Collective Action Clause in the deal, which would force creditors that did not want to swap the debt to do so. The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's has already said it would consider this to be \"selective default\". Could anything go wrong? Quite a lot. After a default, a CDS auction is held to determine how much insurance should be paid out. This is based on the price of the cheapest Greek bond. So, if Greek debt was trading at 25 cents to the dollar, the CDS would pay out 75 cents to the dollar. However, the auction process can take up to a month, by which time there will be none of the original Greek debt left because of the bond swap. So? \"If all the bonds disappear once they're restructured, you've got nothing to deliver,\" says the industry veteran. \"It'll be a bit messy.\" That may be something of an understatement. Others say this could be the end of the sovereign CDS market. If CDSs don't protect against default, there's very little point in holding them.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that Britain will avoid a double dip recession were given a boost on Thursday after a survey of manufacturers found the positive mood established in the first month of the year had continued into February. The Markit Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey of the manufacturing sector, conducted with the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply (Cips), found the level of activity dipped from 52 to 51.2, but remained above the 50-mark that indicates whether the sector is growing or contracting. However, a fall in new orders, amid evidence of strong headwinds from public sector cuts and recession in some eurozone countries is likely to cause concern. Simon Wells, of HSBC, said, \"anecdotal evidence from manufacturers report declining demand from mainland Europe, offset by rising exports to the US and Asia. Given that around half of UK exports go to Europe, this is a worrying development.\" Markit said the prospect of plentiful new orders had failed to materialise while inflation, largely a result of higher oil prices, was expected to eat into profit margins. It said: \"Inflows of total new work and export orders were both broadly unchanged following mild gains in January, while cost inflationary pressures rose sharply. Although the rate of inflation was well below that seen a year ago, the turnaround in the trend was striking. The index tracking input prices posted its steepest month-on-month gain in over 19 years and the second sharpest in the survey history. Companies reported higher prices for chemicals, feedstocks, metals, oil, plastics and transportation,\" it added. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit and author of the Markit/Cips manufacturing PMI: \"UK manufacturers continued to raise production and employment in February, building on the solid foundation seen so far at the start of 2012. This raises hopes that the sector will post an expansion over Q1 as a whole, or at least improve on the disappointing 0.9% contraction seen at the end of last year. \"However, the latest PMI survey brought the headwinds faced by manufacturers into sharper focus. Growth of new work from both domestic and overseas clients stagnated, with reports of weak demand from the eurozone offsetting new business wins in the US and Asia. Cost inflation also resurfaced, picking up sharply on the back of high oil prices and associated increases in the costs of chemicals, energy and transportation. If this combination of rising costs and weak demand persists, sustaining output growth and job creation will become increasingly difficult.\"",

The ideas go beyond those set out by the government only a month ago designed to restrict levels of executive pay. It says the current design of executive pay schemes \"encourages decisions, such as major acquisitions, which are likely to have large effects for good or ill in a relatively short time scale. Paradoxically, the effect of a 'long term incentive plan' may be to encourage risk taking with a short time horizon\".</p> <p>It says \"the design of executive remuneration schemes, far from being an issue which brings managers and shareholders closer together, is now a principal source of friction between them\".</p> <p>On quarterly reporting, singled out by Kay for its distorting impact on company managers' time horizons, the government is likely to be very supportive. Ministerial sources pointed out that the European Ccommission has recently proposed moving away from mandatory requirements on quoted companies to produce quarterly reports and interim management statements.</p>",

The ideas go beyond those set out by the government only a month ago designed to restrict levels of executive pay. It says the current design of executive pay schemes \"encourages decisions, such as major acquisitions, which are likely to have large effects for good or ill in a relatively short time scale. Paradoxically, the effect of a 'long term incentive plan' may be to encourage risk taking with a short time horizon\". It says \"the design of executive remuneration schemes, far from being an issue which brings managers and shareholders closer together, is now a principal source of friction between them\". On quarterly reporting, singled out by Kay for its distorting impact on company managers' time horizons, the government is likely to be very supportive. Ministerial sources pointed out that the European Ccommission has recently proposed moving away from mandatory requirements on quoted companies to produce quarterly reports and interim management statements.",
