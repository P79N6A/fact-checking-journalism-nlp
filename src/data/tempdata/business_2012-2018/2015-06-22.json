Second, in assessing the above, ask whether it is really credible that Greece\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio will fall to a sustainable level as a result of the plan. Third, bear in mind that financial markets\u2019 euphoria for Greek deals tends to last only about 48 hours. All will be relevant in coming days, now that the action in Brussels is generating a whiff of optimism. Thursday is billed as the moment that six months of negotiations and standoffs will conclude with compromise and agreement. In broad outline, Athens may be ready to concede a few more reforms, even if economy minister Giorgos Stathakis told the BBC that these do not involve crossing the ruling Syriza party\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d. In return, the eurozone creditors may accept that debt relief will be required in the future, provided Athens sticks to its pledges. As a script, it\u2019s an improvement on mutual hostility. But the glaring hole is likely to be the lack of detail on debt relief. An agreement in principle to revisit the issue would represent yet another exercise in pain-deferral on the part of the lenders. Greece\u2019s debts stand at almost 180% of GDP. In the first two bailouts, the ambition was to get to 120% by 2020, even if few outsiders thought the target plausible. Jonathan Loynes at thinktank Capital Economics reckons an even bigger reduction is required. \u201cOnce realistic economic assumptions are made, a debt write-off of as much as 50% is needed to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio down to a sustainable level,\u201d he said. Barring a truly miraculous turn of events, a write-off of that size will not be contemplated. The creditors aren\u2019t going to start discussing how to divide \u20ac160bn or so of losses; nor do they seem ready to talk about how to conjure a smaller sum by pushing repayment dates over the horizon or tweaking interest rates. Investors know that, of course, which is why relief in markets may be short-lived. The temptation is to think that a negotiation that has had such a stormy passage will produce a definitive outcome.

It\u2019s a premium of 43% to last Friday\u2019s share price and about 20 times last year\u2019s earnings. Unsurprisingly, Ferrero has been able to gobble 29.9% of Thorntons on the spot and secure acceptances on another 4%. Victory, then, is virtually guaranteed. But why does Ferrero want Thorntons? The brand is well-known but buying other people\u2019s brands is out of character for the family-controlled Italian outfit that owns Nutella and Kinder eggs. Nor does Ferrero own or run shops. A desire to expand in the UK seems to be one reason. Another may be the idea that Thorntons, as part of a bigger chocolate box (Ferrero has annual sales of \u20ac8.4bn), will be better able to resist pricing pressure from supermarkets.

      "bodyText": "It may only be enough space for a coffee table, but a single square metre of home in Kensington &amp; Chelsea, London, will set you back more than \u00a311,000, according to the latest figures from Halifax. The mortgage lender\u2019s latest analysis of prices around Britain found the cost of property in Britain\u2019s most expensive district is more than 12 times as much by area as in the cheapest. The price of a square metre in the London borough has risen to \u00a311,635, almost \u00a3800 more than in 2014, and compares with Aberdare in Wales, where the same small piece of home would cost just \u00a3910. London boroughs dominate Halifax\u2019s list of the most expensive places to buy homes, which is based on the bank\u2019s house price index. As homes are typically smaller in the capital than elsewhere, dividing average prices by average size shows that the price gap in terms of cost per square metre is even larger than it usually appears. According to Halifax, the average home included in its index in Greater London measures 90 sq metres, while in Wales the typical property is 117 sq metres. After Kensington &amp; Chelsea, which also includes areas such as Notting Hill and is a favourite spot with wealthy buyers from overseas, comes Westminster, which includes Mayfair, Belgravia and Knightsbridge, where the average prices a square metre is \u00a39,571, then Camden, where the average is \u00a38,829. All of the top 10 are within the M25 and boast property prices in excess of \u00a35,900 a square metre. Outside southern England, Halifax said the priciest place to buy is Altrincham in Greater Manchester, with an average price of \u00a32,446 per square metre, followed by Solihull, where the average is \u00a32,367. But both are lower than the cheapest London borough, Barking &amp; Dagenham, where the average square metre of housing costs \u00a32,725. At the other end of the scale, the list of least expensive areas was dominated by Wales and Scotland. The bank also looked at how prices have changed over the last two decades and found a growing divide between London and the rest of Great Britain. The average price per square metre across the country has increased by 227% since 1995, from \u00a3621 to \u00a32,033. However, there were marked regional differences. While in Scotland the average price per metre had risen by 152% over 20 years from \u00a3592 to \u00a31,490, in Greater London it had leapt by 388% from \u00a3907 to \u00a34,426. Over the past five years, the biggest price increase has been in Hackney, east London, where the average cost of a square metre of home has risen by 71% to \u00a36,196. Craig McKinlay of Halifax said: \u201cHouse price per square metre is a useful measure for house-price comparison because it helps to adjust for differences in the size and type of properties between locations.\u201d He added: \u201cThere has been a clear widening in the gap between southern England, particularly London, and the rest of the country over the past 20 years \u2013 a trend that has continued during the last five years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Just one more point.... Back in Athens the spectre of dissent possibly disrupting any agreement has already begun. On leading Syriza party MP predicting that the Greek government\u2019s proposals will never get through parliament, reports Helena Smith Leading Syriza party cadre Alexis Mitropoulos, who is also vice president of the 300-seat House, has spoken out against the government\u2019s proposed reforms telling STAR TV this evening: \u201cMy personal view is that these measures cannot be voted, they are extreme and anti-social. I believe that in the end, this package which you have at hand, cannot come to the Greek parliament.\u201d We\u2019ll be watching for more political reaction in the morning.....(or later in the morning, if you\u2019re reading in most of Europe) Add that\u2019s probably all for tonight - I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning for full coverage of another day of Greek drama. Goodnight, and thanks for all those comments. GW Tsipras also told the press pack that Greece\u2019s proposals have been accepted as the basis of a possible deal by its creditors (as Francois Hollande also said tonight). And he\u2019s echoed his own words when he arrived in Brussels 13 hour ago to be playfully cuffed by Juncker: -- Greece is seeking a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and sustainable solution that will be accompanied by a growth package. Alexis Tsipras is explaining to reporters that his government is seeking a deal to address Greece\u2019s mid-term funding issues, (even though Juncker and Merkel both said tonight that debt relief isn\u2019t being discussed right now). He has also borrowed a pet phrase from fellow eurozone leaders -- the ball is in their court, not his :) The Greek delegation are listening to their leader too (there\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis in the middle of the photo) Aha: there\u2019s Alexis Tsipras, briefing the press right now. As the clock strikes midnight in Brussels, and 1am in Athens, thoughts are turning to bed. But we\u2019re not done yet.....we\u2019ve still to hear from Alexis Tsipras. Meanwhile in Athens.... EU officials are briefing that the two sides are really quite close now..... Unfortunately, Angela Merkel\u2019s post-summit briefing clashed with the Tusk-Juncker one. Fortunately, the press pack scattered across the summit, and report that the German chancellor said there wasn\u2019t any discussion of debt relief or a third bailout for Greece. Reuters has snapped the other key points: MERKEL SAYS ALL EU LEADERS STRONGLY BACKED COMMITMENTS TO REACH A DEAL ON GREECE* MERKEL SAYS ABSOLUTELY INTENSIVE WORK NEEDED ON GREEK NEGOTIATIONS* MERKEL SAYS WANTS GREECE TO STAY IN EURO ZONE* MERKEL SAYS TIME IS SHORT FOR DEAL WITH GREECE* MERKEL SAYS IT\u2019S CLEAR THAT FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IS PART OF GREECE NEGOTIATIONS* MERKEL SAYS HOPES EU LEADERS ON THURSDAY ONLY HAVE TO TAKE NOTE OF EUROGROUP AGREEMENT WITH GREECE MERKEL SAYS THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF EXTENSION SCENARIOS ON GREEK BAILOUT* MERKEL SAYS GREECE DOES NOT HAVE TO REPAY MUCH DEBT FOR MANY YEARS And then she departed, pointing out that there\u2019s a lot of work to do.... Across the summit, Francois Hollande has given Greece some support. The French President told reporters that \u201ceverything must be done for Greece to stay in the euro\u201d, and that their proposal was \u201creceived positively\u201d by its creditors. We have the basis (or possibly the bases?) for a deal, he adds. How can Juncker possibly be confident that a solution will be reached this week, given the eurogroup need to assess these measures and then the Greece parliament have to approve them? I\u2019m convinced that we will come to a final agreement in the course of this week, for the simple reason that we have to find one, says Juncker. As they say on football fields.... we cannot play prolongations. A penalty shoot-out might be easier (good luck against the Germans) What discussions did eurozone leaders have about capital controls? Capital controls were not mentioned tonight, Juncker replies. (reminder, we understand that eurozone finance ministers discussed the issue during their meeting earlier today) Are Greece\u2019s creditors worried that the latest proposals will have a recessionary impact? That is an issue we can look at now, Juncker replies. Onto questions.... was there any discussion on debt relief for Greece? This is not the time to discuss that issue, Juncker replies Juncker then says a few words -- the Eurogroup will meet again on Wednesday, he says, and he\u2019s confident that they will produce results for Thursday\u2019s summit. And thenhe states that \u201cWe will finalise the process this week\u201d. European Council president Donald Tusk speaks first, telling reporters that he called tonight\u2019s meeting to avoid a chaotic, uncontrollable \u2018Graccident\u2019. I called today\u2019s summit because I wanted to inject new dynamism in negotiations that have stalled for too long....Today\u2019s Greek proposals show we have taken that step. And I wanted all leaders to be on the same page. Alexis Tsipras has assured us that the Greek government is fully committed to reaching a deal. Today\u2019s proposals are a positive step....they will be assessed in the coming hours. Donald Tuck and Jean-Claude Juncker are arriving in the press room NOW Christine Lagarde has apparently left the summit too, telling reporters that \u201cwe have a huge amount of work to do on Greece\u201d in the next 48 hours. Ah....Angela Merkel is also due to give a press conference, which should be streamed online here. Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are about to hold a press conference on today\u2019s summit, which is being streamed on EbS. I\u2019ll cover the key points, while also trying to watch for other briefings as leaders depart Brussels (what can possibly go wrong?) Italy\u2019s Matteo Renzi has made a quick exit from the summit,.... Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 , president of Lithuania, has left the summit - and warned that the next 48 hours are \u201cabsolutely crucial\u201d. Today we were mainly persuading the Greek government to use our experiences and perform what is necessary, she says. So you\u2019re not impressed by the Greek proposals? Not yet. That\u2019s not as provocative as her quotes arriving at the summit: Phew Like an smouldering fire, the eurozone summit appears to have sprung back into life again. At least, there\u2019s no sign of anyone leaving the event (which must be irksome for those haven\u2019t enjoyed a spot of roast beef and parfait tonight) The early reaction to the Greek government\u2019s latest set of proposals from the eurocrisis crowd isn\u2019t terribly positive: Let\u2019s not pretend that Tsipras and his colleagues want to make these sort of cuts and tax hikes, though; they just appear to be losing the battle over these issues. I\u2019m hoping that eurozone leaders will speak to the media, now that the emergency summit has finished. If so, it should be streamed live on EbS (but no promises). Surely Alexis Tsipras will say something interesting? Greece\u2019s finance minister hasn\u2019t lost his knack at social media, after being challenged on Twitter tonight by Guy Verhofstadt, the senior Liberal MEP and former Belgian PM. As flagged up earlier, Greece is also now proposing to charge a higher VAT rate on many products; it\u2019s not going to be popular..... The Greek government has released one of its famous non-papers outlining in detail the proposed reforms it has made to creditors today, reports Helena. Right off the bat (as point no 1) the leftist-led administration says: \u201cThe government\u2019s proposal is NOT part of its programme. It is the result of hard and persistent negotiations in order to get to an agreement that wouldn\u2019t harm workers\u2019 rights, further dissolve the social fabric and which would allow growth. [It is] A proposal that does not doom the country to harsh austerity and which encompasses a viable solution for the Greek economy, without burdening those on lower and mid-sized incomes.\u201d Prolonging the uncertainty by extending the country\u2019s current bailout accord was not on the cards, the statement said. Whatever happened, creditors had to address the issue of Greece\u2019s debt and Athens\u2019 need for financing, in the mid-term, to \u201cend the vicious circle of uncertainty so that the country is not forced to constantly take new loans in order to pay previous loans.\u201d Word from Brussels: the Greek summit appears to be wrapping up..... The eurozone emergency summit is continuing tonight, so check out Ian Traynor\u2019s report on a crazy old day in the ongoing Greek crisis: Greece\u2019s day of destiny turns to farce with phantom eurozone summit Greece\u2019s date with destiny started with its upstart prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, being slapped on the face. It is the customary gesture of endearment from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission. It means the two men are friends, despite Juncker saying at the weekend he no longer trusted Tsipras. And the day that was supposed to arrest Greece\u2019s collapse into bankruptcy, and prevent the euro\u2019s diminution, ended more than 12 hours later on Monday evening with the bizarre spectacle of a phantom summit. Monday\u2019s hotly awaited emergency gathering of eurozone leaders, called last Thursday evening to fix the Greek crisis or at least to attach sticking plasters to Greece\u2019s bleeding wounds, had nothing to decide and no real agenda to discuss. For that to happen, the finance ministers of the single currency bloc who gathered earlier in the afternoon had to assess the chances of a deal and make their recommendations to the leaders. They could not do that, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chaired the session, because they did not have enough time to study what Athens was proposing. Their minions would have to negotiate hard and come back later in the week. So why did the Eurogroup finance ministers come to Brussels? They had to, Dijsselbloem said, because they were obliged to prepare the emergency summit. They did not manage that. So what was the point of the summit? \u201cThe leaders are always free to have a different opinion,\u201d the Dutchman smiled. The leaders flew in from Paris and Berlin, Madrid and Vienna, Dublin and Bratislava in any case, perhaps to teach Tsipras a lesson. \u201cThere is no question of cancelling the summit,\u201d said an EU official. \u201cThe idea is to remove from Tsipras the illusion he can get a better deal at the summit, or that a decision can be taken at the summit level. The point is to have Tsipras learn the position of the other leaders. No negotiation, no technical discussion. Make sure everybody understands where the others are.\u201d.... Here\u2019s the full piece: Angelique has also written about how the Greek population has become immune to eurozone panic fever, after years of austerity and depression: As the \u201clast-chance\u201d talks rolled on towards another \u201clast-ditch\u201d summit possibly at the end of this week, weary Greeks have deadline fatigue. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve become hardened and accustomed to all this, including the never-ending talks,\u201d said Christos Griogoriades, a physics and IT teacher in Greece\u2019s northern second city of Thessaloniki. Panic about so-called \u201cknife-edge\u201d, \u201clife-or-death\u201d negotiations has become so commonplace that it is almost meaningless to a population whose major concerns are still making ends meet and scrimping for enough to eat..... A Greek government official has told Reuters tonight that Mario Draghi assured Alexis Tsipras that he\u2019ll keep supporting the banking sector, as long as Greece is in a bailout programme. The current bailout expires on June 30, of course, when Greece also owes \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF. Over in Athens Helena Smith says tonight\u2019s rally outside the Greek parliament is further proof of the growing divide now emerging between pro-European and anti-European camps in Greece. Demonstrators spoke of a \u201ccivil war\u201d atmosphere between the two camps. \u201cBefore, the divide was between the pro-memorandum and anti-memorandum camps,\u201d said Lefteris Pappas, a business consultant standing in Syntagma square. \u201cNow it is between those who believe our future is in Europe and those who want to split from the EU and its a divide that is becoming ever more extreme. There is a lot of abuse in the social media, on Twitter and Facebook, [between the two]. They\u2019ve even harked back to the second world war and called us German collaborators because we believe in reform, we agree with a lot of what the creditors are telling us to do.\u201d Yannis Sviroyeras, a retired entrepreneur, said he believed the growing chasm was being deliberately cultivated by the government. \u201cThey are Bolsheviks, they\u2019re Stalinists, they\u2019ve Trotskyists, they\u2019ve got mad ideas about us aligning with Russia. What I worry about is violence. Imagine if the two of us [both camps] want to demonstrate in Syntagma Square - and that day may come soon. It would be difficult not to come to blows.\u201d The letter which Alexis Tsipras sent to Jean-Claude Juncker to explain Greece\u2019s new proposals has also leaked, and shows Athens is adamant that it is meeting its creditors demands: Sky\u2019s Ed Conway has also got hold of the latest Greek proposals: In the Greek city of Thessaloniki, over two hundred \u201cWe are Staying in Europe\u201d demonstrators gathered at the city\u2019s White Tower tonight amid a festive atmosphere as pop music blared from loud speakers and some women wrapped themselves in Europe flags. Apostolis Malamakis, an engineering researcher, told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s not about pressure, I\u2019m just here to express my pro-European feelings.\u201d He said he\u2019d been disappointed in an array of political parties in Greece over the past five years. He felt a deal would be reached in Brussels and that things in Greece would become more difficult in the immediate future. Stavros Stavrides, 41, an orthopedic surgeon at a private clinic, said: \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve taken part in a rally since we won the basketball in 1987. This is about giving the government an argument for staying in the euro.\u201d Makis Karagiannis, a maths teacher, said he was there \u201cnot for purely economic reasons\u201d but to \u201cshow what Europe symbolises to us,\u201d adding: \u201cI regard myself as a person of the enlightenment tradition of Europe and that is very important to me.\u201d No white smoke from Brussels yet..... Just in: photos showing Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande having an intense chat in the corridors of Brussels, after a bilateral meeting this afternoon: The Irish government, which has maintained a hard line on Syriza by insisting Greece must stick to the conditions of its bailout programme, seems to have been persuaded that a deal is viable. Enda Kenny, the Taoiseach, told RTE and Channel 4 News: \u201cWhat\u2019s on the table now is a basis for discussion. There is movement in respect of pensions, there is movement in respect of VAT, there is movement on primary surplus. \u201cThe important thing is that there be a conclusion to this set of negotiations this week.\u201d The Irish had feared that a Syrizia victory would provide an advantage to domestic anti-austerity opponents, mainly Sinn Fein, ahead of next year\u2019s general election. The FT reckons that another \u20ac1.6bn-worth of deposits left the Greek banking system today. For the second time in a few days, protesters have poured into Athens\u2019 Syntagma Square to exhort the Tsipras government not to endanger Greece\u2019s place in the eurozone, and by extension the EU, writes Helena Smith Unfurling a giant blue and white flag over the retaining wall of the Greek parliament, they chanted \u201cEurope, Europe, we are staying in Europe.\u201d \u201cTsipras has to know that he got into power with 36% of the vote, he is not there with the support of all Greeks and he has absolutely no right whatsoever to take us out of Europe,\u201d said Marietta Kontou, a shop owner, insisting it was outrageous the leftist-led government had opened Greece\u2019s membership of the euro to question at all. \u201cEurope is where this country belongs. It is very important that we belong to the West.\u201d Standing next to her waving the star-bedecked European flag her friend Angeliki, who studied economics in Britain, said she had \u201clost sleep\u201d at the thought that Athens might not reach a cash-for-reform deal with creditors and be forced out out of the currency bloc. \u201cTo think that we could end up like Bulgaria or Rumania, an impoverished country in south east Europe, is almost too much to bear. Being an EU member is not only about money, it\u2019s about human rights, a view of the world that is far too precious to lose.\u201d Several older Greeks who had come in from the suburbs to attend the rally, said membership of the euro had to be preserved at any price. \u201cIt is not negotiable, absolutely not negotiable,\u201d said Lefteris Rigas, a retired businessman. \u201cThose who advocate the return of the drachma are ignorant, ignorant of the chaos that would surely follow. A return of the drachma would hurt the most vulnerable in our society most.\u201d Highlighting the growing divide between those who support the country\u2019s continued membership of the euro and those who do not, riot police were rushed to the parliament building after anti-establishment, anti-EU protestors attempted to clash with those who had gathered in Syntagma for the rally. The pro-EU demonstrators have now filled the area in front of the Greek parliament tonight: No austerity rations for the eurozone leaders tonight, it appears: Alexis Tsipras is chaperoned by the leaders of France and Spain tonight. Francois Hollande was one of the most optimistic leaders heading into tonight\u2019s summit, so counts as a Greek ally. Mariano Rajoy, though, will be reluctant to allow Greece an easy ride ahead of his own general elections this autumn, with Podemos on the rise. Greece\u2019s creditors are lined up in formation, with Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel alongside them: Other eurozone leaders are corralled on the wings. Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence says the latest Greek proposals are designed to tackle political hurdles, rather than steer the economy back to growth. Oh Mr Tusk, with our second emergency eurozone meeting of the day you really are spoiling us. Details of Greece\u2019s new proposals are starting to emerge in Brussels: Joost de Vries of Dutch newspaper Volkskrant has tweeted a page showing where the cuts and tax rises fall. And there\u2019s a hefty increase in revenues from VAT over the next 18 months. Greece has also accepted that pension must be reformed, and is planning a hike in pension contributions and an increase in health contributions from retirees. However, it appears that actual pension rates won\u2019t be cut, allowing Athens to argue it has kept to its red line. There\u2019s also a one-off tax on company profits, for firms earning at least half a million euros. The figures match what the FTs Peter Spiegel has been told tonight: Our Athens correspondent, Helene Smith, reports: Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve missed seeing riot police on the streets of Athens: Jean-Claude Juncker was disappointingly tight-lipped as he arrived at tonight\u2019s emergency summit. The Commission president only said a few words as he marched in, including a brisk \u201cBon Soir\u201d. But will it be a good evening?.... Juha Sipil\u00e4, Finland\u2019s new prime minister, doesn\u2019t share Hollande\u2019s optimism. Asked what he expects tonight, he replies \u201cnot much, not much\u201d, before heading towards the Summit. Sipil\u00e4 then gives a longer interview in Finnish, so we might get more details later.... The French president\u2019s limo just rolled up in Brussels, and a quite optimistic-sounding Francois Hollande got out. He told reporters that the new proposals tabled by Greece overnight are an improvement on previous ideas, although some things must still be resolved. Tonight\u2019s talks could open the way to a deal soon, he adds. Angela Merkel has arrived at the EU summit, telling reporters that there is no basis for a decision on Greece tonight. Tonight\u2019s meeting can only be a consultation exercise, the German chancellor says. Back in Athens, riot police are on the streets to prevent clashes between rival anti-austerity and pro-EU demonstrations. Newsnight\u2019s Jess Brammar is on the scene, and tweeting the latest: Bit of confusion of Donald Tusk\u2019s comments, so I\u2019ve watched the tape again, and he\u2019s definitely warning about the dangers of \u2018Graccident\u2019 -- ie, Greece stumbling into a default, or worse.... Donald Tusk has now arrived at the EU summit following his talks with the Greek delegation, and issued a clear warning that he wants serious progress tonight. The European Council president said that the blame game must end: This evening I want all cards on the table. That doesn\u2019t mean I want to negotiate technical details, but it means I want to end this political gambling. Tusk called tonight\u2019s meeting four days ago, after talks between Greece and its creditors hit the wall. He\u2019s more confident tonight, saying: I can say that since I called this informal meeting, some promising things have happened, including today\u2019s talks and meeting. The latest Greek proposals are the first real proposals in many weeks, Tusk continues, although they obviously still need the assessment of the instutions and further work. But the most important thing is that the leaders take full responsibility for the political process to avoid the worst case scenario, which means uncontrollable, chaotic Graccident. But how much time does Greece have left? Tusk nearly breaks into a smile, but replies: We will see tonight.... The Greek delegation has just held talks right now with European Council president Donald Tusk, who called tonight\u2019s emergency summit:. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (top right) does not look particularly happy.... European investors have given a resounding vote of confidence that the Greek debt crisis is going to be resolved, if only temporarily, this week. The German, French and Spanish stock markets have both closed around 3.8% higher \u2013 a really hefty rally. That\u2019s the biggest one-day percentage rise on the Dax since early August 2012, my colleague Nick Fletcher reports. Those predictions that a deal is just days away are being taken seriously, so if relations fall apart tonight there could be wild swings tomorrow..... Yup: There could be tensions in Athens tonight, with rival demonstrations due to take place in the coming hours. Pro-government demonstrators have begun marching in the Greek capital: And we\u2019re also expecting another march, in favour of reaching a compromise with creditors and preserving Greece\u2019s EU membership, later. Our Jennifer Rankin is poised outside tonight\u2019s emergency summit meeting, to hear what leaders say as they arrive: The head of one of Germany\u2019s major economic think tanks has argued that EU leaders should push Greece to implement capital controls tonight. Professor Clemens Fuest, head of the ZEW, isn\u2019t convinced that a deal is close, arguing: \u201cGreece are withdrawing their money from banks, and European Central Bank (ECB) aids are maintaining the bank\u2019s liquidity. As a result, liability risks for tax payers in the euro area are increasing every day, while the bargaining power of the Greek government is growing. \u201cAlexis Tsipras has no plan for economic recovery in Greece. His only plan is to employ more government officials, to nationalize companies, and to make the citizens of other countries fund his policy. His government is failing to collect taxes at home, for example the taxes from illicit accounts in Switzerland.\u201d You can watch EU leaders arriving at tonight\u2019s Emergency Summit here. Reminder: Tonight\u2019s emergency summit is due to start at 7pm Brussels time, or 6pm BST. There will be other meetings first, though, with Alexis Tsipras due to meet Mario Draghi shortly.... Alexis Tsipras has just arrived for tonight\u2019s summit meeting, with a smile for the cameras but no quotes for the assembled reporters. The BBC are tweeting more details of their interview with Greek economy minister George Stathakis, who believes a breakthrough has been achieved. European leaders are starting to arrive for tonight\u2019s emergency summit, starting with Latvia\u2019s Laimdota Straujuma, and Mark Rutte of the Netherlands: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s my colleague Jennifer Rankin\u2019s latest dispatch from Brussels on today\u2019s developments: And here\u2019s a flavour: Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors have called for more time to study the latest plan from Athens aimed at unlocking Greece\u2019s remaining bailout funds and staving off imminent bankruptcy. A meeting of eurozone finance ministers broke up after little more than an hour of discussions, raising questions about the purpose of an emergency summit of EU leaders starting in a few hours. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who chairs the group of 19 eurozone countries, said that the European Union institutions needed time to look at the Greek proposals with the aim of reaching an agreement later this week. But the Greek plan was \u201ca basis to really restart the talks again and really get a result\u201d, he said, although officials needed to assess whether \u201cthe economic reforms [proposed] are enough for the economy to take off again\u201d. Greece submitted concessions overnight responding to creditors\u2019 key demands including raising VAT and making changes to the country\u2019s pension system that would eventually raise the retirement age to 67..... (click here for more) Here\u2019s another shot of Greece\u2019s creditors planning their strategy ahead of tonight\u2019s emergency summit: The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has also heard that eurozone finance ministers discussed whether capital controls should be imposed in Greece (as flagged earlier) He writes: \u201cThere was a discussion about capital controls, but without conclusion,\u201d said one of the officials. Over in Brussels now, the heads of the IMF, ECB, Europan Commission and European Council are sitting down to plan for tonight\u2019s emergency summit on Greece. The Eurogroup has now issued a brief statement, confirming what we learned earlier: The Eurogroup broadly welcomed a new version of the reform plan submitted by the Greek authorities this morning, before the Eurogroup meeting, and considered it to be a positive step in the process. The Eurogroup asked the institutions (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) to start analysing the new proposal and together with the Greek authorities work out a list of prior actions with a view to reaching a final agreement on the reform plan later this week. The Eurogroup might hold another meeting this week. The Athens stock market just closed for the night having surged by 9% today, as optimism ripples through the trading floor. Traders are clinging onto hopes that a deal will be reached -- driving bank shares up by 20% today. Quite a vote of confidence that this crisis will end well.... The German and French markets are both up around 3.5% in late trading, as optimistic noises from Athens and Brussels spark a rally. And in the City, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip sharesis up now up 99 points or 1.5%. Hello...... Belgium\u2019s finance minister has revealed that some of his counterparts think capital controls should be imposed in Greece now..... Optimism is picking up again... European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has just declared that he\u2019s aiming for a deal with Greece by the end of the week. Greece\u2019s economy minister, Giorgos Stathakis, has told the BBC that he believes Athens\u2019 new proposals have broken the deadlock. And he also reckons that European leaders will reflect that in their communique tonight. Robert Peston, the Beeb\u2019s economics editor, has the story: He said he expects eurozone government heads to issue a communique later today that will say there is now a basis for a formal agreement with Athens to complete the current bailout programme and release \u20ac7.2bn of vital funds. Mr Stathakis conceded that technical work would need to be done in the coming days to formalise the agreement. But he was hopeful that Greece would be able to make its \u20ac1.5bn payment to the IMF on its due date of June 30 - and therefore avoid a devastating default. He detailed Greece\u2019s new money-raising proposals. These include: A new tax on businesses A new tax on the wealthy Some increases in the VAT rate on selected items. Here\u2019s the full story: Stathakis: Greece rescued A Greek official has told Reuters that Alexis Tsipras will hold a meeting with Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s president, at 5pm BST (6pm Brussels time). Anyone know why Christine Lagarde didn\u2019t show at the press conference? That is one of the shortest eurozone crisis press conferences I can remember. But not the most gloomy. The key message is that the new proposals from Greece are \u201cbroad and comprehensive,\u201d and a good basis to restart the negotiations that froze over a week ago. But they just arrived too late for a breakthrough today. A deal isn\u2019t coming tonight, but the door remains open on an agreement by Thursday, when EU leaders hold another summit. However....that door could start to creak shut if Greece\u2019s proposals aren\u2019t up to scratch, or if negotiations stall again. In the short-term, though, the eurogroup\u2019s optimism means it will be hard for the European Central Bank to pull the plug on the Greek banking sector. If finance ministers think there is a good chance of a deal, the unelected central bankers of Frankfurt can\u2019t overrule them. It\u2019s also encouraging that Jeroen Dijsselbloem resisted giving Greece a hoofing over the mix-up with its proposals. He could have taken the opportunity to rebuke Yanus Varoufakis, having been criticised by the Greek finance minister in the past. Instead, Dijsselbloem was quite conciliatory, saying it was \u201cno big problem\u201d to get two versions. The big loser today could be fans of the BBC\u2019s Question Time programme, who had been promised that Varoufakis would be on the panel this week. He\u2019s probably double-booked now..... Yanis Varoufakis has apparently left the eurogroup without speaking to the media: And with that, it\u2019s over. Last question: Are these Greek proposals actually credible? Moscovici sounds optimistic: This is a solid basis, but work still needs to be done. We are currently looking for an agreement but we haven\u2019t reached one yet. Dijsselbloem echoes him, calling the Greek proposals \u201ca welcome step, in a positive direction.\u201d It is also an opportunity to get that deal this week, and that is what we will work for. What\u2019s the point of having an EU summit tonight, my colleague Ian Traynor asks, if the eurogroup hasn\u2019t reached an agreement with Greece today. Leaders are always free to have a different view, Dijsselbloem replies. We tell them our view of the situation, ready for tonight\u2019s meeting. \u201cPrior actions\u201d are the key to getting a deal, Dijsselbloem says. In other words, we want to see what Greece must agree to, and implement, before aid can be unlocked. How did ministers react to the Greek proposals, and is it true that several versions were submitted? Yes, there were two versions, one late last night and one this morning. But they were quite similar, so that\u2019s not a big deal, Dijsselbloem says. We\u2019d have liked them earlier, though. Onto questions: What is the initial assessment of the Greek proposals? The general opinion is that they are \u201cbroadly comprehensive\u201d, but we need to check they are comprehensive enough, says Dijsselbloem. Basically they are a basis to restart talks. Christine Lagarde and Klaus Regling are both not here, despite being scheduled to speak.... Moscovici speaks briefly, saying that the new Greek proposals are a good basis to work from. Technical talks will continue, starting this afternoon. If possible, we will use these new Greek proposals as the basis for a deal. If all goes well, we could reach a final agreement later this week, Dijsselbloem adds. This will be a very short press conference, declared Dijsselbloem. Greece has submitted new proposals.... which we welcome. But given the very short time the institutions had had, they could only give us an initial assessment. Get the popcorn ready, because the press briefing is starting any minute. We\u2019ll hear from eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, IMF chief Christine Lagarde, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, and also Klaus Regling, who runs Europe\u2019s bailout vehicle, the European Stability Mechanism. Reminder, you can watch it live here. EU insiders are briefing that tonight\u2019s EU leaders summit will go ahead. Vladis Dombrovskis, the European Commissioner responsible for the euro, has declared that the Eurogroup will meet again this week. Greece\u2019s proposals are a welcome step but more work together with the institutions is needed. Eurogroup will reconvene this week. We need a deal in the coming days. Greek journalist Eleni Varvitsiotis has confirmed that \u20ac-ministers haven\u2019t reached agreement on Greece -- indeed, the latest proposals are only a \u201cpossible\u201d move forwards..... Ian Traynor reports that Greece\u2019s lenders are divided..... Finland\u2019s finance minister tweets that work will continue over Greece\u2019s proposals - a diplomatic way of saying no deal today. The eurogroup meeting has ended, after barely an hour. That strongly suggests that very little progress has been made on the latest Greek proposals; so EU leaders won\u2019t be in a position to sign off a deal at tonight\u2019s summit. A press briefing should start shortly, so we\u2019ll find out exactly what happened soon enough. It will be streamed live here. (right-click to open in a new tab) Photos from the start of today\u2019s eurogroup meeting are arriving, and they suggest that the mood is grim. Christine Lagarde looked as gloomy as the weather when she greeted Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos: Penny for your thoughts, Wolfgang.... Italy\u2019s Pier Carlo Padoa and France\u2019s Michel Sapin looked contemplative too. We haven\u2019t received any photos of Yanis Varoufakis inside the building yet - perhaps because he was apparently late for the meeting - but here\u2019s a shot of him arriving: And here\u2019s Greek PM Alexis Tsipras and Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker heading off for their own talks this morning. Greece\u2019s finance minister was late for the kick-off of today\u2019s meeting, reports my colleague Ian Traynor, who is also hearing that tonight\u2019s summit won\u2019t yield a deal (no surprise there!) Assuming the summit actually happens... The domestic political pressure on Alexis Tsipras is intensifying.... Time for a recap. The prospect of a major breakthrough in the Greek bailout saga have been knocked back this morning, after it emerged that Athens initially sent the wrong proposals to its creditors last night. In the last hour, a series of finance ministers have warned that they will be unable to make a \u2018final assessment\u2019 of Greece\u2019s latest proposals, which do appear to close the gap with its creditors. Finance chiefs from Austria, Ireland, Germany, Finland and Slovakia all told reporters in Brussels that they don\u2019t expect big progress today. This means another meeting could be held later this week, leaving Greece\u2019s future handing precariously in the balance. Ireland\u2019s Michael Noonan says confusion has been rife over the last 12 hours: There was such confusion in the night, with alternative versions coming in. There hasn\u2019t been any preparation for the meeting. My expectation is that we will be meeting again onThursday before the full Council meeting. We are still not quite clear what the actual proposals are.... Wolfgang Schauble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, warned that it may not be possible to prepare for tonight\u2019s emergency summit of European leaders: We haven\u2019t received any substantial proposals until now. I can\u2019t see how we can be able to prepare the eurosummit without proposals. It\u2019s not possible to prepare a statement for the euro summit, the status hasn\u2019t changed since Thursday. Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras looked upbeat this morning, even joking around with Jean-Claude Juncker and earning a slap on the chops when they spoke to the press before their talks. Tsipras declared: \u201cThis is time for a substantial, viable solution that allows Greece to come back to growth within the eurozone with social justice.\u201d EU insiders say that Greece\u2019s latest proposals do include compromises on pension reform and VAT rates. But officials have revealed that Greece initially sent the wrong document to its creditors late last night, scuppering the prospects of a deal today. Back in Greece, the head of the junior coalition party has warned that he won\u2019t accept VAT hikes on the country\u2019s islands. And the European Central Bank has stepped in again to keep the system running, by granting Greek banks an estimated \u20ac2bn fresh liquidity. That suggests the outflow of deposits has increased. But despite the deadlock, there have not been any signs of panic at Greek banks today. And financial market are still buoyant, on hopes that a deal will be reached (even if not today): Dr Sotirios Zartaloudis, lecturer in politics at the University of Birmingham, believes that the threat of Grexit means both sides will strive for a deal. Despite the considerable differences remaining between the parties, everyone involved has a high incentive to reach a compromise. Greece would be economically, politically and socially devastated if it left the Euro, while a Grexit may cause considerable knock-on effects to other Eurozone members and the EU as a whole.\u2019 Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, has scooped the award for the most unamused attendee at today\u2019s meeting. Schelling told reporters that he doesn\u2019t expect a final deal today, and even hinted that Greece should start picking up the tab for these meetings.... Thanks to Eurasia Group\u2019s Famke Krumbm\u00fcller for the translation: Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s finance minister, didn\u2019t speak to the press as he arrived at the eurogroup meeting. He swiftly headed inside, for what could be a rather uncomfortable meeting.... Commissioner Pierre Moscovici remains more optimistic than the rest of the bunch. He tells the increasingly soggy press pack that the Greek proposals do represent \u201cprogress\u201d, but more work needs to be done. Spanish finance minister Luis de Guindos says there is still time for a breakthrough with Greece, as the rain splatters down in Brussels Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Kazimir, tells reporters wryly that \u201cwe might see each other soon\u201d, as he arrives at the eurogroup meeting. Last week, Kazimir told us that he \u201cbelieves in miracles\u201d, regarding a Greek deal. Hopefully he still does.... Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup, has just arrived at the meeting, and confirmed that pessimism is rife. Is this the basis for a big breakthrough? I leave that up to the institutions [Greece\u2019s creditors] to give their views first, Dijsselbloem replies, but the Greek proposals have only arrived very late... Thus: It is impossible to have a final assessment....we\u2019ll see if we have the basis for final talks. And then he broke away, without saying if he expects yet another another eurogroup meeting this week (as Michael Noonan suggested). This is not looking good. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has told reporters that the eurogroup don\u2019t have new proposals to work on. He was speaking in German, with lots of shrugs and \u2018neins\u2019 to drive the point home: * 22-Jun-2015 11:52:50 - GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL SUGGESTIONS FROM GREECE, NO CHANGE SINCE THURSDAY* 22-Jun-2015 11:53:24 - GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL PROPOSALS WE CANNOT SERIOUSLY PREPARE A SUMMIT ON GREECE* 22-Jun-2015 11:54:21 - GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS THE IMF HAS LIKEWISE NOT RECEIVED ANY GREEK PROPOSALS Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, does not look a happy man at all, as he arrives at the eurogroup. Noonan says he has \u201cvery low expectations\u201d for a deal. And that\u2019s because the eurogroup hasn\u2019t been able to make any useful preparation ahead of tonight\u2019s emergency EU summit, because of the \u201cconfusion\u201d caused by Greece submitting various different proposals through the night. Noonan predicts that the eurogroup could be back again on Thursday (!), to lay the ground ahead of the scheduled EU leaders meeting. What does the confusion over Greece\u2019s proposals say about the situation? It says a lot about the state of play in Athens, not the rest of Europe, Noonan responds, before vanishing out of the rain. Alexander Stubb, Finland\u2019s finance minister, has braved the weather....to pour a big bucket of cold water over those expecting a big breakthrough today. Stubb told reporters that : I\u2019ve got very low expectations for today. And then added: It seems to be a Monday where we have wasted a lost of air miles, as finance ministers and heads of state.... I don\u2019t foresee a breakthrough today. Several eurozone ministers have chosen to scamper into the building to avoid the rain, rather than speaking to the press. IMF chief Christine Lagarde gave reporters a no-nonsense wave as she arrived for her meeting with Alexis Tsipras in Brussels. (unless she\u2019s rehearsing a Juncker-style slap of her own....) The EC\u2019s top spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, tells the midday press conference we have \u201ca very important day ahead of us\u201d, with several key meetings on Greece. The commission\u2019s position.... is that the document received by the Greek PM represents a good basis for progress in the eurozone summit. But which proposal is being discussed? We have a document signed by the Greek PM, that\u2019s what the Institutions are discussing, fires back Schinas. Greek government bonds are continuing to rally this morning, despite some concerns that we might not get a major agreement tonight: Belgium\u2019s finance minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, dampened expectations of a big breakthrough today. He told reporters outside the Eurogroup that ministers need to see what Greece is proposing.... (maybe Van Overtveldt is foxed by the news they sent the wrong document last night) French president Francois Hollande has also cautioned that the big deal might not come tonight, flags up AFP\u2019s Alex Pigman: EU insiders say that the new Greek proposal is a \u201cgood basis for discussion\u201d, reports our Europe editor Ian Traynor. Ian confirms that Greece has made some concessions (as flagged a few minutes ago) It\u2019s about to get quite busy. Eurozone finance ministers will arrive for today\u2019s emergency Eurogroup meeting shortly, and should speak to the press on their way in (here\u2019s a live feed from outside the building). And that clashes nicely with the regular EU midday briefing, (it should be streamed here now). Angela Merkel has just predicted that it might take a few more days to reach a Greek agreement. Speaking to reporters in the German city of Magdeburg, chancellor Merkel warned that EU leaders can\u2019t take any decisions at tonight\u2019s emergency summit unless they have a recommendation from Greece\u2019s lenders. There are still a lot of days in the week in which decisions can be taken. So the crisis might rumble on..... Reuters has got hold of the latest Greek reform proposals, which includes some pension changes. GREECE IS OFFERING TO GRADUALLY RAISE RETIREMENT AGE TO 67, STREAMLINE VARIOUS EXEMPTIONS - OFFICIAL* The key here is how \u201cgradually\u201d this would happen; fast enough to deliver the savings which the institutions want? And it appears Greece is agreeing that more items should be taxed at the top VAT rate, with fewer exemptions. It still wants to keep its 6% basic rate (which institutions wish to abolish) GREECE IS OFFERING TO HAVE A 23 PCT MAIN VAT RATE, 13 PCT RATE FOR ENERGY AND BASIC FOODS, 6 PCT ONLY FOR MEDICINE AND BOOKS-OFFICIAL* The upshot is that a final deal is unlikely today: CREDITORS\u2019 INSTITUTIONS UNLIKELY TO FORMULATE COMMON POSITION ON IT ON MONDAY, A FEW MORE DAYS NEEDED FOR CLARIFICATIONS-EURO ZONE OFFICIAL* FINAL DEAL WITH GREECE UNLIKELY ON MONDAY, BUT COULD BE A STEP TOWARDS A DEAL IN COMING DAYS - OFFICIALS The Guardian is holding a panel discussion on Greece, Grexit and the troika on Thursday. Come along to have your say. See below for more details. Over in the Greek city of Thessaloniki, there\u2019s no sign of a bank run among the crisis-weary population. My colleague Angelique Chrisafis reports In Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second biggest city, cash-points were quiet around Aristotelous Square. There were no queues and the few people stopping to use ATMs were often just checking their balance or paying bills. Many felt weary at what they said felt like the umpteenth so-called \u201cknife-edge\u201d moment in years of economic crisis. \u201cI did ask my mum whether I should be worried and needed to withdraw cash but she said \u2018Of course not\u2019,\u201d said Elena, 19, a psychology student checking her current account balance. \u201cIt does feel like we\u2019ve been at this point of crisis talks so many times over the past few years.\u201d She added: \u201cMy biggest worry is my future. I\u2019m seriously considering going abroad to find a job and to be able to have children and get married. I want children in the future but I don\u2019t feel I could start a family without being sure of having the money to raise them. I\u2019d like to be a psychologist and here, with 60% youth unemployment, the only job I could find would be in a caf\u00e9 or bar, if that. My mother, a music teacher, has lost her job.\u201d Tassos, an accountancy graduate, who finished his military service five days ago, had checked his balance and wouldn\u2019t be withdrawing any cash for the day. He was living off support from his farmer parents in rural nothern Greece while he looked for a job. \u201cThe ideal would be to get an accountancy job in a company,\u201d he said, conceding that it wouldn\u2019t be easy. Sorry for the typos in that last post - please refresh to get a cleaned-up version. Alexis Tsipras has arrived at the EC for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, and a brief chat to reporters: Tsipras tells the press pack: This is time for a substantial and viable solution that will allow Greece to come back to growth within the eurozone, with social justice and cohesion. Juncker is more cautious, says that he doesn\u2019t know if there will be a deal today. There\u2019s then a classic moment.... after Tsipras speaks in Greek, Juncker jokes that although he\u2019s getting more fluent in Greek, he can\u2019t follow everything Don\u2019t worry, Tsipras smiles, I told them: Everything that I said...it\u2019s in your position. (ie, he was speaking on Juncker\u2019s behalf) Which earns him a mock-slap from the EC president. Alexis Tsipras is about to arrive at the European Commission for talks with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker. Will be get one of Juncker\u2019s famous kisses? Watch this live feed to find out.... Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras faces an uphill battle back home over the compromise plan being hammered out with lenders, with his coalition partner refusing to accept tax rises on Greek islands. From Athens, Helena Smith reports Panos Kammenos, the defence minister who also heads the coalition government\u2019s junior partner, the right-wng Independent Greeks party, Anel, is adamantly opposed to VAT rates being raised on islands in the Aegean. I\u2019m hearing that Kammenos says VAT on islands is his party\u2019s bottom line to stay in the government. Top Anel insiders suggest that the right-wing populist party could withdraw from the coalition in the event of VAT being raised on Aegean islands close to Turkey. Kammenos fears that if Greek islanders lose the privilege of low VAT they would \u201cget in their boats and go and shop opposite [in Turkey], local markets would dissolve and islands would close.\u201d The money, he said, could be found by increasing taxes by 1% on luxury good and raising levies on properties owned by off-shore companies. The hardline Syriza MP Alexis Mitropolos is also concerned about the possible agreement. He told state- run television channel, ERT, this morning, that: \u201cBut what nation would accept such measures, what nation would be able to bear such these policies?\u201d Konstantinos Michalos, who heads the Athens chamber of commerce and industry (ACCI) summed up the situation: \u201cThe government is facing a very difficult dilemma....between painful measures or rupture (from the EU).\u201d The French and German stock markets are on an absolute tear this morning - both up over 3%: Greek journalist Eleni Varvitsiotis reports that Athens has submitted a new proposals, slightly different to the old one.... Finland\u2019s finance minister isn\u2019t happy with the Brussels weather, for such a crucial day: And you can see why: OK, I\u2019ve picked my jaw up off the floor now. Greece apparently sent the wrong document to its creditors late last night. That\u2019s according to Anne-Sylvaine Chassany and Peter Spiegel of the Financial Times, who report: Three senior officials say there\u2019s been a mix-up with the documents sent to the bailout monitors. \u201cIt\u2019s not so dramatic, but they sent the wrong one by mistake,\u201d said one of the officials... The officials said the Greeks intended to submit a new version this morning, but it remained unclear whether they had done so. Two officials said they received a revised version during the early morning hours on Monday, but the third official said they had not yet received the new version. More here: Regular readers will know that Greece suffered a similar hitch back in February, when it apparently sent the wrong letter to Germany. Easily done, I\u2019m sure. Reuters just flashed up that the European Central Bank has agreed to provide more emergency liquidity for Greek banks: ECB RAISES EMERGENCY FUNDING CAP FOR GREEK BANKS - BANKING SOURCE ECB\u2019S GOVERNING COUNCIL WILL CONVENE AGAIN ANY TIME IT IS NEEDED - BANKING SOURCE Looks like their meeting was earlier than we expected. The wave of optimism sweeping Europe has reached Athens. Traders are rushing to buy shares, on hopes that a six-month bailout extension will be agreed today, to unlock \u20ac18bn of aid. The main Greek banks are up by over 10%, as they react to the news that Greece submitted new proposals late last night, which are seen as the \u201cbasis for progress\u201d. And that has pushed the main ATG index up 6% in early trading -- a big move, but it only claws back some of its recent losses. News of a fresh Greek proposal have had a \u201cmagical effect on the markets\u201d, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at SpreadEX. The main reason behind the positivity is hope that this latest Greek proposal contains the much needed concessions the country\u2019s creditors have been looking for; described as \u2018a good basis for progress\u2019, already these proposals have been received better than the usual \u2018insulting\u2019 attempts at reform. Traders are now watching whether today\u2019s series of meetings are a success. As our agenda explains, the ECB discusses Greek banks shortly, then Tsipras meets Lagarde, Draghi, Juncker and Djisselbloem, then finance ministers convene at the Eurogroup, and finally it\u2019s over to EU leaders for their summit.. Campbell adds: After a month of interminable claims and counterclaims from each side, there is a bit of excitement on the markets and the genuine semblance of optimism; now this sentiment just has to last the day. Insiders in Brussels are making optimistic noises this morning. And that\u2019s significant, as they have now had more than nine hours to digest the latest proposals from Greece: Journalists are poised in Greece ready for queues at the cash machines, but there\u2019s no sign of panic: Bruno Macaes, Portugal\u2019s Secretary of State for Europe, says it\u2019s vitally important to get a Greek deal soon. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: Time is running out and we need a fundamental solution to the problem It would be \u201cbad for the eurozone for a whole\u201d if Greece left the single currency, Macaes said. It would also probably spark a \u201cnew commitment to integration\u201d, to avoid other countries coming under fire. Portugal was bailed out back in 2011, and Macaes says he\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d of avoiding a repeat: Everything we have done in the last three years is to avoid being pulled back into this market turbulence. If a final deal isn\u2019t reached today, EU leaders have another opportunity later this week when they hold their next summit: Here\u2019s another sign of rising confidence that significant progress will be made at today\u2019s meetings. The interest rates (or yield) on Greek government has fallen sharply in early trading, showing traders see a lower risk of default. The yield on two-year Greek debt has tumbled to 24.9%, down from 28.5% on Friday. That\u2019s a really chunky move (but also means the bonds are seen as very risky). 10-year Greek bond yields are down by 1 percentage points, from 12.6% to 11.6%. Typically, a country is locked out of the markets when its 10-year bond yields hit 7%, so Greece has a long way to go yet.... Are the markets over-reacting? It certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time that shares have surged on hopes of a deal, only to fizzle out. Investors are calculating that a) Greece\u2019s latest proposals offer genuine prospects of a deal, and b) European leaders aren\u2019t prepared to let the eurozone fragment. European markets are a sea of green this morning: The key question is whether Greece has made sufficient concessions on pensions, says Frederik Ducrozet, economist at Credit Agricole. ELA is the emergency liquidity assistance provided by the European Central Bank to keep Greek banks functioning, now totalling \u20ac84bn. There is \u201cnew hope of progress in Greek bailout negotiations\u201d in the City today, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, after Athens has presented new proposal to creditors late last night. Germany\u2019s DAX has leapt by 2.5%, as Frankfurt traders embrace optimism over Greece.... European stock markets have surged that the start of trading, on hopes of a long-awaited deal on Greece today. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 72 points, or 1.1%, as investors welcome the news that Greece submitted new compromise proposals overnight. In Paris, the French CAC leapt by 2.2% and the Italian market is up 1.8%. More to follow... From Brussels, my colleague Jennifer Rankin sums up the situation: Greece has submitted 11th-hour concessions to its creditors ahead of a crucial day of talks aimed at preventing it from crashing out of the eurozone. Its proposal followed a hectic round of telephone diplomacy on Sunday between Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, the French president, Francois Hollande, and the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Juncker\u2019s head of cabinet, Martin Selmayr, said the Athens proposal offered \u201ca good basis for progress\u201d, though he described the negotiations as a \u201cforceps delivery\u201d, underscoring the exertions to prevent Greece leaving the eurozone. It was not immediately clear how far the Greek plan met its creditors\u2019 demands for spending cuts and welfare reforms. City traders are predicting that the German stock market will leap this morning, on hopes of a breakthrough today.... EU economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici has declared that a solution will be found to tackle the Greek crisis, after Athens submitted new proposals late last night. Speaking on Europe 1 radio, Moscovici said today is a \u201cdecisive, vital\u201d day for Greece, adding: We\u2019ll be having meetings with [Greek PM Alexis] Tsipras which, I hope and I am convinced, will allow us to reach an agreement this evening\u201d. \u201cWe are moving in the right direction, we have solid ground for a deal, we just have to consolidate that today ... I think that the political will of everyone to preserve the euro, this common good, to ensure that this single currency is irreversible, will win the day.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) He\u2019s just tweeted this message too: Optimism is building that we will, finally, see meaningful progress today. As Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister Jean Asselborn told Germany\u2019s Deutschlandfunk radio a few minutes ago: \u201cThere will be a lurch forward.\u201d Today will be packed with top level meetings. Here\u2019s the running order: 10.30am CEST (9.30am BST/11.30am EEST): The ECB board will discuss the situation in the Greek banking sector 11am CEST: Alexis Tsipras meets Christine Lagarde, Mario Draghi, Jean-Claude Juncker and Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem to discuss Athens\u2019 new proposals 12.30pm CEST: Eurozone finance ministers hold a Eurogroup meeting on Greece, which could yield agreement on its bailout. 7pm CEST: EU leaders hold their Greek crisis summit meeting Good morning. Hope you all had a relaxing weekend, because today should be as dramatic as anything we\u2019ve seen since the eurozone crisis began over five years ago. In the coming hours, the most powerful politicians and officials in Europe will hold a series of emergency meetings that will, most likely, determine the future of both Greece and the wider eurozone. This really could be the last possible chance to reach a deal to avert Greece defaulting, possible exiting the eurozone, and potentially giving the financial markets and the world economy a seismic jolt. The goal? Hammering out an agreement to finally unlock bailout funds for Greece, which have been locked away for months as its government has tussled with the eurozone. That deadlock was broken late last night, when the Greek government submitted new proposals to the heads of the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission. Eine Zangengeburt means forceps delivery, by the way..... Those proposals will be scrutinised this morning, when Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, meets IMF chief Christine Lagarde, ECB president Mario Draghi, EC president Jean-Claude Juncker, and Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem (chair of the eurozone finance ministers). That will be followed by a eurogroup meeting (where details of a deal could be thrashed out), and then an EU leaders summit tonight. So, what might the deal be? Greece\u2019s creditors are prepared to sign up for a short-term deal to extend the existing bailout by another six months, injecting up to \u20ac18bn of loans into the cash-starved Greek economy. They could also make some kind of pledge about debt restructuring, as part of a third bailout. As my colleague Ian Traynor wrote last night: Brussels sources also signalled moves to address Tsipras\u2019s key demand \u2013 that the creditors need to offer debt relief to Greece. Some form of debt restructuring would be promised to Athens in the future, but it would come with strings attached and not as part of the current bailout package, they said. That package expires in just nine days time; so failure today could trigger the slide towards capital controls, given Greece owes \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF on 30 June as well. But Greece will need to persuade its creditors that it is now offering the \u2018credible, concrete\u2019 proposals demanded for months. That means accepting tougher budget surplus targets, savings on pensions, VAT rates and labour market reforms \u2013 areas where progress have been stymied for months. But there\u2019s nothing like a finally-final deadline to get things moving. And there was frenzied activity over the weekend, with world leaders holding phone calls and Alexis Tsipras convening a cabinet meeting to discuss strategy. Negotiators in Brussels worked late into the night too -- waiting for that crucial breakthrough And there were anti-austerity, pro-government protests in Athens last night too: But will Greece\u2019s banks cope? Greek bankers are bracing for a difficult day. Although a bank run has been avoided, deposits have been exiting the system at a worrying levels. According to Reuters, around \u20ac1bn of orders have already been placed over the weekend to be carried out today, on top of \u20ac4.2bn withdrawn last week. But the news that Greece has submitted new proposals might ensure relative calm in Greece. We\u2019ll be tracking all the developments as usual, with correspondents in Brussels and Athens covering what should be a dramatic day.",

They could not do that, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chaired the session, because they did not have enough time to study what Athens was proposing. Their minions would have to negotiate hard and come back later in the week.</p> <p>So why did the Eurogroup finance ministers come to Brussels?

      "bodyText": "Like a husband forgiven for countless infidelities, Greek leader Alexis Tsipras is back in Brussels with a wink and a smile and, yes, another kiss and make-up proposal. Only this time, it looks like the marriage is saved. Tsipras has for the first time in several months taken the time to consider the concerns of his partners and rather than simply demanding solidarity, he has put together a plan to patch things up. What his partners want is simple, if difficult to achieve without further sacrifices. They want to close a funding gap in this year\u2019s budget that most analysts estimate at \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.4bn). It would appear that the leader of the leftist Syriza government has done enough to keep alive his country\u2019s hope of staying inside the euro. The question for his supporters at home will be, has he ditched his principled stand against further austerity, and if he has, do they care? Tackling the towering cost of the Greek pension system was once considered a no-go area. Already cut by his predecessors, Tsipras had ruled out shaving anymore from the bill. Likewise VAT was off the agenda. Now it seems he is prepared to compromise on both issues. On pensions, Athens appears to have conceded that the government\u2019s coffers must be shielded from a wave of early retirements. According to documents supplied by Tsipras\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, there are 400,000 Greeks looking to retire this year who qualify for a state pension, most of them under the existing early retirement rules. That\u2019s a whole bunch of 60- and 61-year-olds who want to get under the wire, probably to supplement a meagre income from working or to serve as an unemployment benefit, all at a huge cost to the public purse. There is already a plan drawn up by the previous Greek administration to phase out early retirement by 2025. But that does little to stop the 400,000 people looking to get their hands on a retirement income this year. Now there will be some further restrictions, which will please Greece\u2019s troika of lenders \u2013 the International Monetary Fund, European commission and European Central Bank (ECB). Higher contribution charges for people in work and a supplementary health charge for the wealthiest retirees is another tick on the austerity wall chart. Tax is another thorny issue. Apart from Tsipras\u2019s plans to squeeze the rich, not a surprise from the leader of a leftwing party, there is now a plan to raise some more tax revenues from higher VAT. While the three tiers of VAT remain in place and Athens insists electricity remains on the lowest band, some areas will be clobbered by a bit more tax. We are not sure which areas, possibly a higher rate applied to some islands, but suffice it to say Tsipras has relaxed his objection to any further rises in VAT. This year, extra VAT will raise \u20ac680m and next year \u20ac1.3bn, according to the Greek budget presented to the troika. It is worth nothing that until last weekend, pensions and VAT were red lines that could not be crossed. In an interview with the BBC, Greek economy minister George Stathakis chose to dwell on other initiatives to break the deadlock. He has put forward an increase on tax surcharges that middle and high-income earners pay, together with an extra levy on companies with annual net income of more than \u20ac500,000 and a hike in corporation tax from 26% to 29%. According to Stathakis, taxing the rich and large corporations will help raise \u20ac2.6bn, more than is needed. Greece, he claims, has achieved the 1% budget surplus \u2013 the amount that tax income exceeds state expenditure as a proportion of Greek GDP \u2013 demanded by the troika without crossing any red lines. But Stathakis is dissembling. Who is going to accept his denial that a health charge on pensioners is not strictly a pension charge? Not many. It is understandable why he would want to play with words. The ruling Syriza government is preparing a victory parade with banners declaring that Brussels caved to pressure while it stood firm, especially on further cuts to pensions. It is also a long way from the original Varoufakis plan to tackle Greece\u2019s growing debt mountain, which involved extending the life of loans worth billions of euros to cut the interest bill. This attempt to forge a long-term solution was rejected by the troika and provided the basis for the impasse of the last few months. Now we have a short-term fudge. And there is no doubt that a small budget shortfall can be fudged, especially now that concessions are on the table in areas that were previously out of bounds. For this sacrifice by the Greeks, the troika is now expected to pull out all the stops and wave through the last \u20ac7.2bn of funds due under the existing bailout programme. With that, Greece can limp on. But this remains an unhappy relationship.",

I borrow a fiver so I can travel to the next village for a day\u2019s work picking fruit. At the end of the day I pay back the fiver, and buy you a pint, and we\u2019re all better off than if I\u2019d stayed at home. Borrow, invest, repay, profit. Even if the bus broke down on the way home and I had to pay for a share of a taxi, we\u2019re all still better off. The problem wasn\u2019t the borrowing, it was the corrupt bus company shaving costs on maintenance. Don\u2019t confuse two separate issues. If I hadn\u2019t borrowed the money, I wouldn\u2019t have done the work, and couldn\u2019t have dealt with the crisis caused by private sector irresponsibility. Sure, problems arise if I borrow money and don\u2019t invest it in productive activity (like Greece, many might say); and it is, in this case, the same for governments, except they can borrow money cheaper than you or me. The problem is not the debt in itself, but in the kind of debt. Was it squandered, or invested in some profitable enterprise like health, education and social solidarity? For an example of squandering, try paying a private company to build you a power station, including the financing. They pay higher interest rates and charge a facility fee, so the whole operation is more costly. In the long term, the punter has to pay more for their electricity, but you\u2019ve achieved two aims: the funding doesn\u2019t appear on the books as government debt, and your buddies in the City get an extra 6% interest on the loans. So what d\u2019Ancona is celebrating is Osborne\u2019s success in selling tissue-paper umbrellas in a thunderstorm. Fair enough, borrowing to pour money down the drain (such as subsidising corrupt banks) doesn\u2019t do a lot of good. But if you borrow, invest, repay and make a profit, it works for governments just as much as individuals, and can be repeated ad lib. The crisis was a crisis of the financial markets. There was never a problem of government liquidity, so why offer support for Osborne\u2019s trashy and fatuous narrative? Dr Tony Brauer Jordans, Buckinghamshire",

If I hadn\u2019t borrowed the money, I wouldn\u2019t have done the work, and couldn\u2019t have dealt with the crisis caused by private sector irresponsibility.</p> <p>Sure, problems arise if I borrow money and don\u2019t invest it in productive activity (like Greece, many might say); and it is, in this case, the same for governments, except they can borrow money cheaper than you or me. The problem is not the debt in itself, but in the kind of debt. Was it squandered, or invested in some profitable enterprise like health, education and social solidarity?</p> <p>For an example of squandering, try paying a private company to build you a power station, including the financing. They pay higher interest rates and charge a facility fee, so the whole operation is more costly. In the long term, the punter has to pay more for their electricity, but you\u2019ve achieved two aims: the funding doesn\u2019t appear on the books as government debt, and your buddies in the City get an extra 6% interest on the loans.</p> <p>So what d\u2019Ancona is celebrating is Osborne\u2019s success in selling tissue-paper umbrellas in a thunderstorm. Fair enough, borrowing to pour money down the drain (such as subsidising corrupt banks) doesn\u2019t do a lot of good. But if you borrow, invest, repay and make a profit, it works for governments just as much as individuals, and can be repeated ad lib.</p> <p>The crisis was a crisis of the financial markets. There was never a problem of government liquidity, so why offer support for Osborne\u2019s trashy and fatuous narrative? <br><strong>Dr Tony Brauer</strong><br><em>Jordans, Buckinghamshire</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland does not yet have a date when its new chairman, Sir Howard Davies, will join its board, after announcing he would not take up his seat as planned on Tuesday this week. On Monday, less than 24 hours before shareholders were due to vote on Davies\u2019s appointment to the board at the annual general meeting in Edinburgh, the bank cited his commitments to the Airports Commission for his delay in taking up the seat. The bank, 79% owned by the taxpayer, insisted Davies would still become chairman as planned on 1 September, when he will take over from Sir Philip Hampton, who has held the position since shortly after the bank\u2019s \u00a345bn taxpayer rescue in 2008. RBS did not give a date for when Davies, a former top City regulator, might join the board of the bank, which is yet to report a profit seven years after the bailout. To take up his role at RBS, Davies is giving up his position chairman of life insurer Phoenix Group and his non-executive role at American investment bank Morgan Stanley. RBS had said he would complete his work as chairman of the UK Airports Commission before becoming chairman, although it was not clear until Monday that this would prevent him joining the board as a non-executive director as well. Davies is now expected to deliver the commission\u2019s report, backing either Heathrow or Gatwick expansion, next week. Established in 2012 by David Cameron to report on if and where a new runway should be built in the south-east, the Airports Commission had been instructed to delay its politically fraught recommendation until after the general election. While officially it had only pledged to deliver a report in the summer, many expected the commission\u2019s verdict in June. But the report\u2019s potential publication had to be delayed when the commission reopened its consultation into air quality, to allow public comment on additional evidence compiled on pollution around Heathrow. Then last week, anti-Heathrow campaigners, the Teddington Action Group, launched legal action, citing a conflict of interest over Davies, \u201cone of Heathrow\u2019s bankers\u201d, as future chairman of RBS. The delay in Davies taking up his boardroom seat comes as the government prepares to sell off part of its RBS stake \u2013 even though it is worth \u00a313bn less than was paid for it.

      "bodyText": "At the heart of the proposals submitted to Brussels by the Greek government on Monday \u2013 and central to the disagreements remaining between Athens and its creditors \u2013 is the issue of tax. According to reports circulating in Athens, the government offer to negotiators includes corporation tax increases on companies with profits over \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3359,000) and additional income tax for individuals with annual earnings of more than \u20ac30,000. The Syriza government is also understood to be ready to make bars and restaurants charge valued added tax at the top rate of 23%, as demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors. But it wants to keep two lower bands: one at 13% for energy and basic foods and another band at 6.5% for medicines and books. Greece\u2019s creditors \u2013 the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European commission \u2013 want to do away with the lowest band. They are also seeking two further changes: VAT to be charged at the highest rate on electricity and the scrapping of a concessionary rate for some of Greece\u2019s tourist-dependent islands. No reference to the first of these changes is understood to have been included in the plan Alexis Tsipras took to Brussels. The second was apparently conceded. But on Monday morning, Tsipras\u2019s coalition partner, Panos Kammenos of the hardline rightwing ANEL party, ruled it non-negotiable, underscoring just how cramped is the prime minister\u2019s room for manoeuvre. Integral to the wrangling over percentage points, however, is uncertainty as to whether the promised extra taxes will actually be collected in a state noted for high levels of evasion. It hardens attitudes and makes agreement more difficult: Greece\u2019s creditors aim to nail Athens down to specific and demanding targets because they know a fair proportion of the hoped-for revenue will never reach the treasury. But why is it so difficult to get Greeks to pay taxes? If anyone should know then it is Haris Theoharis. Until he stepped down last year he was Greece\u2019s top taxman, the secretary general of public revenues, under the previous government of Antonis Samaras. Greece, says Theoharis, loses around 6% more of GDP to evasion than the average country in the OECD club of rich nations. But, he adds, \u201cmuch of the problem is structural\u201d. \u201cGreece has between two and two and a half times more self-employed than in the rest of the OECD.\u201d And, he notes, it is notoriously easier for the self-employed to evade than it is for employees who mostly have their taxes deducted at source. Then, there is Greece\u2019s big shipping industry. \u201cAnd that cannot be taxed anywhere because of international regulations and because the tax base is international.\u201d He gives an example \u2013 apparently taken from personal experience \u2013 of a big firm lucratively shipping goods from China to Germany: \u201cBut with one woman with a telephone in Athens who could be moved at a moment\u2019s notice [to avoid taxation].\u201d Theoharis, who is now an MP for the liberal opposition party, To Potami (The River), reckons that Greece\u2019s shipping industry and its outsized self-employed sector together account for up to half of the six percentage points of GDP that differentiate it from the rest of the OECD. The rest is down to \u201cthe inefficiency of the tax administration\u201d, he says.",

But, he adds, \u201cmuch of the problem is structural\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cGreece has between two and two and a half times more self-employed than in the rest of the OECD.\u201d And, he notes, it is notoriously easier for the self-employed to evade than it is for employees who mostly have their taxes deducted at source.</p> <p>Then, there is Greece\u2019s big shipping industry. \u201cAnd that cannot be taxed anywhere because of international regulations and because the tax base is international.\u201d He gives an example \u2013 apparently taken from personal experience \u2013 of a big firm lucratively shipping goods from China to Germany: \u201cBut with one woman with a telephone in Athens who could be moved at a moment\u2019s notice [to avoid taxation].\u201d</p> <p>Theoharis, who is now an MP for the liberal opposition party, To Potami (The River), reckons that Greece\u2019s shipping industry and its outsized self-employed sector together account for up to half of the six percentage points of GDP that differentiate it from the rest of the OECD. The rest is down to \u201cthe inefficiency of the tax administration\u201d, he says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former head of the Irish operations of RSA has won a record \u20ac1.25m (\u00a3790,000) at an employment tribunal in a ruling that could raise questions about the circumstances surrounding the accounting issues uncovered at the insurance group in 2013. Philip Smith resigned in November 2013, claiming he had been made the \u201cfall guy\u201d for accounting discrepancies that forced the insurance group to pump \u00a3200m into its Irish subsidiary. Smith took his case for constructive dismissal to an employment tribunal in Ireland after arguing that he and his family had been traumatised by his suspension from the FTSE 100 company. The capital shortfall in Ireland was one factor that led to the ejection of RSA\u2019s boss, Simon Lee, in December 2013 and his replacement by the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester. It is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Central Bank of Ireland. Smith\u2019s suspension was announced when RSA stunned the City on a Friday night in November 2013 by saying it had launched an investigation into the Irish subsidiary and was pumping more capital into the operation. During the tribunal, Smith had argued he had made no attempt to cover up the way calculations for possible claims were made \u2013 which led to the \u00a3200m shortfall \u2013 and said the insurer had decided his fate before allowing him to respond to the allegations. RSA argued that Smith ran the operation under a climate of fear and the findings of its investigation were not predetermined. The insurer intends to appeal. The employment tribunal does not formally publish the outcomes of hearings for 14 days after they are delivered, but the Irish Times quoted passages from the outcome. \u201cThe tribunal is satisfied that the claimant was aware of the [accounting] practice, as were at least two dozen other employees, most of whom were in Ireland but some of whom were in the UK group,\u201d it said. \u201cThe tribunal is not satisfied that this practice was allowed to continue for so long due to a fear of the claimant.\u201d The tribunal agreed with Smith that his suspension had effectively been announced on national television, which it said \u201cwas the equivalent of taking a sledgehammer to his reputation as well as to his prospects of ever securing employment in the industry again in Ireland, Europe or possibly beyond\u201d. When he resigned, Smith had said: \u201cMy family and I have been truly traumatised by recent events and I have taken this most difficult of decisions in the best interests of my family. Resigning not only eases the stress and strain on them, but also offers me the opportunity to pursue justice outside the current flawed process.\u201d Smith\u2019s resignation letter was read out to the tribunal and in it he said there had been no attempt to cover up the problems in the Irish division which he had been running since 2007. He said the way the way calculations were made were \u201can open practice, not done surreptitiously or in a secret manner.\u201d It went on: \u201cEqually no attempt was ever made to cover up from colleagues at RSA group level.\u201d RSA said: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed by the Tribunal\u2019s decision and fundamentally disagree with it. We are considering our options but intend to appeal the judgment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The British catering multinational Compass Group, which was shown on Monday to have paid bribes to government officials in Kazakhstan, has also uncovered a \u201csuspected fraud\u201d in one of its joint ventures in the former Soviet state, documents seen by the Guardian reveal. The papers show a supplier linked to an employee of the business pocketed \u00a3160,000 after overcharging the joint venture for produce. The cache of documents also details another case in which a string of Compass managers raised concerns that a supplier was overcharging the same company by around \u00a3400,000 a year. The latest allegations are contained within a batch of papers relating to an ongoing employment tribunal claim brought by Karim Pabani, a former finance director of a Compass subsidiary in Kazakhstan who claims he was sacked after blowing the whistle on corruption. On Sunday, the Guardian revealed how those internal documents showed the catering group admitting a subsidiary made \u201cfacilitation payments\u201d to the country\u2019s customs officials \u2013 a practice the company says it discovered and eradicated in 2011. The claims about overcharging relate to KazMunayGas-Service Compass (KMGSC), which Compass owns with a state-owned oil group in Kazakhstan. The public portion of Pabani\u2019s witness statement further alleges that he was asked to falsify company records in order to cover up shortfalls in KMGSC\u2019s accounts, as well as claims that the joint venture\u2019s then boss Timur Kurenbekov \u2013 son of Amantay Kurenbekov, now head of the state security service \u2013 \u201cwas removing money from the business through the use of their suppliers\u201d. Timur Kurenbekov is also alleged by Pabani to have been the key to KMGSC attracting major contracts in Kazakhstan. Compass has yet to respond in detail to Pabani\u2019s employment tribunal claims. A spokesman said: \u201cCompass is vigorously defending these allegations [in the tribunal] but as the matter is subject to ongoing legal proceedings we are not able to comment further at this time.\u201d KMGSC did not comment. The Guardian was unable to contact Kurenbekov.

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors have raised the prospect of an agreement to stave off imminent bankruptcy after agreeing to develop proposals from Athens aimed at unlocking vital bailout funds. A meeting of eurozone finance ministers broke up after little more than an hour of discussions over a new offer from the government of the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. However, while negotiators said the proposals on budget surpluses, pensions and tax represented a good basis for discussing a last-ditch deal, the move came too late for a definitive breakthrough at an emergency summit of EU leaders on Monday evening. Expectations of a broad agreement were raised, however, after Greece\u2019s economy minister, Giorgos Stathakis, told the BBC he expected eurozone leaders would reach agreement over the Greek bailout, allowing authorities in Athens to unlock \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a36.3bn) of financial aid. An EU official on the creditors\u2019 side described the Greek proposals as the first \u201cdetailed and credible\u201d plan that they had seen in five months of deadlock. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who chairs the group of 19 eurozone countries, said that the European Union institutions needed time to look at the Greek proposals with the aim of reaching an agreement later this week. The Greek plan was \u201ca basis to really restart the talks again and really get a result\u201d, he said, although officials needed to assess whether \u201cthe economic reforms [proposed] are enough for the economy to take off again\u201d. Greece submitted concessions overnight in response to creditors\u2019 key demands including raising VAT and making changes to the country\u2019s pension system that would eventually raise the retirement age to 67. Several eurozone finance ministers complained of confusion after the Greek government sent two versions of the proposals, but Dijsselbloem dismissed it as \u201cno big problem\u201d. An EU official involved in the talks on the creditors\u2019 side said of the proposals: \u201cI am not sure if they will fly, but they are a good basis for discussion.\u201d He also confirmed that the Greeks had made meaningful concessions on VAT rates and pensions reform, two of the main sticking points. The Greeks wanted to keep a three-tier system of VAT, but the lowest rate, which the creditors want abolished, would only apply to a \u201ccouple\u201d of items, believed to be books and medicines. Eurozone ministers are expected to meet again on Thursday \u2013 their third meeting in eight days \u2013 in yet another attempt to end the deadlock which has brought Greece to the brink of bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was still due on Monday night to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and other eurozone leaders to discuss the latest plan. The emergency meeting of EU leaders is being seen as a victory for Tsipras, who has long argued that a breakthrough can only be made at the highest political levels. Negotiators are promising debt relief for Greece but officials have stressed that a breakthrough will depend on a positive response from Tsipras. Greece\u2019s international creditors are looking at a deal that would extend the country\u2019s bailout by six months and supply up to \u20ac18bn (\u00a312.9bn) in rescue funds. Greece urgently needs funds ahead of a \u20ac1.6bn payment to the International Monetary Fund due on 30 June. The six-month rescue extension being considered would unlock the \u20ac7.2bn in Greece\u2019s bailout fund that is yet to be disbursed as well as \u20ac10.9bn already lent to Athens but earmarked for recapitalisation of its weakened banks. The latter sum could be quickly transferred to the government to help debt repayments. Earlier on Monday, as finance ministers arrived in the pouring rain in Brussels for their meeting, many played down hopes of an imminent breakthrough, saying they had not had enough time to study the plans.. Alexander Stubb, Finland\u2019s finance minister, complained that finance ministers and eurozone leaders had \u201cwasted a lot of air miles\u201d over Monday\u2019s meetings. As the talks broke up he tweeted: \u201cWork continues. Institutions assess proposals.\u201d \u201cWe need a deal in the coming days,\u201d said the European commissioner responsible for the euro, Valdis Dombrovskis. Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s head of cabinet, Martin Selmayr, said the Athens proposal offered \u201ca good basis for progress\u201d, though he described the talks as a \u201cforceps delivery\u201d, underscoring the exertions to prevent Greece leaving the eurozone. EU leaders had been reluctant to discuss Greece at this Thursday\u2019s summit, where the packed agenda includes the humanitarian migrant crisis on Europe\u2019s borders, a controversial trade deal with the US and the UK\u2019s demands for treaty change. Tsipras met his three main creditors \u2013 the European commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) \u2013 on Monday morning, after getting an initially positive reaction to his compromise plan. Talks between Greece\u2019s leftist government and its creditors have been deadlocked for five months and the country is fast running out of money. But hopes that an agreement might be reached sent shares across Europe surging today, with the Greek stock market rising 9%. The German DAX leapt by 2.5% and the French market was also up over 2%. In London, the FTSE 100 index jumped by 75 points, or 1.1%. Italian shares were up by 1.8%. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, urged the two sides to seize a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d, saying that all conditions were in place for them to reach a \u201cwin-win accord\u201d. The Greek financial system was given a boost ahead of the crunch talks, when the ECB agreed to extend emergency funding to Greek banks. A banking source told Reuters that the ECB\u2019s decision-making governing council had raised the amount of emergency funds available to Greece\u2019s cash-starved banks and was ready to convene again any time it was needed. Underlining the growing concern beyond Greece, several thousand demonstrators gathered in Brussels on Sunday and several hundred in Amsterdam to plead for solidarity with the cash-strapped country. In Athens itself, more than 7,000 people took to the streets for the second time this week to protest austerity with banners reading \u201cA different Europe with Tsipras\u201d and \u201cYou can\u2019t blackmail the people, the country is not for sale\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s suppliers have rated the retailer as the worst of the major supermarkets at complying with a government-backed industry code designed to protect manufacturers. Four in 100 of Tesco\u2019s direct suppliers, who responded to a questionnaire by the grocery regulator, said the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket never complied with the code of practice, which governs major retailers\u2019 dealings with suppliers. A further 30% said the supermarket rarely complied with the code. Tesco\u2019s poor rating comes despite the attempts of its chief executive, Dave Lewis, to change behaviour at the group after its \u00a3263m supplier payments accounting scandal. That scandal prompted the grocery code adjudicator, Christine Tacon, to investigate Tesco\u2019s treatment of suppliers. On Monday, Tacon said her inquiry was unlikely to be completed until the autumn. Tacon declined to comment on the details of her investigation, but said she welcomed the changes Lewis was making to Tesco dealings with suppliers. Lewis is cutting the ways in which it charges suppliers from 24 to three, putting more focus on agreeing a suitable price upfront. \u201cI think that will lead to more compliant [dealings],\u201d she said, adding that every major retailer had made changes to the way they dealt with suppliers in the wake of Tesco\u2019s issues. Tesco said the survey, which covered just over 1,000 manufacturers in total, was a snapshot of its business partners\u2019 views, given that the supermarket has 3,000 UK suppliers. Tesco said the survey also showed progress from last year, when 6% of those taking part said the retailer never complied with the code and 35% said it rarely did. \u201cSuppliers are at the heart of our business and we\u2019ve been working collaboratively with them to change the way in which we work. Since 2013, we have taken action to strengthen our compliance processes and have established a dedicated supplier helpline in the UK,\u201d the retailer said in a statement. Tacon, who was installed two years ago to oversee the grocery code which had been in place since 2010 without bringing about much change in the industry, said she believed retailers were now changing their ways. \u201cGenuinely, people have become more aware of what they can and can\u2019t do,\u201d she said. Despite that, 70% of the 1,141 suppliers who responded to the regulator\u2019s annual questionnaire about the code said they had experienced at least one related issue in the past year. While it was down from 79% in 2014, Tacon said she was \u201cnot proud\u201d of the high level of problems. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go,\u201d she said. The top five issues raised by suppliers were delays in payments, changes in contract terms, unjustified charges for consumer complaints about a product, demands for contributions to marketing costs, and a lack of compensation when a retailer made errors in forecasting the amount of product they required. In terms of individual retailer performance, Iceland was the only chain to perform worse than Tesco in the survey, with 5% of suppliers who responded saying it never complied with the code and a further 30% saying it rarely did. In joint third place were Morrisons and the Co-op, with 2% of suppliers saying the retailers never complied with the code. Aldi was the best performer with 94% of the German discounter\u2019s suppliers saying it consistently or mostly complied with the code. While the number of suppliers responding to Tacon\u2019s annual questionnaire doubled this year, the regulator admitted she was still not happy with the number of people coming forward to complain. Fewer than half of the direct suppliers taking part in the survey said they would consider raising issues with the regulator. Tacon said suppliers were concerned that they could be identified by the particulars of their complaint. \u201cThe more people that tell me about an issue the safer I am in going back to retailers,\u201d she said. In an effort to harvest more evidence on one of the most complained about issues, Tacon is to hold a workshop with suppliers looking into charges for packaging in September. In the past few months, Tacon has completed an industry consultation relating to consumer complaints charges. She found that some retailers were charging up to \u00a345 for every complaint, while others charged nothing. She has now issued guidance on best practice and said that if suppliers continued to raise the issue she may have to launch a formal investigation.",

So Trapani did something unorthodox: she hired a woman who had been working in a fast food restaurant and invested in teaching her the sheet metal business.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe took a risk and hired this person,\u201d said Trapani, co-president of Wyoming Machine in Stacy, Minnesota. \u201cShe\u2019s been here now for a year and she\u2019s been doing a great job.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/19/baltimore-small-business-freddie-gray\">Baltimore is open for business: can the city convince customers it's safe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trapani is one of the small business owners grappling with a widening gap between staffing desires and the qualifications of the available workforce. In May, more than 80% of small businesses that were hiring said they had few or no qualified applicants for their open positions, according to a <a href=\"http://www.nfib.com/surveys/small-business-economic-trends/\">recently released report</a> from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). And 13% of respondents named the low quality of available labor as the most pressing challenge to their businesses, the highest proportion since 2009. </p> <p>Some argue that high schools and colleges are not adequately preparing young people for the jobs that are available today; others contend that businesses should offer training programs and higher pay to attract and shape the workers they want. Everyone agrees that employers\u2019 desires and workers\u2019 skill sets are increasingly out of sync. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a gap between what we\u2019re training people to do and where the jobs are,\u201d said John Arensmeyer, founder of Small Business Majority, an advocacy group based in Washington DC.</p> <p>While no business is immune from these hiring difficulties, small companies often find the mismatch between openings and applicants especially troublesome. Across industries, therefore, many of these enterprises are tackling the problem by finding creative ways to approach recruiting, hiring and training. At the same time, collaborations between business, government, and community groups are helping to lay the groundwork for a long term solution. </p> <p>Many smaller enterprises simply don\u2019t have the resources they need to find the best, most qualified candidates. In these businesses, there are generally no human resources departments that can dedicate themselves to hunting out candidates, said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis at NFIB. </p> <p>Trapani, whose company employs 55 people, agreed. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really have enough employees to have a full-time staff person that\u2019s doing nothing but recruiting,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can only afford to spend so much time on determining where you\u2019re going to get your next employee.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/17/ouya-video-startups-kickstarter-failures-champions-crowdfunding\">What happens to video startups that make millions on Kickstarter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Small businesses also have less ability to absorb unexpected financial blows, making them more cautious when it comes to hiring anyone who doesn\u2019t match the job description completely, Wade said. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely they are being more selective and looking for the perfect applicant,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Small businesses are also more likely to be working in unusual niches, making it harder to find people with the specific experience needed by employees. Reliable Underground Service Technicians in Allendale, Michigan, for example, provides cathodic protection services \u2013 a technique for preventing corrosion in pipelines, bridges, and other metal structures. Job applicants rarely have any knowledge of the highly specialized field, said owner Tim Corbett. </p> <p>In the six years since he launched the business, Corbett has tried several methods of choosing employees, including aptitude and personality tests. Eventually, he realized that the only way to end up with reliable employees is to create them. </p> <p>Now, Corbett interviews potential hires, looking for confidence and problem-solving skills, then puts the selected candidates through an extensive training program. Today, he has about 20 employees and lower employee turnover than other companies in the field, he said. </p> <p>Such internal training programs are not an option for everyone, however. Many small businesses operate on thin margins and simply can\u2019t afford the expenditure of time and money a comprehensive training program would require, said Rachel Unruh, chief of staff at the National Skills Coalition. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just not feasible for small and medium-sized employers,\u201d she said. </p> <p>In fast-growing fields \u2013 mobile technology or cloud computing, for example \u2013 snagging talented software developers or systems engineers can be harder for smaller, younger companies that haven\u2019t yet developed a brand as an employer. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/07/the-challenge-of-filling-the-skills-gap-in-emerging-economies\">The challenge of filling the skills gap in emerging economies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dyn, a Manchester, New Hampshire company that offers services to help improve the performance of clients\u2019 internet connections, has grown from 25 employees in 2009 to about 400 today. The growing company was careful to cultivate a strong workplace culture in order to attract and keep the best possible employees, said Kyle York, Dyn\u2019s chief marketing officer. Over the years, recruiting has remained competitive but has definitely become easier, he said.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody is fighting for that employee pool,\u201d he said. \u201cBut your happy employees are telling their friends.

      "bodyText": "Last year, Traci Trapani needed employees for her sheet metal fabrication company. None of the applicants, however, had experience in the industry. So Trapani did something unorthodox: she hired a woman who had been working in a fast food restaurant and invested in teaching her the sheet metal business. \u201cWe took a risk and hired this person,\u201d said Trapani, co-president of Wyoming Machine in Stacy, Minnesota. \u201cShe\u2019s been here now for a year and she\u2019s been doing a great job.\u201d Trapani is one of the small business owners grappling with a widening gap between staffing desires and the qualifications of the available workforce. In May, more than 80% of small businesses that were hiring said they had few or no qualified applicants for their open positions, according to a recently released report from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). And 13% of respondents named the low quality of available labor as the most pressing challenge to their businesses, the highest proportion since 2009. Some argue that high schools and colleges are not adequately preparing young people for the jobs that are available today; others contend that businesses should offer training programs and higher pay to attract and shape the workers they want. Everyone agrees that employers\u2019 desires and workers\u2019 skill sets are increasingly out of sync. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a gap between what we\u2019re training people to do and where the jobs are,\u201d said John Arensmeyer, founder of Small Business Majority, an advocacy group based in Washington DC. While no business is immune from these hiring difficulties, small companies often find the mismatch between openings and applicants especially troublesome. Across industries, therefore, many of these enterprises are tackling the problem by finding creative ways to approach recruiting, hiring and training. At the same time, collaborations between business, government, and community groups are helping to lay the groundwork for a long term solution. Many smaller enterprises simply don\u2019t have the resources they need to find the best, most qualified candidates. In these businesses, there are generally no human resources departments that can dedicate themselves to hunting out candidates, said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis at NFIB. Trapani, whose company employs 55 people, agreed. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have enough employees to have a full-time staff person that\u2019s doing nothing but recruiting,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can only afford to spend so much time on determining where you\u2019re going to get your next employee.\u201d Small businesses also have less ability to absorb unexpected financial blows, making them more cautious when it comes to hiring anyone who doesn\u2019t match the job description completely, Wade said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely they are being more selective and looking for the perfect applicant,\u201d she said. Small businesses are also more likely to be working in unusual niches, making it harder to find people with the specific experience needed by employees. Reliable Underground Service Technicians in Allendale, Michigan, for example, provides cathodic protection services \u2013 a technique for preventing corrosion in pipelines, bridges, and other metal structures. Job applicants rarely have any knowledge of the highly specialized field, said owner Tim Corbett. In the six years since he launched the business, Corbett has tried several methods of choosing employees, including aptitude and personality tests. Eventually, he realized that the only way to end up with reliable employees is to create them. Now, Corbett interviews potential hires, looking for confidence and problem-solving skills, then puts the selected candidates through an extensive training program. Today, he has about 20 employees and lower employee turnover than other companies in the field, he said. Such internal training programs are not an option for everyone, however. Many small businesses operate on thin margins and simply can\u2019t afford the expenditure of time and money a comprehensive training program would require, said Rachel Unruh, chief of staff at the National Skills Coalition. \u201cThat\u2019s just not feasible for small and medium-sized employers,\u201d she said. In fast-growing fields \u2013 mobile technology or cloud computing, for example \u2013 snagging talented software developers or systems engineers can be harder for smaller, younger companies that haven\u2019t yet developed a brand as an employer. Dyn, a Manchester, New Hampshire company that offers services to help improve the performance of clients\u2019 internet connections, has grown from 25 employees in 2009 to about 400 today. The growing company was careful to cultivate a strong workplace culture in order to attract and keep the best possible employees, said Kyle York, Dyn\u2019s chief marketing officer. Over the years, recruiting has remained competitive but has definitely become easier, he said. \u201cEverybody is fighting for that employee pool,\u201d he said. \u201cBut your happy employees are telling their friends. It is a more stable, developed workplace.\u201d More far-reaching efforts to narrow the skills gap are also underway. Increasingly, state and local governments, community colleges, and industry members are joining together to create more opportunities for people to learn in-demand skills. Employers in a specific industry work with community colleges or workforce groups to help develop targeted training programs that will produce workers companies want to hire, said Unruh. These collaborations, often called \u201csector partnerships\u201d, are showing up in the manufacturing, health care, and construction industries, particularly, she said. And federal legislation passed last year contains provisions to encourage the creation of more such partnerships in every state, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of cooperative purchase power for training,\u201d Unruh said. In New Hampshire, Dyn is one of the founding partners of STEAM Ahead, an initiative aimed at pushing more high school students to explore science and technology fields with the ultimate goal of strengthening the workforce in years to come. As far as Trapani is concerned, these solutions can\u2019t come fast enough, for both employers and the economy. \u201cSmall employers employ a huge number of people,\u201d she said, \u201cso that fact that we\u2019re all kind of struggling with this compiles into a relatively big problem.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The ambassador could soon be spoiling guests with Thorntons coffee creams, strawberry dreams and whisky truffles after the maker of Ferrero Rocher agreed to buy the ailing British chocolatier for \u00a3112m. One of the most familiar names on the high street, Thorntons has struggled in recent years despite a series of attempts to revive the business, including opening its own stores, trying to expand into products such as ice cream and increasing sales through supermarkets. But Thorntons\u2019 chocolate, which was once seen as luxurious and upmarket, has lost some of its lustre as European brands such as Lindt, which contain a much higher amount of cocoa, have gained ground. Thorntons has struggled to adapt to changing tastes as they shift towards darker chocolate and less sugary flavours. Successive bosses have found it hard to make its Derbyshire factory, built in the boom time, economically viable. Such was the competitive pressure that in 2007 one of Thorntons\u2019 master chocolatiers, Barry Colenso, was forced to resign in disgrace after being caught squashing truffles in one of competitor Hotel Chocolat\u2019s stores. Founded by Joseph Thornton in Sheffield and using the slogan \u201cchocolate heaven since 1911\u201d, the company floated on the stock market in 1987 at a time when it enjoyed widespread popularity. Ferrero International, which makes Nutella and Tic Tacs as well as the foil-wrapped Ferrero Rocher chocolates, said it was buying Thorntons to expand its business in the UK, where the Italian firm has operated for 60 years. The buyout, which must still be approved by shareholders and competition regulators, marks the loss of one of Britain\u2019s last remaining home-grown chocolate brands to an overseas buyer. Cadbury and Green &amp; Black\u2019s were sold to the US confectionary business Kraft Foods Inc \u2013 now renamed Mondelez \u2013 in 2009 while Rowntree, the company which developed the Kit Kat and Aero, was sold to Nestl\u00e9 in 1988. Ferrero, which does not currently manufacture in the UK, said it would keep the Thorntons brand and its factory in Alfreton, Derbyshire. The factory employs about 1,500 of Thorntons\u2019 3,500 staff. However, the future of Thorntons\u2019 242 stores in Britain and Ireland and its head office, which is also in Alfreton, are to be put under review. Giovanni Ferrero, chief executive of the family-owned business which launched from a pastry stall in the 1940s, said he had long admired Thorntons and the customer loyalty it attracted. \u201cThis transaction brings together two highly complementary businesses, but more importantly unites two companies that share the same passion for growing brands and a proud heritage, drive and culture built upon their family foundations.\u201d The deal will enable Ferrero to step ahead of its Swiss rival Lindt to become the UK\u2019s fourth-largest chocolate brand \u2013 behind Mondelez, Mars and Nestl\u00e9. Currently the Nutella maker controls just 4% of UK chocolate sales, the same as Lindt, but this will rise to nearly 7% when the deal is completed Ferrero said: \u201cWe delivered our best ever results in the UK in 2014, giving us confidence that now is the right time to broaden our roots in this important market.\u201d The takeover marks a departure from the way Ferrero operated under its patriarch, Michele Ferrero, who died Italy\u2019s richest man in February. He shunned big mergers but bought a factory in Turkey, which is a major processor of hazelnuts, one of the the main ingredients in Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, last year. Ferrero is still the world\u2019s largest consumer of hazelnuts, using 25% of global supply. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said he would be surprised if Thorntons\u2019 factory survived \u201cintact\u201d as Ferrero took control. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible deal for Thorntons. It\u2019s not going to break the bank for Ferrero, given their size, but you do have to wonder if they have got more money than sense,\u201d he added. Shares in Thorntons soared by nearly 43% to 145p on Monday after Ferrero\u2019s offer was revealed \u2013 their highest level in over a year. The company\u2019s board said it was giving the offer from Ferrero its \u201cunanimous recommendation\u201d. Thorntons directors, including chairman Paul Wilkinson, and the departing chief executive, Jonathan Hart, have already sold Ferrero shares equivalent to 2.8% of the company. Wilkinson will receive \u00a32.2m for his stake in the company while Hart and his family are in line for about \u00a3380,000. He will also be paid his \u00a3350,000 salary for the next year after standing down. The board\u2019s capitulation comes after yet another tough year for Thorntons, which was forced to issue a profits warning in December after orders from supermarkets were much lower than anticipated. Lamine Lahouasnia, head of packaged food research at Euromonitor, said: \u201cThorntons has been in trouble for a number of years now. It looked like things were gradually recovering but recent news put them back on the downward trend again so this deal has come at quite a good time. \u201cFerrero has got a bit of a job on its hands turning round not just Thorntons\u2019 financial performance but how UK consumers perceive the Thorntons brand. That will take quite a lot of communication and investment.\u201d Its departing chief executive, Jonathan Hart, who previously ran coffee chain Caff\u00e8 Nero, joined in 2011 after the company suffered four profit warnings in a year. He tried to revive the business by selling more products to supermarkets and online while shutting unprofitable stores. He quit last month after a difficult period in which Thorntons was forced to issue the pre-Christmas warning. Profit fell almost 10% last year and Hart said supermarket sales would not revive in the coming months. He is due to leave the company at the end of this week. Wilkinson said: \u201cFerrero is offering our shareholders an attractive premium to the average price of Thorntons\u2019 shares over the last three months. Although the prospects for Thorntons as an independent company remain strong as the company embarks on the next phase of its strategy, the board of Thorntons also recognises the potential benefits to the brand and the business, including employees and all stakeholders, from combining with the Ferrero group.\u201d The sales by directors contributed to a 29.9% stake in Thorntons already owned by Ferrero which also has the backing of owners of another 4.5%. Crystal Amber, an activist investment fund that has been agitating for change at Thorntons, also sold its 18.3% stake.

      "body": "<p>The ambassador could soon be spoiling guests with Thorntons coffee creams, strawberry dreams and whisky truffles after the maker of Ferrero Rocher agreed to buy the ailing British chocolatier for \u00a3112m.</p> <p>One of the most familiar names on the high street, Thorntons has struggled in recent years despite a series of attempts to revive the business, including opening its own stores, trying to expand into products such as ice cream and increasing sales through supermarkets.</p> <p>But Thorntons\u2019 chocolate, which was once seen as luxurious and upmarket, has lost some of its lustre as European brands such as Lindt, which contain a much higher amount of cocoa, have gained ground. Thorntons has struggled to adapt to changing tastes as they shift towards darker chocolate and less sugary flavours. Successive bosses have found it hard to make its Derbyshire factory, built in the boom time, economically viable.</p> <p>Such was the competitive pressure that in 2007 one of Thorntons\u2019 master chocolatiers, Barry Colenso, was forced to resign in disgrace after being caught squashing truffles in one of competitor Hotel Chocolat\u2019s stores.</p> <p>Founded by Joseph Thornton in Sheffield and using the slogan \u201cchocolate heaven since 1911\u201d, the company floated on the stock market in 1987 at a time when it enjoyed widespread popularity. </p> <p>Ferrero International, which makes Nutella and Tic Tacs as well as the foil-wrapped Ferrero Rocher chocolates, said it was buying Thorntons to expand its business in the UK, where the Italian firm has operated for 60 years. </p> <p>The buyout, which must still be approved by shareholders and competition regulators, marks the loss of one of Britain\u2019s last remaining home-grown chocolate brands to an overseas buyer. Cadbury and Green &amp; Black\u2019s were sold to the US confectionary business Kraft Foods Inc \u2013 now renamed Mondelez \u2013 in 2009 while Rowntree, the company which developed the Kit Kat and Aero, was sold to Nestl\u00e9 in 1988.</p> <p>Ferrero, which does not currently manufacture in the UK, said it would keep the Thorntons brand and its factory in Alfreton, Derbyshire.

But prospects for a deal rose after Tsipras, despite domestic pressure to honour his anti-austerity election promises, made concessions to foreign creditors in an attempt to find a way through the impasse, which has pushed Greece to the brink of bankruptcy. Many investors were still cautious because it was not immediately clear how far his proposal went in meeting creditor demands for additional spending cuts and tax hikes. But Asian markets mostly reacted positively in morning trade, with Tokyo up 0.80 percent and Hong Kong up 0.44 percent by the break. The euro also ticked higher, buying $1.1381 and 139.70 yen in Tokyo compared with $1.1349 and 139.23 yen in New York late Friday. \u201cOriginally there wasn\u2019t going to be one, so the fact that there\u2019s a new proposal on the table appears to be seen favourably,\u201d Shoji Hirakawa, chief equity strategist at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo told Bloomberg News. Tsipras is holding crisis talks with European commission head Jean-Claude Juncker, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and IMF head Christine Lagarde on Monday morning, before meeting eurozone finance ministers early in the afternoon. Locked out of bond markets and with bailout aid frozen since summer last year, Athens is quickly running out of cash. The deputy finance minister on Sunday confirmed the country had enough money to pay public sector wages and pensions this month. Greece\u2019s international creditors are aiming to strike a deal to stop Athens defaulting on its debt and possibly exiting the euro by extending its bailout by six months and supplying up to \u20ac18bn (\u00a312.9b) in rescue funds. Some analysts said the concessions suggested that fear of the widespread turmoil that could follow a Greek exit from the eurozone may nudge negotiators towards an eleventh-hour agreement. \u201cToday will supposedly be the last round of negotiations, so there could be a possible surprise in form of an agreement with both parties seeing the writing on the wall,\u201d said Shinichiro Kadota, chief Japan forex strategist at Barclays in Tokyo. \u201cStill, it is unclear when and if an agreement will be reached, and the euro will remain sensitive to headlines over Greece. It will be all about Greece today.\u201d Other analysts were more skeptical. \u201cGreece will be reaching a climax this week and markets will be extremely nervous,\u201d said Masakazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. \u201cThe markets are on the whole moderately hopeful on a deal. But it is difficult to tell the outcome as this will be a highly political decision.\u201d Athens desperately needs fresh financing from international creditors to meet a 30 June deadline to repay a \u20ac1.6b IMF loan and a void a possible default. Guarded optimism that the showdown in Brussels will break the deadlock saw Asian stocks rise slightly in early trading on Monday. The Nikkei stock average rose slightly as rising optimism over Japan\u2019s economic outlook outweighed concerns over Greece. The broader Topix index also rose. Chinese mainland markets were closed for a national holiday, offering the region temporary relief from the Greek debt crisis.",
