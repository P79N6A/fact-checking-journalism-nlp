      "bodyText": "An interest rate rise in the US looks a near certainty after another solid month of job creation in the world\u2019s largest economy. In a boost to Donald Trump as he prepares to move into the White House next month, government figures showed the unemployment rate dropped to a nine-year low in November and employers hired new workers at a faster pace as they banked on a rebound in economic growth. Behind the upbeat headline figures were signs that some US workers have yet to feel the gains of an improving labor market as wages fell and as many Americans gave up looking for work. But that is unlikely to deter policymakers on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee (FOMC) from raising interest rates at their meeting later this month, economists said. \u201cOn the back of largely positive economic data throughout autumn, a rate rise is widely expected for the December meeting of the FOMC. The positive employment data from November are probably the last piece of confirmation the members of the committee were waiting for,\u201d said Kay Daniel Neufeld at the consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The final US jobs report of 2016 recorded 178,000 new jobs added, close to economists\u2019 expectations of 180,000 for November. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.6% from 4.9% in October and was the lowest since August 2007, before the global financial crisis struck. Deputy labor secretary Chris Lu said that President-elect Trump was inheriting a far better economy than the one outgoing president Barack Obama had inherited from George W Bush, but \u201cthe unfinished business was wages\u201d. \u201cI think the working-class and middle-class Americans who voted for the president-elect are expecting not only for their jobs to stay here but for their wages to go up, and we know what the policy solutions are,\u201d Lu told the Guardian. \u201cThe tighter job market is pushing up wages as businesses compete for workers, but the process is gradual,\u201d he said. The figures from the US labor department showed hourly wages declined by 3 cents an hour to $25.89. Augustine Faucher, analyst at the bank PNC, called the wage dip \u201ca big soft spot\u201d. Faucher also noted the drop in unemployment was not entirely good news. \u201cIt fell in part because of a contraction in the labor force of 226,000, with the labor force participation rate declining to 62.7%, its lowest since June,\u201d he said. James Smith, economist at the bank ING, said there were reasons to think the wage dip was a one-off and that pay would soon rise again. \u201cThat weak wage figure will probably raise a few eyebrows among some of the more dovish Fed voters. But it would have had to have been a really disastrous jobs report to have derailed the FOMC\u2019s plans to hike in December,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, assuming that the latest wage growth figure was a blip, we still think that the labor market is strong enough to support two hikes from the FOMC next year.\u201d Trump secured the presidency after campaigning on a platform of anti-globalization and pledges of job creation for US workers. He also vowed to increase spending on infrastructure, something many economists believe will give the US economy a significant boost next year. If the billionaire Republican delivers on his spending promise, inflation is also viewed as likely to pick up, which would push the US central bank into more rate rises next year. Fed policymakers, investors and analysts alike would now be closely watching the new president to gauge how much of his campaign talk would become policy, said Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. \u201cIf, as expected, we see a swing towards fiscal stimulus, this may give the Fed greater scope to hike rates further in 2017. Fed decision making will no longer be solely data dependent, but policy dependent also,\u201d said Curtin. The prospect of higher inflation has also raised fears for living standards being squeezed further if wage growth does not keep pace with costs. Many workers still report they cannot make ends meet even with multiple jobs. \u201cI take one day off from home health, but when I do that I do deliveries all day long,\u201d said April Shabazz of Merriam, Kansas, who protested with Fight for 15 workers this week as part of calls for fairer minimum wages nationwide. \u201cI\u2019ve been in home health since I was 15, so 30 years,\u201d Shabazz said, adding that she works every day of the week, sometimes as a delivery driver for GrubHub, sometimes as a home healthcare worker. \u201cThe cost of living is going up, but our pay is not going up,\u201d she told the Guardian.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BHS has been placed into liquidation following pressure from the Pension Protection Fund, which argued that closing down the business would produce the best outcome for the failed retailer\u2019s pensioners. It also emerged that lawyers picking over the carcass of the BHS collapse are looking at the validity of a \u00a335m floating charge held in the name of former owner Sir Phillip Green. This ranks Green as a secured creditor of BHS and entitles him to get all his money back from the administration proceeds. Duff &amp; Phelps, one of BHS\u2019s joint administrators until this week, had already judged Green\u2019s claim to be valid. But it is thought that lawyers working for FRP Advisory, which is now in sole charge of the liquidation process, had demanded that the sum be returned from an escrow account at Green\u2019s legal firm. The PPF, a government-backed lifeboat for troubled pension schemes, is the company\u2019s biggest creditor and had rowed with Duff &amp; Phelps over the next step for the failed business. In the summer it pressed for FRP Advisory\u2019s appointment after it was argued that Duff &amp; Phelps was too close to Green. Duff &amp; Phelps were accused of being the retail tycoon\u2019s \u201cponies\u201d by Dominic Chappell, the former bankrupt who bought BHS for \u00a31 in 2015. Labour MP Frank Field, who has locked horns with Green over BHS\u2019s fate, said liquidation \u2013 where a company\u2019s remaining assets are sold off \u2013 offered the best chance of recovering cash for the collapsed retailer\u2019s pension scheme. BHS\u2019s scheme had a deficit of as much as \u00a3571m at the time of the retailer\u2019s collapse in April this year. \u201cThis is another milestone in the collapse of BHS that Sir Philip Green sailed away from,\u201d said Field. \u201cAt this stage, though, it is welcome. It gives the PPF\u2019s preferred administrator \u2013 rather than Sir Philip\u2019s \u2013 the best chance of salvaging some money for the pension schemes.\u201d The administrators\u2019 duties include scrutinising the actions of BHS\u2019s former directors. However it is understood that, seven months on from BHS\u2019s collapse, this investigatory work, which would provide the basis for any legal action to recover funds, is not yet at an advanced stage. The administrators\u2019 report reveals that forensic accountants and lawyers are wading through 4,000 boxes of hard copy records and nearly 200 terabytes of data from BHS\u2019s servers and company laptops. \u201cWe believe the liquidation is the right way to secure the best possible recovery for the pension schemes and other creditors of the insolvent company,\u201d said Malcolm Weir, head of restructuring and insolvency at the PPF. \u201cThe liquidator will now be able to progress all remaining issues, including the leases and the ongoing investigatory work.\u201d As liquidators FRP Advisory have more power to take decisions, including handing back stores to landlords, and in doing so, mitigating the rent that can be claimed out of the general pot for creditors. Even though all BHS stores are empty the company remains liable for monthly rental payments. At present BHS\u2019s unsecured creditors have been told to expect a maximum of 8p in the pound from the sale of BHS\u2019s assets. \u201cWe will be continuing our process of making recoveries through liquidation on behalf of all creditors and continuing with our statutory duties,\u201d said a spokesman for FRP Advisory. A parliamentary investigation into the demise of the retailer found that BHS had been systematically plundered under its former owners Green and Dominic Chappell. Green, his family and other BHS shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from the retailer, while Chappell\u2019s company Retail Acquisitions was paid an estimated \u00a317m. The Topshop owner is still in talks with the Pension Regulator over how to resolve the shortfall in the BHS pension fund. Last month its chief executive, Lesley Titcomb, told MPs that Green\u2019s assets, including his \u00a3100m superyacht, could be seized by the courts if he refuses to comply with a legal demand to cover the \u00a3571m deficit. Titcomb told the work and pensions select committee a court would determine how to raise funds from the billionaire tycoon, including possible seizure of assets, if he does not pay up when a legal demand is issued, or reach a settlement with the regulator.",

The Whitechapel Bell Foundry began life in 1570 during the reign of Elizabeth I. It moved to its site on Whitechapel Road in 1739 and has traded from the building since. The Guinness Book of Records lists the foundry, one of only two left in the UK, as Britain\u2019s oldest manufacturer \u2013 having traded continuously for 446 years. The foundry has been owned by the Hughes family since 1904. Alan Hughes and his wife Kathryn have sold the grade II-listed building on Whitechapel Road and are considering options for when the foundry leaves in May 2017. Alan Hughes said: \u201cWe have made this decision with a heavy heart, but in response to the changing realities of running a business of this kind. The business has been at its present site over 250 years so it is probably about time it moved once again. We hope that this move will provide an opportunity for the business to move forward in a new direction.\u201d Property prices in Whitechapel have soared in recent years because the area, once infamous for the Jack the Ripper murders, is close to the capital\u2019s financial district and is a favourite spot for growing technology companies. The foundry\u2019s owners are considering a sale that could keep it operating from new premises. In 1752, the foundry cast the Liberty Bell for the city of Philadelphia, which became a symbol of US independence. In 1856, it made Big Ben, although the bell cracked while being tested and was recast in 1858. More recently, the Whitechapel team designed the bell used at the start of the 2012 London Olympics but the 23-tonne structure was too big for its furnaces and was cast in the Netherlands. The foundry cast the bells used on the lead barge for the Queen\u2019s Jubilee pageant on the Thames, also in 2012. Specialist sales \u2013 largely church bells and musical handbells \u2013 have formed the bulk of recent business and the foundry launched an online store selling handbells and doorbells to consumers three years ago.",

      "bodyText": "The world is getting smaller. That is the unbidden meme of our generation, thanks to the juggernaut of growth unleashed by an outpouring of global bodies, free trade agreements, technology and international capital. Every business and person now has a global reach and audience. Today\u2019s paradigm is globalisation and free trade is its evangelical mantra. But this narrative has become worn and no longer fits the facts. In recent months, there has been a backlash, accompanied by emotive talk about the reversal of globalisation and the battle for society\u2019s future. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development used its latest health check on the global economy to warn of the costs of protectionism. The hand-wringing is half a decade too late, because globalisation is already dead and we are already some miles into the journey back. Donald Trump and Theresa May are not flagbearers in the distance, they are catapults battering at the walls. Trump\u2019s stated intent to pull the US out of the TPP on his first day in office underlines the new reality we inhabit, as does the European Union\u2019s recent troubles closing a trade agreement with Canada thanks to Wallonia\u2019s obstinance. Today, we have a new meme \u2013 deglobalisation \u2013 as people turn their backs on an interconnected world economy and societies turn iconoclastic. It is not for the first time. Globalisation may be defined as when trade across nations is growing faster than GDP. People interact more, transact more and create more wealth. Deglobalisation is the alternate state where trade grows less than GDP. Countries focus inwards, trade declines as a proportion of GDP and growth shrinks. A clear cycle of the two emerges over history. Proto-globalisation (1820-1870): Rapid global trade growth, thanks to the Industrial Revolution and the spread of European colonial rule Globalisation 1.0 (1870-1913): Empire building became the norm. Rapid advancements in transport and communications grew trade. But rapid change also meant volatile bouts of economic obsolescence and crisis Deglobalisation 1.0 (1913-1950): Limited growth, unequal outcomes and a huge debt overhang from previous decades stoked economic nationalism and protectionism. Trade fell and a collective failure to tackle deeper structural issues led to the 1930s Globalisation 2.0 (1950-2010): Since then, we have been on a tearaway expansion with unparalleled growth of both global trade and GDP Deglobalisation 2.0 (2010-?): The last financial crisis focused policymaker attention inwards and crystallised the growing sense of social disenfranchisement. A toxic mix of suppressed wages, rocketing debt and political myopia have largely destroyed the allure of globalisation. This is more than a sense of ennui. Global trade today is not slowing down but has plateaued \u2013 hardly a barometer of rude global health. After their peak in January 2015, global exports fell -1.6% by the end of August 2016. The blame lies not with commodity price falls, but shifts in trade policy. Protectionism is en vogue. Restrictive trade measures have outstripped liberalising measures three to one this year and increased by almost five times since 2009, as policymakers try to circumvent the WTO. Meanwhile, the deleveraging of banking balance sheets over recent years has hit global lending, as banks retreat from peripheral to core domestic activities, cutting vital credit flows through key arteries. All of this preceded the populist deluge of 2016 and, indeed, contributed as policymakers myopically prioritised stability over social cohesion, ignoring the lessons of the past. But globally, politicians are now fast realigning to shifting public moods. A year ago, to imagine a world where the major western leaders included Trump, the Brexit brigade and Marine Le Pen was the province of satire. Today, we are two-thirds there. Their ascendancy has shifted the political debate towards nativism in a hauntingly familiar nationalist narrative, as others follow suit. Our new politics are not leftwing or rightwing, merely whether you are in this world or out of it. Even defenders of globalisation are falling into the same trap. By demonising those that voted against and not providing alternative options, they cling tighter to those that confirm and affirm their beliefs. That is still nativism of a different sort and still the politics of division, not unity. This is Deglobalisation 2.0. Monetary policies such as quantitative easing and its newborn sibling, fiscal easing, cannot change this dynamic. Absent structural change, their cumulative corrosive impact on savings and fillip to global debt ensure a limited runway and only inflame the rhetoric of disenfranchisement. Meanwhile, divorces are turning ugly as emotions override reason, viz the talk of Brexit fees and anti-dumping levies, the metaphorical Kristallnacht of populist victors like May and Trump as they struggle for coherence, and emerging divisions between central banks and politicians, to name but a few. Democracy is fast turning to kakistocracy \u2013 government by the least qualified leaders. Globalisation is transmuting to nationalism. The effects are well documented in history \u2013 autarky, economic naivety, protectionism and a rush to grab what remains of the pie, only to trample it underfoot. Me first always ends in me last. The world is still getting smaller, but just in our minds and horizons now, and thoughtless we risk becoming all the poorer for it. Bob Swarup is the author of Money Mania",

      "bodyText": "With this, we are closing the blog. Thank you for all your comments and have a great weekend. We will be back on Monday. European stock markets are still trading lower. FTSE 100 index down 0.7% at 6706.72, a fall of nearly 100 points Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.7% at 10,460.76 France\u2019s CAC down 1.16% at 4507.55 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.76% at 8602.90 Itay\u2019s FTSE Mib down 0.57% at 16,999.99 Brent crude oil has reversed earlier declines and risen above $54. It is now trading at $54.04 a barrel, up 0.1% on the day. And over in Greece, scores of disabled protestors have been taking to the streets as the governing coalition rushes to complete reforms ahead of Monday\u2019s crucial meeting of euro zone finance ministers. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: Once again the eurozone\u2019s weakest link is in a race-against-the clock to complete reforms demanded by creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. Hopes had been high that passage of the \u2018prior actions\u201d \u2013 contingent for the conclusion of a second review of the bailed out Greek economy \u2013 would have been concluded in time for Monday\u2019s meeting, the last gathering of euro zone finance ministers this year. For prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government, December 5th has been marked as the date debt relief talks could finally start. Instead, the leftist-led coalition has been faced with the daunting task of endorsing yet more austerity, the price of participation of the International Monetary Fund in Greece\u2019s third, 86 bn euro rescue programme. Today\u2019s protestors, rallying outside the prime ministers offices, are among the thousands who will be hit by cuts expected to apply as of the New Year. But in a move interpreted as an olive branch, the German finance ministry announced today that the euro group would also discuss possible short-term debt measures for Greece at Monday\u2019s meeting. The IMF has long said that euro zone countries must give Greece \u201cupfront, unconditional\u201d debt relief to make it debt burden sustainable and allow the Washington-based organisation to take part in its bailout programme. At over 300 bn euro or 180 percent of GDP, Athens has by far the highest debt load in the EU. The IMF would consider 120 percent to be manageable. And Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: With a December hike in the Fed Funds rate fully priced into markets, the latest set of payrolls would have to have been extremely weak to impact expectations. We expect the Fed to hike rates on December 14th and the market will move on to speculating on the timing and direction of the next move. With rising treasury yields impacting mortgage rates, other central banks still easing policy, and uncertainty over the scale and timing of any Trumpflation stimulus, we expect the Fed to remain cautious with the pace of rate hikes next year.\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: The decline in the unemployment rate to a new cyclical low of 4.6% last month, from 4.9% was due to a combination of a 160,000 increase in the household survey measure of employment together with a 226,000 decline in the labour force. The number of involuntary part-time workers fell by 220,000. As a result, the U6 unemployment dropped to an eight-year low of 9.3%, from 9.5%. The upshot is that the labour market appears to be approaching full employment. That said, the 0.1% m/m decline in average hourly earnings, which pushed the annual growth rate back down to 2.5%, from 2.8%, suggests that there is still a little slack left for the Fed to play with. A December rate hike is coming and, assuming that we see a major fiscal stimulus passed in the first half of next year, we expect an additional 100 basis points of tightening from the Fed next year, taking the fed funds target range to between 1.50% and 1.75% by end-2017.\u201d Returning to the US economy, Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, has a slightly different take on the labour market data. A rate hike in December is unlikely to be derailed from the afternoon\u2019s jobs report, but a poor wages number does give Janet Yellen food for thought. The headline figure of 178k was solid - along with a significant decrease in the Unemployment rate to 4.6% - but the premise of extra fiscal stimulus in a Trump era and letting wages naturally increase as the Fed have reiterated, could leave Yellen pondering future hikes if wages stutter. We are still likely to see a 0.25 hike this month, but the speed of next year\u2019s recovery could be impacted if wages and participation rates continue to cause a headache. With risk appetite bullish from the OPEC agreement this week, the greenback could likely see some short-term weakness against the majors, with the notable exception of the risk associated this weekend with the Italian Referendum.\u201d Meanwhile, my colleague Katie Allen writes: The Bank of England should be wary of rushing into interest rate rises to curb inflation, according to its chief economist, in a warning that the UK economy is vulnerable to a sharper slowdown next year than current forecasts would suggest. Andy Haldane said he was comfortable with the Bank\u2019s current wait-and-see stance on borrowing costs as it weighs up the conflicting forces of a lower pound stoking inflation and the Brexit vote denting business confidence. Here is an interesting point Here is some instant reaction to the US jobs data. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: Today\u2019s positive US job figures, coming on the back of good economic numbers across the board, will further increase the odds of a rate rise at the next Fed meeting in mid-December. The healthy labour market mirrors the momentum we\u2019ve seen in the economy since the summer, which has enjoyed strong PMI figures in both services and manufacturing. However, crucially, the participation rate has not risen, which may take some of the shine off these figures for the Fed. With the US presidential election suspense now behind us, it is Yellen\u2019s rhetoric which will be of most interest to investors as they look ahead at what to expect in the new Trump era next year. If as expected, we see a swing towards fiscal stimulus, this may give the Fed greater scope to hike rates further in 2017. Fed decision making will no longer be solely data dependent, but policy dependent also.\u201d Looking at a breakdown by sector, manufacturing jobs fell by 4,000 last month, the fourth monthly decline. Construction rose by 19,000 jobs following a 14,000 gain in October, and retail jobs fell for the second month in a row, by 8,300. As the US economy approaches full employment, monthly job gains have slowed from an average of 229,000 in 2015 to an average of 180,000 this year. The 178,000 increase in new jobs was slightly better than expected. Economists had pencilled in 175,000 jobs and an unchanged jobless rate of 4.9%. However, wage growth has slowed. Average hourly earnings fell 3 cents, or 0.1%, after rising 0.4% in October. This lowered the year-on-year growth rate to 2.5% in November from 2.8% in October, which was the biggest increase in nearly 7 1/2 years. The jobless rate hit 4.6%, the lowest in more than nine years, making it a near certainty that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting on 14 December. The jobs report comes after a run of strong economic data. Breaking news: nonfarm payrolls show 178,000 new jobs were created in the US economy last month, compared with 142,000 in October (revised lower from 161,000). My colleague Sean Farrell has found out more. The owners have sold the property in Whitechapel to an undisclosed buyer, will leave in May 2017 and are in talks about what will happen to the business. It looks like it could be sold \u2013 so it is likely to continue as a business. Britain\u2019s oldest bell foundry which made Big Ben and the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, is closing. Whitechapel Bell Foundry, which traces itself back to Elizabethan times and says it is the UK\u2019s oldest manufacturing company, said the decision was \u201cin response to the changing realities of running a business of this kind\u201d. The firm was set up in 1570 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and is one of two remaining bell foundries in the UK. It has changed ownership several times and moved sites. The foundry says it is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the UK\u2019s oldest manufacturing company in continuous operation. Owners Alan and Kathryn Hughes said, according to the Daily Telegraph: We have made this decision with a heavy heart, but in response to the changing realities of running a business of this kind. The Bell Foundry in Whitechapel has changed hands many times, but it has always been a family business. My own family has owned the foundry since 1904, but other families have run the firm through its history, which stretches back to 1570.\u201d A statement posted on the firm\u2019s website suggests that perhaps the company will reopen somewhere else. Whitechapel Bell Foundry Ltd announces, with regret, that by May 2017 it will cease its activities at the Whitechapel Road site that it has occupied since its move there in 1738. The company intends to complete work on all projects presently in hand during the coming months. It will not be entering into new contracts for the time being whilst discussions with the company\u2019s staff and other interested parties regarding the future direction, ownership, and location of the company are ongoing.\u201d The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, has dipped before the US jobs data. The dollar index has slipped 0.1% to 100.92 and is down 0.6% this week \u2013 its first weekly fall in a month. The US currency is also on course for its first weekly decline in four weeks against the euro. The head of watchdog Ofcom has said that British regulators should be given wider powers to block mergers following the Brexit vote \u2013 in particular if a company is strategically important. In a speech to the Institute for Government, Sharon White said Britain should use the opportunity provided by the referendum to beef up the capacities of its regulators. We have the opportunity to introduce a wider set of considerations in merger decisions, including policy or public-interest concerns where a company is deemed to have particular strategic significance for the UK.\u201d But she added this should not lead to \u201cregulatory creep\u201d or \u201cnew powers for the sake of it\u201d. She also called for the introduction of new protections for consumers. The US non-farm payrolls report is expected to show steady job growth, with a small pick-up to 175,000 new jobs forecast for November, from 161,000 in October. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, has looked at the markets: More losses for stock markets indicate the nervousness that is taking hold ahead of the Italian referendum. The slow pullback in US markets is also an indication that we are in the traditionally weak period of early December. Berkeley Group\u2019s numbers this morning gained the approval of shareholders, with the shares moving higher in early trading. Housebuilders remain one of the more interesting dynamics, with valuations still remarkably low, even if concerns remain about potential drop offs in demand. Non-farm payrolls are not expected to disrupt the steady procession towards a Fed rate hike in December, although wage growth is still not as strong as the Fed would like. We also have the Baker Hughes rig count at the end of the day, at a time when most London traders will either be well on their way home or in the pub. Still, it will be a number worth watching as questions remain over how US producers will act in the wake of the OPEC cut.\u201d Time for a morning round-up. Key US jobs data are out at 1.30pm. Non-farm payrolls are expected to show 175,000 new jobs were created in November, up from 161,000 in October. European stocks are falling ahead of this weekend\u2019s Italian constitutional referendum and Austrian presidential election. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell as much as 1.2% and is now 1.1% lower at 337. Wall Street has fared better, where US stocks have hit record highs buoyed by expectations of fiscal stimulus by president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration. City of London Markets trader Markus Huber said: Many are of the opinion that traders will continue to favour US over European stocks.\u201d Brent crude oil has been slipping all morning, and is now down 1% at $53.36 a barrel. It has eased from the one-year high hit yesterday following the Opec oil cartel\u2019s agreement to cut production on Wednesday, the first such deal in eight years. The UK construction sector has strengthened, but firms\u2019 costs have also picked up on the back of the weaker pound, hitting a 5 1/2 year high. Here is our full take on the pick-up in UK construction activity. In other news today, train fares in the UK will go up by an average of 2.3% next year, the rail industry has announced. This was quickly condemned as \u201canother kick in the teeth for British passengers\u201d by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. The union said travellers already pay some of the highest fares in Europe to \u201ctravel on rammed out and unreliable trains\u201d. You can read the full story here. Returning to the UK\u2019s construction figures, here\u2019s some reaction. Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank commercial banking, said: As this survey shows, many construction firms, and particularly those at the top end of the supply chain, retain a cautiously optimistic outlook. Their mood has been helped by what was widely seen as a construction-friendly Autumn Statement, which included a new commitment from the chancellor to spend an increased proportion of GDP on infrastructure. This appears to amount to a Keynesian-style recognition that investment in infrastructure can itself help to stimulate the economy. On the flip side there remains some concern about the London market, which is seen as particularly exposed to a post-EU referendum slowdown. Our own research* shows that business confidence across the UK dropped slightly in November after a relatively high reading in October.\u201d Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at credit insurance firm Euler Hermes, said: Performance across the construction sector is clearly polarising as housebuilders report healthy profits and a number of high-profile contractors bring in the administrators. We expect the number of insolvencies in the sector to climb through next year. Low margin contracts continue to put serious pressure on company cash flows, with businesses unable to pass on further rises in input costs resulting from inflation. Pressure on cashflow will inevitably impact firms\u2019 ability to pay on time throughout the supply chain and construction companies will need to be extra careful when managing their credit books. The Autumn Statement provided some welcome news on both housing and infrastructure, but the industry needs clarity quickly on whether all of this is new money or just a repackaging of previous announcements.\u201d Producer prices in the eurozone have jumped to their highest in more than four years in October as energy prices increased. The European Union\u2019s statistics office said prices at the factory gate in the 19-member currency bloc climbed 0.8% in October, much more than expected. Compared with a year earlier, prices fell 0.4%. The figures will be welcomed by the European Central Bank in its battle against ultra-low inflation. Consumer price inflation has picked up recently and hit a 31-month high of 0.6% in November. But it\u2019s still far below the ECB\u2019s 2% target. Capital Economics have sent us their thoughts on the Swiss GDP numbers. Stephen Brown, European economist at the consultancy, said: The stagnation of Swiss GDP in Q3 demonstrates the negative impact that deflation and the strong franc have had on the economy. With a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone set to keep the franc strong, exporters are unlikely to get a respite soon... It was the weakest quarter for growth since Q2 2015 and a sharp slowdown from the 0.6% rise recorded in Q2. After stagnating in Q2, consumer spending growth eked out an expansion of 0.1% in Q3. Nevertheless, consumer spending growth has clearly been weak in recent quarters, possibly as a result of consumers responding to Switzerland\u2019s deflationary environment by delaying purchases. More encouragingly, investment rebounded by 0.5%. Meanwhile, government consumption edged down slightly, by 0.1%. In addition to the current strong level of the franc, next year exporters will also have to contend with a slowdown in growth and a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone, Switzerland\u2019s main trading partner. If just one of those risks were to materialise, it could act as a double-whammy for Switzerland by both exacerbating the euro-zone\u2019s economic slowdown and by prompting a renewed appreciation of the franc due to the currency\u2019s safe-haven status. In all, then, we expect Swiss GDP growth to slow from about 1.5% this year to 1% in both 2017 and 2018.\u201d Italian 10-year bond yields are heading for their biggest weekly fall since July, amid referendum jitters. Construction was better than expected. Housebuilding remained the best performer, even though its expansion slipped to a three-month low. Commercial activity bounced back after five months of decline, while civil engineering remained the weakest area. Overall, incoming new construction work was the strongest since March, after declining through the summer in the wake of the EU referendum. Some construction firms noted that their workloads had been boosted by a resumption of projects that were delayed after the Brexit vote. However, there were also reports that the stronger inflation backdrop had led to intense competitive pressures and squeezed margins. The bounceback in the UK\u2019s construction industry has continued in November, with the sector expanding at the fastest rate since March, according to a survey. Commercial work picked up for the first time in six months. However, cost inflation also picked up and is now the strongest for 5 1/2 years. The purchasing managers\u2019 index from Markit/CIPS rose to 52.8 in November from 52.6 in October. Also on Sunday, Austria holds a presidential election that could see Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party become the first far-right head of state elected in western Europe since World War II. In Italy, prime minister Matteo Renzi has said he will stand down if voters reject a constitutional reform. But this does not necessarily mean fresh elections. Italian president Sergio Mattarella could ask Renzi to stay, ask another centre-leftist politician to form a new government or try to persuade Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s centre-right party to join or support a caretaker government, as Reuters reports. Jaisal Pstakia, investment manager at Heartwood Investment Management, says: In all probability the Italian electorate is likely to reject Prime Minister Renzi\u2019s proposals for constitutional reform. Essentially, Renzi wants to reduce the power of the Senate - the upper chamber of parliament, allowing for smoother implementation of legislation and potentially a more stable political system. However, the referendum has turned into a vote on Renzi himself, whose popularity has taken a sharp dip since his election in September 2014. We expect the political fallout to be contained. Even if Renzi resigns, recent history suggests that there is more probability of a technocrat government being installed. If a general election were to happen, the likelihood is that it would result in a fragmented coalition government that would find it difficult to pass legislation, owing to the very parliamentary system that Renzi is trying to reform.\u201d But there would be a negative impact on the already struggling economy. A \u2018no\u2019 vote will reduce hopes of advancing the structural reform agenda, resulting in weaker growth for an already struggling economy. Italy\u2019s growth rate in 2016 has been one of the weakest among its euro peers, weighed down by high unemployment rates and a stalling credit cycle. Loan growth has fallen back into negative territory and demand is expected to be further constrained by tighter credit standards for both mortgages and corporates.\u201d European stocks are falling as investors nervously await this weekend\u2019s Italian constitutional referendum. Commodity stocks are among the biggest fallers, with oil prices sliding today, and financial shares are also down. Europe\u2019s pan-European Stoxx 600 index is down 1.2%, the lowest in more than three weeks. Simon Smith, chief economist at FX Pro, said: We have the Italian constitutional referendum over the weekend. This has the potential to induce some volatility in the early part of next week. There are still a lot of undecided voters, so although the no side is ahead, the result is not a given. And even if this does come to fruition, a rejection of the reforms would lead to political instability in Italy and quite possibly to early elections.\u201d We are going to spend less on Christmas this year, PricewaterhouseCoopers reckons. Its survey shows the average UK adult expects to spend around \u00a3280 on gifts. It\u2019s the first time the consultancy firm has done this survey, but it says other reports suggest spending was around \u00a3300-\u00a3400 last year, so this would indicate a dip in Christmas spending. Around 4% of people said they wouldn\u2019t buy any presents. A quarter expect the effects of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union to have an impact on how much they spend this Christmas. However, the majority (67%) expect no impact at all. More than half (53) said they would make their purchases online this Christmas, compared to 43% in store. In the UK, Berkeley Group, which builds luxury homes in London and the south east, has taken a hit from Brexit uncertainty and rising stamp duty. But the company still made a pretax profit of \u00a3392.7m in the six months to October, up 34% from a year earlier. It sold fewer homes but at a higher price \u2013 the average selling price rose to \u00a3655,000 from \u00a3506,000 last year. However, chief executive Rob Perrins said reservations had fallen 20% in the housebuilder\u2019s first half, similar to guidance given in June. This fall in volume is due to higher stamp duty, the extraordinary attack on buy-to-let landlords \u2013 such an important part of sustaining the London market and increasing the supply of new homes \u2013 and the uncertainty caused by Brexit.\u201d You can read the full story here. Meanwhile, the Finnish economy expanded 0.4% in the third quarter. The country\u2019s statistics office revised down an earlier estimate of 0.5%. GDP rose 1.6% from a year earlier. Finland\u2019s economy is slowly recovering following years of stagnation caused by the decline of Nokia\u2019s former phone business and the impact of the recession in neighbouring Russia. The Swiss economy has stalled: Swiss GDP figures came out earlier this morning, and showed the economy was flat in the third quarter compared to the second. It grew by 1.3% year-on-year. The figures were worse than expected and the weakest in more than a year, as Switzerland\u2019s export-led economy struggled with the strong franc. Economists had pencilled in 0.3% growth. The Swiss National Bank ditched a cap on the franc\u2019s value against the euro almost two years ago. European stocks have opened lower, as expected. FTSE 100 index in London down more than 50 points at 6701.22, 0.77% fall Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.9% France\u2019s CAC down 0.7% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.6% Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib down 0.6% Portugal\u2019s PSI20 down 0.4% It emerged earlier this week that the UK\u2019s new plastic \u00a35 note contains animal fat, which caused a storm on Twitter and the launch of a petition on behalf of vegans, vegetarians and some religious groups. It has been signed by more than 121,000 people. A day later, the Bank of England bowed to the pressure and issued a statement saying that it had asked its polymer supplier, Innovia, to find an alternative. The central bank said that \u201can extremely small amount of tallow is used in an early stage of the production process of polymer pellets, which are then used to create the base substrate for the five pound note\u201d. The Australian pioneer of the polymer bank note has now waded into the row, saying it\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d that vegetarian and vegans are protesting in the UK about the five pound polymer note containing tallow. Professor David Solomon told the Australian radio station 2GB: It\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s absolutely stupid. There\u2019s trivial amounts of it in there.\u201d Solomon said polymer notes were extremely hard to forge and had a lot more benefits for the consumer than previous paper notes. It picks up less drugs than paper notes and you don\u2019t chop down trees. It\u2019s more hygienic than a paper note by a long way.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s US non-farm payrolls day, always a big event for the US dollar. Analysts are forecasting that 175,000 jobs were created in November, up from 161,000 in October. The Federal Reserve is already widely expected to raise interest rates in December as recent economic data have mostly been strong. Yesterday surveys showed manufacturing grew faster than expected in November. Here in the UK, we will get a monthly industry survey on construction at 9:30am GMT. Oil is drifting lower this morning, after hitting a one-year high following the Saudi-led Opec cartel\u2019s announcement to cut output on Wednesday \u2013 the first such agreement in eight years. Russia, the biggest non-Opec oil producer, also agreed to reduce its output gradually. Brent crude is trading at $53.37, down 1%. European stocks are expected to open lower.",

Hopes had been high that passage of the \u2018prior actions\u201d \u2013 contingent for the conclusion of a second review of the bailed out Greek economy \u2013 would have been concluded in time for Monday\u2019s meeting, the last gathering of euro zone finance ministers this year. For prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government, December 5<sup>th</sup> has been marked as the date debt relief talks could finally start.</p> <p>Instead, the leftist-led coalition has been faced with the daunting task of endorsing yet more austerity, the price of participation of the International Monetary Fund in Greece\u2019s third, 86 bn euro rescue programme. Today\u2019s protestors, rallying outside the prime ministers offices, are among the thousands who will be hit by cuts expected to apply as of the New Year.</p> <p>But in a move interpreted as an olive branch, the German finance ministry announced today that the euro group would also discuss possible short-term debt measures for Greece at Monday\u2019s meeting. The IMF has long said that euro zone countries must give Greece \u201cupfront, unconditional\u201d debt relief to make it debt burden sustainable and allow the Washington-based organisation to take part in its bailout programme. At over 300 bn euro or 180 percent of GDP, Athens has by far the highest debt load in the EU. The IMF would consider 120 percent to be manageable. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5841832ce4b015a427f76bf3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-02T14:21:08.379Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a December hike in the Fed Funds rate fully priced into markets, the latest set of payrolls would have to have been extremely weak to impact expectations. </p> <p>We expect the Fed to hike rates on December 14<sup>th</sup> and the market will move on to speculating on the timing and direction of the next move.

It was the weakest quarter for growth since Q2 2015 and a sharp slowdown from the 0.6% rise recorded in Q2.</p> <p>After stagnating in Q2, consumer spending growth eked out an expansion of 0.1% in Q3. Nevertheless, consumer spending growth has clearly been weak in recent quarters, possibly as a result of consumers responding to Switzerland\u2019s deflationary environment by delaying purchases. More encouragingly, investment rebounded by 0.5%. Meanwhile, government consumption edged down slightly, by 0.1%.</p> <p>In addition to the current strong level of the franc, next year exporters will also have to contend with a slowdown in growth and a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone, Switzerland\u2019s main trading partner. If just one of those risks were to materialise, it could act as a double-whammy for Switzerland by both exacerbating the euro-zone\u2019s economic slowdown and by prompting a renewed appreciation of the franc due to the currency\u2019s safe-haven status. In all, then, we expect Swiss GDP growth to slow from about 1.5% this year to 1% in both 2017 and 2018.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2a716706e3cb0dbe6262507dc6df1fd73069dd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2a716706e3cb0dbe6262507dc6df1fd73069dd7/0_242_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Switzerland mountain railway, Glacier Express route between Andermatt and Oberalp Pass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Switzerland mountain railway, Glacier Express route between Andermatt and Oberalp Pass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: rusm/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58414398e4b015a427f76a69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-02T09:49:58.127Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italian 10-year bond yields are heading for their biggest weekly fall since July, amid referendum jitters.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584141cce4b015a427f76a62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-02T09:48:33.231Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Construction was better than expected.

Even if Renzi resigns, recent history suggests that there is more probability of a technocrat government being installed. If a general election were to happen, the likelihood is that it would result in a fragmented coalition government that would find it difficult to pass legislation, owing to the very parliamentary system that Renzi is trying to reform.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But there would be a negative impact on the already struggling economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A \u2018no\u2019 vote will reduce hopes of advancing the structural reform agenda, resulting in weaker growth for an already struggling economy.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England should be wary of rushing into interest rate rises to curb inflation, according to its chief economist, in a warning that the UK economy is vulnerable to a sharper slowdown next year than forecasts would suggest. Andy Haldane said he was comfortable with the Bank\u2019s current wait-and-see stance on borrowing costs as it weighs up the conflicting forces of a lower pound stoking inflation and the Brexit vote denting business confidence. In a bid to shore up confidence after the referendum, the Bank cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in August and expanded its programme of electronic money-printing, known as quantitative easing (QE). It had hinted at another interest rate cut before the end of the year but a flurry of brighter than expected economic news forced the Bank to row back on that guidance. Haldane said on Friday that economic output had outperformed the expectations of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) back in August while inflation had picked up, largely as a result of the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum, which makes imports to the UK more expensive. \u201cThat configuration now leaves me comfortable with the current stance of monetary policy, with no bias on the direction of the next move in interest rates,\u201d he said. In a speech to the Materials Processing Institute in the North Yorkshire town of Redcar, Haldane said GDP growth, which came in at 0.5% in the three months following the referendum, was stronger than forecast by the Bank and others. \u201cThis is welcome news. The main source of this upside news to activity has been the buoyancy of consumers. They appear to have kept calm and carried on spending on the high street, in the car showrooms and in the estate agents,\u201d he said. However, he joined other economists in warning that the rise in import costs could be passed on to consumers and that they would curb their spending as a result. The Bank is forecasting GDP growth will slow to 1.4% next year from 2.2% this year but Haldane said that could prove over-optimistic. \u201cI think there is still a material chance that growth could underperform relative to expectations during the course of next year \u2013 for example, if the squeeze on household incomes prompts a larger adjustment in household spending. In that event, the upside pressures on inflation would be weaker than expected,\u201d he said. If inflationary pressures were lower then the effectiveness of low interest rates in boosting the economy could suffer, he added. \u201cMy personal view is that this provides grounds for not proceeding too hastily with any tightening of the monetary policy stance,\u201d Haldane said. Following Chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s focus on the UK\u2019s urgent need to improve its productivity in last week\u2019s autumn statement, Haldane used his speech to explore regional disparities in productivity levels. He said monetary policy, as set by the Bank, had little influence on productivity. But the government\u2019s industrial strategy could improve output per hour worked. Haldane joined other policymakers on the MPC in defending the Bank\u2019s measures to shore up the economy in the wake of the global financial crisis after prime minister Theresa May\u2019s remarks earlier this year that there had been \u201csome bad side-effects\u201d from low interest rates and QE. He echoed the deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, in arguing monetary policy could have little influence on how prosperity is shared out in an economy. \u201cAt least over the longer run, it is reasonably clear that monetary policy is ill-equipped for the task of either expanding the economic pie or altering the way it is sliced,\u201d Haldane said. He also put forward Bank estimates for how the economy would have performed in the absence of QE and the Bank\u2019s deep interest cuts from 5% to 0.5% between September 2008 and March 2009. \u201cWithout the support of looser monetary policy, all regions would then have experienced a contraction in real GDP per head since 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cThe picture is similar if we turn to unemployment. In the absence of a monetary policy easing, unemployment would have risen further after the crisis in every region in the UK, by an additional four percentage points. Around an extra 1.5 million people would have found themselves out of work.\u201d On the question of how the Bank\u2019s policies had affected regional disparities in the UK economy, he found limited evidence of any damage. \u201cThe regional distribution of incomes does not appear to have changed materially during the period of monetary loosening. The same is true of unemployment rates. There is some evidence of the higher-wealth regions benefiting more than the lower-wealth regions over the period since the crisis,\u201d Haldane said.",

      "body": "<p>The Bank of England should be wary of rushing into interest rate rises to curb inflation, according to its chief economist, in a warning that the UK economy is vulnerable to a sharper slowdown next year than forecasts would suggest.</p> <p>Andy Haldane said he was comfortable with the Bank\u2019s current wait-and-see stance on borrowing costs as it weighs up the conflicting forces of a lower pound stoking inflation and the Brexit vote denting business confidence.</p> <p>In a bid to shore up confidence after the referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">the Bank cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in August</a> and expanded its programme of electronic money-printing, known as quantitative easing (QE). It had hinted at another interest rate cut before the end of the year but a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2016/nov/22/how-has-the-brexit-vote-affected-the-economy-november-verdict\">flurry of brighter than expected economic news</a> forced the Bank to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">row back on that guidance</a>.<br></p> <p>Haldane said on Friday that economic output had outperformed the expectations of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) back in August while inflation had picked up, largely as a result of the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum, which makes imports to the UK more expensive. </p> <p>\u201cThat configuration now leaves me comfortable with the current stance of monetary policy, with no bias on the direction of the next move in interest rates,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/945.aspx\">In a speech</a> to the Materials Processing Institute in the North Yorkshire town of Redcar, Haldane said GDP growth, which came in at 0.5% in the three months following the referendum, was stronger than forecast by the Bank and others. </p> <p>\u201cThis is welcome news. The main source of this upside news to activity has been the buoyancy of consumers. They appear to have kept calm and carried on spending on the high street, in the car showrooms and in the estate agents,\u201d he said.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3175b077f04a2db0270840c237950618477e7b3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3175b077f04a2db0270840c237950618477e7b3f/223_431_3974_2387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, he joined other economists in warning that the rise in import costs could be passed on to consumers and that they would curb their spending as a result. The Bank is forecasting GDP growth will slow to 1.4% next year from 2.2% this year but Haldane said that could prove over-optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cI think there is still a material chance that growth could underperform relative to expectations during the course of next year \u2013 for example, if the squeeze on household incomes prompts a larger adjustment in household spending. In that event, the upside pressures on inflation would be weaker than expected,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If inflationary pressures were lower then the effectiveness of low interest rates in boosting the economy could suffer, he added. </p> <p>\u201cMy personal view is that this provides grounds for not proceeding too hastily with any tightening of the monetary policy stance,\u201d Haldane said.<br></p> <p>Following Chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/philip-hammonds-autumn-statement-welcome-reality-check-brexit\">Philip Hammond\u2019s focus on the UK\u2019s urgent need to improve its productivity</a> in last week\u2019s autumn statement, Haldane used his speech to explore regional disparities in productivity levels. He said monetary policy, as set by the Bank, had little influence on productivity. But the government\u2019s industrial strategy could improve output per hour worked.</p> <p>Haldane joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/18/low-interest-rates-inequality-bank-of-england-ben-broadbent\">other policymakers on the MPC in defending the Bank\u2019s measures</a> to shore up the economy in the wake of the global financial crisis after prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">Theresa May\u2019s remarks earlier this year</a> that there had been \u201csome bad side-effects\u201d from low interest rates and QE.</p> <p>He echoed the deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, in arguing monetary policy could have little influence on how prosperity is shared out in an economy.</p> <p>\u201cAt least over the longer run, it is reasonably clear that monetary policy is ill-equipped for the task of either expanding the economic pie or altering the way it is sliced,\u201d Haldane said.<br></p> <p>He also put forward Bank estimates for how the economy would have performed in the absence of QE and the Bank\u2019s deep interest cuts from 5% to 0.5% between September 2008 and March 2009.</p> <p>\u201cWithout the support of looser monetary policy, all regions would then have experienced a contraction in real GDP per head since 2008,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe picture is similar if we turn to unemployment. In the absence of a monetary policy easing, unemployment would have risen further after the crisis in every region in the UK, by an additional four percentage points. Around an extra 1.5 million people would have found themselves out of work.\u201d</p> <p>On the question of how the Bank\u2019s policies had affected regional disparities in the UK economy, he found limited evidence of any damage.</p> <p>\u201cThe regional distribution of incomes does not appear to have changed materially during the period of monetary loosening. The same is true of unemployment rates. There is some evidence of the higher-wealth regions benefiting more than the lower-wealth regions over the period since the crisis,\u201d Haldane said.</p>",

The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s (CMA) inquiry will cover the 430,000 older people in care and nursing homes across the UK. It comes weeks after a bleak Care Quality Commission assessment warned that the quality and safety of social care received by elderly and disabled people in England are at risk, with care homes closing and providers pulling out because they can no longer make enough money. The CMA said its inquiry would examine reports of \u201cpotentially unfair practices and contract terms being used by some care homes\u201d and whether they breach consumer law. It said it would \u201cparticularly like to hear from care home residents and their relatives who have encountered issues such as unexplained or \u2018hidden\u2019 charges, unexpected fee increases, confusing requests for \u2018top-up\u2019 payments, or occasions when they feel that complaints have not been handled fairly\u201d. There are approximately 17,000 care homes in England, with the market worth about \u00a316bn a year. About 15% of over-85s live in care homes, with the number expected to rise substantially as the population ages. Research by Citizens Advice this year found one in 10 care homes give only a week\u2019s notice that fees are going to rise; a third of bill payers put down deposits without any protection scheme; and people often have to make decisions about moving a loved one into a home at very short notice, and are unable to properly plan. In one case highlighted by the Guardian in October, a nursing home in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, closed abruptly, leaving families desperately searching for alternative accommodation for their relatives. It is a story repeated across the country as cash-strapped care providers abandon struggling businesses. Costs for an average single room in a UK residential care home went through the \u00a330,000 per annum barrier this year, rising by 5.2% to \u00a330,926, more than double the average pensioner\u2019s income of \u00a314,456, according to the Prestige Nursing and Care nursing agency. The CMA market study will assess whether competition between care homes is driving quality and value for money for residents and taxpayers. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s acting chief executive, said: \u201cChoosing a care home can be emotional and costly. We are undertaking a thorough review of the sector to make sure it works in the best interests of those who rely on it. \u201cWe want to hear from care home providers about the services they offer and any challenges they face, as well as residents, families and charities who have experienced what it\u2019s like to choose and live in a care home. \u201cGiven the concerns we have heard about possible breaches of consumer law, we particularly want to hear from people who think they might have encountered unfair terms or practices.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British construction firms continued to rebound from their post-referendum soft patch last month but reported the steepest rise in prices for more than five years. In the latest sign that the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote is raising import costs for UK businesses, the poll of construction firms (pdf) showed they reported a \u201csteep and accelerated rise\u201d in what they were paying for building materials in November. That put the rate of inflation in the sector at the highest since April 2011, according to the survey\u2019s compilers IHS Markit. Overall, construction sector activity expanded for the third month running and at a faster pace than economists had forecast. The main reading on the Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) edged up to an eight-month high of 52.8 from 52.6 in October. That was above the 50 mark separating expansion from contraction and beat forecasts for 52.2 in the Reuters poll of economists. Order books also improved at the fastest pace for eight months and construction firms hired new workers to match the rising demand. Tim Moore, a senior economist at IHS Markit, said the sector had continued to recover from a slow third quarter. \u201cThe brighter picture reflected another solid contribution from residential building and renewed growth in commercial work, which some companies linked to a resumption of projects that had been delayed after the Brexit vote,\u201d he said.

Few would deny that a great deal of the credit goes to Witty. </p> <p>Two years into his tenure, with Big Pharma\u2019s reputation in the mire over the unaffordable cost of Aids drugs for people dying in Africa, Witty announced a major change of strategy. GSK would slash its prices in the poorest countries to no more than 25% of the UK price. It would also put any patents it owned over putative drugs that may have some effect on neglected tropical diseases into a \u201cpool\u201d, which would allow anybody to investigate them.</p> <p>There was, he recalls, \u201ca sharp intake of breath\u201d from his competitors on the day the patent pools were announced, \u201cbut within a couple of years, we had 15 or 16 companies that had signed up to the patent pool and we\u2019ve made huge progress.\u201d</p> <p>Later, he helped instigate a meeting of all the big company CEOs in London with Bill Gates to pledge to help end the neglected tropical diseases that affect millions in poor countries yet are unheard of in the west, such as leishmaniasis and trachoma. They donate drugs, pay for their distribution and continue to meet every year. </p> <p>\u201cYou think about the number of times you hear these meetings where everybody announces something and nothing happens,\u201d Witty says. \u201cAnd in this situation we\u2019re talking about billions of doses of medicine being delivered to tens and hundreds of millions of people. It\u2019s huge and as an industry we should be super, super proud of that.</p> <p>\u201cSo if we played a small role in catalysing that, if that\u2019s the only thing I did in my life, that\u2019s not a terrible thing.

GSK also said it intended to put new cancer drugs in a patent pool, as a response to the growing numbers dying of cancer in developing countries.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe will wait and see whether companies follow or not, but I think it raises the question for companies that may not have considered it and they have to address it,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d24684af6b1f7fef9dd9cb025a2e51e2d1d810d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d24684af6b1f7fef9dd9cb025a2e51e2d1d810d9/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"GlaxoSmithKline HQ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GlaxoSmithKline HQ in west London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week, for the fifth year running, GSK topped a league table compiled by the Access to Medicines Foundation, which scores the companies on a range of measures, from pricing and donation to research and development.</p> <p>Witty says ranking top in the index is important, but what matters more is that companies now care about it. \u201cOne day we won\u2019t be number one and I think that\u2019s fine because hopefully what we\u2019ve done in the period \u2026 is encourage other companies to compete and strive in a space which 10 years ago people probably weren\u2019t competing and striving in.\u201d</p> <p>GSK long ago took the view \u201cthat drug companies don\u2019t need to be just about innovation and return to shareholder\u201d.
