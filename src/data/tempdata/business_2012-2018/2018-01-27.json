      "bodyText": "The disconnect between the current strong employment growth and the weak growth in household incomes remains the biggest issue for the coming political year, and it has emerged as the greatest weakness to the government\u2019s economic argument. One of the more absurd suggestions that did the rounds when the Rudd government introduced the Fair Work Act was that the new laws were swinging the pendulum too far in favour of unions. The claim continued despite evidence to the contrary. In May 2012, the then BHP chairman Jac Nasser suggested that the review of the Fair Work Act would be \u201can opportunity to move the pendulum back to a more appropriate balance\u201d. A couple of months later, Tony Abbott said he wanted to \u201crestore the workplace relations pendulum to the sensible centre. That\u2019s where it always should be\u201d. Ahh ... the sensible centre \u2013 a position Malcolm Turnbull embraces as well. At the 2016 annual LNP conference in Queensland, while referring to the capacity of industrial disputes to act \u201cas a handbrake on economic growth\u201d, he urged Bill Shorten to \u201cmeet us in the sensible centre\u201d \u2013 a point that from Turnbull\u2019s point of view included the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisation Commission \u2013 two organisations implicitly established to curtail union power. This week, we saw evidence of just how hollow the suggestion is that somehow the pendulum has swung too much in favour of unions. The Fair Work Commission suspended the proposed 24-hour strike scheduled for Monday by Sydney and NSW train drivers because it was \u201cthreatening to endanger the welfare of part of the population\u201d and would \u201ccause significant damage to the Australian economy or an important part of it.\u201d The ability for the industrial umpire to ban a strike because of such reasons has long been a part of our industrial relations framework. But the margins for breaching such conditions are now so wide that, as the Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, said on Thursday, it means \u201cthe basic right to strike in Australia is very nearly dead\u201d. That is why we can expect a big fight on industrial relations this year. In December, a record percentage of Australians aged between 15 and 64 were employed, and the month had the most number of people working full-time for the past five years. But while such figures would previously lead to wages and household income growth, workers are still waiting for such rewards. Therein lies the problem for the government. You can talk of underemployment and the hangover from the past five years of poor employment growth and generally low inflation around the world, but the Australian government is doing nothing to improve the situation. Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, will talk of greater wages growth emerging once company profits improve via tax cuts, but such a link requires a system of industrial relations that allows workers to agitate for such wages, and one that also seeks to reduce underemployment rather than foster it. And despite the improved profitability of companies in 2017 and the strong rise in employment, we already have evidence that low wage growth will continue. The latest figures from the Department of Jobs and Small Business show that the average wage rise for enterprise agreements approved in the September quarter last year was a record low at 2.2%. Such a result is not surprising given the abuse of the enterprise bargaining system by companies seeking to terminate agreements during the bargaining process and forcing workers to negotiate with the award rate as the starting point rather than the pay and conditions previously agreed to. Companies know the current industrial relations system is in their favour, and they are more than happy with the current level of low wage growth. In the recently released Australian Industry Group 2018 Business Prospects report, rather than bemoaning the poor growth in wages, Australian CEOs actually championed it. The AIG expresses a desire for \u201cthe continuation of moderate wages growth\u201d (note that \u201cmoderate\u201d means record or near record low) and argues that \u201cthe record jobs growth of 2017 and the ability to meet expectations of still higher jobs growth in 2018 are closely associated with the moderate wages outcomes of recent years and require the continuation of this pattern into 2018\u201d. So you can have your strong employment growth only if you have record-low wages growth. And far from looking for higher wages, the report also noted that concerns about wages \u201care already spreading among Australia\u2019s CEOs\u201d. The disconnect between the current low level of wages growth and the employment situation has come about through decades of industrial relations policy, where the right to strike has been severely restrained and the unions are seen as having too much control. Regardless of its rhetoric, the government is more than happy for the disconnect to remain in place. Its policies foster an environment where workers\u2019 negotiating power is diminished and it tries to convince us that higher wages will come once companies can afford them \u2013 even as the companies tell us that what they really want is for the record low wage growth to continue. \u2013 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

Freedom of information requests reveal that the Foreign Office and the Department for International Trade have been championing the interests of British American Tobacco. This is despite the government being forced to draw up new guidelines for UK embassy staff after it emerged in 2012 that the UK ambassador had been lobbying the Panama government on behalf of BAT. The disclosures reveal that in the past four years FO and DIT staff met with British American Tobacco nine times to discuss a long-running tax dispute with the Bangladesh government. In Hungary, in March 2015, a UK government trade adviser was seconded \u201cfor a few days\u201d to BAT HQ in Budapest and subsequently to its office in P\u00e9cs. In December 2014 the then ambassador wrote to the Hungarian economy minister about the \u201cproposed health contribution concerns\u201d of BAT, a reference to a tax on tobacco companies based on their turnover, which BAT regards as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d. In April 2015 the then ambassador met the minister for foreign affairs \u201cand raised BAT\u2019s concerns about government tobacco policy impacting their further investment plans in Hungary, following BAT\u2019s request to him [in] March 2015\u201d. In Panama there were six meetings between BAT and embassy staff, including two BAT \u201creceptions\u201d. The international trade department also had 25 meetings involving BAT Venezuela, mostly via the board of the Venezuelan and British chambers of commerce. Three contacts were disclosed in Poland, one with the ambassador and two with the acting DIT director. The notes of one contact reveal that \u201cBAT \u2026 were specifically interested in organising a meeting with Polish government stakeholders dedicated to implementation of the Tobacco Directive\u201d and \u201cshaping the excise policy in relation to e-cigarettes. The company was keen to be involved in creating the regulatory framework which will allow for effective excise tax collection\u201d. And in Laos, the general manager of Lao Tobacco, which is owned by another British tobacco giant, Imperial, sits on the British Business Group and the European Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with which British embassy staff \u201chave regular contact\u201d. The released information raises questions about the government\u2019s approach to tobacco control. The UK has invested \u00a315m in funding the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control which promotes raising taxes on cigarettes in low- and middle-income countries that are now targeted by big tobacco because smoking rates are declining in developed states. \u201cBritain is a world leader in implementing tough and effective measures to regulate and control the tobacco industry, and as a result our smoking rates have plummeted,\u201d said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the health charity Ash (Action on Smoking and Health). \u201cThe government has publicly committed support to help poorer countries to follow our example. But behind the scenes our embassies are still helping UK-based tobacco manufacturers to promote their lethal business and to resist government regulation. \u201cThe word hypocrisy hardly does it justice. We are saving lives at home and promoting death abroad.\u201d The embassies\u2019 approach is consistent with a 2011 coalition government strategy that pushed for them to do more to promote UK business interests abroad. With Brexit opening up the possibility of new trade deals, health campaigners believe that embassy staff may come under pressure to do more to help promote the tobacco industry \u2013 which makes billions for the exchequer. However, a government spokesman said it took its obligations to protect public health policies in relation to tobacco very seriously. \u201cInteractions with the tobacco industry are only permitted where necessary, and we do not allow our staff to encourage investment in the tobacco industry, or provide any assistance in helping tobacco companies influence local business policies like taxation to their advantage.\u201d This article was amended on 29 January 2018 to clarify the source of a statement from the government.",

      "bodyText": "One of the biggest surprises about Rupert Murdoch\u2019s decision to sell his entertainment assets to Disney was his willingness to part company with Sky, the UK\u2019s biggest pay-TV broadcaster. But some analysts are now asking whether Disney, which has agreed to buy a 39% stake in Sky as part of a $66bn deal to buy most of the tycoon\u2019s 21st Century Fox group, needs the pay-TV arm either. This concern lingers in the background as the UK competition regulator mulls Fox\u2019s attempt to take full control of Sky \u2013 a deal that is still going ahead in parallel with the Disney transaction. Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn bid to buy Sky is still in doubt after the Competition and Markets Authority said the deal could be blocked because it would give his family too much influence over the UK news media. Meanwhile, analysts ponder whether this subplot in one of the decade\u2019s least-expected media deals will be much of a distraction for Disney, the giant theme park, film studio and TV network group. \u201cDisney wants Sky, but doesn\u2019t need it,\u201d said Brian Wieser of equity analysis group Pivotal Research. \u201cThere is a strategic value to Sky, but it would potentially be willing to sell at a certain price. There is a price for everything.\u201d Disney has already signalled to the UK\u2019s Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, the City watchdog for corporate deals, that if Fox\u2019s deal to buy the 61% of Sky it doesn\u2019t already own fails, it does not wish to be forced to pursue a full takeover. For Disney, a bigger distraction than Sky is the strategic quandary posed by new competitors from the tech industry. Given the rapid digitisation of the global media industry, Disney is increasingly focusing on the rising threats of Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Google. Disney\u2019s chief executive, Bob Iger, described Sky as a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d asset when the Fox transaction was announced in December. But he must consider whether Sky\u2019s platform is the best answer in the UK to the threat posed by the tech giants. Last week Netflix\u2019s stock market valuation surged past $100bn (Disney\u2019s is almost $170bn) for the first time after it revealed a record quarter of new subscribers, driving its global user base to 117 million. As the largest entertainment company in the world, Disney boldly decided to flex its muscles and cut out the digital middleman. It has removed its content from Netflix in the US and announced plans for two streaming services. One of these \u2013 for its ESPN sports network, which has rights to prime American leagues such as the NFL and NBA \u2013 will be launched later this year. In 2019, it will launch a second service for its vast film and TV catalogue, which spans the Marvel universe (the Avengers, Iron Man and Captain America series), the Star Wars franchise, Pixar films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, and traditional Disney productions such as Frozen and The Lion King. Disney is launching the venture in the US initially, but Iger, who has made it clear that Disney is looking to a future where viewers get content via the internet rather than cable and satellite TV, has indicated that it will become a global service. Sky is continuing to develop its own streaming service, Now TV, to take on Netflix and Amazon. But Disney has spent $1.5bn on technology to build its own facilities and may not need both. \u201cSky is mostly the old-guard, traditional TV,\u201d said Sarah Simon of research firm Berenberg. \u201cDisney may think it can create more value with its own direct-to-consumer platform than by holding a 39% stake in Sky. If you are in a streaming model, why do you need to own Sky? Now TV could become its streaming platform in the UK, but it\u2019s quite a big price to pay for a bit of [streaming] technology you already have.\u201d Disney, like other major Hollywood studios including Fox, also has an exclusive deal, which expires in 2020, for its films to run on Sky first. Buying Murdoch\u2019s 20th Century Fox, the fourth largest Hollywood studio, will add content including the X-Men films, Avatar, Titanic and Deadpool as well as TV shows such as The Simpsons. According to sources, Disney has been gearing up to pull its content from Netflix in the UK \u2013 its second-biggest market globally \u2013 in order to make its services a must-have. This strategy could also ultimately spell the end of Sky\u2019s exclusive movie deals with Disney and Fox, too. \u201cWith the additional content from the Fox deal, I think Disney will look to pull its content from Netflix in the UK,\u201d said Simon. \u201cIts new digital strategy is to go directly to consumers, but if you don\u2019t make content exclusive, what is the point? I think Disney content would have been pulled from Sky in due course regardless.\u201d Disney may also have a wary eye on Sky\u2019s first-run TV deal with Game of Thrones maker HBO, which expires in 2020, and could come under renewal pressure as HBO is also beginning to build its own streaming services in the US and Europe. Indeed, cable service HBO could go it alone with a Disney-type streaming channel and remove all of its content from Sky eventually. The issue of sports rights, which account for the lion\u2019s share of Sky\u2019s \u00a37bn annual content budget, could be another significant concern for Disney. Sky will have to pay in excess of \u00a35bn to secure the prime matches in the upcoming Premier League rights auction for 2019-22, an estimated 15%-23% more than last time, with the bids for those seasons due in two weeks. Inflation has been rampant: the total rights sold for just a third of that (\u00a31.78bn) as recently as the three-season deal from 2010-11. The spectre of a deep-pocketed digital rival for Premier League rights such as Amazon spurring further price inflation or, worse, ultimately taking the best packages of matches, could weigh on how Disney sees the long game of owning Sky. \u201cFootball is such a big part of this,\u201d said Berenberg\u2019s Simon. \u201cSky makes money, but that depends on the price of [football] rights and the direction of profits. What will happen in the next football rights auction in two more years? They could cost more, or less, or Amazon could be in the football market. Sky says it has reduced its reliance on football, but that is an illusion. Everyone is making high-end drama, and the picture would be very different if HBO were to go, Amazon took some football packages, and some movie deals went. [Disney chief executive] Bob Iger has said Sky is a crown jewel but it will depend massively on how the landscape looks in two years.\u201d Pivotal\u2019s Wieser said that if Murdoch\u2019s Sky bid was blocked by the CMA but Disney launched its own takeover bid, the US media group could face serious competition. He points out Comcast \u2013 which owns assets including NBC, CNBC, Syfy, Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Animation \u2013 as a potential suitor. \u201cDisney will try to buy it, but it won\u2019t be the only one,\u201d he says. \u201cSky will have no shortage of interest \u2013Comcast for example. Who knows where the market will be in 18 months when they would think about making a bid [for the rest of Sky]?\u201d Nonetheless, an educated guess would probably point to Netflix being an even bigger threat by then. If the Fox deal goes ahead, Disney faces a dilemma with Sky.",

      "body": "<p>One of the biggest surprises about Rupert Murdoch\u2019s decision to sell his entertainment assets to Disney was his willingness to part company with Sky, the UK\u2019s biggest pay-TV broadcaster.

      "bodyText": "Businesses are learning to live with Trump A year ago, the global elite was still in shock after the US presidential election. Many business leaders had planned to leave WEF early to fly to Washington for Hillary Clinton\u2019s inauguration, rather than to watch Trump take oath of office. What a difference a year, and a massive tax cut, makes. Trump confirmed that the way to a chief executive\u2019s heart and mind is through their wallet, when he got 15 European business leaders to join him for dinner. Fawning was on the menu alongside grilled beef tenderloin, as several bosses expressed their gratitude for the president\u2019s tax cut and policy of deregulation. The corporate world seems happy to suppress any concerns over Trump\u2019s wider behaviour. It may not like what he says, but it likes what he\u2019s doing. Social media in the dock The days of kowtowing to Facebook, Google and Twitter are over. Social media was kicked from one end of the Davos promenade to the other this year, chastised for failing to control extremist content and for hooking young people onto an unhealthy diet of updates, selfies and likes. George Soros launched the most stinging attack, saying social media giants were exploiting the social environment and undermining democracy. Hours earlier, Theresa May had lashed out at them for giving a helping hand to terrorists and child abusers. Time really is up for sexual harassment News of the sordid behaviour at Britain\u2019s Presidents Club charity dinner filtered up to the Davos ski resort slowly (perhaps delegates had another president on their mind). But as the Financial Times\u2019s report did the rounds, business leaders visibly blanched at the details of groping and sexual harassment and quickly checked the guest list to find out whether any of their employees had been in attendance. The previous evening, Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau had called for a \u201ccritical discussion\u201d on women\u2019s rights and equality. His speech resonated through the hall, but what really shook business chiefs was the possibility their firm had been on the Presidents Club invite list. Malala Yousafzai told WEF that women must \u201craise up their voices\u201d to end harassment, and business chiefs seemed to be listening. Education must be reimagined to handle AI World leaders fear that millions of old economy jobs will be crushed by the fourth Industrial Revolution, while business leaders fret that workers won\u2019t have the skills needed for the new technology age. So what\u2019s the solution? The word on the WEF floor is that education needs a major shake-up. The Lego Foundation chief, John Goodwin, warns that too many countries are still using education practices \u201cestablished at the time of our grandparents\u201d. That could be disastrous, with data showing two-thirds of primary children will go into jobs that don\u2019t even exist yet. Davos has outgrown Davos The theme of this year\u2019s annual meeting was \u201cCreating a Shared Future in a Fractured World\u201d. But WEF itself felt pretty fractured this year. That\u2019s partly thanks to the extra kerfuffle created by Trump, who overshadowed events at Davos even before he landed. But even before then, the flaws in holding a gathering of world leaders and business chiefs in a tiny ski resort were painfully obvious. Even when it runs smoothly, Davos is a wild cocktail of keynote speeches, top-level meetings and intimate sessions. \u201cI\u2019m constantly feeling Fomo \u2013 fear of missing out,\u201d joked one senior UK delegate. Add to that the worst snow in decades, which brought the already glacial traffic to a complete halt, and you start to think that Davos has outgrown Davos.",

Hours earlier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/24/theresa-may-calls-on-social-media-giants-to-do-more-to-tackle-terrorism\">Theresa May had lashed out at them</a> for giving a helping hand to terrorists and child abusers.</p> <h2>Time really is up for sexual harassment</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/presidents-club-scandal\">News of the sordid behaviour at Britain\u2019s Presidents Club charity dinner</a> filtered up to the Davos ski resort slowly (perhaps delegates had another president on their mind). But as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/075d679e-0033-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5\">the Financial Times\u2019s report</a> did the rounds, business leaders visibly blanched at the details of groping and sexual harassment and quickly checked the guest list to find out whether any of their employees had been in attendance. </p> <p>The previous evening, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/23/justin-trudeau-tells-davos-tackle-inequality-or-risk-failure\">Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau had called for a \u201ccritical discussion\u201d</a> on women\u2019s rights and equality. His speech resonated through the hall, but what really shook business chiefs was the possibility their firm had been on the Presidents Club invite list.</p> <p>Malala Yousafzai told WEF that women must \u201craise up their voices\u201d to end harassment, and business chiefs seemed to be listening.</p> <h2>Education must be reimagined to handle AI</h2> <p>World leaders fear that millions of old economy jobs will be crushed by the fourth Industrial Revolution, while business leaders fret that workers won\u2019t have the skills needed for the new technology age.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the solution? The word on the WEF floor is that education needs a major shake-up. The Lego Foundation chief, John Goodwin, warns that too many countries are still using education practices \u201cestablished at the time of our grandparents\u201d. That could be disastrous, with data showing two-thirds of primary children will go into jobs that don\u2019t even exist yet.</p> <h2>Davos has outgrown Davos</h2> <p>The theme of this year\u2019s annual meeting was \u201cCreating a Shared Future in a Fractured World\u201d. But WEF itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2018\">felt pretty fractured this year</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s partly thanks to the extra kerfuffle created by Trump, who overshadowed events at Davos even before he landed. But even before then, the flaws in holding a gathering of world leaders and business chiefs in a tiny ski resort were painfully obvious. </p> <p>Even when it runs smoothly, Davos is a wild cocktail of keynote speeches, top-level meetings and intimate sessions. \u201cI\u2019m constantly feeling Fomo \u2013 fear of missing out,\u201d joked one senior UK delegate. Add to that the worst snow in decades, which brought the already glacial traffic to a complete halt, and you start to think that Davos has outgrown Davos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>",
