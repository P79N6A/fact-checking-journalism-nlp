      "bodyText": "German chemical giant Bayer\u2019s $66bn (\u00a350bn) deal to buy controversial US agrochemical giant Monsanto and create the world\u2019s largest seeds and pesticides company is \u201ca threat to all Americans\u201d and should be blocked, Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday. Speaking shortly after the deal was announced, the Vermont senator, who ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: \u201cThe attempted takeover of Monsanto by Bayer is a threat to all Americans.\u201d \u201cThese mergers boost the profits of huge corporations and leave Americans paying even higher prices. Not only should this merger be blocked, but the Department of Justice should reopen its investigation of Monsanto\u2019s monopoly over the seed and chemical market.\u201d He called for the proposed takeover to be blocked and for a fresh investigation into Monsanto\u2019s current control of the seed market. The proposed deal, the biggest corporate takeover deal so far this year, follows a wave of consolidation in the seeds and agriculture industry and has raised concerns among politicians, scientists, regulators, farmers and activists who called the deal a \u201cmarriage made in hell\u201d. Werner Baumann, chief executive of Bayer, which is most famous for developing aspirin, said \u201cthe combination of our two great organizations [will] deliver substantial value to shareholders, our customers, employees and society at large\u201d. But farmers and environmentalists warned the deal could lead to a reduction in seed variety, an increase in genetically modified crops and higher seed costs and therefore crop and food prices. The proposed takeover is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny in the US and Europe, particularly as it quickly follows two other mega-deals in the agriculture industry and would leave control of almost two-thirds of the world\u2019s seeds and pesticides in the hands of three firms. Analysts at Bernstein Research said they thought there was only a 50:50 chance of the deal winning regulatory clearance. \u201cWe believe political pushback to this deal, ranging from farmer dissatisfaction with all their suppliers consolidating in the face of low farm net incomes to dissatisfaction with Monsanto leaving the United States, could provide significant delays and complications,\u201d they said in a research note. Because of the difficulties expected in getting the deal through, Bayer has agreed to pay Monsanto $2bn if the tie-up falls apart because of competition concerns. Friends of the Earth described the takeover, which will see Bayer pay $128 per share \u2013 a 44% premium on Monsanto\u2019s share price before the proposed deal was first revealed in May, as a \u201cmarriage made in hell\u201d. Adrian Bebb, Friends of the Earth\u2019s food and farming campaigner, said the proposed takeover \u201cthreatens to further lock in industrialised agriculture at the expense of nature, farmers and the wider public\u201d and warned that \u201cthis mega corporation will be doing its best to force damaging pesticides and GM seeds into our countryside\u201d. Campaigners promised further protests, which have already been held around the world since Bayer made its first approach for Monsanto in May. They are concerned that the deal could lead to Monsanto, which has been described as \u201cthe most evil company in the world\u201d for its role in developing deadly herbicide Agent Orange in the 1960s and more recently its role at the forefront of genetically engineered crops, could introduce GMO seeds in Europe. Hugh Grant, Monsanto\u2019s Scottish chief executive, hit out at environmentalists saying their concern about GM crops \u201cdrives me a little bit nuts\u201d and said they should be more worried about how to feed a fast-growing global population while using less water as global temperatures rise. \u201cYou think about two billion new citizens, you think about a warming planet. You think about water. These are appropriate conversations,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. \u201cThe thing that drives me a little bit nuts. The frustrating piece is this is such a polarized debate. And I don\u2019t think it should be because we\u2019re going to need all these kinds of agriculture.\u201d John Colley, professor of international business at Warwick Business School said: \u201cBayer\u2019s acquisition of \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 crop producer Monsanto could be a horror story for both Bayer and its customers: the farmers.\u201d \u201cApart from Monsanto\u2019s shareholders, who have hit the jackpot, this looks like a lose-lose bid. Bayer have been forced into paying too much and face major integration and competition authority risks. \u201cThe farmers will lose out as product ranges are rationalised and attempts are made to increase prices.\u201d Bayer\u2019s shares were up 1.3% to \u20ac105.60 in afternoon trading in Frankfurt, and Monsanto shares were 1.1% higher at $107.20 in New York.",

      "bodyText": "Across the road from the new bus station in the north Nottinghamshire town of Mansfield stands a recently erected retail and office development. The facility houses modern bars and restaurants on the ground floor, while white collar workers tap away on computers on the storeys above. For some, the zone is viewed as an uncontroversial symbol of how the town is emerging from the depression that afflicted the area following the bitter miners\u2019 strike of the mid 1980s and the subsequent closure of the local pits. Yet inside this new facility is one of 100 regional offices of a once-obscure employment agency, which after years of operating in relative anonymity is suddenly becoming significantly better known. Transline Group supplies temporary workers to some of the UK\u2019s best-known brands \u2013 from Amazon to Argos. But it is its relationship with Sports Direct \u2013 serviced from that office in Mansfield \u2013 that has made the group\u2019s name. Last year, an undercover Guardian investigation exposed how workers at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire were being paid less than the legal minimum wage. The expos\u00e9 resulted in the sports retailer and its employment agencies \u2013 Transline as well as its rival, The Best Connection \u2013 being forced into making backpay of around \u00a31m to short-changed minimum wage workers, as well as some of the main protagonists being hauled in front of a parliamentary select committee hearing. Many of the MPs\u2019 conclusions were contained within a damning report on the working practices at Sports Direct that was published in July. But on Tuesday the parliamentarians added that Transline had not been candid when giving evidence to the committee and that the retailer should end its relationship with the agency. In a letter to Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s majority shareholder, Iain Wright, the chairman of the Commons business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, said: \u201cWe ask you to think seriously about continuing to use Transline, a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in a way that is inconsistent with your own aspirations for Sports Direct to be on a par with likes of Selfridges and John Lewis.\u201d The BIS committee also warned Transline that it was considering reporting to the Commons that the company\u2019s directors were not fit to run the company because of concerns about its dealings with Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA), which regulates agencies supplying staff to the food and drink processing sector. So what is this company and who are these directors? Transline was co-founded in 1989 by Paul Beasley, 49, and Jonathan Taylor, 48, who, along with a third director, 48-year-old sales boss Mark Elms, each own 5% of the company. The remaining 85% of the equity in the business, which is registered as Qualitycourse Ltd, is held by another director Colin Beasley, 72. The company refuses to explain what the relationship is between Paul and Colin Beasley. The group\u2019s growth has been against a backdrop of many major employers outsourcing the hiring of much of their workforce, thereby eradicating costs such as having a human resources department. However, the arrangements have been heavily criticised, with workers and unions frequently complaining that they allow companies to bypass employment rights \u2013 while workers often seem to fear instant dismissal. However, the structure appears to work well for some. Between them, the four Transline shareholders received dividends of \u00a3100,000 in 2014 and \u00a3117,000 in 2013, with the highest paid director \u2013 presumably one of the joint chief executives Paul Beasley or Taylor \u2013 earning \u00a3177,942 in 2014 and \u00a3575,862 in 2013. In 2014, the most recent year for which Transline accounts are available, the company made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3675,000 on a turnover of almost \u00a3180m. The year before, it booked profits of \u00a31.7m on revenues of \u00a3110m and sales appear to have risen again in 2015. At the select committee hearing in June, Transline\u2019s representatives told MPs that it charged Sports Direct \u201cin excess of \u00a320m\u201d \u2013 which it said accounted for about 10% of its revenues. All of which represents a decent business for Transline, based in Halifax, West Yorkshire. The accounts show that Paul Beasley had loans from the company totalling \u00a3692,000 at the end of 2014, while Taylor was in debt to his own firm by \u00a3448,000. But while those years look good from an accounting perspective, they were less so for the group\u2019s reputation. It is the events of that period that have landed Transline in trouble with MPs. During the parliamentary hearings, a 2013 failure to renew its licence with the GLA was described by Transline finance director Jennifer Hardy as a voluntary move, as the company had ceased to supply the sector. The GLA disputes Hardy\u2019s version of events, however, claiming Transline directors were not \u201cfit and proper\u201d and that the company had traded without a licence during 2013. Furthermore, as part of its investigations, the GLA examined the payslips of six Transline workers, whichshowed that they were paid less than the hourly national minimum wage (NMW) rate before the Sports Direct scandal was exposed. In a letter sent to Transline in March 2014, which was titled \u201cLicence Application Decision\u201d, the GLA said: \u201cOf these six workers on the scheme five have received under the NMW some of them significantly so.\u201d The employment agency argues the select committee was biased against Transline and said it was \u201castounded and extremely saddened\u201d to read what it said were inaccurate critical comments about its operation and evidence. A Transline spokesperson said: \u201cWe have always provided accurate information to the select committee and are focused on supporting Sports Direct in reviewing and implementing recommendations and actions from the working practices report. We will continue to offer clarity and any further information necessary to the committee. \u201cObviously we find Iain Wright MP\u2019s statements and summary disappointing, however we will prioritise responding to the latest correspondence in a full and concise manner, within the requested timescale. \u201cIt is inappropriate and unjust to make such statements [about directors not being fit and proper], which is why Transline is taking legal advice\u201d.",

At the select committee hearing in June, Transline\u2019s representatives told MPs that it charged Sports Direct \u201cin excess of \u00a320m\u201d \u2013 which it said accounted for about 10% of its revenues. </p> <p>All of which represents a decent business for Transline, based in Halifax, West Yorkshire.</p> <p>The accounts show that Paul Beasley had loans from the company totalling \u00a3692,000 at the end of 2014, while Taylor was in debt to his own firm by \u00a3448,000.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But while those years look good from an accounting perspective, they were less so for the group\u2019s reputation. It is the events of that period that have landed Transline in trouble with MPs.</p> <p>During the parliamentary hearings, a 2013 failure to renew its licence with the GLA was described by Transline finance director Jennifer Hardy as a voluntary move, as the company had ceased to supply the sector.</p> <p>The GLA disputes Hardy\u2019s version of events, however, claiming Transline directors were not \u201cfit and proper\u201d and that the company had traded without a licence during 2013.</p> <p>Furthermore, as part of its investigations, the GLA examined the payslips of six Transline workers, whichshowed that they were paid less than the hourly national minimum wage (NMW) rate before the Sports Direct scandal was exposed. </p> <p>In a letter sent to Transline in March 2014, which was titled \u201cLicence Application Decision\u201d, the GLA said: \u201cOf these six workers on the scheme five have received under the NMW some of them significantly so.\u201d</p> <p>The employment agency argues the select committee was biased against Transline and said it was \u201castounded and extremely saddened\u201d to read what it said were inaccurate critical comments about its operation and evidence.</p> <p>A Transline spokesperson said: \u201cWe have always provided accurate information to the select committee and are focused on supporting Sports Direct in reviewing and implementing recommendations and actions from the working practices report. We will continue to offer clarity and any further information necessary to the committee.</p> <p>\u201cObviously we find Iain Wright MP\u2019s statements and summary disappointing, however we will prioritise responding to the latest correspondence in a full and concise manner, within the requested timescale.</p> <p>\u201cIt is inappropriate and unjust to make such statements [about directors not being fit and proper], which is why Transline is taking legal advice\u201d.</p>",

Pure Gym is chaired by Tony Ball, who as chief executive of BSkyB in its early years helped to change television viewing habits in the UK. The gym chain is another tale of \u201cdisruption\u201d, promises Ball, which might encourage some of the 785,000 members to think of backing the IPO, or flotation, with a few quid. Forget it, unless you are a gym-goer who is also a fund manager. Yes, this IPO is another dreary institutions-only offering, which is par for the course when, as here, the seller comes from the land of private equity. Ordinary investors\u2019 first chance to buy arrives only when the shares start trading. Worse, the whole IPO process could almost be designed to discourage general interest. If you wish to chew over Pure Gym\u2019s financial numbers at leisure, for example, you\u2019re a second-class citizen. The institutional crew will get their \u201cpathfinder\u201d prospectus, which includes all the important data, well in advance. Outsiders\u2019 first sight will come when the full version is published a couple of days before the float actually happens. In the meantime, ordinary mortals must make do with edited highlights. There were interesting lines in Wednesday\u2019s intention-to-float document, like the fact that Pure Gym claims a 47% return on capital at its \u201cmature\u201d gyms. But you will search in vain for up-to-date figures for pre-tax profit or even debt. Nobody could sensibly make an investment decision without those numbers. The real culprit is the Financial Conduct Authority and its predecessor, which over two decades has allowed retail punters to be squeezed out of the IPO game. Back in April, the regulator discussed some sensible reforms. Prospectuses could be published a fortnight before trading day, suggested the FCA, and independent analysts should not be gagged by lack of access to management. Five months later there is no sign of the FCA leaping into action. Those politicians who say from time to time that they want to promote a \u201cshareholding democracy\u201d should start by telling the FCA to pull its finger out. Banks won\u2019t be hurried over Brexit decisions The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, trying to hurry things along and get the Brexit show on the road, clearly hasn\u2019t met many British bankers. Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, and Alex Wilmot-Sitwell, head of the European end of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, are not chaps who like to be rushed. Solemnly, and in turns, they told the House of Lords on Wednesday that upending the European financial services industry can\u2019t be done lightly, quickly, or at all without risking serious instability. The cheerful interpretation, from the point of view of the City, is that a lot of jobs look safer than when some banks were threatening an exodus if the UK voted for Brexit. Big banks are so inflexible, it seems, that change throws them into confusion. That is easy to believe. The big four lenders were given half a decade to erect a ringfence around their retail operations in the UK and still they grumble about the pace of regulatory upheaval. Or, as Flint himself put it, it\u2019s taken HSBC three years to move 1,000 jobs from London to Birmingham, so switching to Paris would be a \u201cnon-trivial\u201d undertaking. But Flint and Wilmot-Sitwell were not speaking out of patriotism. They were making the serious \u2013 and surely correct \u2013 point that both the UK and the EU would suffer if the European financial system is rejigged overnight. Frankfurt and Paris simply aren\u2019t in a position to perform London\u2019s pan-European role. If the financial services industry is forced to jump through too many new licensing hoops too quickly, it could fail in its day job of lending. That point is understood in the UK, as you\u2019d expect, so Flint and Wilmot-Sitwell need to preach to the non-converted. They\u2019ll never persuade Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who wants euro-denominated trades to be cleared in the eurozone, that it is in France\u2019s own interests not to wreck the City. But HSBC and co could do everyone a service by prodding their big corporate clients on the continent to speak up. It\u2019s now up to PM to reduce the cost of her Hinkley Point mistake It is too late, it seems, to persuade Theresa May that Hinkley Point is a colossal waste of money. But, at a bare minimum, let\u2019s hope the prime minister has succeeded in reducing the scandalous cost to consumers. EDF and its Chinese backers could expect to make a 10% rate of return under the old terms agreed in 2012. In today\u2019s world, 7% would be generous.",

      "bodyText": "Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s article (Britain\u2019s bosses fat and lazy? For once, Liam Fox has a point, 13 September) echoes the findings of Martin Wiener who, in 1981, wrote English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit (1981). In essence, Wiener argues that the relative decline of the UK economy over the previous century was due, in part, to the cultural values of British elites. In particular, he saw that industrial and business leaders were more concerned with aping the values of the old agrarian aristocracy. For them, success involved the acquisition of a thousand acres of land and a mansion, preferably in the Cotswolds. This they valued more than the growth of their firms by further injections of available capital. Whatever the strength of Wiener\u2019s analysis, it greatly impressed Keith Joseph who was then secretary of state for industry in Thatcher\u2019s first cabinet. He held the view that the activities of business and industrial leaders had a more corrosive impact on the UK economy than the actions of union leaders. He recommended that all cabinet ministers should read Wiener\u2019s book and learn the lessons. A feature of Wiener\u2019s analysis was that although the economy was still large when measured by GDP, there was a significant decline in productivity when measured by GDP per capita. The end of the Thatcher period saw a significant decline in manufacturing output as a proportion of GDP. This is still the position today, even though during the referendum campaign Fox and other Brexit leaders proudly proclaimed the strength of the economy, the fifth largest in the world \u2013 a strength that they claimed will enable us to face the rigours and uncertainties of the global market. He either did not know, or did not wish to inform the electorate, that our economy measured by GDP per capita is placed 25th in the IMF ranking of world economies. This reflects low levels of productivity, a consequence of under-investment in the economy. Wiener\u2019s cultural argument is demonstrated fully in the recent case of Philip Green, who took hundreds of millions out of BHS for his private consumption. So why is Liam Fox now so concerned about the performance of industrial and business leaders when weeks ago he was lauding the strength of the UK economy? Is it because he now recognises our vulnerability as an isolated economy in the global marketplace and that if things go badly wrong for the economy then who is to take the blame? Fox can hardly blame the large number of workers who voted to leave. A far more acceptable scapegoat will be the fat and lazy business elite who could not be bothered to export and who anyway had voted to remain in the EU. Gerald Crawley St Briavels, Gloucestershire \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s criticism of Liam Fox\u2019s remarks on British bosses being fat and lazy is fine as far as it goes. But he doesn\u2019t diagnose the underlying structural cause. The British economy has long been dominated by financial markets and banks. The preeminence of London as an international financial centre has increasingly been seen in the era of globalisation, but especially since the big bang negotiated in 1983 and implemented in 1986, as the core of British economic success, punching above its weight in the world. However, as many analysts have shown \u2013 for example, Adair Turner in his groundbreaking book Between Debt and the Devil \u2013 the financial services industry is concerned not with supporting the productive economy but with \u201cbidding up existing assets\u201d. Productive investment has slumped dramatically over the years, with profits from the origination and trading of mortgages, derivatives and other pure debt instruments underpinning the lifestyles of economic elites and undermining those of workers. The global financial crisis has merely reinforced this trend. In this environment, as Mariana Mazzucato and others have argued, only a state-led industrial strategy, along with real economy-based financial regulation, can start to reorient the British economy towards regeneration and a more just distribution of rewards. Whether the May government\u2019s stress on industrial strategy will mark a sea change is of course doubtful, given the support given by both Tory and Labour governments to the financial sector over the past 30 years.

Whether the May government\u2019s stress on industrial strategy will mark a sea change is of course doubtful, given the support given by both Tory and Labour governments to the financial sector over the past 30 years.<br><strong>Philip G Cerny</strong><br><em>(Professor emeritus of politics and global affairs, University of Manchester and Rutgers University) York </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><strong><em><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\">guardian.letters@theguardian.com</a></em></strong></p> <p>\u2022 The second letter above was amended on 16 September 2016 to clarify a reference to \u201cthe big bang\u201d.

      "bodyText": "More than 300 major post offices will be hit by a 24-hour walkout on Thursday as workers protest against branch closures, job cuts and pension changes. About 4,000 members of the Communication Workers Union, which represents postal workers, and about 700 members of Unite, which acts for managers, are to picket around the country throughout the day. The action comes despite talks through Acas, the arbitration service, earlier this week which are expected to continue next week. Workers voted to strike after the government-owned service confirmed plans to transfer more than 60 of its largest outlets to the private sector. Along with other cost-cutting proposals, the closures will lead to the loss of around 2,000 of its 6,600-strong workforce in crown branches, back office and cash handling. About half the Post Office\u2019s 7,000-strong workforce is also being forced to shift from a final salary pension scheme to a defined contribution scheme, which unions say could cut retirement benefits by 30% or more in some cases. Jeremy Corbyn, whose bid to hold on to the Labour leadership is being backed by CWU, will also host a meeting of Post Office workers in parliament at lunchtime on Thursday. Corbyn released a video supporting the strikers and describing Post Office workers as loyal public servants. \u201cI\u2019m struck by the strategy of the Post Office to get rid of them, close the Crown Post Offices, franchise out and privatise the service and bring in a group of people on lower wages, worse conditions, not as skilled, not as experienced in many cases and not as able to deliver that public service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the Post Office network for a reason. It is part of the social fabric of this country. It was set up to give a good post office in every high street in every town and I find it beyond sad the way it\u2019s been treated.\u201d The Post Office said that the vast majority of its 11,600-strong network would be open for business as usual on Thursday. More than 11,000 branches \u2013 97% of the Post Office network \u2013 are run by independent businesses and the 50,000 people who work in these branches are not involved in the strike action. Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office\u2019s network and sales director, said the service had contingency plans in place to ensure that it could operate normally with sufficient cash and stock. \u201cThe Post Office is a national institution that is successfully adapting to change and we are safeguarding the future of the network,\u201d he said. He said the changes to the Post Office\u2019s pension arrangements were \u201cthe responsible thing to do both for members of the plan and for the long-term financial health of the business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It was another nervous day for investors, albeit with rather less dramatic market moves than they have endured recently. The usual concerns remained, including whether or not the US Federal Reserve would indeed raise interest rates next week, and a continuing slide in the oil price despite an unexpected fall in US oil stocks. UK unemployment figures did little to rock the boat ahead of the latest Bank of England meeting on Thursday (where rates and its quantitative easing programme are expected to remain unchanged.) But London shares snapped out of a three day losing streak - just - with some support from mining groups after positive economic signs from key commodities consumer China. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 7.68 points or 0.12% to 6673.31 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.08% to 10,378.40 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.39% at 4370.26 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.05% to 16,539.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.25% at 8702.4 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.15% to 556.13 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 38 points or 0.21% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, and there are further tensions between the government and its creditors. Reuters reports: Greece will tell its creditors it cannot comply with labour reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund as a condition of its support for the country\u2019s third bailout, its labour minister told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. The leftist government considers the IMF\u2019s demand as a ban on the right of workers to negotiate wages and conditions on a collective basis. A breakdown with the IMF on the issue could jeopardise its financing of the 86 billion euro ($96 billion) bailout and could undermine overall confidence in the deal. Labour Minister George Katrougalos, speaking a few hours before meeting with the heads of an EU-IMF mission on labour issues, said Athens would fight to revive collective bargaining and described the IMF as \u201can extreme player\u201d. \u201cWe want to reinstate collective bargaining because it\u2019s the core of the European social model,\u201d Katrougalos said. Under previous bailouts, collective bargaining has been weakened. Both the IMF and the EU say an inflexible labour force has helped to make Greece uncompetitive, contributing to its economic malaise. Katrougalos also said the minimum wage in Greece, now at 586 euros, should be determined by social partners - workers and employers - and not by the state, as demanded by the lenders. Other issues that Greece\u2019s creditors have put on the negotiating table include relaxing laws on mass dismissals and allowing employers to shut down their businesses and lock out workers in the event of industrial action, he said. \u201cThese are measures which employers have already rejected in Greece,\u201d Katrougalos said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where we can no longer tolerate the deterioration of Greek workers\u2019 status.\u201d Still on oil Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The price of oil erased early gains as traders resumed bearish bets on speculation that Libya will soon be in a position to begin exports again. The losses come after the American Petroleum Institute reported a build in weekly oil inventories. The price did have a brief rally after DOE data showed a surprise draw, but within half-an-hour of the data made new lows of the day. All indications are that the biggest drawdown in 17 years seen in last week\u2019s inventory figures was an aberration. Oil prices continued their slide despite US crude inventories showing a surprise fall last week. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stocks fell by 559,000 barrels compared with expectations of a 3.8m increase. But gasoline stocks rose by a more than expected 567,000, compared to forecasts of a 343,000 gain. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, were also much higher than expected, rising by 4.6m barrels instead of the forecast 1.5m barrel increase. After an initial rebound as the figures came out, Brent crude is now down 1.32% at $46.48 while West Texas Intermediate is 1.43% lower at $44.26. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Bank of England governor Mark Carney testing the durability of the new \u00a35 note: After Tuesday\u2019s sell-off on the US market, Wall Street has opened marginally higher in early trading. But with continuing nervousness over the prospect of a US rate rise next week, along with weakness in the oil price, it is hardly a convincing move: the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up just 11 points or 0.07%. For the Star Wars fans: Ahead of the latest US oil inventory figures, crude prices are on the slide once more. Brent is down 0.74% at $46.75 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 0.65% to $44.61 on continuing concerns about oversupply amid falling demand. Earlier prices had been supported by a report overnight from the American Petroleum Institute that crude stocks had risen by a lower than expected 1.4m barrels last week, compared to estimates of a 3.8m increase. Oanda senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley told Reuters: Long suffering oil bulls will now turn nervously to the US Energy Information Administration\u2019s commercial crude inventory numbers. It was an unexpected undershoot in these numbers last week that set off the rally in crude last week. Elsewhere in the markets, the pound is bobbing around the $1.319 mark. Traders are waiting for the Bank of England\u2019s next monetary policy decision, tomorrow, although few fireworks are expected. Today\u2019s decent jobs survey, following a shock-free inflation report yesterday, means the BoE will surely leave things unchanged. Last month it slashed interest rates to a fresh record low of 0.25%, and boosted its QE programme by up to \u00a360bn. A growing number of experts believe the baton is being passed back from central bankers to national governments, who could boost spending to encourage growth. Ranjiv Mann, head of economic research at Rogge Global Partners, says the BoE is looking to Westminster for a fiscal response to the Brexit vote. But does chancellor Phillip Hammond have much flexibility? Mann says: The question is how much the government is willing to do in the short term? With debt levels at historic highs, there are constraints from both a credibility and fiscal perspective. The government knows it must proceed with caution and address concerns about how it will balance the budget over the medium term. Just how loose UK fiscal policy becomes will play a key role in determining the BoE\u2019s longer term actions. Even if the government\u2019s Autumn statement delivers a much looser fiscal stance sufficient to reduce some growth worries, the BoE is set to maintain its dovish policy stance for years to come. In the meantime, Mark Carney can enjoy the launch of the new plastic \u00a35 note (which he saw fit to dip into a bubbling pot of curry yesterday): Today\u2019s unemployment report has helped to push shares higher in London. The FTSE 100 had gained 37 points, or 0.55%, to 6073, outpacing European markets (Germany is up a bit, and France is flat). City investors are reassured that the unemployment total fell in the last quarter, and that there\u2019s no sign that firms are cutting hiring. Obviously it\u2019s still early days. And Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, says investors will reserve judgement until more data emerges. Vacancies \u2013 a critical gauge of employer intentions and confidence - remained high, rising slightly to 752,000. Wage growth slipped a tad but remained pretty solid and above the average of recent years. On the downside, a big jump in self-employed numbers could be a cause for concern and the total number of hours worked didn\u2019t rise much. But the official figures seem to contradict some of the anecdotal evidence following the June vote. CEB had found that number of jobs vacancies slumped by 700,000 in the week after Brexit, while the REC reported a sharp deterioration in the jobs market in July. So far these downcast assessments have not been backed up by the official data, but we will need a bit longer to get a clearer picture of how the labour market has been hit. Here\u2019s our news story about the unemployment report: Although most of today\u2019s jobs report is pretty decent, the slowdown in pay growth is a significant worry. The big fear is that inflation spikes, as firms pass on higher import costs, meaning real wages (adjusted for inflation) are eroded. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the government must make \u201ca real effort\u201d to push wages up. \u201cWe need investment now to create more decent, well-paid jobs, and an end to the public sector pay cap. And the government should stick by its promise to give the lowest paid a pay rise, with increases in the national living wage.\u201d The Resolution Foundation have sent over two charts, showing how real wages haven\u2019t reached their pre-crisis levels: Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says Britain\u2019s job recovery is rolling on... \u201cUnemployment is falling, jobs are being created and earnings are heading up. Britain\u2019s jobless rate is half that of the euro area.\u201d Encouragingly, UK firms are actually advertising MORE jobs than a month ago. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg says it\u2019s good news: After the Brexit vote, we had expected firms to exercise a greater level of caution, implying a fall in vacancies. Most surprisingly, the number of job vacancies rose modestly to 752k in August. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says today\u2019s Labour Market report jobs report shows \u201cno immediate impact\u201d from June\u2019s EU referendum. But he also emphasises that it\u2019s early days -- if there is a Brexit shock, the jobs market won\u2019t show it first. Hawksworth explains: \u201cOverall, the latest labour market data suggest some cooling down of the rapid pace of UK jobs growth seen in the period before the referendum, but with no indication yet of a significant rise in unemployment. This is consistent with other broadly reassuring economic data for the post-referendum period, which point to a moderation of growth rather than a recession. \u201cHowever, unemployment tends to be a lagging indicator, as companies will take time to adjust their hiring plans to the post-referendum world. So it will be some months before we can reach firm conclusions on the labour market impact of the Brexit vote.\u201d Britain\u2019s public sector has shrunk again. The Office for National Statistics reports that there were 5.33 million people employed in the public sector for June 2016. This was: 13,000 fewer than for March 2016 20,000 fewer than for a year earlier the lowest since comparable records began in 1999 The public sector is now just 16.8% of the total workforce; again, the lowest since at least 1999. Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at The Work Foundation, says more people are returning to the labour force. That means employers haven\u2019t had to offer wage hikes to attract new staff. He explains: \u201cThere have been substantial gains in the numbers of workers in full-time jobs, be they employees or self-employed. Much of this gain comes from a reduction in the number of economically inactive people, a trend that looks set to continue. It is still therefore the case that expansion continues without imposing significant wage pressures.\u201d This chart shows how UK wage growth has been bobbing around the 2%-2.3% zone for some time. The Department of Work and Pensions have tweeted some key points from today\u2019s jobs report (which is online here) The fall in unemployment between May and July suggests British firms weren\u2019t spooked by the results of the EU referendum on June 23. Joshua Raymond at City firm XTB.com says we should still be cautious. With no immediate negative change in jobless circumstances, it seems UK business held fire from making immediate and sharp changes in hiring and firing [after the Brexit vote]. The UK employment rate remains the highest since records began, at 74.5%. However, it\u2019s worth reminding that this data only shows the knee jerk reaction from the Brexit vote, not Brexit itself. Any positive data over the past month in reaction to Brexit should be considered a mirage and not a vote of confidence in the UK itself despite Brexit, at least just yet. He\u2019s also concerned by the decline in wage growth: UK average earnings slowed sharper than expected to 2.1% from 2.3%, which could become troublesome if UK inflation continues to rise due to the weak pound, and could create a contraction in real earnings.\u201d City experts are concerned that wage growth has slowed to just 2.1% (ex bonuses). The Resolution Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon fears that real wages will be eroded by inflation in the coming months, as the weak pound drives up import costs. Economist Rupert Seggins shows how wages are slowing (blue) just as inflation rises (in red) UK inflation remained at 0.6% in August, but some experts predict it will jump in the months ahead. The unemployment report also shows that wage growth has slowed. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by just 2.1% in the three months to July, down from 2.3% a month ago. And if you include bonuses, earnings rose by 2.3% during the quarter - down from 2.5%. Breaking! Britain\u2019s unemployment report shows little evidence that the Brexit vote has hurt the economy (yet, anyway). The number of people out of work fell by 39,000 in the three months to July, which means the unemployment rate remains at 4.9%. The employment total has jumped again too -- by an impressive 174,000 -- taking the total to 31.77 million. But the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit has gone up, by 2,000, to 771,000. More to follow. Significant news from China: the country\u2019s banks made 948bn yuan (\u00a3107bn) worth of new loans in August, twice as much as in July. That suggests Beijing is keeping its economy stimulated, and preventing a credit crunch gripping its banking sector. One fund manager tweets: Today\u2019s unemployment report, due in under 30 minutes, may show a worrying squeeze in take home pay. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, says: UK Unemployment data is set to show the labour market has remained resilient with unemployment steady at +4.9%. This will be welcomed by the Bank of England but the expected drop in average earnings to +2.1% could be a cause for concern. Average earnings, and a dip in them, could have real consequences on impending retail sales data and consumer expenditure figures, adversely affecting growth in the long term. The Bank of England prioritises average earnings figures, and we could see them act if it looks like a downtrend could prevail. Two luxury goods groups have sent a shiver through the markets this morning. Herm\u00e8s International has abandoned its annual sales growth target, blaming \u201c a lot of uncertainty around the world\u201d. Shares in the French high fashion chain, which makes perfume, handbags, shoes, etc have slumped by 6% in early trading. Richemont, the owner of watch brand Cartier, is also suffering. It hit shareholders with a profits warning this morning, after suffering a 14% slide in sales in the last five months. Its shares are down 4%, as traders fear that the luxury market is cooling. Bloomberg says the warnings reflecting \u201cthe challenges facing luxury-goods companies from weaker demand in Asia and a decline in tourism in Europe\u201d. Rising sharply, then plunging with stomach-churning speed, and occasionally ending up in a nasty crash. No, not the global stock markets. This is drone racing, in which enthusiasts fly small aerial vehicles around a track as fast as they dare, dodging obstacles on the way. And this new sport has just received a dose of cash from Sky, which has told the City its investing $1m (\u00a3770,000) in the Drone Racing League. They\u2019ll broadcast action from five races, climaxing in \u201ca winner-take-all world championship to crown the best drone pilot\u201d. They\u2019re also promising a new race, at an \u201ciconic venue in London\u201d (fingers crossed for the House of Commons). And if you couldn\u2019t tell Drone Racing from the Drones Club, here\u2019s some action: Asian stock markets have slipped to six-week lows this morning, knocking 0.6% off the Chinese and Japanese indices. And bond prices are also slipping, having recently soared to record highs. Reuters explains why: Bond markets have come under pressure in recent days from unease about a possible U.S. rate hike this month, news that theBank of Japan is studying ways to steepen the bond yield curve and disappointment at the lack of clear forward-action plan by the European Central Bank at last week\u2019s meeting. (yields, or interest rates, rise when prices fall). Financial traders are getting edgy because they fear the US central bank might raise interest rates soon, even though the global economy looks fragile. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, explains that next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting is on everyone\u2019s mind. Lower global demand has made investors uncomfortable with the idea that the Fed is still gritty to increase the interest rate. The fact is that investors do not mind if the Fed is going to hike up the interest rate, as this was the situation a few months ago. What is making them wary is that the economic data has started to deteriorate and the Fed has very solid stance with respect to a rate hike. And there\u2019s a lot of bearish chatter in the markets this morning, as experts worry that central banks may be running out of firepower. Here\u2019s Kit Juckes of Societe Generale: And Jamie McGeever of Reuters: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Once again, we\u2019ll be squinting at the economic tealeaves for signs that Britain\u2019s economy has either shrugged off June\u2019s Brexit vote, or been dragged down by it. At 9.30am, the latest UK unemployment report will how how many people signed on for jobseeker\u2019s allowance in August. It will also show whether the unemployment rate remained at just 4.9%, in the three months to July, and whether real wages kept rising. This is the first jobs report to fully cover the dramatic weeks after the EU referendum. It\u2019s probably too early to see any significant impact -- but there may be some early signals.... Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: Although employment gains are set to slow markedly in coming months on this occasion even if the level holds flat with that seen in June it would result in increased employment of over 150k in the last three months. We look for the unemployment rate to hold at 4.9% and for average earnings growth to slow a little; the including bonus measure should come at 2%, year-on-year, and the ex-bonus measure at 2.1%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons the jobless rate could actually fall, to 4.8%,. He points out that last month\u2019s report showed a surprise fall in people \u2018signing on\u2019 for unemployment benefit. Given the decline in jobless claims in July this morning\u2019s ILO unemployment number for July is likely to remain unchanged at 4.9%, and could even improve to 4.8% at a pinch, which would suggest for now little evidence of a negative spill over. There\u2019s also a lot of angst in the financial markets today. Investors are fretting about central bank policymaking, with the US Federal Reserve making a decision on interest rates next week. Oil is also a concern, with predictions of an energy glut until mid-2017. So shares have dropped in Asia overnight, and we\u2019re expecting a quietish morning in Europe.",

Britain\u2019s labour market after the EU referendum looks a lot like it did before the Brexit vote. Anybody looking at the latest unemployment numbers would be hard-pressed to conclude there had been an in-out referendum on EU membership less than three months ago. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics provide little evidence of any major disruption to the labour market either before or after 23 June. In the three months to July, there were 174,000 more people in work than in the previous three months, while the number unemployed fell by 39,000. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9%. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the ONS figures are making economists more cautious in their assessments of the impact of the Brexit vote on the economy. \u201cOur first look at the post-Brexit-vote labour market shows a similar picture to the one we had before the vote,\u201d said Laura Gardiner of the Resolution Foundation thinktank. \u201cIt could be some time before we see any \u2018Brexit effects\u2019 \u2013 good or bad \u2013 in the official figures.\u201d John Philpott, who runs the Jobs Economist consultancy, has a similar take.

Philpott is right. Unemployment has not rocketed since the referendum. Surveys suggest employers are warier about hiring new employees but they have yet to stop doing so. There is little to suggest unemployment will start rising by 50,000-plus per month, which is what it tends to do in the early stages of a recession. The slow burn effect is most likely to come through the low level of earnings growth. All things considered, it is hard to see why employers should be offering higher pay in the aftermath of the referendum than they were in the period before it. That means average earnings growth will remain stuck at around its current level of 2-2.5% a year. For the moment, consumers are seeing increases in their real incomes because wages are rising faster than prices. But inflation is expected to drift higher over the next year and this will lead to a squeeze on living standards. That doesn\u2019t mean the economy is going to crash. But in the absence of further stimulus from the Bank of England and some support from the chancellor in the autumn statement, it could well slow a bit.",

      "bodyText": "Waning consumer demand for luxury goods and global economic uncertainty have triggered sales warnings at Swiss group Richemont and its French rival Herm\u00e8s International. Richemont, whose brands include Cartier and Montblanc, said it was expecting a 45% plunge in first-half profits as sales of watches and jewellery dwindle. Herm\u00e8s said it was abandoning its annual sales growth target because the broad economic backdrop was so uncertain. Shares in both companies fell sharply, with Herm\u00e8s down 6.5% and Richemont down 4%. The luxury sector is being hit by declining sales in key consumer markets such as Hong Kong and Macau, with weakening demand partly driven by a government crackdown on corruption and excess China. In Europe, sales of high-end goods have been flagging after a series of terrorist attacks discouraged foreign tourists from travelling to some of the region\u2019s top shopping destinations such as Paris. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX, said the whole sector was suffering. \u201cThe luxury market is suffering. Richemont and Hermes have both delivered downbeat trading updates and their stocks are being sold off in sharp fashion as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cThese come after a woeful summer for the sector, with Burberry and Swatch among several notable marques seeing sales and profits falling. Meanwhile Tiffany posted its steepest decline in sales since the financial crisis in May.\u201d Geneva-based Richemont reported a larger-than-expected 14% drop in sales in the first five months of the financial year to the end of August. Analysts had forecast an 11% fall. Sales were down in all regions, with Europe the biggest faller at 20%. The business struggled in Japan, where sales fell by 15% partly because a strong yen depressed tourist spending in the country. One bright spot was the UK, where Richemont said the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June was helping to drive sales growth. \u201cElsewhere in Europe, sales were down, particularly in France, due to a significantly lower level of tourist activity,\u201d the company said. Watch sales fell 19% over the five months, while sales of jewellery were down 16%. Richemont said tough trading would weigh heavily on its first-half results: \u201cWe consider that the difficult trading conditions are likely to continue during September. Operating profit for the six months ending 30 September 2016 is therefore expected to be approximately 45% below the prior year\u2019s level,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are of the view that the current negative environment as a whole is unlikely to reverse in the short term. However, we remain convinced of the long-term prospects for luxury goods globally, and in particular for watches and jewellery.\u201d Herm\u00e8s said it was dropping its annual revenue growth target of 8% because of \u201ceconomic, geopolitical and monetary uncertainties around the world\u201d. It said it would maintain an ambitious goal for sales growth. Despite the caution, Herm\u00e8s said revenues in the first half of 2016 rose 6% to \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn), with growth across all regions. Net income rose 13% to \u20ac545m. In Europe sales rose 8%, but the company\u2019s chief executive, Axel Dumas, said trading at its shops in Nice, Cannes and Paris had suffered since the terrorist attack in Nice in July.",

      "body": "<p>Waning consumer demand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/luxury-goods-sector\">luxury goods</a> and global economic uncertainty have triggered sales warnings at Swiss group Richemont and its French rival Herm\u00e8s International. </p> <p>Richemont, whose brands include Cartier and Montblanc, said it was expecting a 45% plunge in first-half profits as sales of watches and jewellery dwindle.<br></p> <p>Herm\u00e8s said it was abandoning its annual sales growth target because the broad economic backdrop was so uncertain. Shares in both companies fell sharply, with Herm\u00e8s down 6.5% and Richemont down 4%.</p> <p>The luxury sector is being hit by declining sales in key consumer markets such as Hong Kong and Macau, with weakening demand partly driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/xi-jinping-tells-chinese-leadership-that-families-must-set-example-on-corruption\">a government crackdown on corruption and excess China</a>.</p> <p>In Europe, sales of high-end goods have been flagging after a series of terrorist attacks discouraged foreign tourists from travelling to some of the region\u2019s top shopping destinations such as Paris.</p> <p>Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX, said the whole sector was suffering. \u201cThe luxury market is suffering. Richemont and Hermes have both delivered downbeat trading updates and their stocks are being sold off in sharp fashion as a result,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThese come after a woeful summer for the sector, with Burberry and Swatch among several notable marques seeing sales and profits falling. Meanwhile Tiffany posted its steepest decline in sales since the financial crisis in May.\u201d<br></p> <p>Geneva-based Richemont reported a larger-than-expected 14% drop in sales in the first five months of the financial year to the end of August. Analysts had forecast an 11% fall.</p> <p>Sales were down in all regions, with Europe the biggest faller at 20%. The business struggled in Japan, where sales fell by 15% partly because a strong yen depressed tourist spending in the country.</p> <p>One bright spot was the UK, where Richemont said the sharp fall in the value of the pound since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">the Brexit vote</a> in June was helping to drive sales growth. \u201cElsewhere in Europe, sales were down, particularly in France, due to a significantly lower level of tourist activity,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>Watch sales fell 19% over the five months, while sales of jewellery were down 16%. Richemont said tough trading would weigh heavily on its first-half results: \u201cWe consider that the difficult trading conditions are likely to continue during September. Operating profit for the six months ending 30 September 2016 is therefore expected to be approximately 45% below the prior year\u2019s level,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are of the view that the current negative environment as a whole is unlikely to reverse in the short term. However, we remain convinced of the long-term prospects for luxury goods globally, and in particular for watches and jewellery.\u201d<br></p> <p>Herm\u00e8s said it was dropping its annual revenue growth target of 8% because of \u201ceconomic, geopolitical and monetary uncertainties around the world\u201d. It said it would maintain an ambitious goal for sales growth.</p> <p>Despite the caution, Herm\u00e8s said revenues in the first half of 2016 rose 6% to \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn), with growth across all regions. Net income rose 13% to \u20ac545m. In Europe sales rose 8%, but the company\u2019s chief executive, Axel Dumas, said trading at its shops in Nice, Cannes and Paris had suffered since the terrorist attack in Nice in July.</p>",

Ever since the Sharm-el-Sheikh Metrojet bombing at the end of October 2016, it seems like easyJet has faced one demand shock after another (Paris, Brussels, Egyptair, Nice, Turkey, Brexit).

      "bodyText": "A slide in wages growth in the month after the Brexit vote appeared to give the first warning sign that the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the referendum could harm the UK labour market. The Office for National Statistics said wages growth slipped to 2.1% in the three months to July, from a revised 2.4% a month ago. When bonuses are added to the wage total, earnings rose by 2.3% during the quarter, down from 2.5%. Employment rose by 174,000 in the period, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.9%. The claimant count, which is calculated for August, found there were 771,000 people claiming unemployment related benefits, up from 763,600 in July. James Knightley, UK economist at ING Financial Markets, said with only one of the three months in the ONS report in the post-referendum period, the employment could continue to worsen. He said: \u201cThe employment figures have held up well despite Brexit because the data is a rolling three-month figure. It includes numbers for May and June, ahead of the referendum, which most corporates expected to result in the UK staying in the European Union. We have to remember that it also takes time for businesses to react to shock outcomes like the Brexit vote.\u201d Knightley said a string of business surveys sugested hiring intentions had weakened substantially in the period after the referendum on 23 June. \u201cConsequently, we expect to see softer jobs growth in coming months while wage growth is unlikely to accelerate with businesses set to act cautiously on pay given the economic uncertainty,\u201d he said. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, was more upbeat, arguing that the broader recovery in the economy bode well for the labour market. \u201cIt is business as usual after the referendum. Firms have not stopped hiring. Blaming the slower wage numbers on Brexit is putting the cart before the horse because the wage data lags [other measures of the economy\u2019s health] by a considerable margin,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly there are risks that this is the calm before the storm. But for now there don\u2019t seem to be any storm clouds on the horizon.\u201d Average regular pay (excluding bonuses) was \u00a3472 per week, up from \u00a3463 per week a year earlier. Analysts said the decline in wages growth was likely to further delay any increase in interest rates, though in the short term the stability of the labour market would mean policymakers were under little pressure to cut further. The Bank of England has targeted wage increases of 3.5% to 4% before it starts to raise interest rates. The work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see another record-breaking set of figures out this month with the unemployment rate at a 10-year low and wages growing healthily. We know there are fewer children living in workless households too, which underlines our efforts to help people move into employment and to build a Britain that works for everyone, not just the privileged few. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to do, and we will continue to work with businesses to help more people take up the wealth of opportunities out there in the economy.\u201d",

Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Copper proxy Glencore is top of the FTSE 100 pile this morning thanks to the bottoming out and rebound from $4600 a tonne over of the last month, seeing the price of the red metal challenge September\u2019s highs just shy of $4,700 and a bugbear 2-month trend of falling highs. The latest leg up maintains the 2016 trend of rising lows from the January depths of the global commodity rut, helped yesterday by supportive data from China and in spite of additional US dollar strength that normally serves to hinder. But luxury goods group Burberry is down 25p at \u00a312.49 after disappointing updates from rivals Hermes and Richemont. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 36.20 points at 6701.83, following recent falls on worries about a US interest rate rise next week. The UK unemployment rate was steady at 4.9% but wage growth slowed. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: A somewhat mixed bag for UK employment data provided a marginal boost for the pound this morning, as the deterioration in average earnings and a rise in claimants were offset by a significant revision to the claimants figure for July. Coming at a time when markets are highly sensitive to UK employment data, today\u2019s data does little to boost or knock the chance of action from the Bank of England tomorrow. Housebuilders are under pressure as mortgage lending fell 13% month on month in July, the month after the Brexit vote. Taylor Wimpey is down 2p at 151.3p while Barratt Developments has fallen 5p to 478.3p. But Galliford Try has bucked the trend, up 67p at \u00a311.98 as it reported a better than expected 18% rise in full year profits to \u00a3135m. Ocado continues to slip following this week\u2019s update warning on margin pressures, down another 24p to 254p. Exane BNP Paribas issued an underperform rating on the online grocer.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest gym operator, Pure Gym, has revealed plans to float on the London Stock Exchange, raising \u00a3190m to pay off debts and fund expansion. The no-frills fitness chain said a stock market listing would allow the company to raise its profile and increase its network of gyms, as well as open the door to more acquisitions. The private equity-owned company did not say how many shares it intended to sell, or their expected price, but the initial public offering is expected to take place in October. Humphrey Cobbold, chief executive, said: \u201cPure Gym is ready to become a listed company. As well as opening more gyms, we will continue to invest in technology and the innovation it supports. \u201cTechnological capability has been and will remain fundamental to our success and going forward offers opportunities to further differentiate the options and services we provide our members.\u201d The Leeds-based business was founded in 2008 and following a period of rapid expansion is now the UK\u2019s largest gym operator, with 163 gyms and almost 790,000 members across the UK. Last year it bought rival chain LA Fitness and struck up a partnership with Olympian Sir Chris Hoy, who is a \u201cspecial adviser and brand ambassador\u201d to Pure Gym. Pure Gym says its business model is based on offering members affordable fees without tying them into fixed term contracts, with gyms accessible at any time of day and night. The chain does not have swimming pools, saunas or cafes, which have high fixed costs. In the first half of 2016 the company opened 27 new gyms, 16 of which were conversions of previously acquired LA Fitness premises. Revenue over the six months was \u00a376.6m, up 51% compared with the first half of 2015. Tony Ball, chairman of Pure Gym, said its business model had made gym membership accessible for hundreds of thousands of people. \u201cPure Gym\u2019s growth from a startup company in 2008 to undisputed market leader today is a story of disruption. \u201cWhen the company was founded the traditional gym market was moribund. It did not cater for modern gym users who are tech-savvy, want to be able to exercise at any time of day or night and want gyms they actually use, all without being locked into an expensive 12-month contract.\u201d",
