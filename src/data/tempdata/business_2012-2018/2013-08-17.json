      "bodyText": "Many of Europe's leaders will have hit the sun loungers for their customary August break by the time last week's GDP data was published, but news that the eurozone had emerged from recession must have perked up the holiday mood no end. A strong performance by Germany helped to deliver 0.3% growth across the 17-member single currency bloc in the second quarter of this year, bringing an 18-month recession to a close. This improvement in the economic weather may partly have resulted from the more lenient approach the \"troika\" of the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission has adopted in recent months. Several countries, including France, were given extra time to meet fiscal targets, letting their governments temper the savage austerity plans that threatened to prolong the downturn. But while the darkest hour may have passed, there are at least three reasons to worry that the crisis is far from over. First, despite the encouraging data, the economic fundamentals in most countries remain grim. While domestic consumption finally appears to be on the rise in Germany, which should help to boost exports from other member countries, many markets further afield remain fragile. The trade balances of some of the crisis-hit states have started to improve, but often more because of collapsing imports than a healthy surge in exports. \"Where are the growth drivers going to come from?\" asked Neil Mellor of BNY Mellon. \"It's still export-dependent and that means the rest of the eurozone is feeding on the scraps from Germany's table; and Germany is dependent on China, which is going south.\" The peripheral countries continue to lag far behind the wealthier core, with several still in recession and many saddled with eye-watering rates of unemployment: Greece 26.9%, Spain 26.3%, Ireland 13.5%. Peter Shaffrik of RBC Capital Markets argued last week that one of the key lessons from five years of crisis has been that \"smaller economies in Europe \u2013 even closed ones like Greece \u2013 can dramatically affect prospects for the currency union as a whole.\" Second, and relatedly, the debt dynamics in several countries look unsustainable, even if growth is restored. Greece has a \"financing gap\" of up to \u20ac11bn (\u00a39.4bn), according to the IMF, which will have to be filled through fresh austerity measures or another round of debt restructuring. Portugal looks unlikely to be able to graduate from its IMF programme in 2014 and return to the bond markets as its creditors hoped; and Italy and Spain are still not out of the danger zone. If bond yields worldwide continue to drift up in response to fears that the US Federal Reserve is about to choke off the supply of cheap money to investors by phasing out its quantitative easing programme, it could drive up funding costs for countries already under pressure. The IMF highlighted this risk in its recent annual health check of the eurozone. Third, progress on many of the most pressing political problems, including completing a banking union, are unlikely to be resolved until after the German elections in September. Linking together the region's banks under a single regulator \u2013 the ECB \u2013 and establishing a common rescue fund to bail them out if they fail could act as a circuit-breaker by severing the lethal connection between countries' public finances and the health of their banks. But there are deep disagreements between member countries about how the new structures will work. Germany responded to the latest proposals from internal market commissioner Michel Barnier \u2013 which would involve a new Brussels body deciding when a struggling bank should be wound up \u2013 by arguing that creating such an institution would be a breach of the EU treaty. Wrangling over these issues is likely to continue for many months, with the constant potential to reignite market panic. Finland's Olli Rehn, the economy commissioner, insisted after the data was published last week that there was \"no time for any complacency whatsoever\". He was right.",

      "bodyText": "Among the most extraordinary items in last week's better-than-expected data from the eurozone was the rip-roaring 1.1% growth in Portugal in the second quarter, marking the end of its second painful recession since 2008. If this nascent upturn really does mean that the darkest hour is over for this beautiful country, it's great news. Yet the nature of the last-ditch, grudging bailouts offered to Portugal means \u2013 as with Greece, Cyprus and Ireland \u2013 that it will be left with a heavy burden to bear for years to come; and the scale of the crisis means it will have profound social and political consequences, perhaps for decades. In its recent progress report on Portugal, the International Monetary Fund warned that, despite a decision by Portugal's troika of creditors to ease stringent deficit targets for the next two years, it is still not clear that the country's debt burden is manageable. \"Sustainability cannot be asserted with high probability,\" it said, with typical bluntness. That may yet mean a bruising battle over debt forgiveness, such as that already suffered by Greece; and with popular support for relentless austerity fading (as the IMF also pointed out), potentially a political crisis too. Holidaying in the north of the country last week, the signs of distress were clearly visible, from the shuttered shops to the shabbily dressed middle-aged men whiling away afternoons on Porto's park benches. In the elegant, down-at-heel port of Viana do Castelo, a 24-year-old man, with impeccable English, stopped to chat at the end of his shift waiting tables in a harbourside restaurant, and began to explain how the crisis had affected him and his family. He had dropped out of his sports management degree because his family could not pay the fees for both him and his brother to study. He was contemplating leaving the intense sunshine of the Atlantic coast once his summer job ends, and migrating: first to Porto, the nearest big city, but if he can't find a job there to affluent Norway, whose talent-hungry firms have sent recruiters to local employment fairs. In Portugal, the unemployment rate is 17.4%; in Norway, it's 3.4%. While his parents had settled down and had their first child by his age, he said, his financial situation made that impossible. Instead, he and his girlfriend will have to find permanent jobs, perhaps thousands of miles from home, before they can even think about starting a family. He was resigned, philosophical, greeting the unfairness of his fate with a shrug, rather than the defiance evident in local graffiti that read: \"Fuck the police, from Porto to Greece\". These are just holiday anecdotes; but the tale has been repeated many times, across many countries, over the past five years, as young people have struggled to build a life for themselves amid sky-high unemployment and savage spending cuts. Perhaps it's not surprising that many have responded either by leaving their home country or delaying starting a family. Between 2010 and the start of this year, Portugal, Spain and Ireland had all lost around 2% of their working-age population as workers went abroad in search of a job. As Marchel Alexandrovich of City broker Jefferies pointed out in a recent note, that will potentially have a long-term impact on these countries' economic viability \u2013 narrowing the pool of taxpayers to fund future public spending far beyond the immediate struggle of emerging from recession. \"In simple terms, a smaller population means a smaller potential tax base and, all things being equal, this implies that even when these economies return to 'full' employment, tax revenues will turn out to be less than were estimated before the recession started.\" Free movement of labour is a basic tenet of the European Union; but, as Alexandrovich points out, it can mean struggling member countries paying to educate young people, only to see them disappear to Germany or France and pay taxes there instead. Delaying the decision to start a family is another understandable, and well-documented, response to tough economic times. A recent article from Eurostat, the EU's number-crunching body, mused that Europe may be heading for a \"baby recession\". It finds a connection in a number of eurozone countries (not Portugal, as it happens), between the onset of recession in 2008-09 and falling birth rates. Spain, Greece and Ireland have all seen a sharp reduction in birth rates since the onset of the crisis, as couples decide that a child is an expense they simply cannot afford. Meanwhile, ageing populations in a number of European countries already mean there are fewer women of child-bearing age. The combination of these two factors has resulted in declining birth rates among 24 of the 31 countries monitored by Eurostat between 2008 and 2011. For some countries that appeared to have benefited most from membership of the euro-club in the boom years of the early noughties \u2013 not least Ireland \u2013 it was a badge of success that after decades of net emigration, talented young people were choosing to stay at home and seek their fortune. But the flow has now reversed. And that means, as Alexandrovich puts it, \"even when the recession ends, the damage to some euro area countries will be more permanent than may be commonly recognised\".",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The successful boss is being kept around \u2013 indeed, is being paid more than his successor \u2013 by a grateful drinks company", 
      "body": "<p>Finding anyone to criticise Paul Walsh, former chief executive of Diageo, is hard. Indeed, it should be. In the final three years of his 13-year tenure, shares in the international drinks company \u2013 which counts Johnnie Walker and Guinness among its brands \u2013 climbed to such an extent that the stock market value of the FTSE 100 company rocketed from \u00a320bn to&#xa0;\u00a350bn.</p> <p>So there was little outrage when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/may/07/paul-walsh-diageo-long-goodbye\" title=\"\">the company's annual report revealed last week that Walsh's last pay deal at the top amounted to nearly \u00a315m</a>. That included a salary of \u00a31.2m and a range of bonuses. Calculations by shareholder advisory group Manifest show that this sum comes on top of \u00a319m paid out in the four years before that. Well remunerated by most standards.</p> <p>It is worth revisiting Walsh's tenure with the world's biggest distiller. The 58-year-old became chief executive in 2000, three years after brand experts at Wolff Olins dreamed up the name Diageo for the merged Grand Metropolitan and Guinness businesses. He was from the Grand Met side of the deal and had earned his spurs by kick-starting the US business Pillsbury \u2013 symbolised by its podgy baker boy logo \u2013 which was later sold off, along with Burger King, to allow Diageo to focus on the drinks business.</p> <p>It was a masterful strategy, overseen by Walsh, who went on to make more than 25 acquisitions \u2013 starting with Seagram, which added Captain Morgan to the drinks cabinet. This culminated recently in the acquisition of a controlling interest in Vijay Mallya's United Spirits, maker of Bagpiper whisky, giving the firm a longed-for distribution channel into the key market of India. After all, Diageo has promised shareholders it will generate 50% of net sales from emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa by 2015.</p> <p>Walsh pushed a company that relied on western Europe and the US into emerging markets, buying the likes of Mey I\u00e7ki in Turkey, rum producer Ypi\u00f3ca and China's Shui Jing Fang \u2013 although he did not persuade Bernard Arnault to part with the remaining 75% stake in Mo\u00ebt Hennessy champagne.</p> <p>Walsh should be enjoying going out on a high, knowing that the share price has tripled under him and shareholders are delighted with his performance. Instead, he is staying put until June, during which time he will keep picking up his \u00a31.2m salary and receive \u00a380,000 a year to represent Diageo at the Scotch Whisky Association \u2013 a key body for the company given that Scotch is a third of the business.</p> <p>It seems the board thinks he needs to stick around to help bed in his successor, Ivan Menezes, who presented his first set of figures as chief executive last month, showing a rise in profits as US spirits drinkers kept the party going alongside those in Latin America and the Caribbean. In western Europe, however, sales were down.</p> <p>Crucially, net sales growth across the group, at 5%, was just below the 6% target set by Walsh. Diageo clearly feels he will be able to influence performance, as he is being allowed to keep all the shares he was awarded under previous bonus schemes that are not yet due to pay out, rather than scale them back in line with his departure terms. Millions of pounds could come his way if performance criteria see these awards pay out in the coming years \u2013 although Walsh might point out that he is unable to join this year's bonus scheme.</p> <p>Walsh is also being paid more than Menezes, who is on a salary of \u00a31m even though he is the one at the helm. So far, shareholders have not been fazed by this situation, or shown any concern about the old boss breathing down the new boss's neck. But another set of shareholders might soon take an interest. Walsh becomes chairman of contract caterer Compass in February, whose investors may become concerned if he is easily distracted.</p> <h2>Miners lose their lustre in London</h2> <p>Actor Phil Davis, seen recently in correctBBC3's<em> Being Human,</em> is the star of a new promotional film called \"A Price Worth Paying?\". The production has been commissioned by US law firm Dechert and focuses on thorny corporate problems such as \"the evaluation of risk at a time of acquisition in an emerging growth market \u2026 and the adequacy of the response to a serious allegation by a whistleblower\".</p> <p>It is quite a good joke as it goes, seeing as Dechert was the law firm hired by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/enrc\" title=\"\">Kazakhstan mining group Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC)</a> to conduct an internal investigation into some of the most prominent fraud allegations ever made against a FTSE 100 company.</p> <p>ENRC dispensed with Dechert's services in the spring \u2013 and soon after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/14/sfo-enrc-legal-documents\" title=\"\">the Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation</a>. As far as the City is concerned, the saga is about to end, with ENRC's three founding oligarchs on the verge of taking their creation private again. Last week, the miner effectively said farewell to London when it unveiled a 56% slump in interim profits \u2013 a parting gift to shareholders nursing 80% losses since 2011.</p> <p>Still, the plot of the real-life ENRC drama has formed part of a wider narrative. Combined with the nightmare of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bumi-resources\" title=\"\">Bumi </a>\u2013 financier Nat Rothschild's similarly costly Indonesian mining creation \u2013 and corporate governance concerns at London-listed mining vehicles such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/vedantaresources\" title=\"\">Vedanta</a> \u2013 observers suggest the City won't recover its appetite for emerging-market natural resources firms floating in the London.</p> <p>Investors will certainly be shyer in future: they will conduct more stringent due diligence and may be wary of firms where only a small free float of shares are not owned by founders and their friends. But it seems unlikely that future listings of this ilk will vanish.</p> <p>Investors may be sore, but for many City firms these mining companies have been a boon. ENRC's 2007 flotation was an earner for a string of investment banks, (Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley) aand similar mandates will lure City institutions to again sell emerging-market mining concerns. Likewise, investors may possess imperfect memories if they sense a profit. The City rarely shuns fees in return for a quieter life.

      "bodyText": "Finding anyone to criticise Paul Walsh, former chief executive of Diageo, is hard. Indeed, it should be. In the final three years of his 13-year tenure, shares in the international drinks company \u2013 which counts Johnnie Walker and Guinness among its brands \u2013 climbed to such an extent that the stock market value of the FTSE 100 company rocketed from \u00a320bn to \u00a350bn. So there was little outrage when the company's annual report revealed last week that Walsh's last pay deal at the top amounted to nearly \u00a315m. That included a salary of \u00a31.2m and a range of bonuses. Calculations by shareholder advisory group Manifest show that this sum comes on top of \u00a319m paid out in the four years before that. Well remunerated by most standards. It is worth revisiting Walsh's tenure with the world's biggest distiller. The 58-year-old became chief executive in 2000, three years after brand experts at Wolff Olins dreamed up the name Diageo for the merged Grand Metropolitan and Guinness businesses. He was from the Grand Met side of the deal and had earned his spurs by kick-starting the US business Pillsbury \u2013 symbolised by its podgy baker boy logo \u2013 which was later sold off, along with Burger King, to allow Diageo to focus on the drinks business. It was a masterful strategy, overseen by Walsh, who went on to make more than 25 acquisitions \u2013 starting with Seagram, which added Captain Morgan to the drinks cabinet. This culminated recently in the acquisition of a controlling interest in Vijay Mallya's United Spirits, maker of Bagpiper whisky, giving the firm a longed-for distribution channel into the key market of India. After all, Diageo has promised shareholders it will generate 50% of net sales from emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa by 2015. Walsh pushed a company that relied on western Europe and the US into emerging markets, buying the likes of Mey I\u00e7ki in Turkey, rum producer Ypi\u00f3ca and China's Shui Jing Fang \u2013 although he did not persuade Bernard Arnault to part with the remaining 75% stake in Mo\u00ebt Hennessy champagne. Walsh should be enjoying going out on a high, knowing that the share price has tripled under him and shareholders are delighted with his performance. Instead, he is staying put until June, during which time he will keep picking up his \u00a31.2m salary and receive \u00a380,000 a year to represent Diageo at the Scotch Whisky Association \u2013 a key body for the company given that Scotch is a third of the business. It seems the board thinks he needs to stick around to help bed in his successor, Ivan Menezes, who presented his first set of figures as chief executive last month, showing a rise in profits as US spirits drinkers kept the party going alongside those in Latin America and the Caribbean. In western Europe, however, sales were down. Crucially, net sales growth across the group, at 5%, was just below the 6% target set by Walsh. Diageo clearly feels he will be able to influence performance, as he is being allowed to keep all the shares he was awarded under previous bonus schemes that are not yet due to pay out, rather than scale them back in line with his departure terms. Millions of pounds could come his way if performance criteria see these awards pay out in the coming years \u2013 although Walsh might point out that he is unable to join this year's bonus scheme. Walsh is also being paid more than Menezes, who is on a salary of \u00a31m even though he is the one at the helm. So far, shareholders have not been fazed by this situation, or shown any concern about the old boss breathing down the new boss's neck. But another set of shareholders might soon take an interest. Walsh becomes chairman of contract caterer Compass in February, whose investors may become concerned if he is easily distracted. Miners lose their lustre in London Actor Phil Davis, seen recently in correctBBC3's Being Human, is the star of a new promotional film called \"A Price Worth Paying?\". The production has been commissioned by US law firm Dechert and focuses on thorny corporate problems such as \"the evaluation of risk at a time of acquisition in an emerging growth market \u2026 and the adequacy of the response to a serious allegation by a whistleblower\". It is quite a good joke as it goes, seeing as Dechert was the law firm hired by the Kazakhstan mining group Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) to conduct an internal investigation into some of the most prominent fraud allegations ever made against a FTSE 100 company. ENRC dispensed with Dechert's services in the spring \u2013 and soon after the Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation. As far as the City is concerned, the saga is about to end, with ENRC's three founding oligarchs on the verge of taking their creation private again. Last week, the miner effectively said farewell to London when it unveiled a 56% slump in interim profits \u2013 a parting gift to shareholders nursing 80% losses since 2011. Still, the plot of the real-life ENRC drama has formed part of a wider narrative. Combined with the nightmare of Bumi \u2013 financier Nat Rothschild's similarly costly Indonesian mining creation \u2013 and corporate governance concerns at London-listed mining vehicles such as Vedanta \u2013 observers suggest the City won't recover its appetite for emerging-market natural resources firms floating in the London. Investors will certainly be shyer in future: they will conduct more stringent due diligence and may be wary of firms where only a small free float of shares are not owned by founders and their friends. But it seems unlikely that future listings of this ilk will vanish. Investors may be sore, but for many City firms these mining companies have been a boon. ENRC's 2007 flotation was an earner for a string of investment banks, (Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley) aand similar mandates will lure City institutions to again sell emerging-market mining concerns. Likewise, investors may possess imperfect memories if they sense a profit. The City rarely shuns fees in return for a quieter life. That trade, it will consider, is not a price worth paying. Central bankers steer clear of Jackson Hole Jackson Hole, the annual wonkfest for the world's most powerful central bankers, takes place in the eponymous Wyoming resort this week.
