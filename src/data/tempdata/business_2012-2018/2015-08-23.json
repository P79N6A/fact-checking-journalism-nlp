      "bodyText": "Partners at Deloitte, one of Britain\u2019s biggest accountancy firms, will share a profit pool of \u00a3593m after a surge in revenues from its consultancy business. The profits mean that 721 partners will receive an average payout of \u00a3822,000, up almost 10% from \u00a3750,000 last year. The increase in profits was driven by a 10.5% rise in consulting revenues, with the group\u2019s core auditing practice growing by just 0.3%. It is the first time in three years that Deloitte partners have enjoyed an increase in the payout, with accountancy firms under pressure from new regulations that force large companies to change their auditors more regularly. The firm\u2019s senior partner and chief executive, David Sproul, took home \u00a32.8m, up from \u00a32.6m last year, but well down on the \u00a35.7m his predecessor John Connolly earned at the height of the boom in 2008. Back then, Deloitte\u2019s 651 partners pocketed \u00a3970,000 each. The mainstay of the firm\u2019s consultancy work was provided by Tesco, after Britain\u2019s biggest retailer uncovered an accounting scandal that led to the departure of several senior executives and sparked investigations by the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Reporting Council and a grocery industry watchdog. Tesco subsequently announced in May that Deloitte would become its new auditor, replacing PwC, which had held the role for 32 years. Deloitte declined to reveal how much Tesco had paid for the consultancy work. Sproul said the last 12 months had been marked by improved economic conditions and stronger business confidence. Deloitte also published its gender pay gap in the results, which stands at 17.8%. The firm said this was 1.3 points below the national average, and fell to 1.5 points when comparing male and female employees at the same grade. \u201cThis illustrates that for Deloitte, the issue is far less about how we pay our people and more about the number of women employed at senior grades,\u201d Sproul said. \u201cWe are determined to improve the retention of women within our firm and our representation of women in senior positions. \u201cWe have an ambition that 25% of our partners will be women by 2020, and in June we announced the promotion of 22 new female partners. We have also taken a number of steps to support these objectives, most recently introducing a return-to-work initiative designed to support women back into employment. \u201cWe believe that without a representative share of senior female employees, average pay will never truly equalise. This is something we are working very hard to resolve.\u201d Deloitte\u2019s results for the year to 31 May show total revenues rose 6.4% to \u00a32.7bn, with profits up 7% to \u00a3593m. Sproul said, however, that there had been hesitation in the economy in the run-up to the general election in May and warned of further uncertainties. \u201cConcerns remain over fragility in the eurozone and turbulence in the Chinese economy, whilst the UK\u2019s position in the EU must be resolved quickly to avoid it becoming a drag on business investment,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, our new financial year has started brightly and we are optimistic that overall, the outlook remains positive for the UK in an evolving global economy.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Farley, the former boss of Persimmon, is to collect nearly \u00a320m in shares this December, part of a \u00a3240m payout lined up for managers at the housebuilder. At least 140 senior executives will share the award \u2013 the first tranche of a 10-year bonus scheme that could be worth nearly \u00a3620m by 2021, based on Persimmon\u2019s closing share price on Friday. The managers will get the maximum award if they hit a target to return \u00a31.9bn to shareholders over the 10-year period beginning in 2011. The payouts, which mirror a multimillion-pound bonus scheme at Berkeley Homes, come amid a housing crisis in Britain that politicians on all sides argue is pushing up houses prices and rents. While housebuilders have increased the number of homes built in the last couple of years, there is a crisis in the availability of affordable homes in many parts of the country. This year, the campaign group Just Fair, whose members include Crisis, Oxfam, Amnesty International, Save the Children and Unicef UK, warned that the UK is in breach of its own United Nations human rights commitment to provide people with adequate homes because the housing problem is so serious. The government has said it has delivered more than 217,000 new affordable homes since 2010, but critics argue that this represents only a fraction of the number needed to meet demand. The announcement of Persimmon\u2019s bumper award comes after a 54% rise in its share price over the past year as the company\u2019s profits have been boosted by the government\u2019s help to buy scheme aimed at first-time buyers, cuts in stamp duty for the majority of buyers, and a relaxation of regulations on affordable house building. It emerged this month that the boss of Berkeley Homes, another of the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilders, received \u00a323.3m last year at the start of a series of payouts to the company\u2019s top executives that could add up to \u00a3500m in the next six years. Last week, Bovis said its profits had risen 9% to \u00a354m in the first half of this year after it completed a record 1,525 homes in the period. The following day, Persimmon reported a 31% rise in profits for the first half of the year. It said profit before tax was \u00a3272.8m for the six months to the end of June, up from \u00a3208.9m for the same time last year. While housebuilders\u2019 fortunes have soared under the current and previous governments, they also enjoyed a boost from Labour as it tried to meet housebuilding targets during the squeeze on mortgage lending in 2007 and 2008. Gordon Brown relaxed planning laws and committed at least \u00a3200m to purchasing unsold stock from house builders for use in social or affordable housing. Without this initiative and a raft of other measures at the time, many developers were expected to go bust, but instead survived to issue directors shares at rock bottom prices. Persimmon\u2019s strong run since 2011 will mean that Farley, who retired in April 2013, will be able to exercise an allotment of 966,400 shares on 31 December under a deal agreed by Persimmon\u2019s board in 2012. The payout comes because the company has already surpassed a target to pay out at least \u00a31.70 a share to investors by December this year. A 95p-a-share dividend paid at the end of June took the total payout since the scheme started in 2012 to \u00a32.40 per share. That achievement triggers share awards equivalent to nearly 40% of managers\u2019 total potential payout under the long-term incentive scheme. However, all except Farley will have to wait to exercise their shares until December 2017. A spokesman for Persimmon said: \u201cThe scheme was approved by shareholders in 2012. This is a long-term plan which is designed to drive outperformance. Since it was initiated, build volumes have grown 48% and shareholders have seen \u00a3734m in returns.\u201d In the first round of awards set for December, Jeff Fairburn, chief executive, is in line to receive 934,992 share options, worth \u00a319m at Friday\u2019s share price, while finance director Mike Killoran will collect 1.3m share options worth \u00a326.8m. Nigel Greenaway, boss of Persimmon\u2019s southern division, will be in line for 595,980 options worth \u00a312.27m. If they achieve their target of paying out \u00a31.9bn to shareholders by 2021, four senior directors, including David Jenkinson, the regional director for the north, as well as Farley, will share about a third of the total payout to managers. Fairburn alone could receive almost \u00a3100m. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 August 2015, as the opening paragragh referred to a \u00a31.9m payout instead of \u00a31.9bn.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "British berry sales soar as liquidiser revolution whirls on", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is the liquidiser revolution that is changing what we eat: sales of blueberries and raspberries are soaring as health-conscious shoppers embrace smoothies as a short cut to consuming one of their five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Demand for blueberries is up by nearly a third this year, while raspberry sales are ahead by 20%. Their popularity has been supported by the engineering of robust new varieties that survive the trip from field to fridge in a better condition. Laurence Olins, of growers\u2019 trade body British Summer Fruits, said: \u201cBerries used to be a luxury item, like strawberries and cream and Wimbledon. Now they are are omnipotent.\u201d The organisation calculates that sales of British strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries will top \u00a31bn this year, compared with about \u00a3300m in 2004. Sales of liquidisers like the \u00a390 Nutribullet have risen nearly 300% in the last year, according to market research firm GfK. John Lewis says it is selling one Nutribullet every four minutes as people seek new ways of consuming their recommended daily portions of fruit. Sales of strawberries are up by just 0.6% year on year, according to data from research firm Kantar Worldpanel, although some British farmers say sales of UK breeds are up by 20% after a good summer crop. There have long been claims about the health benefits of berries, which are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, with blueberries described by some nutritionists as a \u201csuperfood\u201d. This year, berries were named as the only fruit in the Mind diet, which is designed to help slow cognitive decline and the reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, although the NHS says that evidence for the health claims about blueberries is inconclusive. \u201cFor those interested in health, berries fit easily into their lifestyle, adding a touch of sweetness and vibrant flavour to homemade smoothies, juices or blends by only adding a small amount to a more \u2018basic\u2019 or traditional fruit,\u201d said food trends expert Imogen Birt at consultancy Dragon Rouge. British farmers are expected to produce 14,000 tonnes of raspberries this year compared with less than 12,000 tonnes last year, according to British Summer Fruits. New varieties give better yields \u2013 by as much as 50% compared with a few years ago \u2013 and farmers are expanding the amount of land they devote to the fruit. Another reason for the rise in UK production is the wider deployment of equipment such as polytunnels. Farmers are particularly keen to plant more raspberries, according to Olins, as the newest varieties produce greater yield, and high-quality berries. Raspberry varieties such as the berry jewel and Driscoll\u2019s maravilla are also bigger and sweeter. Tesco has claimed that the berry jewel, bred by a Kent-based grower, had helped increase demand for raspberries by 45% this year. Robert Pascall of Clock House Farm, one of the UK\u2019s biggest berry growers, said this year had been a fair one for raspberries and that he had increased the acreage devoted to the fruit by a third in the last three years. \u201cTraditional varieties had turned to juice in the fridge very quickly,\u201d he said. Pascall said British growers enjoyed a good deal of loyalty from shoppers who liked to buy local produce. \u201cWhen English fruit is available, it\u2019s taken first,\u201d he said. But year-round availability of raspberries \u2013 with imports from Portugal, Spain or Morocco \u2013 helped keep the fruit in people\u2019s minds when the British season came around, he added. Growers now hope that blackberries, which enjoyed a 6% increase in sales in the year to mid-July, according to Kantar, will be the next fruit to take off. Pascall said new varieties such as Driscoll\u2019s victoria were helping make them a more regular purchase. \u201cThe whole concept of blackberries has changed. People are eating them fresh rather than just putting them in a pie,\u201d he said. Discount supermarket chains such as Aldi and Lidl, which have significantly increased the amount of fresh fruit and vegetables they stock as part of tactics to attract regular shoppers, have also helped to increase sales by making fruit more affordable. Lidl, for example, said it was selling 30% more fruit this year than last and that its sales of strawberries were up by a fifth year on year.",

      "body": "<p>It is the liquidiser revolution that is changing what we eat: sales of blueberries and raspberries are soaring as health-conscious shoppers embrace smoothies as a short cut to consuming one of their five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. </p> <p>Demand for blueberries is up by nearly a third this year, while raspberry sales are ahead by 20%. Their popularity has been supported by the engineering of robust new varieties that survive the trip from field to fridge in a better condition.</p> <p>Laurence Olins, of growers\u2019 trade body British Summer Fruits, said: \u201cBerries used to be a luxury item, like strawberries and cream and Wimbledon. Now they are are omnipotent.\u201d The organisation calculates that sales of British strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries will top \u00a31bn this year, compared with about \u00a3300m in 2004. </p> <p>Sales of liquidisers like the \u00a390 Nutribullet have risen nearly 300% in the last year, according to market research firm GfK. John Lewis says it is selling one Nutribullet every four minutes as people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/aug/01/should-we-buy-nutribullet\" draggable=\"true\">seek new ways of consuming their recommended daily portions of fruit</a>.</p> <p>Sales of strawberries are up by just 0.6% year on year, according to data from research firm Kantar Worldpanel, although some British farmers say sales of UK breeds are up by 20% after a good summer crop.</p> <p>There have long been claims about the health benefits of berries, which are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, with blueberries described by some nutritionists as a \u201csuperfood\u201d. This year, berries were named as the only fruit in the Mind diet, which is designed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/05/diet-high-in-leafy-green-vegetables-may-slow-cognitive-decline-in-elderly-study\" draggable=\"true\">help slow cognitive decline and the reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s</a>, although the NHS says that evidence for <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/superfoods/pages/are-blueberries-a-superfood.aspx\" draggable=\"true\">the health claims about blueberries is inconclusive</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFor those interested in health, berries fit easily into their lifestyle, adding a touch of sweetness and vibrant flavour to homemade smoothies, juices or blends by only adding a small amount to a more \u2018basic\u2019 or traditional fruit,\u201d said food trends expert Imogen Birt at consultancy Dragon Rouge.</p> <p>British farmers are expected to produce 14,000 tonnes of raspberries this year compared with less than 12,000 tonnes last year, according to British Summer Fruits. New varieties give better yields \u2013 by as much as 50% compared with a few years ago \u2013 and farmers are expanding the amount of land they devote to the fruit. Another reason for the rise in UK production is the wider deployment of equipment such as polytunnels.</p> <p>Farmers are particularly keen to plant more raspberries, according to Olins, as the newest varieties produce greater yield, and high-quality berries. Raspberry varieties such as the berry jewel and Driscoll\u2019s maravilla are also bigger and sweeter. Tesco has claimed that the berry jewel, bred by a Kent-based grower, had helped increase demand for raspberries by 45% this year.</p> <p>Robert Pascall of Clock House Farm, one of the UK\u2019s biggest berry growers, said this year had been a fair one for raspberries and that he had increased the acreage devoted to the fruit by a third in the last three years. \u201cTraditional varieties had turned to juice in the fridge very quickly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Pascall said British growers enjoyed a good deal of loyalty from shoppers who liked to buy local produce. \u201cWhen English fruit is available, it\u2019s taken first,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "With a large tract of land behind their end-of-terrace Victorian house in south London, married couple Terry Green and Mickey Dell had long wanted to build on it a modern home for themselves. Their problem was that the only access was through a passage \u2013 similar to an open-ended garage \u2013 on the ground floor of their home that barely allowed for a vehicle to get through, and ruled out access for builders. The solution came when they found a way to construct a two-bedroom eco-house off site, using wood, then pieceit together like a jigsaw. Behind the precision method of production is Facit Homes, a young design-and-build company based in east London. It uses technology to cut down on waste, so saving time and materials. The company claims that the process also keeps the need for snagging to a minimum. The company \u2013 comprising architects, designers and builders \u2013 uses software to develop models that show every detail, even where electricity switches will be placed. The plywood parts of the house are then cut on a machine and transported to the site on pallets, where they are fitted together before the internal elements are put in. The idea for the method was born out of frustration, said co-founder Bruce Bell. While running an architecture practice, he found that designs and precision measurements would be open to interpretation once they went to site. \u201cYou are doing these drawing on computer down to the millimetre and then you are giving your drawings to somebody and they are getting out the tape measure and chopping up a bit of wood,\u201d Bell said. \u201cYou hand [the plans] to the builder and it is all this layer of interpretation and that just frustrated the hell out of me.\u201d The process would go from computer-design to traditional method, which he described as \u201cmessy and chaotic and horrible\u201d. The company calls its method D-Process, a digital manufacturing system focused on efficiency. \u201cIt is about moving things from being made by hand to being digitally fabricated to being produced where no human interference has come in there to add that layer of chaos to it,\u201d Bell said. Moving away from the architectural drawings more synonymous with building homes, Facit use 3D computer modelling to design every aspect of the house: heat detectors, smoke alarms, ducts, electric cabling and drainage systems are all included along with the rest of the internal workings. Each wall or feature can be individually pulled out and examined on screen. From there, details of the parts of the house are sent online to a cutting machine in a production yard of the company\u2019s office beside London Fields. The various pieces of the construction are cut from engineered spruce plywood and then stacked on pallets ready to be brought to the location of the build. Where there is space to do so, such as a country site, the cutting machine can be moved there and production done on site. While the parts of the house are being cut on the machines, drainage and ground work will be taking place. \u201cWe cut these components, these parts and put them together and the components are numbered and then stacked and then shipped to the house or we ship the machine to the building site,\u201d Bell said. When the components get to site, the house is constructed exactly as dictated on the computer screen with numbered sections fitting into each other. With the more efficient production method of the wooden frame houses comes the savings in time and materials, claims the company, which they say gets rid of snag lists and over-runs on site. \u201cWhat we are able to do is turn what is traditionally chaos into a science,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWe know how much it is going to be. We know how many components, how many square metres. We have designed it. We can change the design if it is going to be too expensive and then we are in complete control of the whole process.\u201d The 15-person company is building its 11th and 12th houses for its clients, many of which come after existing homes are knocked down to be replaced by the modern Facit models. The cost per square metre of the homes ranges between \u00a31,900 and \u00a32,400, putting them firmly in the high-end market. Because of their efficiencies, says Bell, they still come in at 15% cheaper than what a traditional process would cost, as they have to spend much less time on site. Costs would come down if a number of houses were built at the same time along similar models, Bell said, which Facit might do in the future. In south London, Green and Dell are carrying out the final preparations to move into their new 220 sq-metre home, which cost \u00a3500,000 to build. Green, a retired geophysicist, said part of the reason that they used the company was because the construction method allowed them to access the back of the house. Construction of the whole project took eight months, he said, and the detail was \u201cmillimetre-perfect\u201d. \u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website, where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "bodyText": "And so it begins. Shares are falling, currency markets are in turmoil. The price of oil is going through the floor, burning the fingers of speculators who have made the wrong bets on borrowed money. Welcome to the crash of August 2015. Financial markets being what they are, there is every chance there will be a bounce on Monday. Investors will be sniffing out bargains and be hoping that the scale of last week\u2019s falls will prompt a response from central banks. Even in the most severe bear markets, prices never go down in a straight line. But don\u2019t be fooled. This could get ugly. Recessions are years, sometimes decades, in the making. But they always have a trigger. In 1973, it was the quadrupling of the oil price by Opec in response to the Yom Kippur war. In 2007, it was the announcement that Banque Paribas was having problems with three of its funds that specialised in US sub-prime debt. If this really is the start of something, it will be easy for historians to name the catalyst: the decision by Beijing to devalue its currency on 11 August. China\u2019s central bank said the currency move was all part of a long-term liberalisation plan and had nothing to do with the state of the economy. Few believed it. In the past year, Beijing has run down its foreign reserves by more than $300bn in order to maintain the over-valued exchange rate of the yuan \u2013 also known as the renminbi \u2013 against the dollar. It has now abandoned that policy and said that in future the yuan\u2019s exchange rate would be determined by demand and supply and movements in other major currencies. Unsurprisingly, that was taken as a strong hint that there would be further falls in the yuan, which when adjusted for inflation has appreciated by 50% against the dollar in the past 10 years. China\u2019s currency no longer looks undervalued; it looks overvalued, making life a lot tougher for Chinese exporters competing with other Asian countries, including Japan, that have seen devaluations. There were strong suspicions that China\u2019s growth figures have been doctored to disguise a hard landing; suspicions intensified by last Friday\u2019s worse-than-expected survey of manufacturing. Fear rippled through financial markets. Two questions were asked. Did the slowdown in China mean that demand for global oil and metals would fall? And was China about to export deflation to the rest of the world through a weaker currency? To which the answers were yes and yes. Capital came flooding out of the emerging market countries seen as particularly vulnerable, and their currencies fell. Shares in Germany fell because of the economy\u2019s exposure to China. Shares in London fell because the FTSE 100 is stuffed full of mining and commodity companies. Shares on Wall Street fell because they were falling everywhere else and because of concerns that the Federal Reserve is gearing up to raise interest rates next month. That fear is now almost certainly groundless. The Fed is not going to tighten policy while the global markets are in turmoil. Nor is the Bank of England going to raise interest rates in the UK this year. Falling commodity prices will drive inflation even further below target and the falls in the exchange rates of emerging market countries will result in deflation being exported to the west. The events of the past couple of weeks should come as no surprise. There have been more than 50 serious financial crises since the breakup of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, and the world was due one. That\u2019s because, as the US economist Thomas Palley has noted, the current economic model is \u201cunchanged and exhausted\u201d. The reason the global economy hit the wall in 2007 was that it relied on the US as the consumer of last resort. But Americans could not consume more out of wage growth because real income growth was negligible. They borrowed to consume, relying on ever-rising house prices to keep themselves financially afloat. Then the real estate bubble burst and the sky fell in. The post-crisis world doesn\u2019t look that much different. Central banks resorted to quantitative easing in order to prevent the money supply shrinking. The Federal Reserve bought $4.5tn (\u00a32.9tn) of assets in three phases of QE and will doubtless announce a fourth if a marked slowdown in activity threatens to intensify deflationary pressure. Yet even central bankers are starting to doubt whether QE has done much good. Stephen Williamson,vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, has just issued a study in which he concludes : \u201cThere is no work, to my knowledge, that establishes a link from QE to the ultimate goals of the Fed \u2013 inflation and real economic activity. Indeed casual evidence suggests that QE has been ineffective in increasing inflation.\u201d The economic story of the US since the Great Recession ended has been of QE fuelling a six-year bull market in shares at a time when economic growth has been weak and productivity growth even weaker. There has been no trickle-down effect, and no attempt to redress the main structural problem of the past three decades: the severing of the link between productivity and wages. The top 10% of US households took 116% of the income gains when the US economy was recovering between 2009 and 2012. The other 90% of US citizens saw their living standards fall. Inequality has widened.

But, as in the US, too much of China\u2019s boom was down to an unsustainable build-up of debt. So here\u2019s the position. Consumers in the west are being encouraged, in most cases against their better judgment, to take advantage of low interest rates to load up on more debt. But memories of last time are still relatively fresh. China wants better-balanced \u2013 and slower \u2013 growth. Every country bar none thinks it needs to export more and is prepared to indulge in beggar-my-neighbour tactics to do so. This does not stack up. The model can only be kept going \u2013 just about \u2013 so long as interest rates remain at historically low levels and asset prices are kept buoyant through a constant drip-feed of QE. The crisis of 2007-09 was a lesson to policymakers that international policy cooperation was needed to increase global demand. It was a lesson that there needed to be higher investment in infrastructure and skills to raise productivity. It was a lesson that an economic model based on widening inequality was unviable. It was a lesson about the risks of uncontrolled capital flows. Clearly the lesson wasn\u2019t big enough.",

      "body": "<p>And so it begins. Shares are falling, currency markets are in turmoil. The price of oil is going through the floor, burning the fingers of speculators who have made the wrong bets on borrowed money. Welcome to the crash of August 2015.</p> <p>Financial markets being what they are, there is every chance there will be a bounce on Monday. Investors will be sniffing out bargains and be hoping that the scale of last week\u2019s falls will prompt a response from central banks. Even in the most severe bear markets, prices never go down in a straight line. But don\u2019t be fooled. This could get ugly.</p> <p>Recessions are years, sometimes decades, in the making. But they always have a trigger. In 1973, it was the quadrupling of the oil price by Opec in response to the Yom Kippur war. In 2007, it was the announcement that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/09/usnews.internationalnews\">Banque Paribas was having problems with three of its funds that specialised in US sub-prime debt</a>. If this really is the start of something, it will be easy for historians to name the catalyst: the decision by Beijing to devalue its currency on 11 August.</p> <p>China\u2019s central bank said the currency move was all part of a long-term liberalisation plan and had nothing to do with the state of the economy. Few believed it. In the past year, Beijing has run down its foreign reserves by more than $300bn in order to maintain the over-valued exchange rate of the yuan \u2013 also known as the renminbi \u2013 against the dollar. It has now abandoned that policy and said that in future the yuan\u2019s exchange rate would be determined by demand and supply and movements in other major currencies.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, that was taken as a strong hint that there would be further falls in the yuan, which when adjusted for inflation has appreciated by 50% against the dollar in the past 10 years. China\u2019s currency no longer looks undervalued; it looks overvalued, making life a lot tougher for Chinese exporters competing with other Asian countries, including Japan, that have seen devaluations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/20/stock-market-correction-new-global-financial-crisis\">Stock market correction: is this a new global financial crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were strong suspicions that China\u2019s growth figures have been doctored to disguise a hard landing; suspicions intensified by last Friday\u2019s worse-than-expected survey of manufacturing.</p> <p>Fear rippled through financial markets. Two questions were asked. Did the slowdown in China mean that demand for global oil and metals would fall? And was China about to export deflation to the rest of the world through a weaker currency? To which the answers were yes and yes. Capital came flooding out of the emerging market countries seen as particularly vulnerable, and their currencies fell.</p> <p> Shares in Germany fell because of the economy\u2019s exposure to China. Shares in London fell because the FTSE 100 is stuffed full of mining and commodity companies. Shares on Wall Street fell because they were falling everywhere else and because of concerns that the Federal Reserve is gearing up to raise interest rates next month.</p> <p>That fear is now almost certainly groundless. The Fed is not going to tighten policy while the global markets are in turmoil. Nor is the Bank of England going to raise interest rates in the UK this year. Falling commodity prices will drive inflation even further below target and the falls in the exchange rates of emerging market countries will result in deflation being exported to the west. <br></p> <p>The events of the past couple of weeks should come as no surprise. There have been more than 50 serious financial crises since the breakup of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, and the world was due one. That\u2019s because, as the US economist Thomas Palley has noted, the current economic model is \u201cunchanged and exhausted\u201d.</p> <p>The reason the global economy hit the wall in 2007 was that it relied on the US as the consumer of last resort. But Americans could not consume more out of wage growth because real income growth was negligible. They borrowed to consume, relying on ever-rising house prices to keep themselves financially afloat. Then the real estate bubble burst and the sky fell in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/22/could-china-crisis-spread-to-emerging-markets\">China syndrome: how the slowdown could spread to the Brics and beyond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The post-crisis world doesn\u2019t look that much different. Central banks resorted to quantitative easing in order to prevent the money supply shrinking. The Federal Reserve bought $4.5tn (\u00a32.9tn) of assets in three phases of QE and will doubtless announce a fourth if a marked slowdown in activity threatens to intensify deflationary pressure.</p> <p>Yet even central bankers are starting to doubt whether QE has done much good. Stephen Williamson,vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2015/2015-015.pdf\">just issued a study in which he concludes</a> : \u201cThere is no work, to my knowledge, that establishes a link from QE to the ultimate goals of the Fed \u2013 inflation and real economic activity. Indeed casual evidence suggests that QE has been ineffective in increasing inflation.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The economic story of the US since the Great Recession ended has been of QE fuelling a six-year bull market in shares at a time when economic growth has been weak and productivity growth even weaker. There has been no trickle-down effect, and no attempt to redress the main structural problem of the past three decades: the severing of the link between productivity and wages. The top 10% of US households took 116% of the income gains when the US economy was recovering between 2009 and 2012. The other 90% of US citizens saw their living standards fall. Inequality has widened.</p> <p>For a while, it seemed that China would take on the role as the world economy\u2019s consumer of last resort, with its strong growth good news for metals producers in Brazil, oil companies in Angola and manufacturers in Germany. But, as in the US, too much of China\u2019s boom was down to an unsustainable build-up of debt.</p> <p>So here\u2019s the position.
