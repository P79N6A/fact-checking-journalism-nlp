      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s energy networks are not ready for a surge in electric cars and solar panels that is coming within the next few years, according to a report. Clusters of the battery powered cars could result in 1% of the UK experiencing unplanned drops in voltage \u2013 potentially damaging electronic equipment \u2013 without action by 2020, the Green Alliance said. The thinktank warned that as few as six electric vehicles located near one another, most likely in an affluent neighbourhood, could lead to such \u201cbrownouts\u201d. Charging one car requires a similar amount of electricity as a typical home uses in three days, and simultaneous demand at a local level could damage networks without costly reinforcements. Ministers also recently called on electric car owners to ensure they are not charging at times of peak energy demand. Network operators want people to use smart chargers, which can defer when cars are topped up, but most of the 12,000-plus charging points in the UK are \u201cdumb\u201d, with smart technology largely only used in pilot projects. The Green Alliance said that by 2025 up to 700,000 electricity users could suffer blackouts due to a lack of non-smart chargers. \u201cThe government should say all chargers from now on must be smart. Once they\u2019re in, it\u2019s very expensive to retrofit them,\u201d said Dustin Benton, the author of the report. Distribution network operators, who connect the national grid at a local level to homes and businesses, fear clustering of electric cars, but say such hotspots have not yet become a serious problem for their infrastructure. However, the Green Alliance noted that electric car sales were up 56% last year on 2015 figures, and said falling costs would drive a rapid uptake. The thinktank predicted a similar growth in the next few years in the installation of solar panels, which are already disrupting the energy system. Falling solar power prices mean that by 2020 it will make economic sense for commercial building owners to install solar even without subsidies, the report said. The combination of solar and household batteries such as Tesla\u2019s Powerwall could result in houses being able to supply their own electricity independently for months at a time by 2025, it added. While 850,000 homes in the UK have solar panels, few have installed batteries \u2013 but that could change with products launched by one of the big six energy companies. E.ON said on Wednesday that it would begin selling battery and solar packages from \u00a37,500, arguing the combination of the two would elevate solar \u201cto the next level\u201d. The Green Alliance said it thought electric cars and solar would soon be viable without subsidy, which showed the government would no longer be able constrain them \u2013 meaning it was vital action was taken now to manage their impact. This impact could include damage to power networks from electric car charging or solar unable to connect to the grid because of bottlenecks. That in turn could trigger \u201cemergency policymaking\u201d, which Benton said would be bad for investment. The thinktank made several recommendations, including a proposal for a new independent system designer, separate from National Grid, to manage the integration of small-scale energy into the wider electricity supply network. \u201cWe need to actively govern how we use these technologies,\u201d said Benton. A National Grid spokesman said: \u201cGrowing use of solar power and electric cars will change the way the energy system is managed, but National Grid has been consistently dealing with evolution in the energy sector for decades, and these latest changes also present great opportunities. \u201cFor example, electric vehicles can be used to help feed energy back into the system at key times, while solar power will play a crucial role in providing clean energy as coal-generated power stops being used.\u201d The body representing distribution network operators said it was already trialling innovative new technologies to more actively manage its members\u2019 networks.",

      "bodyText": "The latest IMF world economic outlook released on Tuesday is the most positive for years, but it also highlights the continued risks from nationalistic and protectionist policies and the impact of policies and technology changes that reduce the share of income going to workers. For the past eight or nine years, the IMF world economic outlook has been pretty soul crushing. Dismal doesn\u2019t begin to convey the mood. Consider that the titles for the outlook have been such joyous reads as \u201cFinancial Stress, Downturns, and Recoveries\u201d, \u201cCrisis and Recovery\u201d, \u201cSlowing Growth, Rising Risks\u201d, \u201cLegacies, Clouds, Uncertainties\u201d and the one from April last year, \u201cToo Slow for Too Long\u201d. So it is with some relief to see a bit of positivity infect the IMF. The most recent update, is titled, \u201cGaining Momentum?\u201d The question mark of course lets us know that the folk at the IMF remain the sober pessimistic economists we know and love \u2013 and the blog post accompanying the report is titled \u201cGaining Momentum \u2013 For Now\u201d. But at least they do think things are on the improve \u2013 even if only for a while. In October last year the IMF was predicting Australia\u2019s GDP growing in 2017 by just 2.7% \u2013 they\u2019ve now increased that to 3.1% \u2013 the most optimistic they\u2019ve been since 2012. They are also more positive about growth in China, the US and very much so in the UK, where the worries of last year about the immediate impact of the Brexit have been pushed out a few years: Across the world, the prediction is for global GDP growth of 3.5% this year \u2013 up from the prediction of 3.4% made last October. Most of the improvement is coming from a better outlook for advanced economies \u2013 especially in the Euro area: But the outlook beyond this year rather suggests that the answer to the IMF question about gathering momentum is \u201cnope\u201d. The growth for 2018 is largely unchanged, except for the UK where there has been a big downgrade and the US, which has a big upgrade. The downgrade for the UK is due to the effects of Brexit, where the IMF predicts diminished medium-term growth prospects \u201cbecause of the expected increase in barriers to trade and migration\u201d. And, crucially, the improvement in 2018 in the US is based on the assumption of \u201ca sizable fiscal stimulus in the United States, reflecting the anticipated changes in US federal government tax policy\u201d. Given the difficulty Donald Trump apparently has doing anything other than finding his way to a golf course, and his utter incompetence in passing any major legislative measures, that is a very big assumption: Looking out to 2022 (which is so far off, that admittedly it is of limited worth), the IMF sees Australia\u2019s growth rarely going above the long-term average of 3%: The IMF however does predict the unemployment rate will fall below 5% \u2013 a much more optimistic outlook than it has had for the past two years: Mostly this increased optimism is because Australia exports iron ore, coal and gas. The IMF suggests that our economy will improve along with similar commodity-exporting nations like Norway and Canada. But this is based on the proviso that monetary policy remains \u201caccommodative\u201d (ie interest rates stay low) and there are \u201csupportive fiscal policies or infrastructure investment\u201d and \u201cless drag from declining investment in the commodity sector.\u201d The IMF\u2019s outlook not only examined economic growth, it also researched the impact of economic policies and technological changes that have reduced the share of national income going to labour. The IMF found that over the past 25 years, the labour share of income has declined in 29 of the largest 50 economies: One measure of the labour share of income is the real unit cost of labour. In Australia there were substantial falls of this measure from 1999 until the GFC: The IMF suggests that across most nations, technological advancement is the main reason for the falls. It also found that the decline in share of income going to labour caused by technology and global integration \u201chas been particularly sharp for middle-skilled labour\u201d \u2013 with the biggest falls occurring in manufacturing. But while falling real unit labour costs are trumpeted by businesses as crucial for maintaining Australia\u2019s \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d, the IMF found that there was a strong correlation between falling shares of income going to labour and increasing inequality. Looking at labour shares and Gini coefficients across advanced economies since 1961, the IMF found a clear link between the two \u2013 economies with lower shares of income going to labour were more likely to have higher levels of inequality: But crucially the IMF study also found that the differences were not just across different countries, but within countries. They found that as the labour share of income fell within countries, the level of inequality was also likely to rise: These results fit nicely with a new study published this week that found taxation \u201creforms\u201d since the mid-1980s in Australia, New Zealand and Norway did nothing to improve economic growth, and instead just increased inequality \u2013 especially with more of the nations\u2019 incomes going to the richest 1%: The study\u2019s authors conclude, these tax reforms, which lowered the top tax rate and made the system less progressive, did not \u201cincrease the size of the cake\u201d, but did provide the wealthiest with a bigger share. In the period ahead, where the IMF, despite its muted optimism still predicts below average economic growth, the report highlights the importance of governments focusing on inequality. As the IMF outlook notes, \u201cinequality can fuel social tension, and recent research suggests that it can also harm economic growth.\u201d Governments ignore inequality at their peril \u2013 not only because of the harm it will do to their own election prospects, but also the prospects to the economy.",

      "bodyText": "British businesses have lived through some turbulent times recently (like the rest of us....). So a snap election probably won\u2019t cause as much disruption as the shock EU referendum vote. So argues Edmund Parker, partner at legal firm Mayer Brown: \u201cBrexit brought about a significant pause in deal making. However, yesterday\u2019s announcement of a snap election seems less likely to have the same impact on deals and financial activity, as many of the polls believe May will boost her majority, and this will give her a stronger hand in Brexit negotiations, with fewer factions to please.\u201d \u201cHowever, we\u2019re living in uncertain times and if anything changes between now and the 8 June, we still may see a slowdown in activity. The starting gun has only just been fired. Ultimately, uncertainty is becoming the new normal and the markets are just getting on with it. To a large degree, this latest round of \u2018uncertainty\u2019 is just a different shade of the same.\u201d The pound is coming under some late pressure tonight. After a steady day, sterling is now down almost half a cent against the US dollar at $1.2795, having hit a six-month high last night. After initially hailing Theresa May\u2019s push for a snap election, some in the City are now pondering exactly how the campaign will play out. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says many traders are still cautious about the pound\u2019s prospects. The market still remains in a negative mindset for sterling with short positions still elevated. Some investors may also be wondering whether the Conservatives are really nailed on for a landslide, as opinion polls suggest. Richard Benson of currency fund Millennium Global explains (via Reuters):. \u201cIt isn\u2019t quite the one-way street that a lot of people have painted over the last 20 hours. With a 20-point lead off the starting blocs, I would have thought the risk is more that it will narrow than grow. A positive surprise from the French election would also presumably see a squeeze higher in the euro after the weekend.\u201d BREAKING! Edginess over the UK snap general election has sent the FTSE 100 index deeper into the red, wiping out all its gains so far this year. The blue-chip index has just closed for the night, down 33 points at 7114 points. That adds to the 180 points lost yesterday, which wiped \u00a346bn off the index (we\u2019ve lost another \u00a38bn today). This takes the FTSE 100 down to an 11-week low, and means the index is now lower than on 1st January 2017. Fashion firm Burberry was the big faller, down almost 8%, after it warned of uncertain trading conditions and falling sales in the US this morning. Energy companies also lost ground. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, blames \u201congoing political uncertainty\u201d for spurring investors to sell shares. The FTSE has suffered a somewhat disappointing end to Wednesday\u2019s trade, as early gains were eroded in the wake of the vote to dissolve parliament ahead of a snap General Election in seven weeks\u2019 time. After yesterday\u2019s dramatic crash for the FTSE, today has been more about stability as traders seek to ascertain whether such a dramatic selloff is really justified ahead of what looks likely to be a landslide for the Conservatives. However, the FTSE 250 index (which is arguably a better measure of the UK economy) has closed higher. It gained 119 points to 19,417, up 0.6%, taking it closer to the record high hit last Thursday. Here\u2019s another chart showing how the FTSE 250 has caught up with the FTSE 100, after suffering much heavier losses immediately after the EU referendum: Back in parliament Sajid Javid, the secretary of state for Communities and Local Government, has been answering questions about Britain\u2019s housing problem. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the key points: Sophie Barnes of Inside Housing also tweeted from the session: Bloomberg has spotted that the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has been outperforming the larger FTSE 100 for several weeks, and by more than ever before. The white line on this chart shows how the gap between the two indices has risen (a higher number means the 250 has extended its lead). That\u2019s partly because the massive companies on the FTSE 100 are vulnerable to sterling (as they earn money overseas). Mining companies have also been hurt by volatile commodity prices. There\u2019s a general feeling in the City that Theresa May will get a larger majority on June 8, and this will strengthen her hand in the battles ahead with Brussels. That\u2019s why the pound jumped so high yesterday, and had held those gains today. But.... just packing the House of Commons with more Tory MPs won\u2019t make the Brexit talks a breeze, when it comes down to the cost of leaving the EU, and the details of a trade deal. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga suspects that the pound could have rebounded too far, given the uncertainty. He says: Questions should be raised over the sustainability of the current Sterling rally, especially when considering how political uncertainties and Brexit woes remain current. Investors are still pondering over the economic future of the United Kingdom after Brexit, with questions still being raised about whether the two-year timeframe will be enough to secure a deal. Although the European Union has stated that they will not punish Britain during negotiations, the thought of the EU making an example out of Britain to prevent others from leaving the bloc does linger in the background. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, also spies problems ahead: Evidently, investors are hopeful that the UK Prime Minister will have a stronger mandate to secure the UK\u2019s EU exit from the EU as she will be able to push back hard deadlines for a trade deal until the next election in 2022, assuming she wins this one. But that is the hope, in reality things might turn out differently, as US investors are starting to find out with regards to Donald Trump. Clearly, Brexit-related uncertainty will remain in place for a while yet. It\u2019s official! Britain is heading back to the ballot box in June. 522 MPs have voted in favour of a snap general election, comfortably more than was needed. But 13 MPs voted against, which means there were around 100 abstentions. Our Politics Live blog has full details: There\u2019s not immediate market reaction -- obviously it would have been a shock if MPs had voted the other way. Over in parliament, MPs are now voting on whether to hold a general election on June 8th. Theresa May needs a two-thirds majority, under the Fixed Term Parliament Act - which should be a breeze as most opposition MPs have said they\u2019ll support the PM\u2019s plan. Just in: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy could be threatened by Brexit uncertainty. In its new Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF flags up that the financial system could be weakened if banks are forced to leave the City, to maintain full access to the EU. The fund says: \u201cUncertainty about the negotiation outcome is pushing banks to anticipate Brexit-related costs. Banks have started preparing for a worst-case scenario, in which no agreement is reached, to avoid any possible disruption to their services. Duplication of some activities and business structures in different locations seems inevitable and represents an extra cost. Operating in different regulatory regimes will also increase the burden on banks. The Report also flags up China\u2019s economy, Europe\u2019s weak banks, and Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies as potential causes of financial instability. Here\u2019s our full story from Washington: Despite this week\u2019s losses, the FTSE 100 is still up over 12% since last June\u2019s referendum. However, it\u2019s NOT as simple as that, because the index is priced in sterling (so a weaker pound pushed up share prices). In dollar terms, the Footsie is down around 1% since the Brexit vote: The FTSE 100 is continuing to slide, adding to yesterday\u2019s 2.5% tumble. The blue-chip index is now down 25 points at 7122, its lowest point since 2nd February, and putting it deeper into the red for 2017. Burberry are still the biggest faller, down almost 6%, after reporting slowing sales growth this morning. Silver miner Fresnillo are close behind, down 3%, followed by gold producer Randgold (-2.4%) , Rolls-Royce (-2.3%) and Royal Dutch Shell (-2%). Analysts at RBC Capital Markets are predicting that the Liberal Democratic party will gain seats on June 8th. The Lib Dems currently have just nine seats, having suffered a near-wipeout in the 2015 election. But their vocal opposition to Brexit is likely to win support from the 48% of voters wanted to Remain in the EU last year. RBC say: The recent opinion polls suggest a strong lead of the Conservative party over the biggest opposition party, Labour. The latest set of polls indicates that there will be a 19% lead in the popular vote. This would almost certainly increase the number of seats in the House of Commons from the current 17 to a much more sizeable majority. Nonetheless, a lot can change between now and June 8 and it seems likely that the Liberal Democrats will be able to increase their number of MPs from the current setting as they are the only party openly campaigning on a pro-European tickets. In this respect heightened volatility in UK assets as we approach the election. After a calm morning, the pound has held onto Tuesday\u2019s strong gains. Sterling is broadly unchanged against the US dollar right now, at $1.285, and against the euro at \u20ac1.197. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says currency traders are hoping that Britain can avoid a particularly hard Brexit: Through May\u2019s snap election, she at last has the opportunity to take full control of the Brexit process and minimise the political uncertainty which has beset her tenure that had several implications for the currency. Once again, the narrative of sterling has changed from one of uncertainty and volatility in the days following the referendum, to the relative stability of a defined negotiation period following the triggering of Article 50, and now to the possibility of renewed strength as the prospect of \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit and a more coherent negotiating position from the UK\u2019s government becomes a possibility. Morgan Stanley has predicted that the snap general election means Britain is almost certain to leave the single market. But it also reduces the risk of a disorderly Brexit (assuming the polls are right, and the Conservatives win a larger majority). That\u2019s according to a new research note from MS on the general election. Here\u2019s the highlights: Why it virtually rules out staying in the single market: On Brexit, we expect the \u201csovereignty\u201d red lines on UK control over borders, courts and laws, which were set out in the Lancaster House speech, to be put into the Conservative manifesto, effectively ruling out a Remain or EEA outcome. A Conservative government would then imply leaving the single market: either a WTO-like outcome where the UK re-establishes national control but at the cost of economic barriers with the EU, or a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d FTA outcome where the UK re-establishes national control while avoiding major barriers to business with the EU. Why it reduces the risk of a disorderly Brexit: In the base case the UK government would have the Parliamentary majority to push through difficult decisions to seal a deal. In addition, the next Parliament should have time to complete Brexit negotiations before the next scheduled UK election in June 2022. Back in the markets, Britain\u2019s medium-sized companies, are bouncing back from yesterday\u2019s selloff. The FTSE 250 index, which is packed with UK mid-cap firms, has now jumped by 1% today to 19,491 points. Familiar firms such as high street chain Dixons Carphone (+3.7%), holiday firm Thomas Cook (+3.3%) and builders merchants Travis Perkins (+3.5) are among the top risers. Chris Beauchamp of City spread betting firm IG says the FTSE 250 has \u201cleapt out of bed\u201d as investors look to buy up UK-focused assets. As the shock fades from the election announcement, there is a real possibility of a rebound in UK stocks, since yesterday\u2019s fall provided the kind of dip that bargain hunters have been praying for over the past few weeks..... Signs of weakness in the US market will give cause for concern, but overall it still looks like a strong update that points to more growth further down the line. This takes the FTSE 250 back towards last week\u2019s record high (19,525 points), and claws back most of Tuesday\u2019s losses. But its big brother, the FTSE 100, is lagging behind - having shed all its gains for 2017 this morning following yesterday\u2019s 2.5% tumble. Many British firms will welcome the June election, as it should provide a little more certainty about the future. So argues Karen Briggs, Head of Brexit (great job title!) at KPMG, who says: \u201cUK PLC understands the Brexit journey will be a bumpy one. We are getting used to a new normal where political shocks are commonplace, foreign exchange shifts dramatic and the UK\u2019s labour supply in transition. \u201cBusinesses desperately want to make a success of Brexit but their fear has long been that the sheer scale of the negotiations mean they cannot be completed in two years. This might mean vital details in everything from finance, to life sciences and aviation being missed or delayed - upending business models and affecting jobs. \u201cThe prospect of a government now serving until 2022 creates a window for even clearer negotiating objectives and a less frenzied implementation period. Business will hope this makes for a smoother Brexit with more time to fix the intricate detail of a good deal and adequate time to prepare for necessary change.\u201d City traders have another market to watch....and this one shows Theresa May winning a majority of around 100 seats on June 8th , up from just 17 today. Newsflash from Brussels: Eurozone inflation fell to 1.5% in March, down from 2% in February. That\u2019s mainly due to Easter falling in April, and matches the earlier \u2018flash\u2019 reading. It\u2019s rather lower than in the UK, where price are now rising by 2.3% year-on-year, as this chart hows.... Kathleen Brooks of City Index believes the UK pound will keep rallying against the US dollar as the British election campaign picks up. The pound might even hit $1.35 (from $1.28 today), she argues, if the Conservatives look likely to win a large majority. In and of itself the UK election shouldn\u2019t be a key driver of UK asset prices, particularly if Theresa May wins a landslide, as she is expected to do. This election shouldn\u2019t change domestic policy too much, and Brexit was going to happen with or without the vote on June 8th. However, if the polls are to be believed about the Tory lead over Labour then this election could add certainty to the UK\u2019s Brexit positioning stance and to domestic policy for the next 5 years, and that is good for markets. For GBP/USD 1.30 is now in view, and as we lead up to the election then we could see more unwinding of the GBP/USD short positions which could take us to 1.35 around the time of the election result. Viktor Nossek, director of research at ETF provider WisdomTree in Europe, says investors expect Theresa May to do well on June 8th. He says: The sharp jump in the pound yesterday against a number of currencies, including the US dollar, was an acknowledgment that the snap election is likely to lead to more political certainty, given the Conservative Party\u2019s lead in the polls. There would be far more downside risk for the Prime Minister if she had waited another 12 months before acting, but by deciding to hold an election on June 8th - with the sentiment in the UK still in favour of Brexit - it means the Tories will be able to cement their position and allow the PM to get the political support needed to follow her agenda. The move has also given the opposition little room to prepare, and call for, an alternative to Brexit, or a watered-down version of it. Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities, told Bloomberg News that the snap UK election has unnerved some investors. The market dislikes uncertainty. Investors had already been a little on edge over the French presidential election, and now the UK general election is creating further uncertainty in Europe. Here\u2019s a list of the leading risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. One of the MPs who did the most to hold Britain\u2019s business leaders to account is stepping down. Iain Wright, the Hartlepool MP who chaired the Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy Committee, has announced on Twitter he won\u2019t run in the June 8 election. Wright\u2019s committee held some important inquiries this parliament, probing the scandal of the collapse of BHS and the unacceptable working practices at Sports Direct. Britain\u2019s retailers should be celebrating yesterday\u2019s surge in the pound, as it will make it cheaper to import goods from abroad. Analyst Nick Bubb comments: Well, the Fixed Term Parliament Act was meant to bring us \u201cstability\u201d and \u201ccertainty\u201d, but we are now told we need a General Election on June 8th for that\u2026Time will tell whether an increased Tory majority will deliver the \u201csofter\u201d Brexit the City hopes for, but retailers will be pleased if sterling has now bottomed out\u2026 Fashion group Burberry is helping to pull the FTSE 100 into the red today, after reporting underwhelming results. Burberry\u2019s shares have shed 6.7%, their worst fall since October, after reporting a sales slowdown, due to tougher conditions in the US. CEO Christopher Bailey said the market was \u2018uncertain\u2019, despite strong sales in the UK as the weak pound encouraged tourists to buy Burberry items here. The company\u2019s finance officer has told reporters that Burberry remains committed to UK manufacturing, despite the Brexit uncertainty, and hopes that the UK will secure a trade deal with Europe that avoids returning to World Trade Organisation rules. Our Politics Live blog is up and running, and tracking all the election action. Theresa May has already been interviewed on the Today Programme, where she\u2019s ruled out a second EU referendum, and defended her decision to call a general election: The FTSE 250 index, which is a better gauge of the UK economy than the FTSE 100, is having a slightly better morning. It\u2019s clawed back 43 points, or 0.23%, having lost over 220 points yesterday. The pound is holding steady this morning - which is another way of saying that it\u2019s not done much yet. Sterling is trading at $1.284 against the US dollar, having surged to a six-month high of $1.29 late last night. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says the currency markets are closely focused on the pound. Yesterday\u2019s surprise move by U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May calling a snap election sent the British pound to its highest levels against the US dollar since October. The 400-pip move [from $1.25 to $1.29] from low to high is not a reflection of the short-term fundamental outlook for the U.K.\u2019s economy. But traders expect the snap election to lead to stronger negotiation powers with the EU on Brexit terms, thus a softer exit. Today we expect May to win parliamentary support for the snap election, but the reaction on the Pound to be mild, given it\u2019s already priced in. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons that low turnout might scupper Theresa May\u2019s hopes for a whopping majority: While advertising magnate Sir Martin Sorrell fears the election might have a dampening effect on the economy: Britain\u2019s leading stock index has shed all its gains for 2017, as Theresa May\u2019s election call continues to grip the City. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 17 points at the start of trading, adding to the 180 points it lost yesterday. That takes the blue-chip index down to 7130 points, below the closing price of 7142 on 30 December 2016. That\u2019s also the lowest level since late January. Yesterday\u2019s selloff was mainly due to a surge in the pound, as traders welcomed the snap election. A stronger pound erodes the value of overseas earnings, hitting the value of multinationals. Tony Cross of TopTradr predicts that political uncertainty will weigh on the markets until the UK election is out of the way. The market\u2019s clear belief is that the incumbent party will win again, and with a bigger majority. This in turn will make for a cleaner break when the Brexit negotiations conclude \u2013 something that has driven the pound crosses out to six month highs. Success in today\u2019s vote in Parliament - which is required to approve the early election - is a foregone conclusion, but the risk is that the vote in early June doesn\u2019t return the result that\u2019s expected. Early polling suggests it will, but with the centrist Liberal Democrat party likely to make sweeping gains from their diminished current position, they could be the deal-makers again as they were in 2010. Given they are expected to be running on a ticket that promotes retaining single market access, we should be bracing for further volatility as this campaign unfolds over the next seven weeks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders have come down with a double-dose of election fever. The symptoms? Worrying about whether Marine Le Pen could sweep into the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, while also pondering how Theresa May\u2019s snap general election call will effect the Brexit negotiations. The French presidential election is looking increasingly right, with just four days until the first round of voting. The consensus view, that centrist Emmanuel Macron would beat Le Pen in the second round in early May, is looking shaky. With right-winger Francois Fillon and Communist-backed Jean-Luc Melenchon both gaining ground, it\u2019s hard to say exactly who\u2019ll claim the prized top two places on Sunday. The prospect of Le Pen and Melenchon contesting the run-off is causing some jitters in the City. As correspondent Angelique Chrisafis reports from Paris, tension is mounting among Macron\u2019s team too: The independent centrist, who is running in his first election, had been seen as a frontrunner but faces a gruelling final few days before the first-round presidential vote this Sunday. Styling himself as a pro-Europe progressive, he went from dark-horse outsider to favourite three months ago. But as polls narrow and a third of the electorate remains undecided, the race has become increasingly uncertain. Macron\u2019s supporters concede that the last few days of campaigning will be tough and unpredictable. Although polls have shown he could win a second round runoff on 7 May, Macron first has to make it to the final round \u2013 and that is not by any means guaranteed. \u201cThe new president,\u201d said one butcher as he posed for a selfie with Macron at the market. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t won yet!\u201d came the cry from the scrum of media recording the moment. \u201cYou have to vote first,\u201d Macron reminded him gently. Meanwhile in London, MPs are expected to approve Theresa May\u2019s plan for a general election on 8 June. That shock decision sent the pound to a six month high last night, but also wiped \u00a346bn off the FTSE 100. The City\u2019s snap reaction is that Theresa May will claim a large majority, strengthening her hand in the Brexit talks, and removing the chance of being derailed by either pro-Remain MPs or hard-line eurosceptics. That could cut the chances of her final deal being rejected by parliament. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Britain gets a better deal. As our financial editor Nils Pratley says, the Brexit talks will still be tough: If delivering a \u201csuccessful\u201d Brexit involves making a few pragmatic compromises \u2013 which is surely the lesson from the initial skirmishes with the EU negotiators \u2013 you can\u2019t blame May for seeking cover from the hard-liners in her own party. And kicking out the next election until 2022 seems a smart political move: it would allow time for a three-year transitional phase before UK voters go back to the polls, which could take the edge off any economic shock at the moment of Brexit in 2019. So, yes, it was fair for investors to take some comfort in the idea that a market-friendly \u201csoft\u201d Brexit is now easier to imagine. Just don\u2019t get too carried away with the idea. Investment uncertainties rarely evaporate so easily. If the election delivers a messy result \u2013 even a barely improved Tory majority \u2013 what would really have changed? Coming up today... The International Monetary Fund is releasing its Global Financial Stability Report at 1.30pm GMT. That will identify the biggest threats to the world economy. We get a final estimate of eurozone inflation for March, at 10am BST (corrected). New European car sales figures are out this morning (more on that shortly).

      "bodyText": "Next boss Lord Wolfson has missed out on his annual bonus for the first time in 18 years amid tough times on the British high street. Wolfson\u2019s total pay package dived by 58% to \u00a31.8m in the year to 28 January, according to the fashion and homewares retailer\u2019s annual report published on Tuesday, after a key earnings per share target was missed. Last year, Wolfson earned a \u00a3503,000 annual bonus as part of his \u00a34.3m total pay package. Total remuneration for Next\u2019s board almost halved as all directors missed out on their annual bonus after a failure to stock enough wardrobe staples contributed to the chain\u2019s first drop in annual profits for eight years. The company has also struggled in a tough market as shoppers spend less on clothes and more on eating out and holidays while competition online, where Next once offered far superior service, has increased as the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams have modernised their operations. However, all the directors were awarded a payout in recognition of Next\u2019s long-term shares and earnings performance over the three years to January. Wolfson was awarded \u00a3606,000 in shares on top of his basic pay, down from \u00a32.2m last year. In the year ahead, Wolfson will get a 1% rise in basic salary to \u00a3773,000 and could earn up to \u00a33.95m if he achieves the maximum possible bonus payouts. New executive directors Michael Law and Jane Shields, who joined the board in 2013, will also get a 1% rise in basic salary to \u00a3416,000 each. But the annual report says the board handed Law, the operations director, and Shields, the sales and marketing director, a much lower pay rise than the 15% they had planned to implement this year in the light of poor profits. Finance director Amanda James received a 16% pay rise to \u00a3416,200 in February but that was less than the 18% the board previously anticipated. Wolfson has said he is \u201cextremely cautious\u201d about the outlook for the year ahead as shoppers continue to spend less on clothes, growth in consumer incomes weakens and prices rise as a result of the fall in sterling. House of Fraser finance director Colin Elliot said on Tuesday he was also cautious and expecting \u201canother challenging year\u201d in 2017 amid uncertainty over the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe and the snap general election announced on Tuesday. He said the department store chain would be updating its shops and adding in more restaurants and cafes as it tried to use its high street space differently in the face of a tough clothing market. The group is planning to drop five own-label womenswear lines including Therapy, Linea Weekend, Episode and Dickins &amp; Jones as part of the shift in emphasis. Elliot said womenswear had been the toughest sector for House of Fraser in 2016 but strong sales of beauty products and a good Christmas helped more than double pre-tax profits, before exceptional items, to \u00a33.4m. Sales remained steady at \u00a31.3bn, helped by a 16% rise online. Chairman Frank Slevin said a new chief executive for House of Fraser, to replace Nigel Oddy who formally exits later this month, would be announced very soon. He said the group\u2019s Chinese owner Sanpower, which bought a controlling stake in 2014, was committed to opening stores in its homeland despite rumours that it might have lost interest. \u201cHouse of Fraser is not up for sale,\u201d Slevin said.",

Last year, Wolfson earned a \u00a3503,000 annual bonus as part of his \u00a34.3m total pay package.</p> <p>Total remuneration for Next\u2019s board almost halved as all directors missed out on their annual bonus after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/23/next-price-rises-profits-fall-pound-brexit\">failure to stock enough wardrobe staples contributed to the chain\u2019s first drop in annual profits for eight years</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/23/next-price-rises-profits-fall-pound-brexit\">Next admits mistakes as profits fall for first time in eight years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company has also struggled in a tough market as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/next-shares-2017-inflation-pound-brexit\">shoppers spend less on clothes</a> and more on eating out and holidays while competition online, where Next once offered far superior service, has increased as the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams have modernised their operations. </p> <p>However, all the directors were awarded a payout in recognition of Next\u2019s long-term shares and earnings performance over the three years to January. Wolfson was awarded \u00a3606,000 in shares on top of his basic pay, down from \u00a32.2m last year.</p> <p>In the year ahead, Wolfson will get a 1% rise in basic salary to \u00a3773,000 and could earn up to \u00a33.95m if he achieves the maximum possible bonus payouts.</p> <p>New executive directors Michael Law and Jane Shields, who joined the board in 2013, will also get a 1% rise in basic salary to \u00a3416,000 each. But the annual report says the board handed Law, the operations director, and Shields, the sales and marketing director, a much lower pay rise than the 15% they had planned to implement this year in the light of poor profits.</p> <p>Finance director Amanda James received a 16% pay rise to \u00a3416,200 in February but that was less than the 18% the board previously anticipated.</p> <p>Wolfson has said he is \u201cextremely cautious\u201d about the outlook for the year ahead as shoppers continue to spend less on clothes, growth in consumer incomes weakens and prices rise as a result of the fall in sterling.</p> <p>House of Fraser finance director Colin Elliot said on Tuesday he was also cautious and expecting \u201canother challenging year\u201d in 2017 amid uncertainty over the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/18/theresa-may-uk-general-election-8-june\">the snap general election announced on Tuesday</a>.</p> <p>He said the department store chain would be updating its shops and adding in more restaurants and cafes as it tried to use its high street space differently in the face of a tough clothing market. The group is planning to drop five own-label womenswear lines including Therapy, Linea Weekend, Episode and Dickins &amp; Jones as part of the shift in emphasis.</p> <p>Elliot said womenswear had been the toughest sector for House of Fraser in 2016 but strong sales of beauty products and a good Christmas helped more than double pre-tax profits, before exceptional items, to \u00a33.4m. Sales remained steady at \u00a31.3bn, helped by a 16% rise online.</p> <p>Chairman Frank Slevin said a new chief executive for House of Fraser, to replace Nigel Oddy who formally exits later this month, would be announced very soon.

    "webTitle": "Brexit\u2019s unpredictable outcome poses risk to global stability, says IMF", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned that Brexit\u2019s unpredictable outcome poses a risk to global financial stability at a time when it is already challenged by heavily-indebted US corporations, China\u2019s credit bubble and weak European banks. Warning that banks were likely to be the sector of the City hardest hit by Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, the IMF said the costs of doing business would rise and regulation would become more complex. The half-yearly Global Financial Stability Report \u2013 one of the IMF\u2019s two flagship reports \u2013 said the benefits of London as a global financial hub stemmed from economies of scale and its expertise across a range of industries. While the IMF acknowledged that there was \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d about the outcome of the two years of article 50 negotiations, it added that \u201cthe challenges stemming from Brexit could undermine financial stability in ways that are difficult to estimate or predict at this juncture.\u201d The IMF also noted that there could be financial stability benefits if Europe had a less concentrated banking system. The Washington-based organisation said global financial stability had continued to improve, helped by a pick-up in economic growth. But it expressed concerns about the ability of heavily-indebted US corporations safely to fund higher investment during a period of rising interest rates. It also warned that a tightening of policy from the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, or rising protectionism could add to the vulnerability of exposed firms in the emerging world, raising their debts by between $130 and $230bn. The IMF highlighted China as its biggest concern among emerging economies, noting that bank assets were now more than triple the size of its economy. \u201cChina faces mounting risks to financial stability as credit continues to rise rapidly,\u201d it said. It said the economic recovery in the eurozone would not be sufficient to solve the problems of its \u201cpersistently weak\u201d banks. \u201cSystem-wide headwinds are a problem not only within countries but can also affect the profitability of large, systemically important banks in Europe. These institutions find it difficult to keep up with their global competitors, and in some cases this may be partly due to profitability problems in their home countries.\u201d The IMF added: \u201cLeft unresolved, a combination of weak profits, lack of access to private capital, and large bad debt burdens impedes recovery and could reignite systemic risks.\u201d Some European governments use the City\u2019s bond markets to raise money more cheaply than they could do at home, but the IMF warned that they could find it harder and more costly to do if business was moved out of London after Brexit. The IMF said banks were likely to be the hardest-hit sector of the City, followed by insurance, with asset management firms least affected. \u201cAlthough there is a continuum of possible outcomes from Brexit negotiations, it is likely that financial firms\u2019 ability to operate across jurisdictions will be curtailed to some degree,\u201d the report said. Banking activities were likely to be the most affected by the loss of passport rights \u2013 which allow UK-authorised firms, banks and fund managers to conduct business in the other 27 states. \u201cUncertainty about the negotiation outcome is pushing banks to anticipate Brexit-related costs,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cBanks have started preparing for a worst-case scenario, in which no agreement is reached, to avoid any possible disruption to their services. Duplication of some activities and business structures in different locations seems inevitable and represents an extra cost. Operating in different regulatory regimes will also increase the burden on banks.\u201d The IMF said the complexity of financial institutions was likely to increase after Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, making life harder for national supervisors. \u201cEven if there is a generous agreement on regulatory equivalence, the UK and other EU legal systems could start to evolve separately. Financial firms will be forced to develop new strategies for operating and competing in a reconfigured world, and business structures are likely to become more intricate,\u201d it said. Even though Britain is not a member of the single currency, the City has up until now been the place that \u201cclears\u201d trades in the euro by acting as a marketplace for buyers and sellers. This role is now under threat, but the IMF said that even if euro clearing and settlement remained in London, the burden on UK regulators would increase. They would have to \u201ctake over the regulation of rating agencies and trade repositories from the European Securities and Markets Authority. Such a task could amount to reviewing and revising thousands of pages of EU regulatory rulebooks.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City regulator has pledged to ensure that financial firms remain strong in the face of Brexit in its annual list of priorities, which also includes protecting vulnerable customers from overly expensive loans. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said the regulator\u2019s lawyers were scrutinising EU financial sector rules as part of the government\u2019s \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d, which will transfer thousands of EU regulations into UK legislation after Brexit. \u201cThe UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union creates uncertainty for both the UK\u2019s financial industry and the FCA,\u201d said Bailey, who was setting out his first annual priorities since taking the helm last year. \u201cBoth we and the government are keen to ensure that the financial services industry remains resilient and can make the most of opportunities in a post-Brexit world. \u201cThe UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union will have important implications for the FCA over the coming years. We are liaising closely with the Treasury and the Bank of England to ensure a smooth transfer of EU rules and legislation into the domestic framework.\u201d Bailey, a former Bank of England deputy governor, said the FCA intended to maintain its good relationship with other EU regulators after Brexit and would be alert to firms that may try to create complex business models in an effort to gain access to the 27 remaining countries in the EU. Last month, the Bank of England revealed it had asked financial institutions to draw up comprehensive plans for how they would deal with Brexit. \u201cFirms will need to assess the impact that a changed relationship with Europe and any changes to the regulatory regime will have on their business models,\u201d the FCA said. As well as supporting the government\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, the FCA listed a number of other priorities for the coming year including alerting customers to the August 2019 deadline to lodge claims for payment protection insurance (PPI), protecting vulnerable customers, continuing to scrutinise high cost credit and looking at the way people save for pensions. The FCA pointed to customers locked in to mortgage deals they signed before the financial crisis, which they would not be offered now under a new regime requiring lenders to assess the affordability of the loan. Some 1.8 million customers have interest-only mortgages and many do not have strategies to repay them, including some that must be repaid by 2020. Its risk outlook warns of \u201cintergenerational wealth inequality\u201d, which will force younger people to work longer than their elders if they want to retire on similar terms. It also listed cybercrime and money laundering as potential risks. \u201cIncreasing terrorist activity across the globe presents new types of threats to market integrity,\u201d it said. Bailey said the FCA intended to work with firms to see how technology might help them tackle money laundering. Last month the Guardian revealed how at least $20bn (\u00a315.6bn) was moved out of Russia during a four-year period from 2010. Bailey was also asked about the importance of the whistleblowing regime, a focus since last week\u2019s revelations that Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, was being investigated for trying to identify a whistleblower. \u201c[Whistleblowing] is very important,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cWe take it very seriously.\u201d The wide-ranging work of the FCA, which oversees 56,000 firms, will also involve looking at the business models of retail banks and \u201cfree banking\u201d for current account customers who do not use unauthorised overdrafts following on from the Competition and Markets Authority investigation last year.",

It says all government departments will be asked to justify why they think they are unsuitable for decentralisation if they do not want to relocate. It has called on corporate Australia to join the decentralisation drive, flagging it as a \u201clong-term project\u201d. Fiona Nash, the minister for regional development, announced the plan on Wednesday at the National Press Club. \u201cBy midyear I will, in consultation with others, create a criteria for government ministers to assess which departments, functions and entities in their portfolio are suited to decentralisation,\u201d Nash said. \u201cAll portfolio ministers will be required to report back to cabinet by August on which of their departments, functions or entities are suitable. \u201cDepartments will need to actively justify if they don\u2019t want to move, why all or part of their operations are unsuitable for decentralisation. \u201cThe minister for finance will, in consultation with others, develop a template for business cases for decentralisation to ensure a consistent approach across government. \u201cRelevant ministers will be required to report to cabinet with those robust business cases for decentralisation by December.\u201d Nash said some departments and functions would unsuitable to move away from Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra \u2013 but did not specify which ones. She said her desire for decentralisation was driven by \u201cfairness.\u201d She said rural, regional and remote Australians deserved the careers and flow-on benefits offered by departments as much as capital city Australians did. She congratulated Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce for \u201cleading the debate\u201d and fighting for decentralisation in recent years. Joyce has been heavily criticised for forcing the relocation of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to Armidale in northern New South Wales. The forced relocation prompted 20 of 100 regulatory scientists to leave the agency, despite APVMA employees being offered significant incentives to stay. Joyce defended the move last month after reports relocated public servants had been working out of McDonalds in Armidale because of a lack of suitable office facilities. He said the Nationals were committed to decentralisation to spread \u201cthe largesse of government in a more abundant way across the nation, not have it in little pockets, or one pocket, called Canberra\u201d. Nash said on Wednesday there were numerous examples of successful decentralisation efforts, including the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries in Orange, the Grains Research and Development Corporation in Dubbo, and the Centrelink and Asic call centres in Traralgon, Victoria. She said the government would not be pursuing decentralisation at all costs. \u201cIt\u2019s about determining the appropriate departments, parts of departments, agencies that can move to the regions,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Australia Post has hit back at the internet giants Amazon and eBay, saying the Turnbull government\u2019s plan to impose the GST on all online purchases is a good one. It says the government\u2019s proposed GST collection method \u2013 called a \u201cvendor model\u201d, which would require websites such as Amazon and eBay to collect GST for the commonwealth from goods bought online from overseas \u2013 is the most efficient way to impose the tax. It has warned Australia Post shouldn\u2019t collect the tax, despite the pleas of Amazon and eBay, because it would render its parcels business \u201cunviable\u201d. It says it supports the Turnbull government\u2019s proposed GST plan but hopes it will be imposed a year later than stipulated. The Senate standing committee on economics will hold a public hearing on the bill on Friday. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, is pushing ahead with plans to abolish the GST concession for low-value goods bought online from overseas. At the moment, imports of goods worth less than $1,000 are GST-free \u2013 including clothing, books, electronic devices and sports equipment. The government wants to scrap the concession to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for local bricks-and-mortar stores but it wants online giants such as Amazon and eBay to collect GST for the commonwealth using a vendor model. A vendor model would require that, where Australian consumers have bought products online from offshore suppliers, the responsibility for collecting GST would lie with the seller, the electronic distribution platform or the re-deliverer, depending on the nature of the transaction. Amazon has attacked the government\u2019s plan, saying it is so poorly designed it will create an \u201cinherent disincentive\u201d to comply. It said the government should instead use a so-called \u201clogistics model\u201d to collect GST on online purchases, requiring Australia Post (and express carriers and freight forwarders) to collect GST instead. \u201cLogistics providers already have infrastructure in place to collect information on goods coming into Australia and have well-established processes for GST collection for goods valued at more than $1,000,\u201d it says in a submission. It also wondered why the government had provided no rationale for ignoring a recommendation from a previous government taskforce to use a logistics model to collect GST. Australia Post has warned that, if the government adopted Amazon\u2019s suggestion, it would be \u201cadversely impacted\u201d by the extra administrative complexity caused by the imposition of additional revenue collection. \u201cAny proposal involving collection of GST under a model that requires collection at the border is likely to render Australia Post mail and parcels business unviable in the current market of continuing and significant decline in mail volumes that have put severe strain on the financial position of the corporation,\u201d its submission says. It argues any changes to the border process must expedite clearance, rather than hinder it, given 59m items are now being cleared through international mail each year. It says if Australia Post was forced to collect GST on items arriving from overseas, it would cost the federal government roughly $900m a year \u2013 vastly exceeding the $300m revenue the GST could be expected to raise. \u201cHowever, the \u2018vendor\u2019 model as proposed in Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017 places relatively less burden on the Australia Post infrastructure, processing times and its costs of doing business,\u201d its submission says. Gary Elphick, the chief executive of Sydney-based company Disrupt Sports, has said the government\u2019s proposed model shows a \u201cfundamental\u201d lack of understanding about how online markets work.",
