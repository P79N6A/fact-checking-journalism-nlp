      "bodyText": "Oil group Shell has written the last chapter in the history of gold-plated retirement benefits for future generations when it became the last of Britain's biggest companies to scrap its final-salary pension scheme for new entrants. Shell is believed to be the last FTSE 100 company to allow new staff into its final-salary pension scheme after it said new joiners would be forced to accept a cheaper option after 2013. A study by the Association of Consulting Actuaries published this week found that nine out of 10 private sector defined benefit schemes are now closed to new entrants and four out of 10 prevent existing staff building up further benefits. The National Association of Pension Funds estimates that only 19% of private sector schemes are now open to new joiners, compared with 88% 10 years ago. A spokesman for Shell said the change was made \"to reflect market trends in the UK\" and would take place in the first three months of next year. A defined contribution plan would replace the current scheme, which has \u00a313bn of assets, though details of its contribution rates and benefits had yet to be agreed. However, the Unite union, which has led a vigorous campaign against cuts to public sector pensions, condemned Shell for \"turning the screw on workers\". Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary, said: 'This is a disgraceful act, nothing less than greed on the part of one of the world's richest and most powerful corporations. They have no need whatsoever to close this scheme and in the process deny their employees the safe retirement they were promised they could save for. \"Shame on Shell, for where they lead, other corporates will follow.\" The company has made large contributions to cut the deficit in its final-salary scheme in the last two years, pouring more than \u00a32bn into the fund. It has also increased its annual contribution rate for the \u00a315bn fund covering Dutch workers to 45% of salary from 35%. A small number of FTSE 100 businesses have continued to offer new staff entrants a defined benefit retirement plan, though at a lower level than traditional final-salary schemes. Tesco offers a retirement benefit based on a career average salary that leaves most workers only marginally worse off. Some large non British-listed firms offer final-salary plans, such as German car manufacturer BMW. Defined contribution schemes are commonly linked to stock markets investments and pay out benefits based on contribution levels and investment returns. Final-salary schemes disproportionately reward staff with the highest salaries at retirement age. The pace of scheme closures has accelerated in the past decade in Britain, as rising life expectancy, coupled with poor market returns and the tightening of regulation has convinced company finance directors that they are unaffordable and have to be scrapped.",

    "webTitle": "Waitrose online orders rise 68% \u2013 and threaten Ocado", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A festive surge in online sales at Waitrose has cast further doubt on the future of Ocado, a leading retail analyst has warned. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said executives at the grocery delivery company \"must be very worried\" about the momentum Waitrose is building in its online business. The John Lewis-owned supermarket reported a 68% rise in internet orders in the week before Christmas, and managing director Mark Price said he was committed to doubling online sales over the next few years. Price said the \"phenomenal\" growth in online sales helped drive the retailer to a \"record-breaking\" \u00a3200m of Christmas sales. Waitrose's fledgling online operation represents 3% of its total sales but Price said he is aiming to increase it to 5%-6%. The growth follows more than \u00a320m worth of investment into Waitrose.com and packing facilities, including a \"dark\" supermarket where dedicated packers pull online orders from the shelves without customers getting in the way. Waitrose.com has also been boosted by the ending of a non-compete clause that, until last summer, prevented Waitrose from going head to head inside the M25 with Ocado, which also sells Waitrose-brand food. \"We've long held the concern that as Waitrose builds online presence, Ocado will suffer,\" Black said. \"We worry about the scope for a steady migration of Ocado customers to Waitrose as the main reason customers shopped at Ocado was to get Waitrose products.\" But he cautioned that it was difficult to extrapolate a long-term trend because Waitrose only released online data for one week of sales. While the number of orders rose by 68%, sales increased by 49% as new customers tend to make smaller purchases. Jonathan Pritchard, an analyst with Oriel Securities, said there was \"absolutely no doubt\" that Waitrose's surging online sales will hurt Ocado. Ocado, which was founded by three former Goldman Sachs bankers in 2002, has had a difficult start to life as a listed company. The shares, which debuted at 180p in July 2010, were the biggest faller in the FTSE 250 at one point on Thursday before closing down 0.65p to 57.2p. It is the UK's fourth biggest online supermarket behind Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda. Price said Waitrose did well in the runup to Christmas because \"if people want something extra special they come to us\". Among its most popular lines, the retailer sold 2.4m Heston Blumenthal mince pies, 1.5m pigs in blankets and 9,000 pots of edible gold dust to decorate Delia Smith inspired cakes. Like-for-like sales in the five-week pre-Christmas period rose 3.8% compared with last year, or 9.5% including new stores and extensions. Turkey sales jumped by two-thirds and there was a big spike in demand for seafood, with sales of luxury seafood entr\u00e9es up 217% and dressed lobster up 278%. Meanwhile, beleaguered retailers JJB Sports and Clinton Cards saw their share prices rise today after announcing better than expected Christmas sales figures. Shares in JJB Sports rallied by more than 33% as positive Christmas sales figures were released this morning. JJB, with 196 stores in the UK and Ireland, reported growth in like-for-like sales of 5% in the four weeks to Christmas. Clinton Cards reported an increase in like-for-like sales of 0.4% in the same period, helping its shares climb 2.27%. Investors were encouraged by Clinton boss Darcy Willson-Rymer's strategic reforms which he promises will encompass \"real estate, customer service, efficencies within the companies and how we embrace digital\". Expectations are high as the greetings card chain breaks into the world of e-commerce with its new online sales platform clintons.co.uk. Rivals such as Moonpig offer a range of personalisation options than ever before and Willson-Rymer, a former Starbucks executive, plans to compete with Clinton's own offering.",

      "bodyText": "The oil cartel Opec is pumping more crude than at any time since late 2008. Europe is in deep crisis, the pace of activity in the global economy is easing, and the dollar is strong. Under these conditions, oil prices would normally be falling, yet the cost of crude has risen strongly in the first few days of 2012 and Brent crude was changing hands at just over $113 a barrel on Thursday, having been above $114 at one point. It's not hard to see why prices are hardening. The US and the European Union are threatening oil sanctions against Iran that may be triggered by the end of the month. Washington and Brussels believe tough action is needed in the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme, but there is a risk of collateral damage to the already shaky economies of the developed world. Iran is an important oil producer and exports around 2.3m barrels a day. The west has an assurance from Saudi Arabia that it will make up any shortfall from Iran, but as analysts from Commerzbank have noted, this would use up virtually all of the spare capacity from the world's biggest producer. The last time that happened, back in 2008, oil prices climbed to almost $150 a barrel. The expectation in western capitals is that the threat of sanctions will bring Tehran to heel, although there is not much sign yet of this happening. On the contrary, Iran is negotiating with China in the hope of finding a market for its crude (the Chinese, predictably enough, are driving a hard bargain) and is hinting at retaliatory action by threatening to block the strait of Hormuz, the strategically vital waterway at the tip of the Gulf, through which 70% of Opec's exports are transported. Although this appears to be merely sabre-rattling at this stage, even the hint of a supply problem from the Middle East has been enough to ensure that no oil trader wants to be short of crude. Strikes in Nigeria over the removal of gasoline subsidies have not helped the mood. What does all this mean? In the very short term, there is little prospect of crude prices coming down to the sort of levels that would be expected given the current state of global demand \u2013 $75 a barrel or thereabouts. On the contrary, there is a higher chance of Brent climbing above $120 a barrel than there is of it falling below $100. In the slightly longer term, much depends on who wins the game of chicken. If the Iranians tough it out and are prepared to risk military action with the west by closing the strait of Hormuz, the cost of crude could easily rocket above $150 a barrel. That would, without question, lead to a deep global recession in 2012. Policymakers in the west are banking on weaker inflationary pressure this year boosting real incomes, and have certainly not factored a serious oil shock into the equation. And, as every finance minister and central banker knows, each and every recession since 1973 has been associated with a sharp increase in the cost of crude.",

A weighted average of the surveys over Q4 as a whole points to overall GDP doing little better than stagnating (while the falls in industrial production and services output in October suggest that a contraction is still possible).

      "bodyText": "Two of Britain's more beleaguered retailers seem to have come up with the goods for a change. JJB Sports, which came close to collapse last year and issued its latest profit warning in October, said like for like sales in December rose 5% and the all-important Christmas trading period had been in line with its expectations. Like for like sales in the second half of the year dropped 7.8%, but this was better than the 17.7% decline seen in the first six months. Chief executive Keith Jones said: Our overall trading has improved in the second half and we achieved a Christmas trading performance broadly in line with expectations in the face of an extremely challenging consumer environment. The ongoing credit squeeze on consumers and weaker UK employment numbers creates a tough environment. We continue to implement our turnaround aware of the importance of the periods of January sales, European football championships and London Olympics. Shares in the company, which has been almost knocked for six by rival Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, have climbed 0.55p to 6.15p on the news. The near 10% rise should please Bill Gates, who happens to be one of the company's major shareholders. But many analysts are still unconvinced.
