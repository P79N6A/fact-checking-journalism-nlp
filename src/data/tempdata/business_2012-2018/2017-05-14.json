      "bodyText": "British workers should brace themselves for rising unemployment and falling real pay in the year ahead as the impact of a Brexit slowdown is increasingly felt in the jobs market, reports have warned. The era of rapidly increasing employment is over, according to the forecasting group EY Item Club, which on Monday predicted the unemployment rate will rise from 4.7% now to 5.4% in 2018 and 5.8% in 2019. At the same time, UK firms are planning to give workers a pay rise of just 1% over the next 12 months, sharply lower than the rate of inflation, which is 2.3% and expected to rise over coming months. Pay expectations are now at their weakest in three and a half years, according to the survey of more than 1,000 employers by HR specialists the CIPD and Adecco, the recruitment agency. \u201cThe good news in this latest survey is that employment confidence remains positive, with sectors like manufacturing and production proving particularly buoyant,\u201dsaid Gerwyn Davies, a labour market adviser at the CIPD. \u201cThe bad news is that there is a real risk a significant proportion of UK workers will see a fall in their living standards as the year progresses, due to a slowdown in basic pay and expectations of inflation increases over the next few months. \u201cThis could create higher levels of economic insecurity and could have serious implications for consumer spending, which has helped to support economic growth in recent months.\u201d The warnings came as official figures published on Tuesday are expected to show inflation rose to 2.6% in April from 2.3% in March, putting further pressure on household budgets. It would be the highest since September 2013, when consumer price inflation was 2.7%. The rise is partly expected to reflect the timing of Easter, which this year fell in April, pushing up air fares in that month as a result. \u201cThe key influences this month are likely to be air fares, utility bills, continued foreign exchange pass-through and petrol prices,\u201d said Alan Clark, an economist at Scotiabank. \u201cAs ever, the joker in the pack is likely to be food and possibly also restaurants and hotels.\u201d Inflation has been steadily rising since the Brexit vote last June, which triggered a sharp fall in the value of the pound, making goods imported from abroad more expensive. Those higher costs are now feeding through to higher shop prices. A report by David Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, and Stephen Machin and Rui Costa, both London School of Economics professors, argued that wages would remain low for several years despite low unemployment and record levels of employment. \u201cThe Bank of England and other forecasters continue to state that within 18 months wage growth will revert to approximately 4% once again. This is much the same forecast that they made in each of the last 10 forecasts and these simply did not turn out to be true. \u201cAt the very least, the continual inability of the Bank monetary policy committee to learn from their forecast failures in the labour market increasingly brings into question their credibility. The Bank of England needs to gain a better understanding of what has been happening in the UK labour market.\u201d Blanchflower, who is now an economics professor at the US Ivy League university Dartmouth College, said the trend for wage rises to average around 2% was unlikely to go away while uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations persisted. The Item Club said that advances in technology and increased automation could also weigh on pay growth over the longer term. \u201cWith the potential for technology and machines to displace some workers, the digital revolution is likely to boost the supply of labour competing for other jobs, putting downward pressure on wages in more labour-intensive and low-productivity sectors where machine advances are less applicable,\u201d Item said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is expected to sell off its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group in the coming week, marking a watershed moment for the sector after the financial crisis. Eight years after pumping in \u00a320bn to prevent the bank from collapsing, taxpayers will no longer own any shares in an institution that was created in the depths of the financial crisis when Lloyds TSB rescued HBOS. The share sale, in the midst of the general election campaign, will highlight the contrast between the progress of Lloyds and that of Royal Bank of Scotland, which is still 73% owned by the government and has yet to make an annual profit since its bailout. At its peak, the taxpayer holding in Lloyds stood at 43% and first started to be scaled back in September 2013. Last week, the bank\u2019s chairman, Lord Blackwell, told shareholders at its annual general meeting that the stake had fallen to 0.25%, with those final shares expected to be disposed of in the coming days. They will not be sold with the fanfare envisioned by George Osborne when he was chancellor. He had ambitions for a discounted share sale to the public, which had to be abandoned a year later by his successor, Philip Hammond, because of the fall in the bank\u2019s shares after the Brexit vote. Instead the shares are being sold off on the stock market through the investment bank Morgan Stanley at prices below the 73.6p average that taxpayers paid during the three-stage bailout that began in January 2009. Hammond has said that despite some of the shares being sold at a loss, the government has still recouped all the \u00a320.3bn used to buy shares. However, that does not take into account the \u00a33.6bn cost incurred by the government although the bank\u2019s chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, told last week\u2019s AGM that the government would make at least \u00a3500m from the bailout. The return to the private sector has led to 57,000 job cuts \u2013 in part because of cost-cutting implemented in the merger but also subsequent efficiency drives to boost profitability. The bailout also required a restructuring of the bank. While a competition inquiry was averted after the HBOS deal was clinched at the height of the crisis, the EU required 600 branches to be sold off. Those TSB branches are now owned by Sabadell of Spain. Lloyds still has a 25% share of current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% of the mortgage market, largely through Halifax. The recovery of Lloyds has also been held back by a bill of more than \u00a317bn to compensate customers missold payment protection insurance (PPI) \u2013 about half the industry\u2019s total. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who has been paid more than \u00a330m since becoming chief executive in 2011, will now face questions about his own plans. He has focused the bank on the UK, which now accounts for 97% of its business, after retreating from 30 countries to six. The Portuguese banker is also expanding into credit cards, buying MBNA for \u00a31.9bn to increase Lloyds\u2019 market share from 15% to 26%, at a time when concerns are being raised about the speed of consumer credit growth. Horta-Os\u00f3rio is also facing anger from businesses hit by the loans scam at the HBOS branch in Reading. Six people were jailed in February after a jury heard they splashed out on superyachts and sex parties, while destroying businesses they had been lending to. Lloyds has set aside \u00a3100m to compensate 64 victims including the TV presenter Noel Edmonds but is facing questions about whether it will be enough. Timeline September 2008 A \u00a312bn takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB comes just days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shockwaves through financial markets. The Financial Services Authority, then the City regulator, says the deal will \u201cenhance finance stability\u201d. October 2008 As financial instability mounts the government announces a bailout of the banking system. Lloyds TSB renegotiates the takeover of HBOS to 0.605 Lloyds TSB shares for every one HBOS share, from 0.833 a month earlier. January 2009 Lloyds Banking Group is created from the purchase of HBOS by Lloyds TSB. The government begins first of a three-tranche bailout of the group, pumping in \u00a313bn. May 2009 Sir Victor Blank is forced to step down as chairman of Lloyds. June 2009 The government puts in another \u00a31.5bn. December 2009 The government backs cash call, buying \u00a35.8bn of shares. Total rescue deal amounts to \u00a320.3bn. Taxpayer stake stands at 43%. March 2011 Eric Daniels leaves and Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio takes over as chief executive. May 2011 Lloyds takes first provision for payment protection insurance of \u00a33.2bn. The bank\u2019s bill eventually tops \u00a317bn. November 2011 Horta-Os\u00f3rio takes leave, citing fatigue. He returns to work in January. September 2013 The taxpayer stake gradually reduces from 43% to 39% for technical results. It is cut to 33% when a formal sell-off of Lloyds shares begins: \u00a32.3bn of shares sold to big City investors at 75p a share. March 2014 \u00a34.2bn of shares sold at 75.5p, taking the taxpayer holding to 24%. February 2015 Dividends to resume for first time since the bailout. December 2014 George Osborne announces a plan to dribble out shares into the market. October 2015 Osborne unveils plans for a cut-price sale to the public. October 2016 Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, abandons his predecessor\u2019s pledge to sell cut-price shares to the public. May 2017 The taxpayer is expected to exit Lloyds Banking Group.",

    "webTitle": "We wouldn\u2019t need price caps if the Tories hadn\u2019t cut energy-saving schemes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "How much should people pay for the essential service of heating and powering their homes? Last week, politicians tried to outbid one another with how much they would save you. Up to \u00a3100 off for two thirds of people, said the Tories. We\u2019ll raise you, with a \u00a31,000 ceiling for everyone, said Labour. Vested interests across the energy world responded with warnings that competition would die and consumers would inadvertently suffer as prices went up. Jobs would be shed as profit margins crumbled for the \u201cbig six\u201d cohort of energy firms, who still hold 84% of the market despite years of so-called competition. Yet amid the furore, and the debate over how low a cap would be set, how long it would last and whether it would really end what Theresa May described as \u201crip-off energy prices\u201d, the real solution barely warranted a mention. The problem with price caps is that they are \u2013 like switching to tariffs that eventually come to an end \u2013 a short-term sticking plaster. Ed Miliband\u2019s price freeze was for 18 months. The Conservatives\u2019 stolen version will be time-limited, perhaps for a year or two, perhaps longer. But when it lifts, so will prices, and we end up back with the status quo. The elephant in the room, and the only real long-term answer to reducing how much we pay, is energy efficiency. As one industry figure admits, it\u2019s \u201cnot electoral Viagra\u201d. But experts agree that new boilers, better appliances, insulating the solid walls of 100-year-old homes and properly lagged lofts are the only true fix. Government advisers recently found that shifting to A-rated fridge-freezers, ditching incandescent bulbs and switching to condensing boilers reduced the average household energy bill by \u00a3290 between 2008 and 2016. Efficiency is a large part of the reason people pay about \u00a3115 a year less for energy in real terms than they did nine years ago. Fitting energy-efficiency measures is relatively cheap \u2013 and when it\u2019s not, there are financing workarounds \u2013 plus installing them creates jobs across the country. Yet in government, the Conservatives have botched or cut government energy-efficiency programmes that could have reined in the rising energy bills that have made a cap seem so inevitable. The number of insulation measures going into homes will have fallen 88% in a decade by the end of the year, at current rates. The 1 million homes the government promises to insulate this parliament sounds good \u2013 until you realise that in 2007, 2.5 million homes were done in a single year. Less than three months after coming to power in 2015, ministers killed the government\u2019s flagship energy efficiency programme, the Green Deal. It was deeply flawed, so few were sad to see it go. But as officials freely admitted, the government had nothing to replace it, and still doesn\u2019t. Labour, to its credit, at least understands the importance of saving energy. The party\u2019s draft manifesto pledged to insulate four times as many homes as the Tories. It promises interest-free loans, much like Scotland did earlier this month, for people to make their homes more efficient. The government has supported a loophole for landlords allowing them to sidestep regulations coming next year which would force them to reduce energy bills for their tenants. By contrast, Labour promises to improve upon the regulations. But whether it\u2019s May or Jeremy Corbyn installed in No 10 next month, there\u2019s also still the obstacle of the big six suppliers. They pay lip service to energy efficiency but in private they hate it. Like warm weather, it reduces consumption and profits. One of the six lobbied relentlessly to cut energy-efficiency measures in a row over bills in 2013, when prices had also risen. Which brings us back to the Tories\u2019 price cap on default tariffs. Analysts have shown it will hit the big six suppliers the hardest, because theirs are the most expensive on the market. So the cap could have one silver lining \u2013 loosening the big six\u2019s dominance will weaken one obstacle to the real solution to rising prices. Training must be next priority Last week Iain Duncan Smith said he wanted British jobs for British workers as he waved the flag for Theresa May\u2019s immigration clampdown. It is a simple slogan, but favouring UK school leavers over better qualified foreigners \u2013 an inevitability in a post-Brexit world \u2013 will require renewed focus on skills. Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions minister, argues employers should be trying harder. Brexit and the immigration squeeze that would follow will force employers to trawl the local schools and further education colleges for nascent talent. That will be a necessity, so they may as well start now. The problem for employers is that the squeeze on skilled labour is already hurting them before they have had a chance to shop locally for replacements. A study by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) found vacancies at their highest level for 16 months. The REC\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Green, says the continued evidence of skills shortages puts the onus on the next government to invest in training and careers advice. Unfortunately for Duncan Smith and the government, it can only hang its head in shame in response. It has dumped careers advice into the lap of schools, and to say the service is patchy would be kind. Now these same schools face draconian budgets cuts. Will the careers adviser survive when a science teacher is at risk? Not likely. The cuts to further education colleges are longstanding and mean that skills training is already operating at subsistence levels. Green says the current lack of training and careers advice means the government must allow foreigners freedom to work in the UK. Duncan Smith says employers will ignore their responsibilities to local workers as long as foreign ones are queuing at the door. But ministers cannot allow a vacuum to develop without doing further damage to the economy. It is crucial that the next government spends the money on skills training before a full Brexit \u2013 hard or soft \u2013 and not wait until the situation reaches a crisis. Another Gent in the boardroom Six years after the government pledged to increase diversity in FTSE 100 boardrooms, it is hard to believe that any business remains a male bastion. But that is the case for ConvaTec, a maker of bandages and colostomy bags that floated on the stock market last October and held its first annual general meeting last week. It could have been an ideal opportunity for investors to register a protest at the eight solitary men standing for election to the board, including chair Sir Christopher Gent.The results from the But no: show otherwise. Aall resolutions were nodded through. Now, it may the case that big City investors are giving the company the benefit of the doubt: it entered the FTSE 100 index very quickly for a newly floated company. Or maybe investors are ready to turn a blind eye after the shares rose 20% since floating. Either way, they must bring pressure to bear before the next AGM.",

      "body": "<p>How much should people pay for the essential service of heating and powering their homes? Last week, politicians tried to outbid one another with how much they would save you. Up to \u00a3100 off for two thirds of people, said the Tories. We\u2019ll raise you, with a \u00a31,000 ceiling for everyone, said Labour.</p> <p>Vested interests across the energy world responded with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/09/conservative-energy-price-pledge-not-same-as-labours-botched-plan\" title=\"\">warnings that competition would die</a> and consumers would inadvertently suffer as prices went up. Jobs would be shed as profit margins crumbled for the \u201cbig six\u201d cohort of energy firms, who still hold 84% of the market despite years of so-called competition.</p> <p>Yet amid the furore, and the debate over how low a cap would be set, how long it would last and whether it would really end what Theresa May described as \u201crip-off energy prices\u201d, the real solution barely warranted a&#xa0;mention.</p> <p>The problem with price caps is that they are \u2013 like switching to tariffs that eventually come to an end \u2013 a short-term sticking plaster. Ed Miliband\u2019s price freeze was for 18 months. The Conservatives\u2019 stolen version will be time-limited, perhaps for a year or two, perhaps longer. But when it lifts, so will prices, and we end up back with the status quo.</p> <p>The elephant in the room, and the only real long-term answer to reducing how much we pay, is energy efficiency. As one industry figure admits, it\u2019s \u201cnot electoral Viagra\u201d. But experts agree that new boilers, better appliances, insulating the solid walls of 100-year-old homes and properly lagged lofts are the only true fix.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/16/uk-climate-targets-will-raise-household-energy-bills-by-100-in-a-decade\" title=\"\">Government advisers recently found</a> that shifting to A-rated fridge-freezers, ditching incandescent bulbs and switching to condensing boilers reduced the average household energy bill by \u00a3290 between 2008 and 2016. Efficiency is a large part of the reason people pay about \u00a3115 a year less for energy in real terms than they did nine years ago.</p> <p>Fitting energy-efficiency measures is relatively cheap \u2013 and when it\u2019s not, there are financing workarounds \u2013 plus installing them creates jobs across the country. Yet in government, the Conservatives have botched or cut government energy-efficiency programmes that could have reined in the rising energy bills that have made a cap seem so inevitable.</p> <p>The number of insulation measures going into homes will have fallen 88% in a decade by the end of the year, at current rates. The 1 million homes the government promises to insulate this parliament sounds good \u2013 until you realise that in 2007, 2.5 million homes were done in a single year.</p> <p>Less than three months after coming to power in 2015, ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/23/uk-ceases-financing-of-green-deal\" title=\"\">killed the government\u2019s flagship energy efficiency programme, the Green Deal</a>. It was deeply flawed, so few were sad to see it go. But as officials freely admitted, the government had nothing to replace it, and still doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>Labour, to its credit, at least understands the importance of saving energy. The party\u2019s draft manifesto pledged to insulate four times as many homes as the Tories. It promises interest-free loans, <a href=\"https://beta.gov.scot/news/green-home-loans/\" title=\"\">much like Scotland did earlier this month</a>, for people to make their homes more efficient.</p> <p>The government has supported a loophole for landlords allowing them to sidestep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/05/landlords-draughty-homes-ban\" title=\"\">regulations coming next year</a> which would force them to reduce energy bills for their tenants. By contrast, Labour promises to improve upon the regulations.</p> <p>But whether it\u2019s May or Jeremy Corbyn installed in No 10 next month, there\u2019s also still the obstacle of the big six suppliers.</p> <p>They pay lip service to energy efficiency but in private they hate it. Like warm weather, it reduces consumption and profits. One of the six lobbied relentlessly to cut energy-efficiency measures in a row over bills in 2013, when prices had also risen.</p> <p>Which brings us back to the Tories\u2019 price cap on default tariffs. Analysts have shown it will hit the big six suppliers the hardest, because theirs are the most expensive on the market. So the cap could have one silver lining \u2013 loosening the big six\u2019s dominance will weaken one obstacle to the real solution to rising&#xa0;prices.</p> <h2>Training must be next priority</h2> <p>Last week Iain Duncan Smith said he wanted British jobs for British workers as he waved the flag for Theresa May\u2019s immigration clampdown. It is a simple slogan, but favouring UK school leavers over better qualified foreigners \u2013 an inevitability in a post-Brexit world \u2013 will require renewed focus on skills.</p> <p>Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions minister, argues employers should be trying harder. Brexit and the immigration squeeze that would follow will force employers to trawl the local schools and further education colleges for nascent talent. That will be a necessity, so they may as well start now.</p> <p>The problem for employers is that the squeeze on skilled labour is already hurting them before they have had a chance to shop locally for replacements. A study by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) found vacancies at their highest level for 16 months.</p> <p>The REC\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Green, says the continued evidence of skills shortages puts the onus on the next government to invest in training and careers advice. Unfortunately for Duncan Smith and the government, it can only hang its head in shame in response. It has dumped careers advice into the lap of schools, and to say the service is patchy would be kind.</p> <p>Now these same schools face draconian budgets cuts. Will the careers adviser survive when a science teacher is at risk? Not likely. The cuts to further education colleges are longstanding and mean that skills training is already operating at subsistence levels.</p> <p>Green says the current lack of training and careers advice means the government must allow foreigners freedom to work in the UK. Duncan Smith says employers will ignore their responsibilities to local workers as long as foreign ones are queuing at the door.</p> <p>But ministers cannot allow a vacuum to develop without doing further damage to the economy. It is crucial that the next government spends the money on skills training before a full Brexit \u2013 hard or soft \u2013 and not wait until the situation reaches a crisis.</p> <h2>Another Gent in the boardroom</h2> <p>Six years after the government pledged to increase diversity in FTSE 100 boardrooms, it is hard to believe that any business remains a male bastion. But that is the case for ConvaTec, a maker of bandages and colostomy bags that floated on the stock market last October and held its first annual general meeting last week.</p> <p>It could have been an ideal opportunity for investors to register a protest at the eight <a href=\"https://www.convatecgroup.com/about-us/board-of-directors/\" title=\"\">solitary men standing for election to the board, including chair Sir Christopher Gent</a>.The <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/convatec-group-plc--ctec-/rns/results-of-agm/201705111422479082E/\" title=\"\">results from the But no: </a> show otherwise. Aall resolutions were nodded through.</p> <p>Now, it may the case that big City investors are giving the company the benefit of the doubt: it entered the FTSE 100 index very quickly for a newly floated company. Or maybe investors are ready to turn a blind eye after the shares rose 20% since floating. Either way, they must bring pressure to bear before the next AGM.</p>",
