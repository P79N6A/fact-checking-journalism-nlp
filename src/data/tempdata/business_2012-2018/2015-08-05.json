      "bodyText": "This week, Whole Foods put three asparagus stalks in some water, called it \u201casparagus water\u201d and charged $6 for it. The store, which specialises in organic food and poultry \u201cfree of growth hormones and antibiotics\u201d at prices that have led it to be dubbed \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d later claimed the asparagus water was a mistake and removed it from shelves. But not before Whole Foods was publicly ridiculed over the product. Part of the reason for the outcry is that even though asparagus water turned out to be short-lived, you can easily imagine it being a permanent Whole Foods staple. A nonsense product, supposedly healthy or organic or artisanal, served at an outrageous price. This is peak Whole Foods. I went to a Whole Foods for the first time on Wednesday morning in New York. They didn\u2019t have any asparagus water (it was served only in one Los Angeles store, and only briefly). But they had items of a similar ilk. There was a kale, apple, ginger, romaine, spinach, cucumber, celery, parsley and lemon cold pressed juice. A pint of which cost $9.99. There was also some Omega 3 mayonnaise with \u201cexpeller pressed\u201d flax seed oil. $8.99. Whole Foods is well known for selling fancy products. Ornamental Kale. Kaleamole. \u201cVeganic sprouted\u201d things. Olive oil that\u2019s so virginal it might as well come in a chastity belt. But if you look past the chia seeds and hemp seeds and sacred seeds, you find that mostly, Whole Foods sells your bog-standard supermarket stuff. The chain offers a lot of food products you could just easily find at Walmart. It just sells them alongside versions that are needlessly, wastefully, hedonistically expensive. Take their eggs, for example. There are normal eggs at roughly normal prices (more expensive, obviously, but check out the fancy basket you get to wheel around). But Whole Foods will also present you with the chance to buy a dozen eggs for $7.99 \u2013 more than three times the New York average. They come from \u201cVital Farms\u201d. They are \u201cpasture raised\u201d, organic and \u201cethical\u201d. They are also eggs. Whole Foods sells your standard sliced cheese, perfect for putting in your children\u2019s sandwiches or regurgitating, bird-liken into their open, clamouring mouths. Oh, and they also sell eight slices of mature cheddar for $5.19. That\u2019s 65 cents a slice. If you want, you can buy a teeny, tiny pot of \u201cBeth\u2019s farm kitchen\u201d raspberry jam for for $9.99. You can buy Saratoga \u201cBlizzard\u201d peanut butter for $7.49, although only because it\u2019s on sale. It normally costs $8.49. Be sure to snap up a \u201cHu kitchen\u201d chocolate bar for $7.99. It\u2019s paleo and vegan and, according to the packaging, \u201csimple\u201d. Choose from more than 40 different types of tea. Hey, there\u2019s even one with the in-no-way-patronising title \u201cBuilder\u2019s brew\u201d that I can guarantee has never been drunk by an actual builder. Two ounces of tea is $7.49. That $7.49 will get you 15 to 18 cups of tea. That\u2019s 50 cents to make a cup of tea in your own home. What is this, the Weimar Republic? So who is buying these things? I\u2019ll tell you. Idiots. Idiots with too much money. That\u2019s the whole idea. Whole Foods has discovered that people will pay pretty much anything for the most basic items, as long as the mushrooms are local or the hummus is organic or the jam comes with a simplistic \u201chomely\u201d logo that makes it look like it was made in an old woman\u2019s kitchen. If Whole Foods had kept the asparagus water on the shelves, people would have bought it. They would have bought it because it is the same as normal asparagus, but more expensive. Because people are idiots. And because Whole Foods is clever.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has opened an inquiry into the insurance claims handler Quindell after the company published its long-delayed 2014 accounts showing a \u00a3238m loss. The involvement of the SFO means there are now three agencies investigating affairs at the former stock market darling, whose shares were suspended in June. The latest inquiry was announced hours after the results were publishedg vb xc b and Quindell said its shares would resume trading on Thursday. The SFO would not elaborate on its statement on Wednesday that it had opened a \u201ccriminal investigation into business and accounting practices\u201d. Its announcement came shortly after the accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), revealed it was investigating individual accountants and two firms in connection with the auditing of Quindell\u2019s accounts from December 2011 to June 2014. The auditors during that time were RSM Tenon, now known as Baker Tilly, and KPMG, one of the big four accounting firms. When Quindell suspended shares in June, it said it was examining how the company accounted for some of its acquisitions under past management after a series of events shattered confidence in Quindell. It said then it was under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the main City watchdog. The FRC revealed that it had been monitoring Quindell since March 2014, a month before a US fund accused the company of being a \u201ccountry club based on quicksand\u201d. Quindell\u2019s founder, Rob Terry, was ousted in November after a share scandal and its main claims handling division was sold to the Australian law firm Slater &amp; Gordon in March. Quindell was originally a golf club in Hampshire, but under Terry it changed direction with the aim of using technology to revolutionise the handling of motor insurance claims. It was briefly a favourite of investors and came close to joining the FTSE 100 index of leading shares. But its fortunes have reversed and accounts for the year ending December 2014 show it swung to a loss of \u00a3238m from a profit of \u00a38.6m, as it wrote down assets by \u00a3157m. Baker Tilly said: \u201cAs this matter is currently under inquiry by the FRC, it would be professionally inappropriate to comment at the present time.\u201d KPMG, appointed in October 2013, said: \u201cWe issued an audit opinion on the 2013 statutory accounts, which included a number of restatements. We have today issued a qualified audit opinion on the 2014 statutory accounts, which include various further restatements, both to apply more conservative accounting policies in some areas and to correct prior year errors, largely in relation to certain historical acquisitions, revenue and share transactions and disclosures in respect of 2011 to 2013\u201d. It said it was understandable and appropriate for the FRC to investigate and it would cooperate. The Financial Times quoted Terry as saying that he welcomed the investigations \u201cto draw a line under the past\u201d. He said he would be making no further comment until the inquiries had concluded. The report and accounts set out \u00a34.8m of payments to the three senior members of the former management team, including Terry, who received \u00a32.2m. He left in November 2014 and the payment to him includes \u00a3950,000 in lieu of notice. Robert Fielding received \u00a31.9m, including \u00a31.4m in shares for his stake in the accident claims company ACH, which Quindell bought in January 2014. Laurence Moorse, who left in May, received \u00a3625,000. The business is under new management. Its chairman, Richard Rose, was appointed in January and the finance director, Mark Williams, in April. A new chief executive has been promised shortly.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s is responding to increased competition in the fast food market by entering the slow lane. The home of the Big Mac and the rapid-fire eating experience is offering table service in the UK for the first time. The company is trialling the new approach at a branch in Mottram, Greater Manchester, and plans to roll it out to 11 more locations by the end of the month, before taking the system nationwide. For those who prefer to queue, there will still be the option of ordering at the till. The embrace of table service is the latest attempt to modernise the image of McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the face of competition from gourmet burger brands such as Five Guys and Shake Shack, Mexican chains such as Chipotle, and established rivals Burger King and KFC. Customers will be able to order from digital kiosks or staff with tablet computers, with the food then delivered to their table. The initiative is targeted at young families and customers who do not want to wait at the traditional McDonald\u2019s counter. McDonald\u2019s first opened in Britain in 1974 and now has more than 1,250 restaurants in the UK. It has trialled table service in restaurants in France, Germany, Switzerland and Australia. However, the ambitious UK launch represents a notable step up for the strategy as the chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, a Briton, tries to breathe new life into a brand that is struggling in the US in particular. While McDonald\u2019s has enjoyed 37 consecutive quarters of growth in the UK, it is in decline in its home market. The poor US performance led to a 14% fall in group profits in 2014, one of the worst performances in McDonald\u2019s history. Easterbrook, who was appointed to the top job in January after a long career at the chain, punctuated by spells at Wagamama and Pizza Express, is under pressure to revive one of the world\u2019s most famous brands. He has pledged to deliver a \u201csharper focus\u201d on McDonald\u2019s customers and return excitement to the golden arches, while admitting that the world\u2019s largest burger chain was \u201cnot on our game\u201d and had allowed its menu to become too complicated. So far this year, McDonald\u2019s has pressed ahead with a string of measures designed to overhaul struggling restaurants across the world. These include the launch of an all-day breakfast menu, allowing customers to build their own burgers, a customer complaint app in Japan and a pledge to stop selling chicken raised with antibiotics. The new managing director of McDonald\u2019s UK, Paul Pomroy, is overseeing a refurbishment programme of the company\u2019s restaurants estimated to be costing more than \u00a3350m. This includes providing Apple iPads and Samsung Galaxy tablets that children can play with, installing digital kiosks where customers can make orders and building glass shopfronts on McDonald\u2019s restaurants. About 250 McDonald\u2019s restaurants will have been revamped by the end of the year. Pomroy said McDonald\u2019s was making changes to restaurants and introducing table service in response to customer feedback. He said the company would not increase prices to pay for the overhaul. \u201cWe have listened to customer feedback and to meet their evolving expectations, we are significantly investing in our restaurants to create an exciting new environment and improve the customer experience,\u201d Pomroy, who replaced Halfords-bound Jill McDonald earlier this year, said. \u201cWe also plan to test some new ideas. For example, we know that for parents it can be tough juggling the kids and carrying your food, so we have decided to trial table service, whereby customers place their order via our new kiosks and then have their food brought to them. \u201cIt is currently on test in one restaurant here in the UK, but with plans to increase the trial to about a dozen restaurants over the coming month. It\u2019s an idea that has been successfully launched in France, and we are keen to see if it will prove as popular with our customers in the UK.\u201d Neil Saunders, a retail and consumer analyst at Conlumino in the US, said McDonald\u2019s faced a battle with the thousand of franchisees who run the chain\u2019s 36,000 restaurants around the world to modernise its sites and menu. He said: \u201cThe store experience is generally poor and is not inspiring or inviting for customers. The firm has loads of old outlets across the US which are in need of upgrading. Generally, the store estate is in a much worse condition to the UK. To be fair, McDonald\u2019s has made a start and is making stores more contemporary and nicer to dwell in, but there is a lot of work still to be done.\u201d Referring to the so-called fast casual phenomenon that has seen McDonald\u2019s lose customers among younger people in particular, he added: \u201cThe menu choices need updating. While younger consumers do not dislike McDonald\u2019s per se, they do have more sophisticated tastes and more options to exercise those tastes \u2013 like Chipotle. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s is challenged as it needs to both stick to its core menu and provide some variety and more exciting options.\u201d Warning of a potential struggle with franchisees, he said: \u201cAt present, franchisees are under a lot of pressure financially and many are disgruntled about menu complexity and other changes McDonald\u2019s has been making. McDonald\u2019s has not done a great job in communicating its future strategy and probably needs to give more financial support to franchisees if it wants to up the pace of change.\u201d",

However, the ambitious UK launch represents a notable step up for the strategy as the chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/29/mcdonalds-new-chief-executive-steve-easterbrook\">Steve Easterbrook</a>, a Briton, tries to breathe new life into a brand that is struggling in the US in particular.</p> <p>While McDonald\u2019s has enjoyed 37 consecutive quarters of growth in the UK, it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/23/mcdonalds-sales-us-drop-seventh-straight-quarter\">in decline in its home market</a>. The poor US performance led to a 14% fall in group profits in 2014, one of the worst performances in McDonald\u2019s history.</p> <p>Easterbrook, who was appointed to the top job in January after a long career at the chain, punctuated by spells at Wagamama and Pizza Express, is under pressure to revive one of the world\u2019s most famous brands. He has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/04/mcdonalds-revitalisation-plan-customers\">pledged to deliver a \u201csharper focus\u201d on McDonald\u2019s customers</a> and return excitement to the golden arches, while admitting that the world\u2019s largest burger chain was \u201cnot on our game\u201d and had allowed its menu to become too complicated.</p> <p>So far this year, McDonald\u2019s has pressed ahead with a string of measures designed to overhaul struggling restaurants across the world. These include the launch of an all-day breakfast menu, allowing customers to build their own burgers, a customer complaint app in Japan and a pledge to stop selling chicken raised with antibiotics.</p> <p>The new managing director of McDonald\u2019s UK, Paul Pomroy, is overseeing a refurbishment programme of the company\u2019s restaurants estimated to be costing more than \u00a3350m. This includes providing Apple iPads and Samsung Galaxy tablets that children can play with, installing digital kiosks where customers can make orders and building glass shopfronts on McDonald\u2019s restaurants. About 250 McDonald\u2019s restaurants will have been revamped by the end of the year.</p> <p>Pomroy said McDonald\u2019s was making changes to restaurants and introducing table service in response to customer feedback. He said the company would not increase prices to pay for the overhaul.</p> <p> \u201cWe have listened to customer feedback and to meet their evolving expectations, we are significantly investing in our restaurants to create an exciting new environment and improve the customer experience,\u201d Pomroy, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/23/halfords-hires-mcdonalds-uk-boss-jill-mcdonald\">replaced Halfords-bound Jill McDonald earlier this year</a>, said.</p> <p>\u201cWe also plan to test some new ideas.

Markit said: July data indicated a slight rebound in service sector activity growth, following the five-month low recorded in June. The latest survey also highlighted a strong and accelerated rise in new work, alongside a further robust upturn in payroll numbers. However, service providers\u2019 confidence regarding the year-ahead business outlook dipped to its lowest since June 2012.\u201d Meanwhile, revisions to back data by the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics paint a slightly different picture of Britain\u2019s economic recovery from the 2009 recession in the wake of the global financial crisis. Wall Street is set to open higher after data showed hiring in the private sector slowed in July, which raised hopes that the Fed could wait until December before putting up interest rates, which would be the first hike in nearly a decade. The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers took on 185,000 workers, the smallest increase since April and below the 215,000 increase forecast by economists. The figures come ahead of the monthly non-farm payrolls data on Friday. Fed governor Jerome Powell told CNBC on Wednesday that policy makers had not yet made up their minds about whether to raise rates in September, and that data on the labour market would be key to that decision. Nothing has been decided. I haven\u2019t made any decisions about what I would support, and certainly the committee hasn\u2019t. The economy is moving along about as expected ... the labor market continues to be strong.\u201d But \u201cmore recent data has been mixed,\u201d including a weaker than expected reading of wages in the second quarter. Here\u2019s an interesting chart on the commodities meltdown, courtesy of Bloomberg. Commodities are crashing like it\u2019s 2008 all over again. Following reports that former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean will lead a review into the state of the UK\u2019s national economic statistics, Paras Anand, head of European Equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: This is an area we have been interested in for some time. The real economy has evolved over time due to the impact of technology, the emergence of new business models and changing consumer preferences. This has meant that the traditional means of measurement have at best led to confusion and at worst led to mis-representation. For example, there is a lot of negative commentary on collapsing productivity. The challenge is that the Office of National Statistics (ONS) currently uses GDP per capita to measure productivity, but the GDP statistic fails to capture services that were previously paid for but are now available for free, such as postal services (replaced by email), music (streaming services) or news. The fact they are now free means that people are using them more and we have therefore become significantly more productive. However, the way this is being captured statistically is suggesting the opposite. Another issue is the way the current account deficit is measured, with a focus on sales rather than profit. It is questionable whether this truly reflects the value of exports vs the value of imports vs the price of the finished goods. In an example where you are importing smartphones from overseas but some of the core components such as software, chipsets and security features being provided by UK companies, the value equation between the imports and exports might be a lot more balanced that is being suggested by the measure. We welcome this evolution as we think it is important, but there will be challenges. Replacing the statistics that exist today with new forms of measure is by no means is an easy task \u2013 the ONS will have a large mountain to climb to find suitable alternatives. It may require some thought around different and, in some cases, quite esoteric forms of measurement. Some of the answers may actually exist in measures which grew in prevalence through the tech boom. The tech bust had the consequence of discrediting a lot of the measurement techniques that were put forward to think about the new economy. We should be open minded about the possibility that there may be some upside in dusting off some of those abandoned methodologies and consider whether at least some of them may have more saliency in the future.\u201d The European Central Bank is closely monitoring Greek banks and any capital shortfalls could be plugged using some of the money from the next (and third) bailout, the ECB\u2019s banking supervision chair Daniele Nouy said. Greece is still hammering out the details of the agreement, which could total \u20ac86bn. She said in a letter to a member of the European Parliament: If this assessment identifies capital shortfalls for one or more significant institutions, these may be covered by the capital buffer to be established under a new Greek programme, after applying the legal framework. The latest US figures show the trade deficit widened more than expected in June, with imports of food and cars reaching a record high, while exports fell for the second month in a row. The US Commerce Department said the trade gap increased 7.1% to $43.8bn. Wall Street had expected a deficit of $42.8bn. The strong dollar and sluggish global demand held back exports, which slipped 0.1% to $188.6bn. Exports to the EU fell 2.3%. Imports increased 1.2% to $232.4bn as domestic demand picked up. The strong dollar, which has gained 15% against the currencies of the US\u2019 main trading partners over the past year, is also making imports cheaper. The Greek prime minister said during a visit to Greece\u2019s agriculture ministry, according to Reuters: We are on the final stretch of concluding a deal with the institutions... Despite the difficulties we are facing we hope this agreement can end uncertainty on the future of Greece and of the eurozone. Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras says the country is on the \u201cfinal stretch\u201d of concluding a deal with lenders, Reuters reports. Despite difficulties, he is is hopeful the deal will end the uncertainty surrounding the future of Greece and the eurozone. And a Greek government spokeswoman has suggested that Athens will hold elections in the autumn. The Economist has taken a look at what the slide in commodity prices means for commodity exporters \u2013 mainly emerging markets. The magazine writes: FIVE years ago, two views were fairly common. The future belonged not to the sluggish, ageing advanced economies but to the emerging markets. Furthermore, those economies had such demand for raw materials that a \u201ccommodity supercycle\u201d was well under way and would last for years. Commodity prices peaked in 2011, and have been heading remorselessly downwards ever since. Their decline of more than 40% so far is a huge bear market; had it happened in equities, the talk would be of calamity and collapse. News coverage in the Western media tends to view the decline in commodity prices as a benign phenomenon, as indeed it is for countries that are net importers. But it is not good for commodity exporters, many of which are emerging markets. That helps explain why emerging-market equities have had only one positive year since 2011, and have underperformed their rich-country counterparts by a significant margin in recent years. The latest sign of trouble came in China, where the Shanghai Composite fell by 8.5% on July 27th... Given the background, this does not seem the most obvious time for the world\u2019s leading central bank to be tightening monetary policy. Of course, the Fed is supposed to focus on domestic conditions, not the international environment. But higher American rates will probably mean a stronger dollar, and thus tighter monetary policy for countries that peg their currencies to the greenback. And it will create a problem for economies with lots of dollar debt. Several emerging-market currencies are already at multi-year or record lows. The hope is that the signs of a slowdown will prove mistaken. The IMF expects both the global growth rate and that of emerging economies to pick up in 2016. Perhaps it will be right. Unfortunately, it has often been over-optimistic in the past. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s board has been told to delay any move to add the yuan to its benchmark currency basket until after September 2016. That\u2019s the recommendation given by the Washington-based organisation\u2019s staff in a report that showed the Chinese currency lagged other major currencies in in terms of meeting key financial benchmarks. The report comes after Beijing made a major diplomatic push for the yuan to be added to the IMF\u2019s Special Drawing Rights basket as part of its long-term strategic goal of reducing dependence on the dollar. The IMF board is due to make a decision in November on whether to include the yuan in the basket of currencies, which includes dollars, euros, pounds and yen, although the decision could be pushed back if policymakers decide they need more information. Reuters has more details. A UK rate rise does appear to be getting closer, judging by the Bank of England\u2019s recent rhetoric. Citi economist Michael Saunders says: We expect no change in either Bank Rate or QE from the MPC on Thursday. The MPC\u2019s core policy message is likely to be in line with the governor\u2019s recent speech, namely that MPC tightening is on the horizon but probably not imminent. The meeting may well feature the first split vote since last December. We expect the MPC will lift their growth forecast, but lower the inflation outlook. Two key wild card factors are the scale of any minority vote for a hike and whether the MPC put greater emphasis on domestically-generated inflation measures. George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, says: Some MPC rhetoric \u2013 including that from the governor \u2013 is hinting that a rate rise is getting closer, and that as inflation rises around the turn of the year this should become more evident. Not all Committee members agree, with the Bank\u2019s chief economist being one of the more vocal dovish voices. Chris Hare at Investec says: Mood music for a rate rise has become louder in recent weeks, underscored by the previously-reputed MPC dove David Miles saying that an interest rate hike should come \u2018soon\u2019. And the minutes from the 8 July meeting pointed out that, absent Greece-related concerns, the decision to raise rates was becoming \u2018more finely balanced\u2019 for \u2018a number\u2019 of members. Now that Greek risks have receded, and the insights from updated forecasts will be on the table, that could well be enough for a hawk or two (perhaps Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty) to pull the trigger. That said, we do not think that the majority will vote for a rate hike until Q1 next year. One of the main reasons is that currently, with headline inflation at zero, a rate rise is presentationally more difficult than it should be in 16Q1. At that point we expect inflation to be above 1% as past falls in energy and food prices drop out of the calculation. Money markets are now pricing in a Bank of England rate hike in the first quarter of next year, rather than in May as at the start of the week. Rates are then seen rising gradually to 2% by the middle of 2018. What seems certain is that the Fed will act first. While Britain\u2019s economy is recovering, inflation remains low. \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d should shed more light on the Bank\u2019s thinking. Minutes of its monthly meeting are expected to reveal a split on the nine-member monetary policy committee, with two or three votes for a rate rise this month. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: As we move ever closer to \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 \u2013 the first simultaneous publication of the MPC decision, minutes and Inflation Report \u2013 there was little in this survey to suggest that the MPC will be close to pulling the trigger on rate rises this month. Though selling prices accelerated, they did so at a pace which was in line with the long-run average, while input cost inflation remains very weak. Therefore, while it is perfectly possible that we will see two, or maybe even three votes in favour of a rate hike on Thursday, in our view the chances of a move this year remain low.\u201d Sterling is holding up against the resurgent dollar, amid expectations that any rise in US interest rates will be swiftly followed by a Bank of England rate hike. Growing expectations that the Fed will act on rates as early as September initially sent the pound 1 cent lower against the dollar, but it later recovered and is now 0.1% higher on the day at $1.5581. Against the euro, it climbed to a two-week high of 69.65p per euro. JPMorgan economist Allan Monks says the UK services PMI is \u201cholding its ground\u201d. Its current level remains broadly in line with its average for 1H15 and is more than a point higher than its long run average of 56.0. The details also look firmer than suggested by the headline, with new business rising from 57.2 to 58.6. Overall, the July PMIs this week suggest that manufacturing is still stagnating, but with enough momentum from the service sector to keep overall GDP growth looking firm. One noteworthy development in the services PMI is the large drop in the employment reading from 56.0 to 53.8. While still high in an absolute sense, the decline is large and echoes some other labour market indicators which point to a slowing in employment growth. If output growth holds up as expected, this offers some further hints of a better productivity outturn for this year. Greek air traffic controllers have gone on strike a the height of the tourism season, causing several domestic and international flights to be cancelled. At Athens airport, about 22 flights were cancelled and 173 rescheduled due to the four-hour stoppage. The controllers are striking from 11.00 to 15.00 GMT. They are asking for EU-based reforms \u2013 calling for their government agency to be restructured and an independent one set up in line with EU rules. They believe this would hep Greece deal with staff shortages and a lack of funds for the maintenance of air traffic control systems. The air traffic controllers\u2019 union has threatened to step up action from 14 August if the government does not respond to its demands. Tourism accounts for a fifth of Greece\u2019s economic output. The Athens stock exchange is once again in the red, for the third day running since reopening on Monday following a five-week suspension. It has lost 3.6%, with the banks posting further sharp falls. Piraeus Bank -29.59% Alpha BAnk -29.56% Eurobank -26.76% Attica Bank -16.67% National Bank of Greece -15.14% European stock markets are still trading higher. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has been boosted by better-than-expected results from insurer Legal and General and the London Stock Exchange. A rebound in the mining sector has also helped \u2013 despite a lacklustre copper price which remains near six-year lows, hit by concerns over demand from China and expectations of a rate hike in the US. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 0.2% at 6699.84 Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.06% at 11576.99 France\u2019s CAC up 1.04% at 5165.47 Turning to the markets, oil prices are up for a second day after falling below $50 a barrel on Monday, a six-month low. Oil has been boosted by weekly data that showed a fall in US crude stocks, although the strong dollar held back gains. Brent crude is trading at $50.25 a barrel, up 0.5%, while New York light crude is at $45.91, up 0.37%. The dollar rose to its highest level in over three months after hawkish comments overnight from a voting member of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s policy setting committee. Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart said there would need to be a \u201csignificant deterioration\u201d in economic activity to hold the Fed back from raising rates in September. The dollar hit a 3 1/2 month high against a basket of currencies. That took the euro to a two-week low of $1.0847. Markets are eagerly expected Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls data. More data: Retail sales in the eurozone were weaker than expected in June. According to Eurostat, they fell by 0.6% from the previous month. The all-sector PMI for the UK, which measures the combined output of services, manufacturing and construction, fell to 56.7 in July, the lowest since December 2014, from 57.4 in June. Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit, said the latest PMI surveys for the UK sent out mixed signals for the Bank of England: While the slowdown in business activity signalled by the surveys was only modest, the hiring trend was more worrying. Employment growth fell sharply to the lowest since September 2013. Despite falling, the PMI remains at a level which has encouraged the Bank of England to tighten policy in the past, which will add to the hawkish mood among a divided Monetary Policy Committee. However, there are plenty of excuses to hold off from hiking interest rates any time soon, including zero inflation, a waning rate of job creation, a strong pound hurting exports and the latest signs of growth cooling. Policymakers will also be concerned about the global economic outlook, and slower growth in emerging markets in particular, which the manufacturing PMI showed to have slipped back into contraction in July. While a rate hike later this year remains a distinct possibility, the majority of Monetary Policy Committee members will most likely want to see stronger numbers than today\u2019s PMI before feeling comfortable about voting for higher interest rates. Growth in Britain\u2019s services sector has slowed more than expected, as hiring eased to its slowest pace since March 2014. This suggests the economic recovery weakened at the start of the second half of the year. The Markit/CIPS services PMI dipped to 57.4 in July from 58.5 in June, still indicating expansion among services businesses. Taking together with this week\u2019s manufacturing and construction surveys, the reading points to economic growth of 0.6% in the three months to July, slightly lower than the 0.7% reported by the Office for National Statistics for the three months to June. The current period of job creation is the longest achieved since 2011, Markit said. Germany, Italy and Spain all reported higher employment last month, with the rates of increase accelerating in Germany (five-month high) and Spain (100-month record). Markit went on to say: Spain registered the best rate of economic growth of the \u2018big-four\u2019 eurozone nations, with the pace of expansion moving back towards April\u2019s 101-month record. Growth in Germany remained solid and steady, whereas decelerations were signalled in both France and Italy.\u201d Markit\u2019s composite index for the eurozone as a whole shows growth in the private sector eased in July. It dropped to 53.9 from 54.2 in June. Markit said: The latest PMI data showed the rate of expansion in eurozone economic activity slowing slightly at the start of the third quarter. However, growth remained close to June\u2019s four-year high, with the extent of the easing less marked than that signalled by the earlier flash estimate.\u201d Some instant reaction... The German composite index, which measures the combined output of the manufacturing and service industries, was also unchanged from June\u2019s reading, signalling further \u201csolid activity growth at German private sector firms,\u201d according to survey compiler Markit. Finally, Germany\u2019s services sector grew at the same above-average pace last month as in June, with the PMI coming in at 53.8, unchanged from June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion; a reading below points to contraction in business activity. Markit economist Jack Kennedy said about the drop in the French composite index: Having picked up to the fastest rate in nearly four years during June, activity growth took a step back in July. The service sector looks to be still struggling to generate much upward momentum in a persistently subdued demand environment. A return to job cutting and dip in business expectations in the latest survey period suggest that companies are far from convinced about the recovery and that last month\u2019s stronger numbers may have been something of a false dawn.\u201d The French services sector has also slowed, with the PMI dropping to 52 last month from 54.1 in June. The composite index, which comprises services and manufacturing, is also lower, at 51.5 from 53.3 in June, indicating slower economic activity. Italy\u2019s services PMI has come in lower than expected with a reading of 52 for July, from 53.4 in June (a 12-month high), indicating slower growth. Encouragingly, however, the new business sub-index rose to 53.7 from 52.7. The eurozone\u2019s third biggest economy is emerging from a three-year slump and is forecast to return to modest growth this year after national output rose 0.3% in the first quarter, ending its longest recession since World War II. Meanwhile, the Athens market has turned red again, opening 1.6% lower. Greek bank shares drop a further 7.9% in early trading. Other European stock markets have opened higher, as expected. FTSE 100 index up 0.15% at 6696.96 Dax up 0.75% at 11542.15 CAC up 0.9% at 5159.29 https://twitter.com/Simon_Nixon/status/628832774414303232 Here we go \u2013 the PMI for Spain is out. Growth in Spain\u2019s services sector has hit a three-month high, beating economists\u2019 expectations. Markit\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) of service companies jumped to 59.7 in July from 56.1 in June. The survey showed that service companies hired staff at the fastest rate in eight years as the tourism season got under way. Official figures last week showed the economy grew at the fastest quarterly rate since 2007 in the second quarter. Turning to Greece, a leading think tank in the UK has warned that the new round of austerity measures demanded by its international creditors will mean that the battered economy remains stuck in permanent depression \u2013 unless it receives substantial debt relief. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates that a haircut of 55% on Greek debt is needed to give the country a chance of reducing its debt to 120% of GDP by 2020. It warned that continuing to insist on \u201cunrealistic fiscal targets\u201d will ensure that the Greek economy will \u201cremain in depression\u201d. It said the VAT increases reluctantly accepted by Athens in exchange for a new bailout will lead to a 1% fall in national output next year. Sir Charlie Bean, former deputy governor of the Bank of England launches his official review into Britain\u2019s official economic statistics on Wednesday. He told the Financial Times (\u00a3) that the \u201cBig Data\u201d revolution on the internet has rendered Britain\u2019s stats out of date. Bean noted that the framework for for the national accounts \u201cwas developed in the aftermath of the Great Depression\u201d. As an economy develops, the traditional ways of thinking about it cease to be so relevant,\u201d he said, expressing concerns that official numbers are struggling to keep up with the internet age where consumers, for example, book their holidays online, bypassing travel companies. Back in the 1970s the UK was \u201cprobably the world leader in statistics\u201d, he added, but it is not \u201cquite the leader of the pack now\u201d. The BOE\u2019s former chief economist was last month appointed to lead a root-and-branch review of the UK\u2019s economic statistics. The pound is also in focus again, ahead of Super Thursday \u2013 the Bank of England\u2019s big day when for the first time it will announce interest rates and release the minutes of its policy meeting at the same time. On top of this, the central bank will release its inflation report with the latest growth and inflation projections. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FxPro Daily, has looked at the interest rate outlook in the UK and US and the impact on the pound: This wealth of data could overwhelm investors and we are likely to see some volatility following the release, where the market is expecting the first votes for a hike from at least a couple of monetary policy committee members since the hawks were last calling for the base rate to rise last year. What has been made clear by both the Federal Reserve\u2019s Janet Yellen and the BOE\u2019s Mark Carney is that rates are going to move upwards soon. For the BOE the challenge is to determine whether, at a time of very low inflation, wage growth is robust enough to warrant the commencement of rises later this year or early next year, especially at a time when recent data has been indicating the economy is coming off the boil. This week alone has seen unimpressive PMI surveys for the UK and this morning sees the important services PMI release which is expected to dip from 58.5 to 58.0. Anything lower than 58.0 could put sterling under pressure. For the US the debate is not indifferent with the Fed\u2019s voting member Lockhart overnight calling for the start of rate hikes in September, but the market is expecting later in the year and we have two important nonfarm payrolls releases ahead of then, the first being on Friday. Today sees the ADP payroll expected to come in at 215k so anything better could see the dollar add to its overnight gains following the comments from Lockhart. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ve woken up to news that China\u2019s services sector expanded at its fastest pace in 11 months in July, offsetting some of the pressure from a faltering manufacturing industry. The Caixin/Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) climbed to 53.8 from 51.8 in June, marking the 12th consecutive month of expansion. A reading above 50 indicates expansion while one below points to contraction. This is a private survey; China\u2019s official services PMI released at the weekend showed a slight pick-up in activity in July. All eyes are now on services PMIs for the eurozone and the UK, out later this morning. Britain\u2019s manufacturing and construction surveys were mixed, with manufacturing improving slightly while construction saw a surprise slowdown due to housing. European markets are set to open slightly higher following their mixed performance on Tuesday. The Athens stock market closed down 1.2%, the day after its 16.2% record fall when it reopened after a five week halt in trading. But banking shares took another hammering, falling close to 30% again. The US dollar was lifted on Tuesday by some hawkish comments from FOMC voting member and Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart, who said there would need to be a \u201csignificant deterioration\u201d in economic activity to hold the Fed back from raising rates in September. In light of the comments, investors will be focused on the latest economic data with the private ADP jobs report for July (ahead of non-farm payrolls on Friday), the June trade figures, and the ISM services survey for July.",

The real economy has evolved over time due to the impact of technology, the emergence of new business models and changing consumer preferences. This has meant that the traditional means of measurement have at best led to confusion and at worst led to mis-representation.</p> <p>For example, there is a lot of negative commentary on collapsing productivity. The challenge is that the Office of National Statistics (ONS) currently uses GDP per capita to measure productivity, but the GDP statistic fails to capture services that were previously paid for but are now available for free, such as postal services (replaced by email), music (streaming services) or news. The fact they are now free means that people are using them more and we have therefore become significantly more productive. However, the way this is being captured statistically is suggesting the opposite.</p> <p>Another issue is the way the current account deficit is measured, with a focus on sales rather than profit. It is questionable whether this truly reflects the value of exports vs the value of imports vs the price of the finished goods. In an example where you are importing smartphones from overseas but some of the core components such as software, chipsets and security features being provided by UK companies, the value equation between the imports and exports might be a lot more balanced that is being suggested by the measure.</p> <p>We welcome this evolution as we think it is important, but there will be challenges. Replacing the statistics that exist today with new forms of measure is by no means is an easy task \u2013 the ONS will have a large mountain to climb to find suitable alternatives. It may require some thought around different and, in some cases, quite esoteric forms of measurement. Some of the answers may actually exist in measures which grew in prevalence through the tech boom. The tech bust had the consequence of discrediting a lot of the measurement techniques that were put forward to think about the new economy. We should be open minded about the possibility that there may be some upside in dusting off some of those abandoned methodologies and consider whether at least some of them may have more saliency in the future.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-05T14:07:58.870Z\">at 3.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55c20466e4b0e3f3418aa960\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-05T12:46:55.846Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB's Nouy: Greek banks could be recapitalised via bailout money</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Central Bank is closely monitoring Greek banks and any capital shortfalls could be plugged using some of the money from the next (and third) bailout, the ECB\u2019s banking supervision chair Daniele Nouy said.

The future belonged not to the sluggish, ageing advanced economies but to the emerging markets. Furthermore, those economies had such demand for raw materials that a \u201ccommodity supercycle\u201d was well under way and would last for years.</p> <p>Commodity prices peaked in 2011, and have been heading remorselessly downwards ever since. Their decline of more than 40% so far is a huge bear market; had it happened in equities, the talk would be of calamity and collapse.</p> <p>News coverage in the Western media tends to view the decline in commodity prices as a benign phenomenon, as indeed it is for countries that are net importers. But it is not good for commodity exporters, many of which are emerging markets. That helps explain why emerging-market equities have had only one positive year since 2011, and have underperformed their rich-country counterparts by a significant margin in recent years. The latest sign of trouble came in China, where the Shanghai Composite fell by 8.5% on July 27th...</p> <p>Given the background, this does not seem the most obvious time for the world\u2019s leading central bank to be tightening monetary policy. Of course, the Fed is supposed to focus on domestic conditions, not the international environment. But higher American rates will probably mean a stronger dollar, and thus tighter monetary policy for countries that peg their currencies to the greenback. And it will create a problem for economies with lots of dollar debt. Several emerging-market currencies are already at multi-year or record lows.</p> <p>The hope is that the signs of a slowdown will prove mistaken. The IMF expects both the global growth rate and that of emerging economies to pick up in 2016. Perhaps it will be right. Unfortunately, it has often been over-optimistic in the past.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02ba583a9639d27fbf8b613e40edd066b18f9195\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02ba583a9639d27fbf8b613e40edd066b18f9195/0_160_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of Anglo American\u2019s Los Bronces copper mine at Los Andes Mountain range, near Santiago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of Anglo American\u2019s Los Bronces copper mine at Los Andes Mountain range, near Santiago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Alvarado/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55c1e552e4b0528dcd379c30\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-05T10:34:17.033Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">IMF staff: delay adding yuan to currency basket</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The International Monetary Fund\u2019s board has been told to delay any move to add the yuan to its benchmark currency basket until after September 2016.

And the minutes from the 8 July meeting pointed out that, absent Greece-related concerns, the decision to raise rates was becoming \u2018more finely balanced\u2019 for \u2018a number\u2019 of members. Now that Greek risks have receded, and the insights from updated forecasts will be on the table, that could well be enough for a hawk or two (perhaps Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty) to pull the trigger.</p> <p>That said, we do not think that the majority will vote for a rate hike until Q1 next year. One of the main reasons is that currently, with headline inflation at zero, a rate rise is presentationally more difficult than it should be in 16Q1. At that point we expect inflation to be above 1% as past falls in energy and food prices drop out of the calculation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55c1e02de4b0528dcd379c10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-05T10:13:25.296Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Money markets are now pricing in a Bank of England rate hike in the first quarter of next year, rather than in May as at the start of the week.

Minutes of its monthly meeting are expected to reveal a split on the nine-member monetary policy committee, with two or three votes for a rate rise this month.</p> <p>Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we move ever closer to \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 \u2013 the first simultaneous publication of the MPC decision, minutes and Inflation Report \u2013 there was little in this survey to suggest that the MPC will be close to pulling the trigger on rate rises this month.

For the BOE the challenge is to determine whether, at a time of very low inflation, wage growth is robust enough to warrant the commencement of rises later this year or early next year, especially at a time when recent data has been indicating the economy is coming off the boil. This week alone has seen unimpressive PMI surveys for the UK and this morning sees the important services PMI release which is expected to dip from 58.5 to 58.0. Anything lower than 58.0 could put sterling under pressure.</p> <p>For the US the debate is not indifferent with the Fed\u2019s voting member Lockhart overnight calling for the start of rate hikes in September, but the market is expecting later in the year and we have two important nonfarm payrolls releases ahead of then, the first being on Friday.

The latest health check conducted by the information services company Markit showed the pace of activity across the eurozone eased only slightly during the weeks when Greek banks were closed for business. But the survey found no signs that the eurozone was about to slide back into recession and, with Spain leading the way, was consistent with growth continuing at about 0.4% per quarter. However, the fragility of the recovery in the 19-nation group was highlighted by data from the EU\u2019s statistical agency, Eurostat, showing a 0.6% drop in retail sales growth in June. The drop in spending was sharper than the financial markets had been expecting and cut the annual growth in retail sales from 2.6% to 1.2% \u2013 its slowest pace for nine months. Jack Allen, an economist at Capital Economics, said the decline in retail sales growth from 1% in the first quarter to 0.3% in the second quarter suggested that the boost to consumer spending from the collapse in oil prices late last year had started to fade. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, said: \u201cThe eurozone economy showed reassuring resilience in the face of the Greek debt crisis in July. Despite a record deterioration in Greek business conditions amid extended bank closures, the overall pace of economic growth across the region barely slowed from June\u2019s four-year high.\u201d Both measures used by Markit to gauge the strength of the eurozone economy fell slightly last month. The services business activity index dropped from 54.4 to 54.0, while the composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) dipped from 54.2 to 53.9. A reading above 50 indicates economic growth. Williamson said: \u201cBased on the recent survey data, euro area GDP looks set to have risen by 0.4% in the second quarter, with the same rate of growth evident at the start of the third quarter. Even faster growth could soon be achieved providing the Greek situation remains under control. \u201cOf the region\u2019s largest economies, Spain is the current star performer, with the PMI signalling ongoing economic growth of approximately 1% at the start of the third quarter. Italy and Germany are also showing sustained recoveries, albeit with growth running at more modest 0.3%-0.4% rates. France remains a straggler, but is still joining in the recovery, with the PMI signalling a mere 0.2% rate of expansion.\u201d Spain\u2019s return to growth is the result of the performance of its services sector, with the Markit survey showing output in recent months back to levels last seen when the economy was booming in 2006. The services PMI rose from 56.1 to 58.7 last month.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Legal &amp; General has backed a call by the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist for companies to invest for the long term instead of paying out cash to feed the short-term demands of shareholders in the City. Nigel Wilson, the chief executive of one of the biggest investors in the UK stock market, said his investment management arm would take a hard line with bosses who put a higher priority on payouts to shareholders than ensuring the future health of their companies. In a speech last week, Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s top economist, said UK company law gave too much importance to shareholders over other priorities such as employees, suppliers and investment. He said dividends that outpaced profits and companies buying back shares were partly to blame for the economy not fulfilling its potential. Announcing Legal &amp; General\u2019s first-half results, Wilson said: \u201cI talk to Andy about this a lot. We want people to invest. Dividends are an important part of the return to shareholders. What we don\u2019t want is people overdistributing by share buybacks or overpaying dividends and not investing for the long term.\u201d Rolls-Royce shares jumped when it announced a \u00a31bn share buyback in June 2014 despite declining financial performance. Warren East, the enginemaker\u2019s new chief executive, scrapped the buyback last month to preserve cash after issuing a profit warning. Legal &amp; General and nine other investors controlling \u00a310tn of assets have previously written to the chancellor setting out ways to increase long-term investment in research, employee skills and technology as well as pledging to oppose companies that fail to think long term. In their letter, the investors, which also included Standard Life, Aviva and the fund manager Neil Woodford, said they would oppose unjustified spending cuts, dividend payments and other measures that focused too much on short-term returns. They also singled out share buybacks designed to increase bonuses. Wilson called for the creation of a \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d of more investment, better jobs and higher pay to support the economy. He said British businesses were not ambitious enough and the government needed to do more to encourage exports, despite George Osborne\u2019s vow in 2011 to support the \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d. Wilson said: \u201cI think the prime minister and the chancellor have the right intent, but we haven\u2019t built enough export infrastructure to export to Africa, South America and Asia.\u201d Companies need support at trade fairs in those regions that are now dominated by German businesses, he said. Haldane argued that the shareholder-focused company model common in the UK and the US was not necessarily the best, and that countries such as Germany and Japan gave workers a greater say in the running of a company, including board representation. But Wilson said he opposed that idea: \u201cI\u2019ve worked in Germany and various parts of the world and British corporate governance, for all its faults, is still the best in the world, but it needs constantly modernising and Andy is right to encourage the debate.\u201d Legal &amp; General\u2019s first-half operating profit rose 18% to \u00a3750m. The company increased its interim dividend by 19% to 3.45p a share.",
