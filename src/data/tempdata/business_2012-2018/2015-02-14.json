The papers, published by the University of Zurich, analysed the impact of plain packets in Australia. Their findings were widely disseminated in the media and used by the tobacco lobby to make the case that the health initiative had no discernible effect on smoking rates among the young in Australia, and therefore should not be introduced in the UK. But now a group of academics has written to the university calling for the papers, funded and supervised by Philip Morris International (PMI), which makes Marlboro cigarettes, to be withdrawn. In his letter to Dr Michael Hengartner, the university\u2019s rector, Pascal Diethelm, president of OxyRomandie, a Swiss anti-smoking organisation, lists seven errors that he and his team say they have identified. \u201cThey are extremely serious,\u201d Diethelm says. \u201cTaken individually, most of them are sufficient to invalidate the findings of the papers. Collectively, they are damning.\u201d The two papers were written by Ashok Kaul and Michael Wolf, who have robustly defended their work, which was cited as key evidence by tobacco manufacturers in submissions to the Department of Health\u2019s consultation on plain packaging. On the back of their findings, PMI issued a press release stating: \u201cThe plain packaging experiment in Australia has not deterred young smokers, professors from the department of economics at Zurich University and the University of Saarland found in a report released today.\u201d However, Diethelm claims the errors go towards \u201creinforcing the conclusion of a lack of evidence, ie, they all play in favour of the commercial interest of the financial sponsor\u201d. The row has been taken up by others. A group of doctors recently declared on the BMJ website that \u201cboth of these papers are flawed in conception as well as design, but have none the less been widely publicised as cautionary tales\u201d. Diethelm\u2019s letter calls on the university to take the papers down from its website. \u201cWe ask the University of Zurich to retract them because they are erroneous beyond repair and because \u2026 they interfere with the public health policy of other countries\u2026 \u201d In both papers, which were not peer-reviewed, Kaul and Wolf acknowledge that PMI provided funding. However, they do not reveal that the company demanded sight of the study before publication and the right to put forward suggestions. Dr Nicholas Hopkinson, senior lecturer in respiratory medicine at Imperial College London \u2013 who criticised the papers on the BMJ website \u2013 described Zurich University\u2019s collaboration with PMI as a \u201cstain\u201d on its reputation. In a response to the criticisms, which they describe as \u201cspurious\u201d and \u201cdefamatory\u201d, the two authors said: \u201cAs the authors of the working papers \u2013 committed to an open, free and objective scientific debate \u2013 we will not withdraw them from public scrutiny.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Upmarket estate agent Henry Wiltshire has just opened a glitzy new office in Vauxhall, south-west London. It\u2019s by the bus station, next to a homeless shelter, on the site of a corner shop. The company\u2019s other offices are in rather more glamorous surroundings: Canary Wharf, Hong Kong, Singapore and Abu Dhabi. But this opening is evidence of the dramatic transformation under way in the Nine Elms area in Battersea, on the south bank of the Thames. In a triangle bordered by the river, Battersea Park and the main railway line into Waterloo, 20,000 homes are being built \u2013 most of them luxury apartments in a cluster of high-rise towers that has been dubbed mini-Manhattan or Dubai-on-Thames. \u201cWe will handle the odd instruction between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31m, but we are pitching this office at properties worth \u00a31m-plus,\u201d says Henry Wiltshire sales director Kyle Spence. \u201cWe are a very high-end brand.\u201d They chose the area \u201cbecause so many of our clients in Canary Wharf are now buying in Nine Elms as well\u201d. Central London could soon have a glut of expensive new homes. Using figures from researchers Lonres and Dataloft, consultancy Property Vision reckons more than 54,000 homes are planned or being built in prime areas of the capital, most of them costing more than \u00a31m. This is despite the fact that last year, just 3,900 homes worth \u00a31m or more were sold in central London. Across London, more than 200 tall towers have been proposed, approved or are already under construction. Property Vision founder Charlie Ellingworth says: \u201cLondoners are beginning to discern a skyline that is quite out of scale with anything they are used to.\u201d And while local buyers are \u201csqueezed further out and into ever smaller spaces with mortgages they are not quite sure how they will ever repay\u201d, the property business is booming. \u201cFor developers and their dependent ecosystem of estate agents, architects, lawyers and builders, it has been a one-way super-bet.\u201d About \u00a315bn of investment is pouring into the Nine Elms area, which is directly across the river from super-swanky Chelsea but was until recently wasteland, sheds and warehouses. This is the biggest building site in London, and one of the largest regeneration projects in Europe, easily eclipsing the \u00a39bn cost of the 2012 Olympics site in Stratford. Ravi Govindia, the Conservative leader of Wandsworth council, is very upbeat: \u201cYes, some of the buildings will be tall, but there will be a distinctly London flavour. It\u2019s going to be a place that people [will] enjoy living in.\u201d But it is unclear how many of the buyers who get to enjoy that distinctly London flavour will be local people. At the heart of the development is Battersea power station, which lay derelict for three decades before its Malaysian owners came up with an \u00a38bn facelift plan. Several developers have tried and failed to restore the grade II-listed 1930s landmark, which is so vast St Paul\u2019s cathedral could fit comfortably inside it. Rob Tincknell, who runs the Battersea Power Station Development Company, set up by the Malaysian consortium, says the proposal \u2013 to fill the power station with shops, offices, luxury apartments and \u00a330m-plus penthouses, and surround it with yet more apartment blocks, all designed by star architects Lord Foster and Frank Gehry \u2013 \u201cwas the last chance to save it\u201d. But not everyone agrees. Keith Garner, a local architect and a member of the Battersea Power Station Community Group (BPSCG), which campaigns against the project, says: \u201cThis famous London landmark will disappear behind this wall of flats. And the housing isn\u2019t very nice \u2013 it\u2019s crammed in. The power station will become a big Westfield with a shopping centre inside.\u201d But Tincknell says the height of the new buildings will be capped at 60 metres, which means the brick colossus\u2019s four white chimneys will be visible from afar. \u201cIt\u2019s these things,\u201d he says, pointing at the luxury flats on a scale model of the power station, \u201cthat are paying for this [the restoration]. You don\u2019t just regenerate this out of thin air.\u201d Faced with a barrage of criticism when most of the first phase of 865 flats were sold to overseas buyers, many from Asia, the developers marketed the second lot of 254 homes only in London. But for the third tranche, of 539 apartments, a marketing campaign ran in Tokyo, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur, and there were celebrity-studded launch parties in New York and Los Angeles. State-imposed curbs on second-home purchases in Beijing and Shanghai may have further fuelled Asian interest in London. Tincknell insists that of the 1,300 homes sold so far, two-thirds have gone to UK buyers, and that \u201cpeople are coming over the river from Chelsea\u201d. But Angela Parkinson, a local resident and BPSCG campaigner, is not impressed: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a \u2018buy to leave\u2019 business. These flat are just deposit boxes for buyers taking advantage of the rising value of property in London.\u201d One of the newest blocks in the area seems to bear this out. Look up, any night, at the 52-storey Vauxhall Tower, completed in 2013, and most of the flats are in darkness. Govindia says the Nine Elms area was \u201calmost a blank slate\u201d before the diggers moved in four years ago. But it was not entirely wasteland. The famous flower market, part of New Covent Garden, Britain\u2019s biggest wholesale market, is to be demolished to make way for three towers of flats, shops and offices. The market traders petitioned unsuccessfully against the \u00a32bn redevelopment. A big Sainsbury\u2019s was also knocked down and the grocer is now developing, with housebuilder Barratt, a new store and seven towers with a total of 737 homes. This is the supermarket chain\u2019s biggest housing project, and when the flats went on the market last autumn, 11 were sold in the first eight minutes. Landmark Victorian gasholders have also been sold off by National Grid to make way for new homes. Huge amounts of foreign money are pouring into London. Chinese property company Dalian Wanda is constructing one of Europe\u2019s tallest residential buildings at One Nine Elms. Two towers of 60 and 45 storeys respectively and linked by a walkway will house 491 flats, including 52 affordable homes and a five-star hotel. The only higher homes in London will be those at the top of the Shard. The affordable housing in the projects is limited, however. At Keybridge House in Vauxhall, where BT is demolishing a telephone exchange to build five high-rise blocks, the 419 new flats include just 19 affordable homes. At 4.5% of the total, this is far short of the local Lambeth council\u2019s affordable target of 40%. The Labour leader of Lambeth council, Lib Peck, acknowledges this, but points out that the new affordable homes will be of a very high standard and \u201cbig enough for families\u201d and that a new primary school will also be built. Having had their budgets slashed as part of the government\u2019s austerity drive, local authorities are increasingly reliant on property developers to help plug gaps. Of the planned 3,444 new homes at the power station 560, or 16%, will be affordable. But that includes intermediate rent properties, which are pitched at 80% of market rates and require a family income of at least \u00a338,000 a year. When Labour members of the London Assembly attacked the drive to sell the power station flats to wealthy foreigners, saying they were \u201ca million miles from affordable to ordinary Londoners\u201d, London mayor Boris Johnson called the critics \u201cgloomadon poppers\u201d, adding that \u201c600 hundred affordable homes are better than no affordable homes\u201d. He also pointed out that the Malaysian developers were contributing \u00a3200m towards the cost of the London Underground extension that will serve the development. Tony Travers, director of the Greater London group at the London School of Economics, says: \u201cIn fairness, the developer is being required to pay for a lot of other things. The land has to be used very intensely to produce enough yield to pay for the things that the government used to pay for.\u201d The government could, he points out, have made Battersea power station a designated area of affordable and social housing. \u201cBut then the government would have had to pay for it.\u201d Many flats were sold off-plan and, still unbuilt, are back on the market at higher prices. Just before Christmas one unbuilt studio flat in the power station, which had sold for close to \u00a31m, was back on the market for \u00a31.4m. Last week, estate agent Chestertons was reported to have other unbuilt flats on the market for \u00a3865,000 \u2013 \u00a3150,000 more than their original asking price. The initial buyers never paid the full purchase price, just a deposit of up to 20%; the new buyers then take over next-stage payments. Govindia stresses that the Nine Elms revamp will bring 25,000 permanent jobs plus 20,000 construction and engineering jobs during the building phase, as well as launching a new cultural hub. This year, Damien Hirst is opening a gallery to house his art collection in a row of converted theatre warehouses, stretching along an entire street in Vauxhall. But there has been criticism on other grounds, such as the lack of a masterplan for area. Rowan Moore, Observer architecture critic and author of Why We Build, says the new buildings don\u2019t speak to each other. Sir Simon Jenkins, former chairman of the National Trust, has warned that the Thames riverside is turning into \u201ca wall of glass from Bermondsey to Battersea\u201d. Travers of the LSE talks of \u201cHong Kongification\u201d and says London\u2019s skyline \u201chas never been protected the way Paris\u2019s skyline has\u201d. He says the high density of London housing is partly the fault of the green belt, which prevents the capital sprawling into the countryside. He adds: \u201cYou can get quite high densities without building towers,\u201d pointing to blocks of social housing in Earls Court and Pimlico. And, like Moore, Travers also questions whether the Nine Elms towers are going to look good, compared with the skyscrapers further east: \u201cThe City of London has more different shapes. As a cluster, it has some kind of pizzazz.\u201d ALL CHANGE \u25a0 The transformation of Nine Elms from urban no-man\u2019s-land to \u201cDubai-on-Thames\u201d started in 2008, when the US embassy decided to move there from Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, north of the river. The Dutch embassy in west London is now following suit. \u25a0 Another catalyst was the rescue of Battersea power station by a Malaysian consortium, which bought the 42-acre London landmark for \u00a3400m after it had fallen into administration in 2011. \u25a0 The final boost came last October, when the Northern Line extension was given the green light. The area will have two new tube stations and will be 15 minutes from central London.",

Look up, any night, at the 52-storey Vauxhall Tower, completed in 2013, and most of the flats are in darkness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Look up, any night, at the 52-storey Vauxhall Tower, completed in 2013, and most of the flats are in darkness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Govindia says the Nine Elms area was \u201calmost a blank slate\u201d before the diggers moved in four years ago. But it was not entirely wasteland. The famous flower market, part of New Covent Garden, Britain\u2019s biggest wholesale market, is to be demolished to make way for three towers of flats, shops and offices. The market traders petitioned unsuccessfully against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/13/battersea-covent-garden-market-regeneration-tube-line-london-nine-elms\" title=\"\">\u00a32bn redevelopment</a>. A big Sainsbury\u2019s was also knocked down and the grocer is now developing, with housebuilder Barratt, a new store and seven towers with a total of 737 homes.</p> <p>This is the supermarket chain\u2019s biggest housing project, and when the flats went on the market last autumn, 11 were sold in the first eight minutes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/07/victorian-gas-holders-houses-national-grid\" title=\"\">Landmark Victorian gasholders have also been sold off by National Grid</a> to make way for new homes.</p> <p>Huge amounts of foreign money are pouring into London. Chinese property company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/09/how-chinese-tycoon-wang-jianlin-is-turning-hard-cash-into-soft-power\" title=\"\">Dalian Wanda</a> is constructing one of Europe\u2019s tallest residential buildings at One Nine Elms. Two towers of 60 and 45 storeys respectively and linked by a walkway will house 491 flats, including 52 affordable homes and a five-star hotel. The only higher homes in London will be those at the top of the Shard.</p> <p>The affordable housing in the projects is limited, however. At Keybridge House in Vauxhall, where BT is demolishing a telephone exchange to build five high-rise blocks, the 419 new flats include just 19 affordable homes. At 4.5% of the total, this is far short of the local Lambeth council\u2019s affordable target of 40%.</p> <p>The Labour leader of Lambeth council, Lib Peck, acknowledges this, but points out that the new affordable homes will be of a very high standard and \u201cbig enough for families\u201d and that a new primary school will also be built. Having had their budgets slashed as part of the government\u2019s austerity drive, local authorities are increasingly reliant on property developers to help plug gaps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a29fb877bd12c795c074f38ac1eb0512bf977c0d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/13/1423847818291/959a36fe-c302-472f-9752-bc6c8b890744-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"An apartment block under construction in Nine Elms.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An apartment block under construction in Nine Elms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the planned 3,444 new homes at the power station 560, or 16%, will be affordable. But that includes intermediate rent properties, which are pitched at 80% of market rates and require a family income of at least \u00a338,000 a year.</p> <p>When Labour members of the London Assembly attacked the drive to sell the power station flats to wealthy foreigners, saying they were \u201ca million miles from affordable to ordinary Londoners\u201d, London mayor Boris Johnson called the critics \u201cgloomadon poppers\u201d, adding that \u201c600 hundred affordable homes are better than no affordable homes\u201d. He also pointed out that the Malaysian developers were contributing \u00a3200m towards the cost of the London Underground extension that will serve the development.</p> <p>Tony Travers, director of the Greater London group at the London School of Economics, says: \u201cIn fairness, the developer is being required to pay for a lot of other things. The land has to be used very intensely to produce enough yield to pay for the things that the government used to pay for.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour Assembly members say the power station flats are 'a million miles from affordable to ordinary Londoners'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government could, he points out, have made Battersea power station a designated area of affordable and social housing. \u201cBut then the government would have had to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>Many flats were sold off-plan and, still unbuilt, are back on the market at higher prices. Just before Christmas one unbuilt studio flat in the power station, which had sold for close to \u00a31m, was back on the market for \u00a31.4m. Last week, estate agent Chestertons was reported to have other unbuilt flats on the market for \u00a3865,000 \u2013 \u00a3150,000 more than their original asking price. The initial buyers never paid the full purchase price, just a deposit of up to 20%; the new buyers then take over next-stage payments.</p> <p>Govindia stresses that the Nine Elms revamp will bring 25,000 permanent jobs plus 20,000 construction and engineering jobs during the building phase, as well as launching a new cultural hub. This year, Damien Hirst is opening a gallery to house his art collection in a row of converted theatre warehouses, stretching along an entire street in Vauxhall.</p> <p>But there has been criticism on other grounds, such as the lack of a masterplan for area. Rowan Moore, <em>Observer</em> architecture critic and author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/06/why-we-build-moore-review\" title=\"\"><em>Why We Build</em></a>, says the new buildings <a href=\"There has also been criticism that there%E2%80%99s no masterplan for the area %E2%80%93 the new buildings don%E2%80%99t speak to each other,\" title=\"\">don\u2019t speak to each other</a>. Sir Simon Jenkins, former chairman of the National Trust, has warned that the Thames riverside is turning into \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/28/communities.comment\" title=\"\">a wall of glass from Bermondsey to Battersea</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Travers of the LSE talks of \u201cHong Kongification\u201d and says London\u2019s skyline \u201chas never been protected the way Paris\u2019s skyline has\u201d. He says the high density of London housing is partly the fault of the green belt, which prevents the capital sprawling into the countryside. He adds: \u201cYou can get quite high densities without building towers,\u201d pointing to blocks of social housing in Earls Court and Pimlico.</p> <p>And, like Moore, Travers also questions whether the Nine Elms towers are going to look good, compared with the skyscrapers further east: \u201cThe City of London has more different shapes. As a cluster, it has some kind of pizzazz.\u201d</p> <h2>ALL CHANGE</h2> <p>\u25a0 The transformation of Nine Elms from urban no-man\u2019s-land to \u201cDubai-on-Thames\u201d started in 2008, when the US embassy decided to move there from Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, north of the river. The Dutch embassy in west London is now following suit.</p> <p>\u25a0 Another catalyst was the rescue of Battersea power station by a Malaysian consortium, which bought the 42-acre London landmark for \u00a3400m after it had fallen into administration in 2011.</p> <p>\u25a0 The final boost came last October, when the Northern Line extension was given the green light. The area will have two new tube stations and will be 15 minutes from central London.</p>",
