      "bodyText": "Detroit's gargantuan motor show starts on 9 January. When the doors open at 6am on Monday, more than 5,000 journalists from 50-plus countries will descend on the city's Cobo convention centre for a first look at the hottest new vehicles. Once again the world's top car firms are showcasing electric cars and hybrid vehicles. BMW, General Motors, Lexus, Mercedes, Nissan, Toyota, Volvo \u2013 all have new electric or hybrid cars to show off. As usual they will garner huge amounts of coverage. But will anyone buy them? The signs are not good. Last year GM's Chevy Volt was named car of the year at the Detroit auto show, beating the Nissan Leaf. The Volt runs on a combination of battery and old school combustion engine, the Leaf is all electric \u2013 they were heralded as the first mass market electric cars. Neither has proved a hit with consumers. Both missed their 10,000 vehicle sales targets for the year, Nissan by a fraction and Volt by more than 2,000. By comparison, Toyota sold 308,510 Camrys last year. As if to rub it in, the new year got off to a bad start for the Volt, with GM asking owners to bring in their cars to dealerships after problems with their batteries. Some analysts are predicting this could be a pivotal year for the industry's flirtation with alternative fuels. After the worst recession in living memory, car sales are bouncing back. Overall, auto sales were up more than 10% in the US last year. But while consumers returned to the showrooms, sales of \"alternative power source light vehicles\" rose just 2.3%, according to the analysts WardsAuto. Even industry executives are not optimistic. A survey of global car executives by KPMG recently found that they do not expect electric-car sales to exceed 15% of annual global car sales before 2025. This figure is still far higher than most independent analysts offer. \"This could be a crunch year,\" said Ed Hellwig of the auto analysts Edmunds.com. Consumers will have access to more supply and more choices in alternative-fuel cars than ever in 2012. \"This could be the year when we see whether this is really ready to go mainstream or the public just aren't interested,\" he said. Sales of hybrid cars in general have been flat for the past few years, said Anthony Pratt, director of forecasting at the car industry analysts Polk. Even in Europe, where petrol prices are far higher, the electric and hybrid market remained tiny, he said. And in the short term things could even get worse. Alternative-fuel cars are competing with vehicles from manufacturers that have undergone a Damascene conversion to energy efficiency. Detroit's big three in particular suffered terribly after betting their businesses on gas-guzzling behemoths as the recession bit and petrol prices soared. Now all the major companies boast fuel-efficient technology and less thirsty cars that make the switch to hybrid or electric vehicles more difficult for consumers to make on a purely economic level. Paul Taylor, the National Automobile Dealers Association's chief economist, said that, much to the chagrin of car manufacturers and the green lobby, consumers were conducting a \"rational cost-benefit analysis\". He added: \"People are enthusiastic about hybrid and electric cars but when they see how much they cost, they want to test drive something else.\" This lack of enthusiasm has been going on for some time. Even when oil prices reached record highs, sales of alternatively fuelled cars rose only modestly, Taylor said. Brandon Mason, senior analyst at PricewaterhouseCoopers' Autofacts group, said more efficient combustion engines are cutting consumption by 15%-25% in some vehicles. \"There are a lot of very competitive and fuel-efficient cars out there right now.\" However, new fuels are going to play an increasingly important role, Mason said. \"With any new technology you need to bring the price down and get the infrastructure right. That is going to take some time.\" In the long term, alternative fuels will receive some significant boosts. The US government has asked manufacturers to make 35.5 miles per US gallon (mpg) \u2013 equivalent to 15km a litre \u2013 standard by 2016, far above today's 22mpg average but still within reach of old technology. By 2025, the US wants manufacturers to have doubled fuel efficiency. On top of that, some states, including California, require manufacturers to have at least one zero-emission car in their fleets. Over time these factors should help boost alternative-fuel sales. Meanwhile, few expect the carmakers to cut back their heavy investment in new technologies. \"It's the price of poker,\" Pratt said. Manufacturers have to be involved in the latest technology. But that technology is in its infancy, and the next five years could be even more challenging.\"",

      "bodyText": "When the doors to Detroit's gargantuan auto show open at 6am Monday, more than 5,000 journalists from 50-plus countries will descend on the city's 2.4m sq ft Cobo conference center for a first look at the hottest new vehicles from the world's top auto firms. Once again, the top car firms are showcasing electric cars and hybrid vehicles. BMW, GM, Lexus, Mercedes, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo all have new electric or hybrid cars to show off. As usual they will garner massive amounts of coverage. But will anyone buy them? \"This could be a crunch year,\" said Ed Hellwig of auto analyst Edmunds.com. Consumers will have access to more supply and more choices in alternative fuel cars than ever in 2012, he said. \"This could be the year when we see whether this is really ready to go mainstream or the public just aren't interested.\" The signs are not good. In the wake of the worst recession in living memory, car sales overall are creeping back, up over 10% in the US last year. But even as consumers returned to the show rooms, according to analyst WardsAuto, sales of \"alternative power source light vehicles\" rose just 2.3%. Last year GM's Chevy Volt was named car of the year at the Detroit auto show, beating the Nissan Leaf. The Volt runs on a combination of battery and old school combustion engine, the Leaf is all electric \u2013 they were heralded as the first mass market electric cars. Neither has proved a hit with consumers. Both missed their 10,000 vehicle sales targets for the year, Nissan by a fraction and Volt by over 2,000. By comparison Toyota sold 308,510 combustion-engine Camrys last year. To make matters worse for GM, the Volt is currently being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration because its batteries caught on fire in the weeks following three government crash tests. Sales of hybrid cars in general have been flat for the last few years, said Anthony Pratt, director of forecasting at auto analyst Polk. Even in Europe where gas prices are far higher, the electric and hybrid market remains tiny, he said. There will also be more cars that run on alternative fuels at the show, such clean-diesel, possibly including the first diesel passenger car from a US maker. But analysts are skeptical that these cars will make inroads in the marketplace for at least five years or more. That's because alternative fuel cars are now competing with vehicles from manufacturers who have undergone a Damascene conversion to energy efficiency: more efficient combustion engines are cutting fuel consumption by 15% to 25% in some newer vehicles, according to Brandon Mason, senior analyst at PwC's Autofacts group. \"There are a lot of very competitive and fuel efficient cars out there right now,\" he said. Still, Mason contends the annual hype over electric and hybrid cars, and increasingly, alternative fuels, isn't without merit. \"With any new technology you need time to bring the price down and get the infrastructure right,\" he said. \"That is going to take some time.\" Over the longer term, alternative fuels are set to receive some significant boosts.

      "standfirst": "Morgan Stanley raises recommendation on ITV but warns of problems ahead for satellite broadcaster", 
      "body": "<p>Broadcasters <strong>ITV</strong> and <strong>BSkyB</strong> were heading in different directions after a hefty note on the media sector from Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>The bank's analysts raised their recommendation on ITV from equal weight to overweight, with an 80p a share price target. They believe ITV may get off to a slow start for the year (although rival analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted a stronger advertising performance in the first quarter than previously expected) but said business should pick up after that.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley said that ITV benefited from a low valuation, a strong balance sheet, exposure to the UK advertising market during the Olympics, and the prospect of further cost cuts:</p> <blockquote> We expect a \u00a320m to \u00a325m cost saving programme to be announced in February. </blockquote> <p>But Morgan Stanley was more negative on BSkyB, where it happens to act as corporate broker. Its analysts have moved from overweight to equal weight and cut their price target from 800p to 790p.</p> <p>They said the company faced five headwinds at the start of 2012:</p> <p>\u2022 it continues to operate in a difficult consumer environment and is entirely exposed to the UK and Ireland;</p> <p>\u2022 the renegotiation of the Premier League football rights come up shortly, with rival bids likely from ESPN and possibly left field players such as Al Jazeera, which could push up the bidding (the bank predicts the annual cost rising from \u00a3541m to \u00a3649m);</p> <p>\u2022 it faces the prospect of the competition commission pressing for a break-up of Sky's exclusive film deals with the Hollywood studios;</p> <p>\u2022 there is the threat of increased competition when YouView, the internet-enabled successor to Freeview, is launched by June;</p> <p>\u2022 and the outcome of Ofcom's fit and proper person test relating to News Corporation's stake in the business, which could in extremis lead to Rupert Murdoch's company having to sell some of its stake in BSkyB.</p> <p>The upshot was that ITV rose 1.9p to 71.35p - an increase of nearly 3% - while BSkyB lost 9.5p to 711.5p.</p> <p>Overall, positive news on US jobs proved a temporary distraction from the eurozone crisis, although by the end of the trading session the market had come off its best levels. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 25.42p higher at 5649.68 as investors continued to worry about next week's debt auctions by Spain and Italy, and news that Fitch had downgraded Hungary's credit rating. The spectre of a cut in France's Triple A rating by Standard &amp; Poor's still looms large. Still, the leading index is up around 80 points on the first - shortened - week of the new year.</p> <p>Despite worries about bank funding in the wake of Unicredit's deeply discounted cash call, the sector seemed to hold up reasonably well. <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> shook off a report from Barclays Capital that it may need to make \u00a320bn more provisions in 2012 for problematic mortgages and corporate loans. BarCap said <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> may need to take further charges of \u00a313bn. These figures come on top of the \u00a3100bn of impairments the two banks have taken over the past four years. BarCap analyst Rohith Chandra-Rajan said:</p> <blockquote> After \u00a3100bn impairments charged by Lloyds and RBS over the four years 2008 to 2011 we had anticipated a decline in provisions in 2012. However, a slow and fragile economic recovery has led us to reassess this view and we see a high risk of a renewed deterioration in credit quality. <br> With higher impairment forecasts, we now expect Lloyds to be loss-making again this year. Along with a relatively weak capital position, this leads us to reiterate our underweight rating on Lloyds. We continue to prefer RBS and maintain an overweight rating. </blockquote> <p>But Lloyds ended 0.76p higher at 27.11p while RBS rose 0.24p to 20.51p</p> <p><strong>Man </strong>lost 10.3p to 112.7p, making the hedge fund group the biggest faller in the leading index as a number of brokers turn negative. RBC Capital Markets cut its recommendation from outperform to sector perform, and its price target by 40p to 145p:</p> <blockquote> We believe there are both benefits and challenges to an investment in Man Group. In our opinion, in the absence of strong AHL performance and the cessation of outflows, we now fail to see positive catalysts in the near-term. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile JP Morgan said consensus forecasts implied what looked like an unlikely level of performance at the start of the year:</p> <blockquote> Man continues to struggle against weaker investment performance and poor flows.

      "bodyText": "Broadcasters ITV and BSkyB were heading in different directions after a hefty note on the media sector from Morgan Stanley. The bank's analysts raised their recommendation on ITV from equal weight to overweight, with an 80p a share price target. They believe ITV may get off to a slow start for the year (although rival analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted a stronger advertising performance in the first quarter than previously expected) but said business should pick up after that. Morgan Stanley said that ITV benefited from a low valuation, a strong balance sheet, exposure to the UK advertising market during the Olympics, and the prospect of further cost cuts: We expect a \u00a320m to \u00a325m cost saving programme to be announced in February. But Morgan Stanley was more negative on BSkyB, where it happens to act as corporate broker. Its analysts have moved from overweight to equal weight and cut their price target from 800p to 790p. They said the company faced five headwinds at the start of 2012: \u2022 it continues to operate in a difficult consumer environment and is entirely exposed to the UK and Ireland; \u2022 the renegotiation of the Premier League football rights come up shortly, with rival bids likely from ESPN and possibly left field players such as Al Jazeera, which could push up the bidding (the bank predicts the annual cost rising from \u00a3541m to \u00a3649m); \u2022 it faces the prospect of the competition commission pressing for a break-up of Sky's exclusive film deals with the Hollywood studios; \u2022 there is the threat of increased competition when YouView, the internet-enabled successor to Freeview, is launched by June; \u2022 and the outcome of Ofcom's fit and proper person test relating to News Corporation's stake in the business, which could in extremis lead to Rupert Murdoch's company having to sell some of its stake in BSkyB. The upshot was that ITV rose 1.9p to 71.35p - an increase of nearly 3% - while BSkyB lost 9.5p to 711.5p. Overall, positive news on US jobs proved a temporary distraction from the eurozone crisis, although by the end of the trading session the market had come off its best levels. The FTSE 100 finished 25.42p higher at 5649.68 as investors continued to worry about next week's debt auctions by Spain and Italy, and news that Fitch had downgraded Hungary's credit rating. The spectre of a cut in France's Triple A rating by Standard &amp; Poor's still looms large. Still, the leading index is up around 80 points on the first - shortened - week of the new year. Despite worries about bank funding in the wake of Unicredit's deeply discounted cash call, the sector seemed to hold up reasonably well. Lloyds Banking Group shook off a report from Barclays Capital that it may need to make \u00a320bn more provisions in 2012 for problematic mortgages and corporate loans. BarCap said Royal Bank of Scotland may need to take further charges of \u00a313bn. These figures come on top of the \u00a3100bn of impairments the two banks have taken over the past four years. BarCap analyst Rohith Chandra-Rajan said: After \u00a3100bn impairments charged by Lloyds and RBS over the four years 2008 to 2011 we had anticipated a decline in provisions in 2012. However, a slow and fragile economic recovery has led us to reassess this view and we see a high risk of a renewed deterioration in credit quality. With higher impairment forecasts, we now expect Lloyds to be loss-making again this year. Along with a relatively weak capital position, this leads us to reiterate our underweight rating on Lloyds. We continue to prefer RBS and maintain an overweight rating. But Lloyds ended 0.76p higher at 27.11p while RBS rose 0.24p to 20.51p Man lost 10.3p to 112.7p, making the hedge fund group the biggest faller in the leading index as a number of brokers turn negative. RBC Capital Markets cut its recommendation from outperform to sector perform, and its price target by 40p to 145p: We believe there are both benefits and challenges to an investment in Man Group. In our opinion, in the absence of strong AHL performance and the cessation of outflows, we now fail to see positive catalysts in the near-term. Meanwhile JP Morgan said consensus forecasts implied what looked like an unlikely level of performance at the start of the year: Man continues to struggle against weaker investment performance and poor flows. In our view estimates risk falling further. Credit Suisse lowered its price target on Man from 215p to 175p to reflect a 26% reduction in its 2012 earnings forecast. The bank was also negative on the asset management sector, cutting its rating from outperform to neutral on both Ashmore, 9.6p lower at 321.3p, and Jupiter Fund Management, down 11.4p at 196p. Elsewhere GlaxoSmithKline climbed 15p to \u00a314.97. Late in the day traders heard talk it could be taking a look at US group Human Genome. Burberry rose 47p to 312.50 on hopes for its business in China, following talk the country's central bank planned to cut its banks' reserve requirement again to boost the economy. Among the mid-caps Mitchells &amp; Butlers added 20p to 249.8p as analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out that billionaire Joe Lewis, who withdrew an offer last year but has since increased his stake to nearly 26%, was free to bid again from April. But estate agency Savills slipped 8.1p to 336p after a downgrade from UBS. The bank said: We lower our recommendation to neutral from buy following recent strong performance. The shares are up 33% (total return) in the last three months, outperforming the FTSE all share by 22%. We continue to believe that Savills is an attractive play on global real estate markets.

      "bodyText": "As Spaniards celebrated the twelfth day of Christmas today by opening presents brought by the three wise men, the new government received an unwanted gift in the form of shocking unemployment figures that show almost one in four are jobless. Figures from Eurostat revealed Spain's unemployment rate had hit 22.9%, with the country accounting for at least one in five of Europe's jobless. The figures came just days after officials admitted the social security system had slipped into the red for the first time since 1999 and new finance minister Luis de Guindos warned that the welfare state was under threat. Few people expect the figures to improve in the short term as Spain enters the second part of a double-dip recession. The Workers' Commissions trades union has said the fight is now to avoid unemploment rising from five million people to 5.5 million, or one-third of all the unemployed in the euro zone. But measures to rein in a runaway budget deficit of around 8% will almost certainly push unemployment still higher as the new conservative government of Mariano Rajoy attempts to tax and axe its way out of trouble. Rajoy has already hiked income tax, with some top earners now paying 56% \u2013 making Spain a rival for Sweden and Denmark as Europe's biggest taxer of the rich. Further measures to shrink the state are expected to be introduced in coming days, with a partial sell-off on the cards of both airports and the lottery system. But the tax rises and spending cuts announced to date account for less than half of Rajoy's target of reducing the deficit by up to \u20ac40bn (\u00a333bn), leaving it at 4.4%, this year in order to meet European Union-set targets and calm bond markets. More cuts are inevitable, though Andrew Benito of Goldman Sachs has warned that harsh austerity will deepen the fall back into recession.

According to the US Labour Department's monthly survey of employers private companies added 212,000 jobs in December, while the public sector\u2014federal, state and local governments\u2014shrank by 12,000. A separate survey of US households said the unemployment rate sank to 8.5% in December, its lowest level since February 2009. While job growth has yet to make up for the ground lost during the recession, 13.1 million Americans remain unemployed, December was the 15th consecutive month that the job numbers have risen.

    "webTitle": "UK car sales fall to lowest since 1994", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Car sales fell 4.4% last year to their lowest level since 1994 as a strong 2011 for manufacturers failed to be reflected in showrooms across the UK. Total new registrations were 1.94m, with the Ford Fiesta the best-selling vehicle, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It is the lowest total since 1994, when 1.91m cars were sold. New car sales are a bellwether for British consumer sentiment rather than industrial strength. About eight out of 10 cars built in the UK are exported and Friday's SMMT figures confirmed that the industry's domestic and export markets are on divergent paths. Car manufacturing has recovered more strongly from the credit crunch than UK saes, with production forecast to increase this year and next. Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive, said a rebalancing of the UK economy \u2013 away from consumption and towards production \u2013 would produce these \"unusual\" figures. \"With this whole concept of rebalancing the economy, this is what you would expect to see,\" he said. \"Consumer demand is weaker but at the same time we are seeing a strong performance in some key segments of the manufacturing economy.\" The SMMT expects 2012 sales to be flat on this year's total, with 2013 staging a \"firmer\" recovery. Everitt expressed concerns over a consumer market that is now at lows not seen since the early 1990s. Although total car sales declined 4.4%, that figure would have been even worse were it not for a strong performance in fleet sales, driven by demand for hire cars and company cars. Consumer sales slumped 14%. \"The consumer in 2011 is as anxious as they have been since the early 1990s. It is not surprising given the level of concern that people have had about jobs, squeezed living standards and the instability of the eurozone,\" said Everitt. Higher petrol prices also appear to have influenced consumer behaviour, with diesel and alternatively fuelled cars taking record market shares in 2011. Sales have fallen against a backdrop of less frequent vehicle use as well, with road traffic falling 1.6% in 2010. The top five was rounded out by the Ford Focus, the Vauxhall Corsa, the Volkswagen Golf and the Vauxhall Astra. Manufacturing was also propped up by a government scrappage scheme, which subsidised the replacement of dated vehicles with cars straight off the production line, whose expiry in 2010 also affected today's numbers, with 2011 sales struggling to match the 2010 data as a consequence. Nonetheless, strong demand in China, the US, and India has helped Britain's car factories outperform its showrooms as facilities owned by the likes of Nissan, Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover prepare for another year of strong demand. The SMMT expects the UK industry to manufacture around 1.5m cars this year, up 5% on last year, with the 2012 total rising to 1.6m. Consultancy firm Deloitte said it expected a decline in car sales in 2012 to 1.84m vehicles, as demand across Europe struggles. David Raistrick, Deloitte's head of UK manufacturing, said: \"We believe total new car registrations for 2012 will be relatively low \u2013 around the 1.84m mark. There is no doubt that 2012 is going to be a tough year. I expect there will be a levelling off for sales in new and used car sales, both in the UK and more widely across Europe.\" Neil King, an automotive analyst at Euromonitor, said the figures showed the weakest performance since 1994. \"The fall in new car sales in 2011 compared to 2010 comes as no real surprise following the introduction of the 20% VAT rate and the fact that demand was still bolstered by the scrappage scheme in the first half of 2010. However, with just 1.941m new cars sold in 2011, this is the UK's weakest performance since 1994 and it is rather worrying that demand was even down in the second half compared to a weak, post-stimulus second half of 2010. Mercifully, fleet demand continues to recover and limited the market's decline to just 4.4% but the outlook naturally remains weak until the eurozone crisis is resolved, unemployment stops rising and, ultimately, confidence levels improve.\"",

      "bodyText": "Tradition dictates that if Christmas decorations are not tidied away by today, households will be plagued by bad luck for the rest of year. The centuries-old Twelfth Night tradition could leave hundreds of the nation's wealthiest in a spot of bother as many are still awaiting Christmas hampers costing up to \u00a35,000 from Fortnum &amp; Mason. The world-famous Piccadilly emporium has been forced to admit that it still has not delivered orders placed weeks before Christmas. Fortnum, which traces its roots back to 1707, said it has still not been able to deliver all of its orders for festive treats, including its \u00a340 Queen Elizabeth Christmas pudding with gold-leaf almonds. The Queen's favourite grocer said it was still reeling from an IT glitch that brought down its electronic delivery system before Christmas. Despite drafting in 100 extra customer service staff, including managing director Beverley Aspinall, the store is still faced with a significant backlog almost two weeks after the big day. A spokesman for the company, which has previously managed to deliver a hamper to an expedition up Mount Everest, said the \"vast majority of customers received their orders before Christmas\" but admitted there many are still awaiting their box of treats. \"Fortnum &amp; Mason experienced severe issues with IT infrastructure that caused delays to some Christmas deliveries,\" the spokesman said. \"This was not acceptable and we are working with our IT suppliers to ensure that we do not disappoint our customers again in the future. \"We are very sorry that this situation occurred. We have been doing everything in our power to rectify it for our customers, so that we can deliver the excellence of service that they expect. We will offer a full refund to anyone who did not receive their order and our customer service team is working through any outstanding issues on orders.\" The company would not say how many people were still awaiting delivery. The long delay is likely to embarrass the company, which has boasted Queen Victoria, Oscar Wilde, Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra among its celebrity clientele. On its website, the Piccadilly store states that: \"It's at Christmas that the Fortnum's hamper really comes into its own. After all, what could be more satisfying than to have Christmas delivered to your door?

Mixing clients' money with a bank's own is a serious matter, which is why the Financial Services Authority (FSA) last year whacked the US bank's UK broking division with a \u00a333m fine. The failures ran for seven years and an average of \u00a35bn of clients' cash was potentially at risk every day. A record penalty, big enough to be noticed by the bank's bigwigs, was entirely in order. Now consider the size of the penalty for PwC, which consistently gave false reports to the FSA that clients' assets at JP Morgan Securities were properly segregated. The industry's independent regulator, the Accountancy and Actuarial Discipline Board, pondered mightily and decided that PwC also deserves a record fine. But, in the AADB's case, the sum turns out to be \u00a31.4m, small enough to be lost in the wash at a firm the size of PwC. OK, PwC wasn't the principal \u2013 JP Morgan was. Nor was there any suggestion of fraud. As the report puts it, PwC simply did not carry out its work \"with due skill, care and diligence and with proper regard for the applicable technical and professional standards expected of it\". Even so, it's astonishing that the regulator, in a case involving billions of pounds of other people's money, can regard \u00a31.4m as an appropriate penalty for an auditor. The FSA's fine on JP Morgan Securities (the main non-US broker/dealer of the US bank) represented 6.9% of the firm's profits last year. On the same basis, PwC would be writing a cheque for \u00a344m, or \u00a340,600 per partner, which would certainly concentrate minds. The AADB deemed such an approach to be \"irrational\". That's fair enough, since there's no logical basis for dishing out fines solely on the basis of a company's profits. On the other hand, fines have to be big enough to be felt. The AADB seems jolly pleased with itself for securing what it regards as a substantial hike in potential penalties in cases such as this. Think again, chaps: if you'd opted for \u00a36m, one of the sums considered during the disciplinary hearing, the boast might have some weight. But \u00a31.4m looks feeble.",
