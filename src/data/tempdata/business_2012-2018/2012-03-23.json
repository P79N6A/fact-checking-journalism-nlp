      "bodyText": "Next week the Office for National Statistics is expected to confirm the economy shrank in the last three months of 2011. On Wednesday it will issue its last review of survey evidence for the period and what it says about the state of retailing, manufacturing, construction and the rest. It was a bad time for which the government and the eurozone crisis can share the blame. What is more in doubt is the path of the economy in the first three months of 2012. A feelgood factor has warmed right-wing political debate, with some coalition MPs claiming they have sighted green shoots of recovery. Surveys of manufacturing and services were upbeat. Two months of positive retail sales added to the impression that Britain was getting back on its feet, and the consumer was leading the charge. There was evidence during January and February that middle income consumers were refusing to pay down debt and the poorest were turning to payday loan companies in ever bigger numbers. Maybe they were spending the money on the high street. It was possible, though Bank of England lending data pointed in the opposite direction. Then it happened. A dive in the retail spending figures for February, combined with a retrospective downgrade in the spending figures for January showed that the message from the high street was mangled by the ONS. It was always wrong. The spending splurge was a mirage and while green shoots of recovery from the consumer side of the economic equation appeared real, they were a trick of the light. When they were published, the ONS figures for January didn't add up without a huge rise in borrowing. Now we know the rise in inflation, which is still high despite coming down to 3.4%, combined with ultra-low wage rises (the annual rise is running at 1.7%) and a lending clampdown continues to depress consumption. Borrowing, such as it is, can be seen in a slow decline rather than the rapid decline many economists believe is necessary to bring household debts back to manageable levels. Ben Broadbent, the Goldman Sachs economist and monetary policy committee member, took the opposite line in a speech last week. He said households can sustain higher levels of debt than previously believed because most of the equity released from the housing market had gone into savings and the net position was little changed from the early 1990s. With households no more leveraged than two decades ago, they are freer to spend than many think. This argument mentions, but ultimately ignores, the fact that most of the benefits of housing have been hoarded by older households, and bigger mortgages have been taken on by young families. Young families are the lifeblood of the economy and they remain up to their necks in debt. Broadbent is giving evidence to the House of Lords next week, but is in danger of giving a distorted impression of the consumer with a broad brush aggregate view of macroeconomic trends. The budget did nothing to help young families. The Insitute for Fiscal Studies said it did the opposite and punished them more than any other group. With tax credit and housing benefit cuts to come this year and next, familes are likely to carry on delaying big ticket purchases and spending will remain subdued. If they do borrow to spend, as Broadbent argues they can, it just perpetuates Britain's game of debt-fuelled consumption.",

      "standfirst": "As President Obama picks a nominee, what the new head of the World Bank might find on his or her agenda straight away", 
      "body": "<h2>Getting the world's poor back on the agenda</h2> <p>Since the economic crisis, the World Bank's role has been overshadowed by the International Monetary Fund, which has stepped in to bail out a string of struggling western economies, while many countries have cut back their overseas aid budgets. A new World Bank boss will have to make the argument that fighting poverty should still be a top priority.</p> <h2>Fighting high and volatile food prices</h2> <p>High and volatile prices for food and other basic commodities have caused hunger and political upheaval in scores of developing countries. The World Bank has the challenge of providing relief to the worst hit through its Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP). It has vowed to help raise agricultural yields in the poorest countries and is also looking into ways companies in developing nations can hedge against food price hikes.</p> <p>There is pressure to rapidly improve infrastructure, particularly in Africa, to help bring food prices down and improve profitability for farmers.</p> <p>The new World Bank head will also have to push further research into so-called \"land grabs\" of agricultural terrain in developing nations, particularly in Africa, by richer nations and companies. It is an issue gaining political and NGO attention and the World Bank has faced criticism in the past that some of its food policies have facilitated land grabs</p> <h2>Integrating China and the other leading developing countries into the fight against poverty</h2> <p>Middle-income countries, particularly China, are playing a growing and controversial role in delivering overseas aid, often hand-in-hand with lucrative commercial investments.

      "bodyText": "Getting the world's poor back on the agenda Since the economic crisis, the World Bank's role has been overshadowed by the International Monetary Fund, which has stepped in to bail out a string of struggling western economies, while many countries have cut back their overseas aid budgets. A new World Bank boss will have to make the argument that fighting poverty should still be a top priority. Fighting high and volatile food prices High and volatile prices for food and other basic commodities have caused hunger and political upheaval in scores of developing countries. The World Bank has the challenge of providing relief to the worst hit through its Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP). It has vowed to help raise agricultural yields in the poorest countries and is also looking into ways companies in developing nations can hedge against food price hikes. There is pressure to rapidly improve infrastructure, particularly in Africa, to help bring food prices down and improve profitability for farmers. The new World Bank head will also have to push further research into so-called \"land grabs\" of agricultural terrain in developing nations, particularly in Africa, by richer nations and companies. It is an issue gaining political and NGO attention and the World Bank has faced criticism in the past that some of its food policies have facilitated land grabs Integrating China and the other leading developing countries into the fight against poverty Middle-income countries, particularly China, are playing a growing and controversial role in delivering overseas aid, often hand-in-hand with lucrative commercial investments. The World Bank, as the only global anti-poverty body, has a crucial role in trying to negotiate a common approach and share best practice about schemes that have worked well. Giving these countries more voice at the Washington-based institution, which remains too dominated by the Old World powers, would be a good start. Sorting out the Bank's environmental policies Protecting poor countries from climate change is one of the World Bank's key public priorities; but campaigners complain that it still offers loans to polluting coal plants and oil pipelines. The Bank needs a coherent approach to all its projects, worldwide.

      "bodyText": "The UK's major banks are being told to step up their efforts to raise capital by a new Bank of England regulatory body which is concerned they are not holding enough to \"ensure resilience in the face of the prospective risks\". After telling banks to restrain their dividends to shareholders and bonuses to staff last year in an effort to build up capital, the financial policy committee (FPC) has now adopted a tougher stance by saying the banks need to raise capital from external sources \"as early as feasible\". The FPC, set up by the coalition to tackle systemic risks in the financial system, also attracted criticism from Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, for failing to explain why it was not going to ask the government for powers to intervene in the mortgage market. The FPC did not detail how much more capital banks would need and it will now fall to the Financial Services Authority to have discussions with individual banks about their capital positions. All them are holding capital well above the minimum regulatory requirements, but the FPC is more concerned about absolute capital levels than the ratio of capital to its risks. The last time the FPC made pronouncements after its quarterly meetings it warned of the \"exceptionally threatening environment\" posed by the eurozone crisis and need to restrict bonuses and dividends to amass capital. The FPC said on Friday that the FSA had then discussed with banks how they could build capital in the short term. \"Some progress has been made by banks in meeting the committee's recommendation,\" the FPC said, with cash bonuses down at four of the five largest UK banks and 17% down in total. Total capital at the three largest banks without taxpayer bailouts (while not named by the FPC these are Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered) has increased by more than \u00a31.5bn in the second half of 2011. \"Nevertheless, the committee remained concerned that capital was not yet at levels that would ensure resilience in the face of the prospective risks. It therefore agreed on the need for banks to continue to restrain cash distributions, including via share buybacks. But the scope to build capital through this route was limited. It therefore advised banks to raise external capital as early as feasible,\" the FPC said. Three months ago it said banks should give \"serious consideration\" to raising capital. The members of the FPC, led by Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King, agreed that financial markets but were still \"fragile\", even with the European Central Bank's long-term financial operations. \"Banks with large exposures to those countries where risks of persistent low economic growth and potential credit defaults remained high should be particularly alert to the need to build capital,\" the FPC said. The committee, which will not get statutory powers until next year, wants to be able to impose additional capital requirements on banks through what are known as \"counter cyclical buffers\" that can then be drawn down when the economy weakens. But the FPC called for a wider debate about whether it should be allowed to intervene in the mortgage market to restrict the size of loans to the value of a home or the size of the loan according to the homebuyer's income. \"While recognising the potential power of these instruments, the committee also noted that the use of these tools would require a high level of public acceptability,\" the FPC said. This infuriated Tyrie. \"The FPC's decision not to ask for stronger tools appears to demonstrate clearly that they lack the confidence, at this time, to explain to the wider public why such tools are necessary,\" the MP said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's high streets have more empty shops than at any time in four years after retailers suffered a bout of post-Christmas closures, according to a survey. The Local Data Company reported its monthly barometer of shop vacancies had jumped to 14.6% in February after steadying last year at 14.3%. The figures paint a gloomy picture of high streets hit hard by shop closures and combine with official figures that show a fall in retail sales last month. A report by Deloitte this week added to the sense of unease, concluding that the longer-term outlook for Britain's high streets remains uncertain and warning that four out of 10 shops will have to shut in the next five years as consumers turn their backs on traditional stores in favour of online shopping. The report was published shortly after computer game retailer Game Group said it had run out of cash and could be forced to make 6,000 staff redundant. The company's shares were suspended and it is expected to appoint administrators in the next few days. Analysts said the struggle faced by retailers emphasised the pressures households were facing, after George Osborne vowed to push on with Britain's austerity drive. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes fell twice as fast as expected last month, while January's rise was revised sharply lower. The news is a blow to the chancellor as he pins his hopes on a recovery this year to avoid recession and soften the impact of the coalition's cuts. His budget on Wednesday quickly came under fire for ushering in a tax cut for the super-rich while taking money away from pensioners and some working families. Households have struggled with rising unemployment and with falling real incomes as their wages have failed to keep pace with inflation during Britain's lacklustre recovery. Underlining those pressures, the Office for National Statistics reported that retail sales volumes fell 0.8% month-on-month in February, the sharpest drop in nine months. They were a mere 1% higher than a year earlier, less than half the 2.5% growth forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. Analysts said the fall and downward revisions to sales growth in December and January cast doubt over any recovery suggested by company results and business surveys. \"February's UK retail sales figures leave the recovery on the high street looking a bit more fragile than it previously seemed,\" said Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics. \"With the budget doing little to ease the burden of the next round of austerity measures due to hit households in April, the high street recovery looks set to be short-lived again.\" The ONS said the February drop was driven by the sharpest fall for two years at \"other stores\", a category that includes jewellers, carpet stores, haberdashers and computer shops. Within that, the biggest drop was in sales of fine art and antiques. In value terms, sales fell 0.4% in February, again the weakest performance since last May. The data echoes a cautious outlook from retailers, although there have been reports of high street profits recovering in recent weeks. The head of Next, Britain's second largest clothing retailer, said on Thursday he expected the UK consumer mood to remain subdued in 2012. \"I don't think things are going to get any worse than last year. They may get slightly better, but I don't think they're going to get a lot better,\" the company's chief executive, Lord Wolfson, said after reporting a 5% rise in profits last year. He said the benefit to the British consumer of falling inflation was being offset by unemployment and tight credit availability. He is also worried that a worsening of the eurozone debt crisis will hit UK consumer sentiment. Kingfisher, Europe's biggest home improvements retailer, was also wary about the short-term economic outlook but was confident of coping, thanks in part to improved margins on cheaper goods from China.",
