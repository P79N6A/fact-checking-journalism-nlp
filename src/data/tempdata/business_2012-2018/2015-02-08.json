    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The HSBC files, the biggest banking leak in history, reveal the full scale of malpractice at its Swiss subsidiary. Recent court cases in the US and Europe have provided individual examples of the bank\u2019s wrongdoing, but the leaked files show how these cases were part of a persistent pattern of misconduct. In one case that illustrates the bank\u2019s conduct, a wealthy British client, Stoke City football club director Keith Humphreys, frankly told his HSBC manager that his father\u2019s $430,000 (\u00a3280,000) Swiss account was \u201cnot declared\u201d to the UK tax authorities. Humphreys, whose wealth originated from the sale of a local supermarket chain, explained that one HSBC manager had already advised how to extract undeclared offshore money via a credit card. \u201cThe credit card is thus used to enable the Humphreys family to make withdrawals from \u2018cash points\u2019 when they are outside the UK,\u201d he said. The banker, who even brought paperwork to Humphreys\u2019 stately home in Cheshire because the client was uneasy about \u201cwalking around with a set of account-opening documents\u201d, recorded how Humphreys was also alarmed to hear a Swiss lawyer might realise he had a secret HSBC account. \u201cThis situation initially appeared to cause some disquiet to my hosts, though this later gave way to a more relaxed attitude with the sentiment that Genevan lawyers would be discreet, something that I did nothing to discourage.\u201d On clinching arrangements in London, the bank manager wrote: \u201cWe subsequently repaired to the Ritz, for a very enjoyable lunch.\u201d Humphreys told the Guardian his father eventually had to repay about $224,000 (\u00a3147,000) for evading tax due to the UK. Another customer, retired accountant Andrew Sebastian, also told the Guardian how he had now been made to pay about $64,000 (\u00a342,000) in back tax, interest and penalties. HSBC in Switzerland had supplied him with \u00a350,000 in sterling banknotes in the course of a year. At its height, HSBC\u2019s secretive Swiss arm hid a total of $120bn (\u00a378bn) in assets. These funds were collected from wealthy clients all over the world and have already led to criminal investigations and charges against the bank in France, Belgium, the US and Argentina. But in Britain, no legal action has been taken against HSBC and the evidence against it had never been made public until now. The leaked Swiss HSBC files implicate the bank in apparent misbehaviour all over the world. One Australia-based HSBC client planned to share his \u201cblack\u201d account with his daughter in London. The bank noted: \u201cThe account is \u2018undeclared\u2019, a fact with which [she] may not be entirely at ease \u2013 as a compliance officer at Kleinwort Benson.\u201d The manager wrote that the account was also not declared \u201cto the best of my knowledge\u201d to the tax authorities in Australia. HSBC was so keen to protect its clients that it used a codename when phoning another prominent Australian financier, Charles Goode, then chairman of the ANZ bank in Melbourne, about his US$318,000 deposit. According to the files, HSBC instructed he \u201cwould like to be called Mr Shaw\u201d. Goode told the Guardian the use of a codename was the bank\u2019s idea, not his, and the deposit had long been left dormant by him. He says he has paid all tax due on the account. Another HSBC manager wrote on the file of Irish businessman John Cashell (later to be convicted of a tax fraud): \u201cHis preoccupation is with the risk of disclosure to the Irish authorities. Once again I endeavoured to reassure him that there is no risk of that happening.\u201d HSBC similarly recorded on the file of a British property developer: \u201cHe is very much concerned that \u2026 client information could be exchanged \u2026 I explained [to] him that we are bound to CH [Swiss] banking secrecy, which is one of the strictest in the world.\u201d HSBC appears to have allowed executives of a textile firm to conceal unregistered \u201cbearer share\u201d certificates in a Swiss safe, which would have revealed who really owned the company. Bearer shares are banned in some countries because of their potential for abuse. The bank recorded: \u201cIn this safe are some very important documents (bearer share(s), which belong to the beneficial owner Mr DL from Israel. These shares are kept in a safe for tax reasons.\u201d In a separate transaction, the bankers themselves recorded that they were uneasy when a Serbian businessman wanted to deposit \u20ac20m (\u00a315m). But they merely asked him to act less conspicuously. HSBC \u201cexplained that as per today the bank did not interfere in his money transfer transactions but would have preferred to reduce those activities on a lower scale. [He] understands our concerns and will use smaller amounts\u201d. The bankers seem to have been reluctant to take risks personally. The files record that a wealthy owner of a London furniture store and holder of a secret HSBC Swiss account, demanded HSBC \u201chelp him get back money into the UK on a \u2018non-declared\u2019 basis\u201d by carrying in bundles of cash. HSBC offered instead to provide him or a colleague with sterling banknotes in Switzerland, recording, \u201cwhat he decided to do with friends of his \u2026 was his affair\u201d. In a revealing remark, an HSBC manager wrote on the files: \u201cWe made clear the difference between passive and active action on our part.\u201d This tax evader also ended up repaying UK authorities, as part of a $205m (\u00a3135m) haul Britain has so far recovered from HSBC\u2019s tax-dodging customers. Chris Meares, then overall head of HSBC private banking, assured the Treasury committee in 2008: \u201cWe prohibit our bankers from encouraging or being involved in tax evasion.\u201d But former tax inspector Richard Brooks, author of The Great Tax Robbery, who is interviewed about HSBC on BBC Panorama on Monday night, says: \u201cI think they were a tax avoidance and tax evasion service. I think that\u2019s what they were offering. They knew full well that people come to them to doge their tax liabilities. There are very few reasons to have an offshore bank account, apart from just saving tax.\u201d The HSBC files are being published in an international collaboration including the French daily Le Monde in Paris, which first obtained the data; the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists; and BBC Panorama. HSBC says it won\u2019t comment on many of the specific allegations because of ongoing criminal investigations and because of Swiss bank secrecy laws. But HSBC also says it has now embarked on a radical cleanup of its Swiss act. It says it has not only introduced \u201cstrict controls\u201d on cash withdrawals, but also ended the \u201chold mail service\u201d (the practice of not sending giveaway letters to customers\u2019 home countries); and got rid of 70% of its previous customers. \u201cHSBC has implemented numerous initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets, doling out bundles of untraceable cash and advising clients on how to circumvent domestic tax authorities, according to a huge cache of leaked secret bank account files. The files \u2013 obtained through an international collaboration of news outlets, including the Guardian, the French daily Le Monde, BBC Panorama and the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists \u2013 reveal that HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank: \u2022 Routinely allowed clients to withdraw bricks of cash, often in foreign currencies of little use in Switzerland. \u2022 Aggressively marketed schemes likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes. \u2022 Colluded with some clients to conceal undeclared \u201cblack\u201d accounts from their domestic tax authorities. \u2022 Provided accounts to international criminals, corrupt businessmen and other high-risk individuals. The HSBC files, which cover the period 2005-2007, amount to the biggest banking leak in history, shedding light on some 30,000 accounts holding almost $120bn (\u00a378bn) of assets. The revelations will amplify calls for crackdowns on offshore tax havens and stoke political arguments in the US, Britain and elsewhere in Europe where exchequers are seen to be fighting a losing battle against fleet-footed and wealthy individuals in the globalised world. Approached by the Guardian, HSBC, the world\u2019s second largest bank, has now admitted wrongdoing by its Swiss subsidiary. \u201cWe acknowledge and are accountable for past compliance and control failures,\u201d the bank said in a statement. The Swiss arm, the statement said, had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing \u201csignificantly lower\u201d standards of compliance and due diligence to persist. That response raises serious questions about oversight of the Swiss operation by the then senior executives of its parent company, HSBC Group, headquartered in London. It has now acknowledged that it was not until 2011 that action was taken to bring the Swiss bank into line. \u201cHSBC was run in a more federated way than it is today and decisions were frequently taken at a country level,\u201d the bank said. HSBC was headed during the period covered in the files by Stephen Green \u2013 now Lord Green \u2013 who served as the global bank\u2019s chief executive, then group chairman until 2010 when he left to become a trade minister in the House of Lords for David Cameron\u2019s new government. He declined to comment when approached by the Guardian. Although tax authorities around the world have had confidential access to the leaked files since 2010, the true nature of the Swiss bank\u2019s misconduct has never been made public until now. Hollywood stars, shopkeepers, royalty and clothing merchants feature in the files along with the heirs to some of Europe\u2019s biggest fortunes. In one memo, an HSBC manager is recorded discussing how a London-based financier whom the bank codenamed \u201cPainter\u201d, and his partner, could cheat on Italian tax. \u201cThe risk for the couple is, of course, that when they return to Italy the UK tax authorities will pass on information on them to the Italian tax authorities. My own view on this was that \u2026 there clearly was a risk.\u201d According to the files, HSBC\u2019s Swiss bankers were also prepared to help Emmanuel Shallop, who was subsequently convicted of dealing in \u201cblood diamonds\u201d, the illegal trade that fuelled war in Africa. One memo records: \u201cWe have opened a company account for him based in Dubai \u2026 The client is currently being very careful because he is under pressure from the Belgian tax authorities who are investigating his activities in the field of diamond tax evasion.\u201d The records indicate HSBC managers were untroubled that a customer collecting cash bundles of kroner might be breaking Danish law. HSBC staff were instructed: \u201cAll contacts through one of her 3 daughters living in London. Account holder living in Denmark, i.e. critical as it is a criminal act having an account abroad non declared.\u201d HSBC\u2019s Swiss bankers routinely handed over large sums of cash to visiting clients, asking few questions, the files show. The bank said it had since tightened its controls. \u201cThe amended terms and conditions allowed the private bank to refuse a cash withdrawal request, and placed strict controls on withdrawals over $10,000 [\u00a36,600],\u201d its statement said. One example of the old system detailed in the files involves Richard Caring, a British tycoon and owner of London\u2019s celebrity-packed Ivy restaurant, who on one day in 2005 removed 5m Swiss francs (\u00a32.25m) in cash. When the Guardian asked him why, he declined to explain. His lawyer said it was a private matter and involved no impropriety. Caring\u2019s UK tax status allowed him legally to keep his accounts secret from the tax authorities. The files show how HSBC in Switzerland keenly marketed tax avoidance strategies to its wealthy clients. The bank proactively contacted clients in 2005 to suggest ways to avoid a new tax levied on the Swiss savings accounts of EU citizens, a measure brought in through a treaty between Switzerland and the EU to tackle secret offshore accounts. The documents also show HSBC\u2019s Swiss subsidiary providing banking services to relatives of dictators, people implicated in African corruption scandals, arms industry figures and others. Swiss banking rules have since 1998 required high levels of diligence on the accounts of politically connected figures, but the documents suggest that at the time HSBC happily provided banking services to such controversial individuals. The Guardian\u2019s evidence of a pattern of misconduct at HSBC in Switzerland is supported by the outcome of recent court cases in the US and Europe. The bank was named in the US as a co-conspirator for handing over \u201cbricks\u201d of $100,000 a time to American surgeon Andrew Silva in Geneva, so that he could illegally post cash back to the US. Another US client, Sanjay Sethi, pleaded guilty in 2013 to cheating the US tax authorities. He was one of a group of convicted HSBC clients. The prosecution said an HSBC banker promised \u201cthe undeclared account would allow [his] assets to grow tax-free, and bank secrecy laws in Switzerland would allow Sethi to conceal the existence of the account\u201d. In France, an HSBC manager, Nessim el-Maleh, was able to run a cash pipeline in which plastic bags full of currency from the sale of marijuana to immigrants in the Paris suburbs were collected. The cash was then taken round to HSBC\u2019s respectable clients in the French capital. Bank accounts back in Switzerland were manipulated to reimburse the drug dealers. HSBC is already facing criminal investigations and charges in France, Belgium, the US and Argentina as a result of the leak of the files, but no legal action has been taken against it in Britain. Former tax inspector Richard Brooks tells BBC Panorama in a programme to be aired on Monday night: \u201cI think they were a tax avoidance and tax evasion service. I think that\u2019s what they were offering. \u201cThere are very few reasons to have an offshore bank account, apart from just saving tax. There are some people who can use an ... account to avoid tax legally. For others it\u2019s just a way to keep money secret.\u201d The Labour party said: \u201cTax avoidance and evasion harms every taxpayer in Britain, and undermines public services like the NHS. What is truly shocking is that HMRC were made fully aware of these practices back in 2010 but since then very little has been done.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Swiss banks often get mentioned in crime thrillers. They are depicted as shady havens for James Bond types, super-villains and African dictators. Outside the pages of fiction, however, it has been virtually impossible until now to get at the reality. Rigid laws protecting bank secrecy have attracted billions from all over the world. Canny Swiss bankers charged high prices in return for their silence. HSBC, headquartered in Britain and led at the time by Sir John Bond, decided to get in on this lucrative act in 1999. It bought up an existing Swiss bank which chased fresh customers. But details of the Swiss operation\u2019s 30,000 accounts were hacked in 2007 by its IT expert, Herv\u00e9 Falciani, who fled with them to France. The files have since been reconstructed and their contents confidentially distributed around the world by French tax authorities. As one of Brecht\u2019s characters famously said in The Threepenny Opera: \u201cWhat is robbing a bank compared to founding one?\u201d The leaked files, as the bank now concedes, reveal considerable wrongdoing. But does that make it right for the Guardian to expose the names of HSBC\u2019s Swiss-account holders? Not all HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank customers are public figures and many are not dishonest. Some want secrecy for family reasons. The files disclose, for example, how a Finnish teacher set out to hide money from her husband. The history of the Holocaust may explain why some Israeli clients like their wealth to be in a safe place. One British banker even told us that he hid \u00a35m in his Swiss account merely in order to conceal from colleagues the size of his bonus. The Guardian is not naming such individuals. However, others emerge, according to the files, as would-be \u2013 though legal \u2013 tax avoiders of one kind or another, who would have deprived the UK and other countries of revenue to provide public services. The then head of the UK tax authority, Dave Hartnett, told an accountants\u2019 gathering in 2011 that most Swiss-account holders were suspected tax-dodgers: \u201cPotentially innocent people \u2026 are relatively small in number \u2013 maybe no more than 20% of UK residents investing in Switzerland.\u201d He told parliament that the thousands of names in the leaked HSBC data were \u201call ripe for investigation\u201d. So the public should be entitled to know what has been going on in Switzerland. But the full range of behaviour also deserves to be made clear. Some rich clients merely try to use artificial loopholes \u2013 for example, offshore trusts or historic quirks such as Britain\u2019s notorious \u201cnon-dom\u201d tax breaks. To critics, they may have sometimes exploited or even stretched the law, but they have not broken it. Such typical British businessmen such as Rod Aldridge and Paul Pindar, respectively founder and former chief executive of Capita, grew fat on government contracts while setting up Swiss-based trusts with HSBC that were perfectly legal (and ironically, turned out in the end not to have saved them any tax). Pindar put \u00a316m of his shares offshore, but when regulations tightened, he abandoned Switzerland. The bank recorded: \u201cHe mentioned that the tax laws in the UK have much changed to his disadvantage and that he could no longer save much taxes with his two trusts. He was only paying fees \u2026 for not getting much advantages.\u201d Pindar told the Guardian that the device \u201cwas a very common pre-public flotation practice 25 years ago\u201d, but he had saved nothing in the event: \u201cDissolving the trusts created a substantial tax liability which I paid in full and on time.\u201d Aldridge says his similar move in 1988, setting up Swiss structures worth up to \u00a360m, was also \u201ca common pre-flotation measure\u201d. It did not save him capital gains tax, because the regulations were later changed. Neither man ever broke any rules, nor did they in fact avoid any tax. Other clients of the Swiss operation, however, may have been downright tax cheats, holding secret accounts, while some carried cash out of their bank\u2019s Geneva doors in bundles of non-Swiss currency that could not be spent locally. Following the HSBC leak, scores of its Swiss clients are already under criminal investigation, in Britain and globally. Many others have paid civil penalties. Only one Briton has previously been publicly identified \u2013 Michael Shanly, a millionaire property developer, whose failure to pay inheritance tax on his late mother\u2019s \u00a3800,000 home has cost him \u00a3850,000 in criminal penalties. Other clients of HSBC now turn out to be unsavoury characters, attracted by the secrecy on offer. Evidence exists that some may have been smuggling drugs, handling bribes, committing fraud, helping to finance terrorists, or looting their own countries. Others have done nothing unlawful but have kept untaxed money in Switzerland while making political donations in Britain or the US. In these cases, the Guardian believes the public has a right to know.",

The then head of the UK tax authority, Dave Hartnett, told an accountants\u2019 gathering in 2011 that most Swiss-account holders were suspected tax-dodgers: \u201cPotentially innocent people \u2026 are relatively small in number \u2013 maybe no more than 20% of UK residents investing in Switzerland.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/feb/08/hsbc-files-secret-swiss-account-data-misconduct-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/45tmx\"                        data-video-id=\"2237896\"            data-video-name=\"HSBC files: how secret Swiss account data detailing misconduct came to light\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/2/7/1423351423572/crop_KP_89439_640x360.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-455347753\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/2/7/1423351418676/crop_KP_89439_1200x720.jpeg\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10040219&amp;format=video/mp4\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/02/07/HSBCTax_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10040219&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/02/07/HSBCTax_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10040219&amp;format=video/m3u8\"></source> </video> <figcaption>HSBC files: how secret Swiss account data detailing misconduct came to light</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He told parliament that the thousands of names in the leaked HSBC data were \u201call ripe for investigation\u201d.</p> <p>So the public should be entitled to know what has been going on in Switzerland. But the full range of behaviour also deserves to be made clear. Some rich clients merely try to use artificial loopholes \u2013 for example, offshore trusts or historic quirks such as Britain\u2019s notorious \u201cnon-dom\u201d tax breaks. To critics, they may have sometimes exploited or even stretched the law, but they have not broken it.</p> <p>Such typical British businessmen such as Rod Aldridge and Paul Pindar, respectively founder and former chief executive of Capita, grew fat on government contracts while setting up Swiss-based trusts with HSBC that were perfectly legal (and ironically, turned out in the end not to have saved them any tax).</p> <p>Pindar put \u00a316m of his shares offshore, but when regulations tightened, he abandoned Switzerland. The bank recorded: \u201cHe mentioned that the tax laws in the UK have much changed to his disadvantage and that he could no longer save much taxes with his two trusts. He was only paying fees \u2026 for not getting much advantages.\u201d</p> <p>Pindar told the Guardian that the device \u201cwas a very common pre-public flotation practice 25 years ago\u201d, but he had saved nothing in the event: \u201cDissolving the trusts created a substantial tax liability which I paid in full and on time.\u201d</p> <p>Aldridge says his similar move in 1988, setting up Swiss structures worth up to \u00a360m, was also \u201ca common pre-flotation measure\u201d. It did not save him capital gains tax, because the regulations were later changed. Neither man ever broke any rules, nor did they in fact avoid any tax.</p> <p>Other clients of the Swiss operation, however, may have been downright tax cheats, holding secret accounts, while some carried cash out of their bank\u2019s Geneva doors in bundles of non-Swiss currency that could not be spent locally.</p> <p>Following the HSBC leak, scores of its Swiss clients are already under criminal investigation, in Britain and globally. Many others have paid civil penalties. Only one Briton has previously been publicly identified \u2013 Michael Shanly, a millionaire property developer, whose failure to pay inheritance tax on his late mother\u2019s \u00a3800,000 home has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18713483\">cost him \u00a3850,000 in criminal penalties</a>. Other clients of HSBC now turn out to be unsavoury characters, attracted by the secrecy on offer. Evidence exists that some may have been smuggling drugs, handling bribes, committing fraud, helping to finance terrorists, or looting their own countries. Others have done nothing unlawful but have kept untaxed money in Switzerland while making political donations in Britain or the US.</p> <p>In these cases, the Guardian believes the public has a right to know.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/next-gen/news/2015/feb/moonfall/shell/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/next-gen/news/2015/feb/moonfall/shell/boot.js\" data-alt=\"Enhancer\"> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell, one of David Cameron\u2019s closest corporate allies, says the business community faces \u201ca conundrum\u201d in choosing between Labour and the Conservatives at the ballot box in May. As more former business backers of Labour distanced themselves from the party this weekend, Sorrell, chief executive of the marketing and advertising group WPP, said the uncertain future of Britain in Europe under the Tories was of deep concern to many firms investing in the country. In an interview with the Guardian, Sorrell said the decision about which party to vote for amounted to \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d; on the one hand, he claimed, Labour was \u201canti-business\u201d, on the other, a Conservative victory would trigger a referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership. \u201cFrom an electoral point of view Ed Miliband clearly believes bashing business is good for the ballot box and will benefit him. It\u2019s a conundrum for business. Labour won\u2019t have a referendum but you might have a regime that is more negative to business, and a referendum makes a Conservative vote that much more difficult,\u201d Sorrell said. The comments follow a week of attacks directed at Miliband for the party\u2019s relationship with business, which began with the head of Alliance Boots, Stefano Pessina, saying it would be a catastrophe if Labour were elected. Former supporters have turned on the party, including Sir Charles Dunstone, the founder of Carphone Warehouse, who said he would be frightened by a Labour victory. Katja Hall, deputy director general of the CBI, agreed with Sorrell that it was unclear which result would be better for business: \u201cWe have some concerns about Labour intervening in the banking and energy sectors, but we are encouraged by their work on industrial strategy and reforming the UK education system to produce more rounded and grounded young people. We like the Conservatives\u2019 emphasis on maintaining a competitive corporation tax environment, but have concerns around some of the unhelpful rhetoric on immigration.\u201d Labour has struggled to attract the public support of senior business figures, as policies such as an energy-price freeze, mansion tax, and the reinstatement of a 50p top rate of tax, ruffle feathers in UK boardrooms. However, the shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, became the latest senior party figure to insist that Labour backed business. He told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that Labour was a \u201cfuriously, passionately, aggressively pro-business\u201d party. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow cabinet office minister, told BBC 5 Live that a referendum on UK membership of the EU, promised by the Tories before the end of 2017, was the \u201clast thing\u201d businesses needed because of the uncertainty. The prime minister tried to maintain the momentum of the attack on Labour, writing in the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cThis chaos [within Labour] betrays something much deeper about Ed Miliband and Labour \u2013 something that should strike fear in every family in the country: they have a sneering hatred of business.\u201d Three more former business allies of Labour distanced themselves from Miliband this weekend. The Sunday Times reported that Chris Wright, founder of the music publishing firm Chrysalis, who backed Labour in the 2005 election, said the party risked stoking the politics of envy. Lord Haskins, a former party donor who ran Northern Foods, said Miliband had failed to capitalise on his party\u2019s pro-European stance with entrepreneurs, and Robert Senior, head of the advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which ran Labour\u2019s 2010 election campaign, told the Sunday Telegraph that Labour was \u201ca very different beast\u201d now and his firm would focus on other work. George Osborne and Miliband clashed on Sunday over Labour\u2019s plans to tackle tax havens, the chancellor claiming a blacklist could isolate Britain from allies in Washington, Paris and Berlin. Labour has pledged to compile a public register of offshore firms and their owners if it wins the general election in May. A Miliband-led government would draw up sanctions against overseas territories not drawing up a list, a spokesman for his party has said. On the Andrew Marr Show, Osborne said such a policy would cause the British government to fall out with the US, France and Germany, which have no commitment to setting up a public register. Miliband\u2019s office hit back, saying Osborne\u2019s claims were \u201cthe lamest excuse for inaction yet\u201d. His spokesman said: \u201cNo one is saying Germany, the US or France, is a tax haven and it is ridiculous to use this as a reason not to act on overseas territories and crown dependencies, which have operated under a shroud of secrecy for too long.\u201d The effort by Labour to harness public anger over tax havens is a potential embarrassment for Cameron who has made no headway since he requested in 2013 that the islands draw up a public registry of companies\u2019 ultimate owners.",

He told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that Labour was a \u201cfuriously, passionately, aggressively pro-business\u201d party.</p> <p>Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow cabinet office minister, told BBC 5 Live that a referendum on UK membership of the EU, promised by the Tories before the end of 2017, was the \u201clast thing\u201d businesses needed because of the uncertainty.</p> <p>The prime minister tried to maintain the momentum of the attack on Labour, writing in the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cThis chaos [within Labour] betrays something much deeper about Ed Miliband and Labour \u2013 something that should strike fear in every family in the country: they have a sneering hatred of business.\u201d</p> <p>Three more former business allies of Labour distanced themselves from Miliband this weekend.</p> <p>The Sunday Times reported that Chris Wright, founder of the music publishing firm Chrysalis, who backed Labour in the 2005 election, said the party risked stoking the politics of envy.</p> <p>Lord Haskins, a former party donor who ran Northern Foods, said Miliband had failed to capitalise on his party\u2019s pro-European stance with entrepreneurs, and Robert Senior, head of the advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which ran Labour\u2019s 2010 election campaign, told the Sunday Telegraph that Labour was \u201ca very different beast\u201d now and his firm would focus on other work.</p> <p>George Osborne and Miliband clashed on Sunday over Labour\u2019s plans to tackle tax havens, the chancellor claiming a blacklist could isolate Britain from allies in Washington, Paris and Berlin.</p> <p>Labour has pledged to compile a public register of offshore firms and their owners if it wins the general election in May. A Miliband-led government would draw up sanctions against overseas territories not drawing up a list, a spokesman for his party has said.</p> <p>On the Andrew Marr Show, Osborne said such a policy would cause the British government to fall out with the US, France and Germany, which have no commitment to setting up a public register.</p> <p>Miliband\u2019s office hit back, saying Osborne\u2019s claims were \u201cthe lamest excuse for inaction yet\u201d. His spokesman said: \u201cNo one is saying Germany, the US or France, is a tax haven and it is ridiculous to use this as a reason not to act on overseas territories and crown dependencies, which have operated under a shroud of secrecy for too long.\u201d</p> <p>The effort by Labour to harness public anger over tax havens is a potential embarrassment for Cameron who has made no headway since he requested in 2013 that the islands draw up a public registry of companies\u2019 ultimate owners.</p>",

Despite echoing many of the criticisms of Ed Miliband \u2014 voiced in recent weeks by Alliance Boots boss Stefano Pessina and a handful of other business leaders \u2014 Sorrell said the uncertain future of Britain in Europe under the Conservatives was of equal concern to many companies investing in Britain. Sorrell said the decision on which party to vote for amounted to \u201ca Hobson\u2019s Choice\u201d\u2014 on the one hand Labour is anti-business, while on the other hand a Conservative victory would trigger a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. Sorrell told the Guardian: \u201cFrom an electoral point of view, Ed Miliband clearly believes bashing business is good for the ballot box and will benefit him. \u201cIt\u2019s a conundrum for business. Labour won\u2019t have a referendum but you might have a regime that is more negative to business, and a referendum makes a Conservative vote that much more difficult.\u201d Katja Hall, deputy director-general of business lobby group the CBI, agreed that it was a mixed picture. \u201cThere are some proposals we like and some we don\u2019t from all of the political parties,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have some concerns about Labour intervening in the banking and energy sectors, but we are encouraged by their work on industrial strategy and reforming the UK education system to produce more rounded and grounded young people. \u201cWe like the Conservatives\u2019 emphasis on maintaining a competitive corporation tax environment, but have concerns around some of the unhelpful rhetoric on immigration.\u201d Sorrell has previously sat on the prime minister\u2019s business advisory group and, with his wife, has been a guest of the Camerons at Chequers.

He promptly brought WPP\u2019s headquarters back to the UK after Osborne reversed those measures. Business lobby groups have repeatedly argued that most companies want Britain to remain in the EU, and that a referendum would cause widespread uncertainty, stifling investment.

      "bodyText": "The runup to this election promises to be a mixture of daily boredom and entertaining gaffes. When I returned to London after a seminar in Venice last weekend, the gaffe of the day appeared to be the responsibility of Stefano Pessina, acting chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance (plain old Boots to you and me), who told us that a Labour win would be \u201ca catastrophe\u201d for Britain. On closer inspection, it turned out that a Labour win, if it forced the likes of tax exiles such as Pessina to pay their taxes, would be more of a catastrophe for him and his ilk. There is a cynical campaign being conducted by some business leaders and City luminaries to discredit the leader of the opposition for being \u201canti-business\u201d, when the driving force behind Miliband\u2019s approach is simply the desire to combat the excesses of modern capitalism, some of which notoriously contributed to the crisis of 2007-09, from which, frankly, we are still trying to emerge. The Labour party has not been anti-business since the reforming job done, at great cost to himself, by Neil Kinnock in the 1980s. It is fashionable to give all the credit to Tony Blair for reforming the Labour party, but the truth is that much hard work was also put in by Kinnock. Indeed, if anything, under Blair and Gordon Brown, Labour, in its desire to please, became almost too pro-business and too pro-City; it was a sucker for consultations with the latter \u2013 which, curiously enough, often gave vent to advice and reforms that led to the feathering of the nests of those consulted. \u201cLight-touch regulation\u201d was one such example. And there were all manner of tax concessions for dubious enterprises (see Private Eye, passim). Which brings me back to last weekend\u2019s seminar in the country from which Pessina is a Monaco-based tax exile. Every year now, for 20 years, the Italian government has hosted a meeting of British and Italian journalists at which Italian ministers, officials and industrialists can speak under what is known as the Chatham House Rule \u2013 the information can be used but sources must be protected. In my experience, at such events, there is almost always an obsession with what is going on somewhere else. Sure enough, on this occasion the big focus of interest was whether prime minister Matteo Renzi would see his candidate for president, the veteran Sergio Mattarella, elected, down there in Rome, over opposition from the egregious Silvio Berlusconi, who still calls a lot of the shots. The result was considered a triumph for Renzi with, it was hoped, good omens for his \u201creform agenda\u201d: We shall see. I did not get where I am today by going too closely into Italian politics, although I once spent a memorable evening with Giulio Andreotti. But my interest in the Italian economy goes back many years, and the word \u201creform\u201d has come up so often \u2013 the subject of ambitious presentations at many a seminar \u2013 that one has to beware of \u201creform fatigue\u201d, not weariness with reform (there seldom appears to be much in practice), but there is always a chance that something may actually happen. You see, for decades, the Italian economy trundled along quite nicely, with a strong industrial sector, a great name for design, and the ability to devalue the lira from time to time, when wages got out of control and international competitiveness suffered. That is to say, for all its \u201cstructural rigidities\u201d and \u201cItalian practices\u201d, the economy performed reasonably well. In recent decades, it has been hit by a succession of blows, not least the financial crisis \u2013 which struck after great strides had been made in reducing the budget deficit \u2013 and the economic straitjacket of the eurozone. Membership of the single currency not only removes the freedom to devalue against, for example, Germany: it also subjects Italy to the kind of fiscal sadism against which the Greeks have just revolted. The many \u201crigidities\u201d of Italy\u2019s economy are highlighted in the film Girlfriend in a Coma, made by Annalisa Piras and former Economist editor Bill Emmott, described by Le Monde as \u201ca desperate love letter to Italy\u201d. Well, the Italians are having another go. One reform which might not be too popular with Pessina is yet another attempt to crack down on tax avoidance \u2013 generally considered something of a national sport. They are trying to speed up the justice system as part of an effort to stimulate more inward investment, and \u2013 especially important for so many of the young, who are effectively excluded from the labour market \u2013 the Renzi administration aims to reduce the imbalance in labour contracts between those with a \u201cjob for life\u201d and those desperate to get a job. Meanwhile, rays of hope as the sun was setting in Venice last Saturday were: first, although Italy cannot devalue against Germany, the entire eurozone may gain some relief from both the European Central Bank quantitative easing programme \u2013 boosting money and credit \u2013 and the devaluation of the euro. Then there is the potential boost to spending from the lower oil price. Nevertheless, macroeconomic policy in the eurozone remains far too restrictive. I think we are talking of alleviation of the Italian economy\u2019s problems, rather than a cure.",

      "body": "<p>The runup to this election promises to be a mixture of daily boredom and entertaining gaffes.</p> <p>When I returned to London after a seminar in Venice last weekend, the gaffe of the day appeared to be the responsibility of Stefano Pessina, acting chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance (plain old Boots to you and me), who told us that a Labour win would be \u201ca catastrophe\u201d for Britain.</p> <p>On closer inspection, it turned out that a Labour win, if it forced the likes of tax exiles such as Pessina to pay their taxes, would be more of a catastrophe for him and his ilk.</p> <p>There is a cynical campaign being conducted by some business leaders and City luminaries to discredit the leader of the opposition for being \u201canti-business\u201d, when the driving force behind Miliband\u2019s approach is simply the desire to combat the excesses of modern capitalism, some of which notoriously contributed to the crisis of 2007-09, from which, frankly, we are still trying to emerge.</p> <p>The Labour party has not been anti-business since the reforming job done, at great cost to himself, by Neil Kinnock in the 1980s. It is fashionable to give all the credit to Tony Blair for reforming the Labour party, but the truth is that much hard work was also put in by Kinnock.</p> <p>Indeed, if anything, under Blair and Gordon Brown, Labour, in its desire to please, became almost too pro-business and too pro-City; it was a sucker for consultations with the latter \u2013 which, curiously enough, often gave vent to advice and reforms that led to the feathering of the nests of those consulted. \u201cLight-touch regulation\u201d was one such example. And there were all manner of tax concessions for dubious enterprises (see <em>Private Eye</em>, <em>passim</em>).</p> <p>Which brings me back to last weekend\u2019s seminar in the country from which Pessina is a Monaco-based tax exile. Every year now, for 20 years, the Italian government has hosted a meeting of British and Italian journalists at which Italian ministers, officials and industrialists can speak under what is known as the Chatham House Rule \u2013 the information can be used but sources must be protected.</p> <p>In my experience, at such events, there is almost always an obsession with what is going on somewhere else. Sure enough, on this occasion the big focus of interest was whether prime minister Matteo Renzi would see his candidate for president, the veteran Sergio Mattarella, elected, down there in Rome, over opposition from the egregious Silvio Berlusconi, who still calls a lot of the shots.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>For decades the economy trundled along quite nicely, with a strong industrial sector and the ability to devalue the lira</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The result was considered a triumph for Renzi with, it was hoped, good omens for his \u201creform agenda\u201d: We shall see. I did not get where I am today by going too closely into Italian politics, although I once spent a memorable evening with Giulio Andreotti.</p> <p>But my interest in the Italian economy goes back many years, and the word \u201creform\u201d has come up so often \u2013 the subject of ambitious presentations at many a seminar \u2013 that one has to beware of \u201creform fatigue\u201d, not weariness with reform (there seldom appears to be much in practice), but there is always a chance that something may actually happen.</p> <p>You see, for decades, the Italian economy trundled along quite nicely, with a strong industrial sector, a great name for design, and the ability to devalue the lira from time to time, when wages got out of control and international competitiveness suffered. That is to say, for all its \u201cstructural rigidities\u201d and \u201cItalian practices\u201d, the economy performed reasonably well.</p> <p>In recent decades, it has been hit by a succession of blows, not least the financial crisis \u2013 which struck after great strides had been made in reducing the budget deficit \u2013 and the economic straitjacket of the eurozone. Membership of the single currency not only removes the freedom to devalue against, for example, Germany: it also subjects Italy to the kind of fiscal sadism against which the Greeks have just revolted.</p> <p>The many \u201crigidities\u201d of Italy\u2019s economy are highlighted in the film <a href=\"http://girlfriendinacoma.eu/\"><em>Girlfriend in a Coma</em></a>, made by Annalisa Piras and former <em>Economist</em> editor Bill Emmott, described by <em>Le Monde</em> as \u201ca desperate love letter to Italy\u201d.</p> <p>Well, the Italians are having another go. One reform which might not be too popular with Pessina is yet another attempt to crack down on tax avoidance \u2013 generally considered something of a national sport.</p> <p>They are trying to speed up the justice system as part of an effort to stimulate more inward investment, and \u2013 especially important for so many of the young, who are effectively excluded from the labour market \u2013 the Renzi administration aims to reduce the imbalance in labour contracts between those with a \u201cjob for life\u201d and those desperate to get a job.</p> <p>Meanwhile, rays of hope as the sun was setting in Venice last Saturday were: first, although Italy cannot devalue against Germany, the entire eurozone may gain some relief from both the European Central Bank quantitative easing programme \u2013 boosting money and credit \u2013 and the devaluation of the euro. Then there is the potential boost to spending from the lower oil price.</p> <p>Nevertheless, macroeconomic policy in the eurozone remains far too restrictive. I think we are talking of alleviation of the Italian economy\u2019s problems, rather than a cure.</p>",
