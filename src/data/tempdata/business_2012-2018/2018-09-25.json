      "bodyText": "Delays of only half an hour at UK ports and the Irish border would risk one in 10 British firms going bankrupt, according to a report laying bare the severe risk to the economy from no-deal Brexit. According to the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), failure to reach a deal with Brussels before March could trigger massive queues of trucks at British borders from a vast increase in paperwork and checks to clear customs. From a survey of more than 1,300 UK and EU-based supply chain managers, the personnel responsible for navigating customs controls for their companies, a tenth at UK firms said it would risk bankruptcy if goods were delayed by between 10 and 30 minutes at the border. The warning comes amid the increasing likelihood of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal in little more than six months time, after Theresa May failed to win support for her Brexit plan from European leaders and said both sides had reached an impasse. Several major UK firms have warned of the risks from tougher border controls, including the retail chain Next, and carmakers such as Honda and Jaguar Land Rover who rely on thousands of parts arriving from the EU each day. JLR has cut staff working hours, while Honda has said a no-deal Brexit could add 60,000 extra pieces of paperwork for imports and exports to the UK while costing the firm tens of millions of pounds. \u201cIt\u2019s such a potential car crash,\u201d said John Glen, economist at CIPS, adding: \u201cCommon sense has got to prevail. We need to have a two-year transition period and to get something sorted out during that. The idea of day-one no-deal is just crazy.\u201d The CIPS survey also found almost a quarter of British businesses are planning to stockpile goods for fear of border delays and shortages of goods, while 4% are already starting to do so. Economists have warned tougher border controls, import tariffs and other barriers to trade in the event of no-deal Brexit would have severe consequences for the economy, with one consultancy estimating the cost at around \u00a31bn per year. Researchers at Imperial College London estimate just two extra minutes of checks could more than triple the existing queues at ports, potentially leading to motorway tailbacks in Kent up to 29 miles long. Leading Brexiters have dismissed the warnings as scaremongering and urged walking away from negotiations without a deal and striking free trade agreements around the world instead. Ministers have also attempted to downplay the concerns by suggesting they could relax efforts to collect border taxes to maintain the free movement of imports and exports in the event of no-deal. Disruption would be costliest around the port of Dover, where about 17% of the UK\u2019s entire trade in goods worth up to \u00a3122bn was handled last year. Alongside the Eurotunnel rail link at Folkestone, more than 4m trucks are processed around this part of south-east England each year. There are precedents for disruption, including Operation Stack on the M20, which forced trucks to a standstill in 2015 amid tunnel fires and industrial action in Calais. Typically used for a few days each year, it had a lengthier impact three years ago when 7,000 trucks were stranded, taking 36 hours to work their way through. Some food products did not make it to market because they went off in the queue, while others arrived so late that there were late penalties. Rolls-Royce was forced to delay its production line when goods did not arrive in time.",

      "bodyText": "If you were to conjure up a list of New England icons, the top names would likely all be very similar. It would feature some combination of the Red Sox, Tom Brady, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and a guy named Sully drinking an iced coffee in cargo shorts outside in the middle of February. The place he\u2019d have purchased that coffee from barely needs to be mentioned, because we all know it would be Dunkin\u2019s, kid. Or maybe Dunkies, if you prefer to call it that, as I do, or alternatively, Dunks. You would certainly never call it Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, at any rate. Not unless you think you\u2019re better than me. The major player in the coffee and doughnut game realizes that fact, and today they\u2019ve announced that after a year of careful research and study, they\u2019re finally dropping the second, superfluous word in their branding and will henceforth be known as Dunkin\u2019. \u201cBy simplifying and modernizing our name, while still paying homage to our heritage, we have an opportunity to create an incredible new energy for Dunkin\u2019, both in and outside our stores,\u201d Tony Weisman, the chief marketing officer for Dunkin\u2019 US, said in a statement. Reactions around New England were decidedly conflicted about the branding change on Tuesday, which may seem strange \u2013 because who cares what a coffee chain is called? But the long-standing staple of the landscape, with its orange and pink logo, has been deeply embedded in the culture here for decades, since the first location opened in 1955 in Quincy, Massachusetts. Today there are over 4,200 stores in New England, nearly a third of the 12,600 around the world. By comparison Starbucks has 14,000 locations in the US alone. It\u2019s not hard to understand why locals might begin to associate it with their own identity. Weirdly, that brand loyalty exists despite the fact that many of us here don\u2019t particularly think it\u2019s actually any good. It\u2019s a very Boston thing perhaps, like defending your no-good brother, who despite all his screw-ups still has a heart of gold. \u201cI\u2019ll totally defend Dunks even though the coffee is admittedly not great,\u201d said Scott Surette of Woburn, Massachusetts. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing that binds us together.\u201d \u201cI definitely felt a connection to it, being a born and bred Bostonian, and they are literally on every corner,\u201d said Dave Wedge who, as the author of a recent book about the New England Patriots, knows a thing or two about what we revere around here. \u201cIn some towns, they have them literally across the street from each other.\u201d Wedge is admittedly not a fan of the coffee, but the pastries hold a special place in his heart. \u201cIt\u2019s sacrilege to even say around here that you don\u2019t like Dunks but I can\u2019t fake it. There\u2019s just so much better coffee out there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a longtime follower of the Dunkin\u2019 brand, and this change is great,\u201d said Jeremy Stanley, of Boston. \u201cI have called it Dunkin\u2019 or Dunks for as long as I remember. \u2018I\u2019m heading to Dunks, you want anything?\u2019 The new logo retains the spirit of the brand, and no one\u2019s going to really give a shit if someone continues to call it Dunkin\u2019 Donuts later. It\u2019s like Apple dropping \u2018Computer\u2019 from its name. This is the same thing.\u201d Not everyone is convinced, however. Tim Lanning, of Malden, Massachusetts, doesn\u2019t like the update. \u201cI think part of it is I just don\u2019t like when brands change their name. It isn\u2019t like people get confused by what Dunkin\u2019 Donuts is.\u201d \u201cChanging the name smacks of desperation but it really doesn\u2019t matter much because it\u2019ll always be just Dunks to me and all of us here in New England,\u201d Wedge adds. That may or may not be the case. Some say it\u2019s a risky move, like Marc Hurwitz, a food writer in Boston. \u201cWhen your name is so ingrained in people\u2019s minds, making any change rarely has an upside. And I just think, why mess with success?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a brand that\u2019s incredibly successful like they do, why try to change it unless you\u2019re going with a whole new concept, which doesn\u2019t appear to be the case here?\u201d For their part, the company says the move has something to do with the speed of the modern customer. \u201cOur new branding is one of many things we are doing as part of our blueprint for growth to modernize the Dunkin\u2019 experience for our customers,\u201d said the Dunkin\u2019 Brands CEO and Dunkin\u2019 US president David Hoffmann in a statement. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a rebranding,\u201d said Angela Pugliese, of North Smithfield, Rhode Island. \u201cWhat are we now dunking if not donuts? And a lot of people called it Dunkin\u2019 already, so it\u2019s not really changing the image at all. It doesn\u2019t sound classier or change the image at all in my mind.\u201d \u201cI would say probably the goal is to pivot more towards other food and coffee, if I had to guess, I\u2019m not really too sure,\u201d added Mike Vaughn, of Marlborough, Massachusetts. \u201cThey might be worried about getting pigeonholed as a doughnut place, but I only really get coffee from them. \u201cThere are also definitely lots of people around here, and probably everywhere, that don\u2019t like change,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I would like to think that them changing the name doesn\u2019t change my memories of the place.\u201d",

Some say it\u2019s a risky move, like Marc Hurwitz, a food writer in Boston.</p> <p>\u201cWhen your name is so ingrained in people\u2019s minds, making any change rarely has an upside. And I just think, why mess with success?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a brand that\u2019s incredibly successful like they do, why try to change it unless you\u2019re going with a whole new concept, which doesn\u2019t appear to be the case here?\u201d</p> <p>For their part, the company says the move has something to do with the speed of the modern customer.</p> <p>\u201cOur new branding is one of many things we are doing as part of our blueprint for growth to modernize the Dunkin\u2019 experience for our customers,\u201d said the Dunkin\u2019 Brands CEO and Dunkin\u2019 US president David Hoffmann in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a rebranding,\u201d said Angela Pugliese, of North Smithfield, Rhode Island. \u201cWhat are we now dunking if not donuts? And a lot of people called it Dunkin\u2019 already, so it\u2019s not really changing the image at all. It doesn\u2019t sound classier or change the image at all in my mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would say probably the goal is to pivot more towards other food and coffee, if I had to guess, I\u2019m not really too sure,\u201d added Mike Vaughn, of Marlborough, Massachusetts. \u201cThey might be worried about getting pigeonholed as a doughnut place, but I only really get coffee from them.</p> <p>\u201cThere are also definitely lots of people around here, and probably everywhere, that don\u2019t like change,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I would like to think that them changing the name doesn\u2019t change my memories of the place.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has cancelled 190 of its 2,400 scheduled flights on Friday blaming strikes by cabin crew based in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy and Germany. The Irish airline, which has already suffered a summer of disruption, declined to reveal exactly which flights had been cancelled \u2013 which account for 8% of all its flights on Friday \u2013 but said all 30,000 affected passengers had been notified by text and email. The cancellations, however, do include flights into and out of the UK. Ryanair said it \u201csincerely regrets these unnecessary customer disruptions\u201d, which it blamed on agitation from staff at rival airlines. Friday\u2019s action will further damage the airline\u2019s reputation in the eyes of the travelling public, who have been wary of making future Ryanair bookings because of the threat of industrial action. In August, the low-cost carrier was forced to cancel nearly 400 flights as it battled unions in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. About 50,000 passengers had their travel plans disrupted, leaving a trail of unusable hotel, car hire and other bookings. There was similar disruption in July. The long-running industrial action by Ryanair staff centres on working conditions. Staff based in countries other than Ireland are unhappy that Ryanair has been employing them under Irish legislation. Employees say they are compelled to receive their pay in Irish bank accounts, which affects their credit rating at home. Ryanair said it has agreed to move to local contracts, law and taxation as quickly as possible next year, but with conditions attached. Ryanair said in a statement: \u201cRyanair sincerely regrets these unnecessary customer disruptions, which have been called by unions at the behest of competitor airline employees. The airline\u2019s Kenny Jacobs said: \u201cThese repeated unnecessary strikes are damaging Ryanair\u2019s business and our customer confidence at a time when oil prices are rising strongly, and if they continue, it is inevitable that we will have to look again at our capacity growth this winter and in summer 2019. We hope these unions will see common sense.\u201d During the summer, the airline\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, threatened to move jobs to Poland because of the strikes. He warned: \u201cIf we have people who just want to have strikes for the sake of having strikes then they can have strikes and they\u2019ll find themselves [with] jobs getting moved.\u201d Rory Boland, the Which? travel editor, called on Ryanair to save its customers holidays. \u201cThe airline must now immediately arrange alternative flights or provide a full refund and pay out compensation to those affected \u2013 including the many people still waiting for the money they\u2019re owed from its shambolic summer of cancellations\u201d Anyone who has booked a Ryanair flight on Friday 28 September was advised to check their inbox and mobile phone to see if their flight is among those cancelled. Normally the airline posts a list of affected flights on its website, but by Tuesday evening had failed to do so.",

      "bodyText": "That a brand like Versace, with a DNA so entrenched in the exclusive and luxurious Italian aesthetic, has aligned itself with Michael Kors, a label known for its accessibility, has surprised many who were expecting it to announce an imminent IPO. But if 40 years of Versace has taught us anything, it\u2019s not to underestimate the brand or Donatella, the woman who has steered it since her brother Gianni\u2019s death in 1997. In selling to Kors for $2.1bn (\u00a31.6bn), Versace has sought to secure her family\u2019s fashion legacy. It\u2019s a sentiment shared by the fellow Italian fashion house Missoni, which sold a 41.2% stake to a private equity firm for \u20ac70m (\u00a363m) this year. \u201cEither you grow or you die,\u201d the brand\u2019s creative director, Angela Missoni, told Jess Cartner-Morley this month. \u201cFor the luxury conglomerate landscape, these two companies might not seem like natural bedfellows,\u201d said Kathryn Bishop, the deputy foresight editor and luxury sector specialist at The Future Laboratory. \u201cBut Michael Kors could bring much-needed modernisation to the label in an era when sexy doesn\u2019t sell quite like it used to, and perceived Italian rival Gucci continues to innovate, winning the attention and spend of younger, globally minded shoppers.\u201d In the 24 hours since it was first reported a deal with the American investor was imminent, Versace has been inundated with messages on her official Instagram account from followers imploring her to reconsider the sale. \u201cPlease don\u2019t sell Versace to MK!!! That would be like Gucci selling to Primark! Versace is worth so much more than 2 billion and MK knows it,\u201d said one. Confirmation that Versace will continue to lead the creative side of the business will help appease critics. Investment from Michael Kors does bode well, however, if its recent acquisition of Jimmy Choo (for \u00a3896m last year) is anything to go by. The footwear brand exceeded expectation in the first quarter of 2018 and its injection of $172.7m helped its new owners increase its revenues by 26.3% in the three months to the end of June to $1.2bn, compared with the same period in 2017. Bishop agrees with John D Idol, chief executive of Michael Kors, in thinking the acquisition of Versace can follow the same trajectory, as well as helping the company to become one of the US\u2019s most powerful conglomerates. \u201cIt comes at a time when both brands have witnessed a slowdown of sales, meaning both businesses could potentially draw on one another\u2019s strengths and expertise,\u201d she said. \u201cThis takeover is likely to position the future of Michael Kors and Versace alongside the accessories-focused group Tapestry Inc, which includes Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, rather than powerhouses Kering and LVMH.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Oil prices hit fresh four-year high above $82 \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The rise in crude oil prices above $82 a barrel has led to more predictions of $100 a barrel around the end of the year. A supply crunch is to blame, just as winter is coming \u2013 the US has reimposed sanctions on Iran and Opec declined to raise production at the weekend (some say the oil cartel has limited room for manoeuvre). Energy shares such as BP have benefited, lifting European stock indices. Trade tensions have faded for now, after the latest round of US and Chinese tariffs took effect yesterday. But concerns clearly remain. The United States is putting \u201ca knife to China\u2019s neck\u201d on trade issues, a senior Chinese official has said, as the two sides struggle to find a way to end a months-long standoff over trade. A day after both sides heaped fresh tariffs on each other\u2019s goods, vice-commerce minister Wang Shouwen said the resumption of talks on the matter depended on the \u201cwill\u201d of the US. Sterling has risen for a second day, staging a recovery after Friday\u2019s sell-off. It is trading at $1.3158 at the moment, up 0.3%. Thank you for all your great comments. Good-bye \u2013 we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. As far as contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit is concerned, it couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for many retailers. Jessica Walker, partner at international law firm Mayer Brown, says: The need for retailers to commit additional spending to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, including the costs of setting up the necessary infrastructure to mitigate the associated risks, comes at a time when many retailers are needing to increase their investment in their stores and online offerings during a time of reduced consumer spending, difficulties in increases borrowing and an already-increased trading cost base including inflated business rates and rising employment costs. There can be no doubt that preparing for Brexit as early as possible will be beneficial to all retailers but the costs of doing so may be unwelcome at best and crippling at worst. Germany\u2019s BDI industry association has stressed the importance of achieving a breakthrough on getting a Brexit deal in the coming weeks to ensure a transition period that will give firms legal certainty until the end of 2020. BDI president Dieter Kempf said: Even this amount of time will hardly suffice to negotiate a free trade agreement as the United Kingdom envisages. His comments came as the industry body lowered its 2018 growth forecast for Germany and warned of a potential downturn, citing weaker demand for German exports due to US tariffs and Brexit, as well a threat to the economy from a wave of nationalism and xenophobia in Germany. The German economy is now expected to grow by 2% this year, down from a previous estimate of 2.25%. Exports are forecast to rise by 3.5% in real terms, below an initial forecast of 5%. Kempf said: The trade policy of US President Trump, but also the approaching Brexit are dampening investment activity worldwide and with it German export business. The BDI president also warned that the German economy could be hurt by a wave of nationalism, after violent right-wing marches in the eastern city of Chemnitz that followed a stabbing blamed on migrants. An allegedly homeland-loving nationalism that declares everything foreign an enemy is wrong. It poses a threat to the business model of our industry which is based on openness - and it\u2019s jeopardising prosperity and employment. Also in the fashion world, Michael Kors has confirmed its acquisition of the Italian fashion house Versace for $2.1 bn (\u00a31.6bn). Donatella Versace, the brand\u2019s artistic director and sister of founder Gianni Versace, will continue to lead the creative side of the business. Versace boss Jonathan Akeroyd will also stay put with the rest of the brand\u2019s senior management. Michael Kors will be renamed Capri Holdings. The enlarged company will comprise of three global fashion brands: Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo. Donatella Versace, her brother Santo and daughter Allegra will become shareholders in Capri Holdings. Here is our full story on the Next results, profit upgrade and Brexit plans. The rise in oil prices over the past two days has prompted Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to lift its forecast. MUFG has joined others who are predicting prices might reach $100 a barrel in coming months \u2013 levels not seen since 2014 \u2013 with potentially adverse effects on global economic growth. Ehsan Khoman, head of MENA (Middle East and North Africa) research and strategy at MUFG, says: Winter is coming and markets need to brace for higher oil prices. Several factors have increased the likelihood of oil prices rising significantly, not least heightened geopolitical tensions. We see material near-term risks that oil could reach as high as USD100/b, potentially damaging global economic growth and increasing inflation. Here is our full story on oil prices and what it means for the world economy. This is quite interesting. The European Medicines Agency, the European drug regulator, is moving from London to Amsterdam next year, but is having trouble getting out of its 25-year lease at 30 Churchill Place in Canary Wharf, where it occupies 10 floors. From Reuters Breakingviews: The European Medicines Agency is making a grim prognosis for London\u2019s property market. The EU\u2019s drug watchdog is using an arcane legal manoeuvre to try to get out of a lease on its UK headquarters. If successful, the case could set a dangerous precedent. Either way, London landlords should be worried... The EMA is deploying a rarely used legal argument that dates back to the 19th century, known as \u201cfrustration\u201d. That allows parties to cancel a contract if an unforeseen event renders it impossible to fulfill. In one case, a plaintiff used frustration to terminate a lease after the cancellation of Edward VII\u2019s coronation. If the EMA is successful, other tenants may follow. It looks like a long shot. Canary Wharf can argue that the existence of Article 50 in the Treaty of Lisbon, which was signed in 2007, shows that Brexit was not an unforeseen event. And UK politicians made the case for such a referendum long before the lease was first agreed in 2011. Nick Clegg, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats party, argued for a vote in 2008. The EMA has other options. Although the lease has no break clause, it does allow the drug regulator to sublet the space to other tenants. The EMA is exploring that option, according to one person familiar with the matter. The snag is that Brexit means there is little demand for large office spaces. Banks are already moving staff out of London, with 75,000 workers likely to leave, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman. The fallout will be more severe if the UK can\u2019t agree a deal with Europe: asset managers would also leave, and an economic downturn would hit demand for flexible office space. Providers like WeWork are now central London\u2019s biggest office occupier. Analysts at Jefferies reckon rents in the City of London will fall by a fifth over the next two years. Small wonder that the EMA is getting creative. Returning to the rise in Brent crude above $82 a barrel (up 1% on the day), Ashley Kelty, oil &amp; gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, believes that Opec will take its time before it takes any action. The US has become the world\u2019s biggest producer, although it is reaching peak output as infrastructure constraints are beginning to bite. These two will mean that supply will remain relatively tight in the near term, although OPEC were always likely to prevaricate at this meeting, as they (Russia and Saudi) don\u2019t wish to do anything that would appear to be appeasing the US, whilst being able to build market share at the expense of Iran. The group also wants to wait and see how the Iran sanctions play out, and whether the US-Sino trade war escalates further, and thence begins to threaten the global economy. Furthermore, OPEC are thrilled at the current oil price as it helps refill the national coffers after the Saudi-instigated collapse several years ago. Ironically, Trump should also be somewhat pleased that the recent price rise has triggered the creation of a lot of jobs and helped the non-farm payroll figures get better. The lack of any concrete action by OPEC will increase focus on the rhetoric and actions by OPEC nations ahead of the next meeting in November. We reckon that OPEC are happy to sit back and see how the aforementioned sanctions and tariffs shale out before acting. Investors have brought forward their bets on the first interest rate hike from the European Central Bank since 2011. Money markets now assume that the ECB will raise interest rates next September \u2013 before the departure of the central bank\u2019s president Mario Draghi. He finishes his term at the end of October 2019. Draghi yesterday predicted a \u201crelatively vigorous\u201d pickup in underlying inflation, which has been interpreted by some traders and investors as a signal that rates could go up faster than expected. They had pencilled in a rate hike for the ECB\u2019s October 2019 meeting, but have shifted this to the September meeting. Martin van Vliet, senior rates strategist at ING, told Reuters: You can downplay what Draghi said yesterday, but I think it was a notable shift in rhetoric. If inflation unfolds as the ECB now forecasts, then it makes sense for markets to brace for the first rate hike before Draghi leaves. The ECB last raised rates in 2011 when Jean-Claude Trichet was president. Over in the US, the Federal Reserve is widely tipped to lift interest rates for the third time this year at the end of its meeting tomorrow, following strong economic figures. The government yesterday said that flights between the UK and the rest of the EU could be grounded if Britain crashes out of the bloc without a deal. In response, the global airline industry body Iata has issued a stark warning about the implications of a no-deal Brexit today, saying that the impact is far broader. Pilots\u2019 licenses and security arrangements also need to be agreed. The association\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said in a statement: The UK government\u2019s papers on the air transport implications of a \u201cno deal\u201d departure from the EU clearly exposes the extreme seriousness of what is at stake and underscores the huge amount of work that would be required to maintain vital air links. It is not just permission for flights to take off and land. Everything from pilots\u2019 licenses to security arrangements need to be agreed. Much of this could be secured through mutual recognition of existing standards. But formalising this cannot happen overnight. And even when that is done, there will still be an administrative burden for the airlines and governments involved that will take time and significant resources. While we still hope for a comprehensive EU-UK deal, an assumption that \u201cit will be all right on the night\u201d is far too risky to accept. Every contingency should be prepared for, and we call upon both the EU and the UK to be far more transparent with the state of the discussions. The pound is also higher for a second day amid growing hopes of a Brexit deal, continuing its recovery from Friday\u2019s sell-off when the UK ran into an impasse in Brexit talks with EU leaders in Salzburg. Sterling is currently 0.26% higher against the dollar at $1.3154 and has gained 0.1% against the euro to 89.42p. On Friday, it fell to a low of $1.3053. Brexit secretary Dominic Raab talked up the chances of an eventual deal yesterday, although he added that the government was also ready and prepared for a no-deal scenario. However, some are sceptical that the pound\u2019s recovery will last. Hedge funds have been building up a massive bet against sterling since April, when it traded above $1.42. The high-street retailer Next revealed today that it had hedged against a further weakening of the pound until 2020. It said: In effect, we have insured the company against cost price volatility as a result of the potential devaluation of the pound. The corollary of this is that if the pound significantly strengthens next year we will not reap any of the reward until the following year. With Brent crude oil prices holding above $82 a barrel, the highest in four years, $100 a barrel has become the talk of the oil town. Analysts at Petromatrix warn: We are quite confident that at $100 a barrel Brent, global oil demand growth will be annihilated. $100 a barrel Brent looks fine on a chart but it looks problematic on a currency-adjusted chart, and disastrous on a domestic-price chart. Only the last one matters for oil demand and domestic prices include taxes that have risen over the last few years, while subsidies have fallen. On a domestic-price basis, $100 a barrel crude will not only force a sharp reduction of global oil demand, it will also lead to inflationary pressures that will force higher interest rates in Emerging Markets, which in turn could lead to wider pressure on economic growth. Many Emerging Markets will be forced to cut oil taxes or increase subsidies, resulting in turn in widening budget deficits. In developed economies, oil would make a come-back at $100 a barrel right at the time when the major auto manufacturers are introducing new lines of electric cars and that should result in an acceleration of the sales trend of Alternative Fuels Vehicles, on top of a price-induced contraction of oil demand. The rise in oil prices has benefited shares in BP and Royal Dutch Shell and pushed Britain\u2019s top share index higher. BP and Shell are among the main risers, up nearly 2% and 1.7% respectively. Top of the index is highstreet retailer Next, whose profit upgrade confounded expectations, at a time when other well-known retailers including John Lewis are struggling. Shares in Glencore are also higher, rising 2.9%, after the mining and trading giant launched an additional $1bn share buyback. The FTSE 100 has edged up 0.2% to 7,475.92. Others say crude prices could rise above $100 a barrel as market uncertainties stack up \u2013including sanctions on Iran, Venezuelan production concerns, tighter crude inventories and Saudi spare capacity. Oil traders gathered at the S&amp;P Global Platts Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference in Singapore yesterday, where Daniel Jaeggi, president and co-founder of Mercuria Energy Trading, told the conference: I think we may well be on the verge of some very significant volatility here in Q4 2018 because, depending on the severity and the duration of the Iranian sanctions, the market simply does not have an adequate supply response for 2 million b/d of oil disappearing from the market. It is conceivable to see oil north of $100 a barrel. The US sanctions on Iran threaten to cut Iran\u2019s crude exports to as little as 1 million to 1.3 million barrels a day from over 2.5 million barrels a day, according to Trafigura. Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura, said. I think it is entirely possible that once are beyond that we trade higher into Christmas and higher again into the New Year. I think it is entirely plausible that you are at $90 by Christmas and you are probably going to trade $100 in the New Year. Barclays Capital also believes oil prices will go higher, without saying by how much. Richard Robinson, manager of the Ashburton Global Energy Fund, says oil prices could surge another 12% to above $90 a barrel by the end of the year, due to tight supply, healthy demand, falling global inventories and anaemic spare capacity. He notes that \u201cwithout spare capacity, OPEC is relatively impotent in relation to preventing rising prices\u201d. Following four years of collapsing international capital spend, Trump\u2019s removal of the world\u2019s fifth largest oil producer, Iran, from the market \u2013 with sanctions to be fully implemented in November \u2013 was never going to end well. Iran is now likely to focus on influencing oil prices in the only way left available, by disrupting supply from others and elevating the risk premium \u2013 hence the military exercises performed over the Strait of Hormuz over the weekend. Following Trump\u2019s call for support from OPEC, the only country able to increase production significantly since July has been Libya. It increased production by 270k bbld, compared to Saudi Arabia\u2019s decline of 140k bbld \u2013 and this could disappear in a heartbeat. There is a risk that prices could spike even higher, Robinson reckons. In the event of a large supply disruption, both OPEC and the US \u2013 due to a lack of takeaway capacity in 2019 \u2013 will find it increasingly difficult to meet shortfalls next year. The world could then be faced with oil prices spiking back up to all-time highs circa $120. Brent crude has broken through $82 a barrel, rising as high as $82.20. Iran\u2019s oil exports fell by more than 700,000 barrels a day between April and August, when the US reimposed sanctions on the country. The sanctions will be fully implemented in November. Oil prices continue to rise today, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, hitting a fresh four-year high of $81.69 this morning. Some traders are predicting that the supply crunch could trigger a spike to $90 or even $100 a barrel around the turn of the year. The Opec oil cartel rebuffed calls for action from Donald Trump at the weekend, by not raising output to offset the loss of Iranian production due to new US sanctions against the country. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: President Trump has been quite critical of OPEC on a number of occasions in the past few weeks as oil prices have continued to edge higher, blaming them for the continued rise in prices, conveniently ignoring his part in the move higher. When the US reimposed sanctions in August Brent prices had slipped back to $73 a barrel having tried and failed to push through $80 on two previous occasions. Whatever the rights of wrongs of the decision to reimpose sanctions it has had the effect of removing 3m barrels of output from the global oil supply. Given the cuts to capital expenditure as a result of the slide from $110 in 2014 to the lows of $27 a barrel in 2016, it was always going to be difficult to replace that capacity, at a time when inventories have been declining, and so it has been proved. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Next has decided it can do without the headache of currency risk stemming from Brexit, and has hedged out its exposure to sterling on products it plans to sell right up to January 2020. This means it won\u2019t benefit from any rise in sterling, but equally there are no nasty surprises for the business if the currency heads in the other direction. Next deserves credit for presenting investors with a clear and insightful picture of its business in this set of results. The retailer has shown itself to be a resilient, well-managed company through a difficult period for the sector. Next isn\u2019t immune to the problems besetting the high street, but it\u2019s doing the right things to ensure it makes it to the other side in decent shape. Here is some reaction to the Next figures. Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at data company GlobalData, said: The positive figures announced by high street bellwether Next are likely to be perceived as a sign that the UK retail environment is recovering, however Next has made wise operational decisions which have aided growth and enabled the retailer to capitalise on changing shopping habits. Next\u2019s robust performance should not be attributed to a general upturn in consumer spending and as such other retailers that are not making strides in improving their customer proposition, are unlikely to see the same results. Next is better protected as sales continue to transition online, given the dominance of its digital channels, and is well prepared with a more agile retail estate comprising of shorter leases and profitable stores. Stores remain a declining part of the business but Next is utilising physical locations to its advantage, for example by adding in concessions to drive revenue and give shoppers other reasons to visit Next, and also as a back-up stock pool for online orders. In addition Next is considering using stores as collection points for \u2018third-party non-competing businesses\u2019 demonstrating a willingness to extend its purpose, in order to provide convenience for shoppers and adapt to changing consumer needs. Meanwhile, Unilever executives have taken to the airwaves and the press to defend their plans to scrap the company\u2019s dual British-Dutch structure, picking Rotterdam over London as its single headquarters. The creation of a single holding company based in the Netherlands means that the company will drop out of the FTSE 100 index, forcing UK tracker funds and those with strict UK investment mandates to sell their holdings. The plans have angered some UK investors. A major Unilever shareholder, Aviva Investors, plans to vote against the plans. David Cumming, the chief investment officer, has urged other Unilever shareholders to follow suit. In a charm offensive, Unilever\u2019s chairman, Marijn Dekkers, wrote an op-ed in the Daily Telegraph while the chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, made an appearance on BBC radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Both stressed that the company, which makes a huge range of well-known consumer products such as Dove soap, Persil and Marmite, remained committed to Britain. Dekkers wrote: Rest assured that reports of Unilever leaving the UK could not be further from the truth. Two of our three operating divisions at Unilever, which represent 60% of our turnover, will remain headquartered from our offices in London. We also employ around 7,000 people across the country, which will not change as a result of the board\u2019s proposals. In fact, simplifying our business is all about allowing our operating divisions to compete and perform even better for the future. And if they perform better that is good news for the UK and it is good news for our shareholders. Cumming told BBC radio that it looked like Unilever was moving to the Netherlands for better takeover protection, following last year\u2019s failed $143bn takeover approach from Kraft Heinz. Pitkethly responded by saying \u201cthe best form of protectionism is great performance\u201d. Unilever\u2019s plans will be put to shareholder votes in late October. The third UK retailer to report figures this morning, Hotel Chocolat has posted a 13% rise in full-year profits. The upmarket chocolatier is pressing ahead with store openings abroad, pushing into Scandinavia, Japan and the US. The firm reported a profit before tax of \u00a312.7m for the year to 1 July. The upbeat figures sent its shares up nearly 3% to 348.5p. Elsewhere on the high street, Card Factory has not fared as well. It has blamed weak consumer spending for an 8.9% drop in underlying profits in the six months to 31 July to \u00a329.9m. Like-for-like sales \u2013 at stores that have been open at least a year \u2013 slipped 0.2%. Shares in the FTSE 250 company fell more than 7% in early trading, and are now down 5.3% at 176.3p. The group said it had been selling fewer everyday ranges such as birthday cards, but its Valentine\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day ranges each produced record sales. The greeting card retailer still expects to make full-year profits of \u00a389m to \u00a391m, after lowering its forecast in August. The chief executive, Karen Hubbard, said: Our like-for-like performance has impacted profitability, as have the ongoing cost headwinds of foreign exchange and national living wage. Never mind the Brexit contingency plans. Traders clearly like the profit upgrade from Next \u2013 its shares jumped just over 9% when the market opened, and are still up 8.6% at \u00a355.52. Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark owner Associated British Foods have also benefited and are among the main risers on the FTSE 100. The FTSE 100 as a whole has inched up nearly 5 points to 7463.32. The German Dax and and French CAC are slightly down, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is 0.5% ahead and Spain\u2019s Ibex has risen 0.3%. In a detailed section on duties, Next warns that stock imported into the UK could end up incurring double duty if its then exported to any country outside the UK. There is an additional risk when goods are sold online and dispatched from the UK to the EU, it said. Customers will become liable for duty on the selling price of the goods rather than their cost price. This is because the customer would, in effect, be importing the goods at selling price into the EU from outside. So Next has set up a German company to send goods to EU customers. It explains: It is likely goods would be sold to our German company from our UK company. Goods would then be deemed to have been imported into the EU by our German company at cost plus a reasonable transfer premium, in the same way as if they had been imported direct from the overseas territory in which they were manufactured. It is our intention to bond our German warehouse facility so that goods will only incur duty when they leave it and go into free circulation in the EU. This will enable unsold goods that return from Germany to the UK to avoid double duty... it is our intention to steadily increase the volume of our EU business served through our German warehouse. The company has also set up a company in Ireland, which will own goods sent from the UK to its Irish stores. This means that goods can be imported into Ireland at a cost (plus a reasonable transfer premium) and will incur very little additional duty. The Next chief executive, Wolfson, has said in the past that leaving the EU could spark an \u201ceconomic renaissance\u201d for Britain, by enabling trade deals to be struck in emerging markets and allowing the UK to leave behind swaths of regulation. However, he has urged the government not to rush negotiations, warning that the economy would suffer from a botched or rushed deal. Next, seen as a bellwether of the high street, reported a 0.5% rise in first-half profits to \u00a3311m in the 26 weeks to 28 July after full-price sales rose 4.5%. However, it warned: The UK retail market remains volatile, subject to powerful structural and cyclical changes. Many of these headwinds have not abated. As expected, sales in our stores (which now account for just under half of our turnover) continue to be challenging. We believe the over-performance in the first half was flattered by the unusually warm summer and we remain cautious in our outlook for the rest of the year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The high street retailer Next has set out its contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. It highlighted queues and delays at ports as the biggest risk to its business if the UK were to leave the EU without a customs arrangement in place. It also warned of higher tariffs and a further weakening of the pound, which the company is hedging against. However, the company added that it does not see a \u201cmaterial threat\u201d from Brexit. Next, which is run by Lord Wolfson, who has backed Brexit, said: It is not yet clear how well prepared HMRC systems, customs and other relevant personnel will be for the upcoming potential increase in workload and data capture. We believe that the biggest risk to our business is the external risk of UK ports not coping with the additional volume of customs work they would be required to undertake if no changes are made to the UK\u2019s current procedures... We believe that it remains open to the government to initiate changes in the way customs procedures operate and that such measures could eliminate much of the risk to our ports. The retailer added: There are significant challenges involved in preparing for a no-deal outcome and we would not want to understate the work we are doing to prepare for this eventuality. However, we do not believe that the direct risks of a no-deal Brexit pose a material threat to the ongoing operations and profitability of Next\u2019s business here in the UK or to our \u00a3190m turnover business in the EU. We are well advanced in our preparations and are setting up all the administrative, legal and physical infrastructure that will be needed to operate effectively if the UK and EU are unable to agree a free trade agreement. We are confident all the necessary arrangements we need to make will be in place by March of next year. The comments came as Next upgraded its profit forecast after sales were boosted by the long heatwave, but warned that the market remained tough. Its raised its full-year forecast for profit before tax by \u00a310m to \u00a3727m, similar to last year\u2019s profit of \u00a3726.1m.

The European Medicines Agency, the European drug regulator, is moving from London to Amsterdam next year, but is having trouble getting out of its 25-year lease at 30 Churchill Place in Canary Wharf, where it occupies 10 floors.</p> <p>From Reuters Breakingviews:</p> <blockquote> <p>The European Medicines Agency is making a grim prognosis for London\u2019s property market. The EU\u2019s drug watchdog is using an arcane legal manoeuvre to try to get out of a lease on its UK headquarters. If successful, the case could set a dangerous precedent. Either way, London landlords should be worried...</p> <p>The EMA is deploying a rarely used legal argument that dates back to the 19th century, known as \u201cfrustration\u201d. That allows parties to cancel a contract if an unforeseen event renders it impossible to fulfill. In one case, a plaintiff used frustration to terminate a lease after the cancellation of Edward VII\u2019s coronation. If the EMA is successful, other tenants may follow.</p> <p>It looks like a long shot. Canary Wharf can argue that the existence of Article 50 in the Treaty of Lisbon, which was signed in 2007, shows that Brexit was not an unforeseen event. And UK politicians made the case for such a referendum long before the lease was first agreed in 2011. Nick Clegg, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats party, argued for a vote in 2008.</p> <p>The EMA has other options. Although the lease has no break clause, it does allow the drug regulator to sublet the space to other tenants. The EMA is exploring that option, according to one person familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The snag is that Brexit means there is little demand for large office spaces. Banks are already moving staff out of London, with 75,000 workers likely to leave, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman. The fallout will be more severe if the UK can\u2019t agree a deal with Europe: asset managers would also leave, and an economic downturn would hit demand for flexible office space. Providers like WeWork are now central London\u2019s biggest office occupier. Analysts at Jefferies reckon rents in the City of London will fall by a fifth over the next two years. Small wonder that the EMA is getting creative.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ca14bb30a7cb907f26cafa29ba918bbcd89f080\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca14bb30a7cb907f26cafa29ba918bbcd89f080/0_115_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The headquarters of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The headquarters of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5baa12afe4b072dfb217c3b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-25T10:51:02.676Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Returning to the rise in Brent crude above $82 a barrel (up 1% on the day), Ashley Kelty, oil &amp; gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, believes that Opec will take its time before it takes any action.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US has become the world\u2019s biggest producer, although it is reaching peak output as infrastructure constraints are beginning to bite.

Furthermore, OPEC are thrilled at the current oil price as it helps refill the national coffers after the Saudi-instigated collapse several years ago. Ironically, Trump should also be somewhat pleased that the recent price rise has triggered the creation of a lot of jobs and helped the non-farm payroll figures get better. </p> <p>The lack of any concrete action by OPEC will increase focus on the rhetoric and actions by OPEC nations ahead of the next meeting in November.

Pilots\u2019 licenses and security arrangements also need to be agreed.</p> <p>The association\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said in a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK government\u2019s papers on the air transport implications of a \u201cno deal\u201d departure from the EU clearly exposes the extreme seriousness of what is at stake and underscores the huge amount of work that would be required to maintain vital air links. </p> <p>It is not just permission for flights to take off and land. Everything from pilots\u2019 licenses to security arrangements need to be agreed. Much of this could be secured through mutual recognition of existing standards.

It highlighted queues and delays at ports as the biggest risk to its business if the UK were to leave the EU without a customs arrangement in place. It also warned of higher tariffs and a further weakening of the pound, which the company is hedging against. </p> <p>However, the company added that it does not see a \u201cmaterial threat\u201d from Brexit. Next, which is run by Lord Wolfson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/01/uk-business-figures-still-backing-brexit\">who has backed Brexit</a>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is not yet clear how well prepared HMRC systems, customs and other relevant personnel will be for the upcoming potential increase in workload and data capture.</p> <p>We believe that the biggest risk to our business is the external risk of UK ports not coping with the additional volume of customs work they would be required to undertake if no changes are made to the UK\u2019s current procedures... We believe that it remains open to the government to initiate changes in the way customs procedures operate and that such measures could eliminate much of the risk to our ports.</p> </blockquote> <p>The retailer added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are significant challenges involved in preparing for a no-deal outcome and we would not want to understate the work we are doing to prepare for this eventuality. However, we do not believe that the direct risks of a no-deal Brexit pose a material threat to the ongoing operations and profitability of Next\u2019s business here in the UK or to our \u00a3190m turnover business in the EU.</p> <p>We are well advanced in our preparations and are setting up all the administrative, legal and physical infrastructure that will be needed to operate effectively if the UK and EU are unable to agree a free trade agreement. We are confident all the necessary arrangements we need to make will be in place by March of next year.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The comments came as Next upgraded its profit forecast after sales were boosted by the long heatwave, but warned that the market remained tough.

Adoboli, 38, was jailed for seven years after being found guilty in 2012 of fraud that cost his employer UBS $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn). He was released after serving half his sentence. Although born in Ghana, he left when he was four and has lived in the UK since he was 12. Under UK law, if a foreign national has been sentenced to more than four years in jail \u201cthe public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances\u201d. Adoboli was last week granted an injunction against his deportation in an attempt to prevent his \u201cbanishment\u201d from his friends and family in the UK. Adoboli\u2019s legal team argued on Tuesday that he should be freed from Harmondsworth immigration removal centre near Heathrow airport and released on bail until the outcome of the review. But in a hearing where Adoboli appeared via video link, the immigration judge Claire O\u2019Garro agreed to the Home Office\u2019s request that he must remain locked up. However, the Home Office has asked the judiciary to expedite an initial decision on the case. O\u2019Garro said if his judicial review went ahead he could reapply for bail. O\u2019Garro rejected the arguments of Adoboli\u2019s barrister, Phil Haywood, that he should be released from detention because he was not an absconding risk and because his friends were prepared to stand as \u00a325,000 bail sureties. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly not wishing to return to Ghana,\u201d said O\u2019Garro. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to go, he doesn\u2019t want to be removed. This seems to be the last throw of the dice.\u201d Speaking from detention after the hearing, Adoboli said: \u201cI\u2019m devastated about today\u2019s decision. My friends and family have had to sacrifice a lot to support me through this process. There is no evidence that I will abscond. I\u2019m just trying my best to ensure that my life in the UK is protected.\u201d In his recent report (pdf) into immigration detention, the former prisons ombudsman Stephen Shaw expressed concern about the removal of foreign national offenders who were born in the UK or grew up here. He said removing people from a country where they had grown up, gone to school and had family and friends raised real ethical issues. He described the Home Office policy to deport people who had committed crimes but had grown up here as \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and called for an end to the practice.",

      "bodyText": "The global economy could be damaged if oil prices return to $100 (\u00a376) a barrel, experts have warned, after crude prices hit a four-year high of $82.16. Some market watchers have predicted prices between $90 and $100 by the year\u2019s end after Opec last weekend rebuffed Donald Trump\u2019s demands for the oil cartel to rein in prices by expanding production. Now after Tuesday\u2019s high a leading analyst has said that if prices climbed to $100 \u2013 a level not seen since September 2014 \u2013 growth in oil demand would be \u201cannihilated\u201d and demand would fall sharply. Moreover, PetroMatrix said, emerging economies\u2019 growth could suffer because of steep crude prices causing inflationary pressures that lead to interest rate rises. Those countries could also be forced to cut oil taxes, widening budget deficits. Any slowing in emerging markets would add to the recent economic challenges facing countries including Turkey and Argentina. The price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, has crept up in the past week as it became clear that major oil producers were not planning to increase output. Trump tweeted last week that the \u201cOpec monopoly must get prices down now\u201d, but when the cartel met in Algiers on Sunday it focused on how a previously agreed increase would be divvied up, rather than a new boost. Observers expect prices to keep rising, mainly due to concerns over the impact of US sanctions on Iranian oil exports from November. Analysts at Barclays said they saw further upside risk to oil prices, while Ashburton Global Energy Fund predicted prices above $90 by the end of the year due to \u201ctight supply, healthy demand, falling global inventories \u2026 and anaemic spare capacity\u201d. Some traders have been even more bullish, predicting $100 this year. \u201cWe see material near-term risks that oil could reach as high as $100 per barrel, potentially damaging global economic growth and increasing inflation,\u201d said Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The world\u2019s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, recently said it expected the recent price range of $70 to $80 to be tested as the market tightened up. The return of the $100 barrel would coincide with the arrival of a new wave of electric car models in wealthy countries, potentially making them even more attractive. \u201cThat should result in an acceleration of the sales trend of alternative fuels vehicles,\u201d PetroMatrix noted. There are about 114 different electric cars on sale in the UK, including pure electric cars, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen cars, according to Next Green Car, a buyers\u2019 guide. But there are expected to be at least 41 additional models by the end of 2019, based on car makers\u2019 announcements, Next Green Car said. The RAC, a UK motoring group, warned that if a higher oil price coincided with the pound falling against the dollar, drivers could face record high prices of 142p per litre of petrol and 148p for diesel, up from 131.18p and 134.32p now, respectively.",

      "bodyText": "Next has warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to disruption at UK ports and higher prices in its shops, but shares in the company soared as the fashion and homewares retailer said the long hot summer had bolstered sales and profits. The retailer\u2019s shares climbed by more than 9% on Tuesday, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, after Next said sales had risen by 1% more than expected, strengthened by the heatwave. When Next updated investors in August, the chief executive, Simon Wolfson, said early summer sales had been boosted by the heatwave and he feared a slowdown in August and September. However, that slump did not materialise and on Tuesday the retailer increased its profit forecast for the year to the end of January by \u00a310m to \u00a3727m, which would be in line with last year. The group reported flat pre-tax profits of \u00a3311.1m on sales of \u00a32bn for the six months to the end of July. \u201cWe believe the overperformance in the first half was flattered by the unusually warm summer and we remain cautious in our outlook for the rest of the year,\u201d Wolfson said. Online sales drove first half growth, while sales in stores fell back, prompting Next to slate 22 stores for closure this year compared with 14 last year. A further 25 are being kept on without a lease and could be closed at any moment. Next also now expects to open 60% less space than it believed it would six months ago, reflecting a shakeout across the high street that has prompted rivals including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and New Look to close stores. In the half-year, Next sold more goods online than in stores for the first time as Wolfson said the retail industry was undergoing a \u201cprofound shift\u201d towards online shopping in an environment that was \u201cextremely challenging\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to go away. It doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be any shops in 10 years\u2019 time. Our job is not to guess what is going to happen but to make sure we are flexible enough and disciplined enough to handle whatever it is,\u201d he said. Wolfson, a prominent Vote Leave supporter, said the Leicester-based retailer was also preparing for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, devoting 10 pages in its Stock Exchange update to the topic. The biggest risk to the business, Wolfson said, was the likelihood of queues and delays at UK and EU ports, while a sharp fall in the value of the pound and increased tariffs also posed a threat. Next has set up new companies in Ireland and Germany as part of its planning. \u201cDeparture from the EU without a free trade arrangement and managed transition period is not our preferred outcome,\u201d said Wolfson, who is a Conservative peer. \u201cHowever, Next is well-prepared for this eventuality and we have all the administrative, legal and IT framework in place to ensure that we are able to carry on running the business as we do now. \u201cWe believe that the biggest risk to our business is the external risk of UK ports not coping with the additional volume of customs work they would be required to undertake if no changes are made to the UK\u2019s current procedures,\u201d he continued. He suggested that Dover, where the majority of goods imported from the EU by sea arrive in the UK, was likely to come under the most pressure if the government didn\u2019t take action to streamline processes. Wolfson said the \u201ctrusted trader\u201d scheme which allows checks on some companies\u2019 vehicles and drivers to take place inland could be extended and customs duties handled via self-assessment, in the same way as VAT, to reduce the administrative burden at ports. \u201cWhatever your view on Brexit, no one can think it can be a good thing for the ports not to be prepared,\u201d he said. Wolfson also called on the government to clarify policy on import tariffs in the light of a no-deal Brexit. He said the UK should consider lowering tariffs on goods from countries outside the EU to help offset tariffs on goods from the EU, which would kick in if there was a no-deal Brexit under World Trade Organisation rules. Next said about 10% of its stock came from the EU and Turkey and in the \u201cunlikely event\u201d that the UK did not replicate free-trade agreements with countries such as Mauritius and Morocco, it would face paying up to \u00a320m in additional duty, a figure that would add less 0.5% to its prices. \u201cIn reality some of these additional costs would be shared with suppliers or eliminated through alternative sourcing routes,\u201d said Wolfson.",

      "bodyText": "Labor has criticised the Productivity Commission\u2019s recent landmark report on inequality, saying it has taken an overly sunny view of the ability of Australians to move from rags to riches. Andrew Leigh, Labor\u2019s shadow assistant treasurer, says the commission\u2019s failure to delve deeply enough into inequality data means it has produced a report that skates over the very real problems of Australia\u2019s generational inequality. Leigh, a former professor of economics at the Australian National University, will make his argument on Tuesday evening, when he delivers the Evatt Foundation NSW Parliament Lecture on generational inequality. Leigh will use the speech, which Guardian Australia has seen, to explain how governments can improve intergenerational mobility rates in Australia. He will talk about the need to give children the greatest possible start in life by reducing \u201cpre-birth inequality\u201d, emphasising the vital importance of healthy pregnancies, paid parental leave, properly funded legal aid for family violence victims, and the ability to visit a doctor without worrying about the cost. But he will also criticise the Productivity Commission\u2019s recent report on income and wealth inequality, which was published in August. \u201cI was surprised to see that the Productivity Commission\u2019s recent report took such a sunny view about mobility in Australia, concluding that \u2018economic mobility is high in Australia, with almost everyone moving across the income distribution over the course of their lives\u2019,\u201d Leigh will say. \u201cImplicit in this statement is that we should be pleased if we see some movement \u2013 in effect, that the benchmark should be feudalism rather than equal opportunity. \u201cIf you think that any mobility is good, you\u2019ll be pleased with the status quo. If you think we should aspire to be a nation where babies born into poor households have the same life chances as babies born into rich households, you\u2019ll conclude that we could do a lot better.\u201d In 2007, Leigh conducted a study on how much parents\u2019 income affects the incomes of their children, a measure known as \u201cintergenerational elasticity\u201d. It was the first internationally comparable estimate of Australia\u2019s intergenerational elasticity. Leigh says studies of intergenerational elasticity consider the impact on children\u2019s incomes of a 10% increase in parental incomes \u2013 if a 10% increase in parental incomes boosts children\u2019s incomes by 10%, we might conclude that it\u2019s essentially impossible to jump up or down the social hierarchy. But if the same increase in parental income had zero impact on children, then we\u2019d be looking at a society where everyone moved across social classes based on their talents, not their parents. Leigh says in the United States, a 10% increase in parental income translates into about a 5% increase in children\u2019s incomes, while in Scandinavian nations, it means less than a 2% increase. \u201cIn other words, parental income matters more than twice as much in the United States,\u201d he says. Leigh says in 2007 he judged that a 10% increase in parental income boosted children\u2019s incomes by around 2.5% in Australia, which suggested Australia was less mobile than Scandinavia, but more mobile than the United States. \u201cBut in 2017, researchers used the same methodology \u2013 with considerably more data \u2013 and revised the estimate upwards to 3.5%,\u201d he says. Leigh says in Australia, a more progressive tax system, a more employee-friendly industrial relations system, and competition laws that limit monopoly power are likely to deliver a more equal society, which in turn is likely to lead to greater mobility. An increase in home ownership rates will also improve social mobility, he says. He will reiterate that a Labor government would task the Productivity Commission to produce an Equality of Opportunity Report every five years. \u201cLike the Intergenerational Report, it would aim to focus national attention on how Australia is tracking in improving social mobility,\u201d he said.",
