    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shareholders are to win a legal right to block sky-high pay awards to company executives under radical plans for an assault on \"fat cat\" earnings drawn up by the government. Senior ministers, including the business secretary, Vince Cable, are backing a move that would give shareholders an effective veto over pay deals they deem unacceptable. David Cameron confirmed the move and said he was determined to end the \"merry-go-round\" of super-rich bosses rubber-stamping each others' inflated deals and being rewarded for failure: \"Let's empower the shareholders by having a straight, shareholder vote on top pay packages,\" he said. \"The market for top people isn't working; it needs to be sorted out.\" The move by ministers, which would require legislation, came to light as the main parties scrambled to occupy the high ground over executive pay, ahead of the politically charged bank bonus season. It reflects a growing consensus at Westminster that executive pay is out of control and has to be tackled, particularly at a time when many people are losing their jobs and those on modest earning are having their pay frozen. In the past financial year, the directors of FTSE 100 companies have seen a 49% increase in total earnings, taking average pay to \u00a32.7m. Although bonuses will probably be down on last year, the hefty sums awarded will further highlight the growing chasm between rich and poor and fuel complaints that the government is too soft on the City. Labour, whose leader, Ed Miliband, has called for a \"fairer and better capitalism\", challenged the government to back all the recommendations of the independent High Pay Commission in order to increase transparency and accountability in the boardroom and the City. Currently shareholders have a right to vote on pay awards, but the vote is \"advisory\" and often takes place only after decisions have been made on executive pay. Under the plans being drawn up by cabinet ministers, the vote would, for the first time, have legal force, so that executives would be subject to the democratic will of shareholders over pay. Cameron criticised boardroom cronies who helped each other \"fill their boots\" while the country was being forced to tighten its belt. \"We've got to deal with the merry-go-round where there's too many cases of remuneration committee members sitting on each other's boards, patting each other's backs and handing out each other's pay rises,\" he said. \"We need to redefine the word 'fair'. We need to try to give people a sense that we have a vision at the end of this, of a fairer, better economy, a fairer, better society, where if you work hard and do the right thing you get rewarded.\" Anger among shareholders and the public at soaring executive pay has been growing in recent years. Shareholder rebellions have become increasingly common. Advertising giant WPP's management received a stinging rebuke from investors last year, with 42% of shareholders voting against the remuneration report. Shareholder activists objected to the fact that Mark Read, the head of WPP Digital, received a pay rise of 31% to \u00a3425,000 in January. Other reforms being considered by ministers include ending the \"cosy cartel\" that allows top executives to set each other's pay, by bringing outsiders on to remuneration committees, and introducing rules to force executives to take more of their pay in shares that cannot be cashed in for at least five years. The High Pay Commission said executive remuneration was out of control. It cited the pay of the head of Barclays, which rose by nearly 5,000% in 30 years, a period in which average wages had risen only threefold. It made 12 recommendations, including: \u2022 Greater transparency in the calculation of executive pay, to end the \"closed shop\" on pay decisions. \u2022 Putting employees and other \"outsiders\" on remuneration committees. \u2022 Publishing the top 10 executive pay packages outside the boardroom in order to illustrate the sums earned by senior traders at investment banks. \u2022 Forcing companies to publish a pay ratio between the highest paid executive and the company median. \u2022 Requiring companies to publish a single total pay figure for boardroom members, including pension benefits. Will Hutton, Observer columnist and author of an independent review of fair pay delivered to the government last March, called for companies and the public sector to publish annually the five-year trend of the ratio of top pay to median pay and justify upward movement. \"Citizens, workers and shareholders would have the ammunition to challenge undeserved top pay,\" he said. Deborah Hargreaves, who chairs the commission and is a former business editor of the Guardian, said: \"We urge the government to be bold in their reforms and not be put off by the strong possibility of a backlash from the business lobby. The public are right behind the campaign in this new era of austerity.\" Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"We have set three tests for the government to meet, based on the principles of transparency, accountability and fairness. Anything less than the full implementation of these measures by the prime minister will fall short of what is required to empower those who ultimately own our businesses.\"",

      "body": "<p>Consumer goods company Unilever faces a renewed wave of strikes this month over its decision to close its final salary pension scheme.</p> <p>Before Christmas, Unilever, which produces goods such as Dove soap, Wall's ice-cream, PG Tips and Marmite, was hit by the first ever national strike involving its UK operations after revealing plans for a pensions shake-up.</p> <p>The firm, which employs around 7,000 workers, is looking to move 5,000 staff to a less generous career average scheme by the middle of next year.

      "bodyText": "Consumer goods company Unilever faces a renewed wave of strikes this month over its decision to close its final salary pension scheme. Before Christmas, Unilever, which produces goods such as Dove soap, Wall's ice-cream, PG Tips and Marmite, was hit by the first ever national strike involving its UK operations after revealing plans for a pensions shake-up. The firm, which employs around 7,000 workers, is looking to move 5,000 staff to a less generous career average scheme by the middle of next year. The remainder are already signed up to the new scheme, which was closed to newcomers in 2008. On Saturday, leaders of the Unite, Usdaw and GMB unions said they would call for a series of strikes from 17 January, claiming new pension arrangements could cut retirement income for staff by 40%. Jennie Formby, national officer of Unite, said: \"It would seem that Unilever believed the workers would give up after one day's strike but they are badly mistaken. \"The workforce is angry that the company has refused to meet us or to attend talks at the conciliation service Acas.\" Allan Black, national officer of the GMB said: \"Unilever need to get the message that profitable companies will not be allowed to walk away from their savings commitments to their loyal workforce.\" Unilever previously said its UK pension arrangements had to reflect realities if they were going to be sustainable into the future. Around 2,500 mostly factory-floor staff are represented by the unions at Purfleet, Port Sunlight, Warrington, Leeds, Crumlin, Gloucester, Manchester, Burton-on-Trent and Ewloe, Wales. There was uproar last week when Shell, the last remaining FTSE-100 company with a final salary scheme in Britain, said it was closing it to new members, even though it recorded a surplus in 2010. Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary, said: \"This is a disgraceful act, nothing less than greed on the part of one of the world's richest and most powerful corporations. They have no need whatsoever to close this scheme and in the process deny their employees the safe retirement they were promised they could save for.\" Shell's decision is part of a wider trend in Britain where only 19% of final salary and average salary schemes are open to new employees. The era when a majority of British staff in the private sector could be confident of a guaranteed income throughout their retirement is coming to an end. Workers in the public sector are being asked by the government to pay more and work longer in order to retain benefits that are more reliable than those on offer from private firms. A study by the Association of Consulting Actuaries published this week found that nine out of 10 private sector-defined benefit schemes are now closed to new entrants and four out of 10 prevent existing staff building up further benefits. In a statement, Unilever said it was \"deeply concerned by the disproportionate action\" of the trade unions. \"We believe the provision of final salary pensions is a broken model which is no longer appropriate for Unilever. The pension arrangements which we plan to implement in July this year are exceptionally competitive. \"It is currently not clear how the dispute with the trade unions will be resolved \u2013 but we are continuing to urge our employees who have participated in industrial action to give further objective consideration to the very competitive new arrangements.\"",
