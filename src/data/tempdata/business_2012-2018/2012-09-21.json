The energy regulator said it was ready to impose multimillion fines after finding only 30% of promises had been achieved under the \"super priority group obligation\" \u2013 which applies to families receiving child tax credits and with an annual income of under \u00a316,190. In an open letter, Ofgem told gas and electricity suppliers they had until 31 December to fulfil their obligations under the community energy saving programme (Cesp) and the carbon emissions reduction target (Cert) set up in 2008 but ending this year. A four-year review by Ofgem shows the firms had in total installed insulation and other measures to save 5m tonnes of carbon rather than the 16m tonnes they were obliged to. A wider priority group of households had received 40% of the measures they were entitled to although the overall figure for all Cert measures was 82% of the total or 241m tonnes of CO2.

Analysts believe a revised deal, similar to the Sportingbet offer, could see it snap up Probability successfully if it takes a second tilt at the business.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Pearson</strong> put on 35p to \u00a312.17 after the publisher was upgraded by Exane BNP Paribas, which raised its target price by 21% to \u00a314.50 and its rating from neutral to outperform. It said:</p> <blockquote> We have turned more bullish on the growth opportunities at Pearson International Education, US School and on digital learning. We have raised our earnings per share by 5% 2013 estimates and 9% on 2014 estimates and now stand above consensus by 4% and 6%, respectively. Apart from increased earnings forecasts, our target price upgrade reflects more optimistic long-term assumptions on margins in digital and a revaluation of Pearson's emerging market education assets, which we now value separately. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> dropped 34p to \u00a323.65 on profit taking after Thursday's better than expected trading update.</p> <p><strong>Lonmin</strong> lost 16.5p to 594p ahead of an expected cash call of up to $1bn. The platinum producer's balance sheet will come under increasing strain after it agreed a wage deal after a bitter dispute in South Africa. The agreement at the Marikana mine followed six weeks of industrial action which has led to production stoppages and protest in which 45 people have died. It will add 14% to the company's wage bill from October, and Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote> Following the Marikana agreement we downgrade our earnings [forecast] from $218mm to $95m in 2012 and from $195m to $29m in 2013. We believe Lonmin will struggle to ramp up to 750,000 ounces (its optimal capacity) in 2013, and we moderate our volume forecast to 660,000 ounces of platinum in 2013 (from 750,000 ounces). <br> On our new numbers Lonmin will likely breach covenants until 2014 under our base case price forecasts. While in 2009 the group managed to arrange a covenant waiver we think this time there is a genuine funding gap and as such a recapitalization (including equity) of Lonmin continues to be needed. On our base case (and spot) forecasts net debt will climb close to $700m by the end of 2013 (or in 12 months time).  A full recapitalization (replacement of debt) would need $1bn equity and this would arguably reset the company. A smaller $500m rights issue in our view would be enough to pay down some covenanted debt, but not enough to restart growth plans and would need to be complimented with a bond if growth was to be restarted. </blockquote> <p>Others continued to be hit by industrial action, including the platinum subsidiary of <strong>Anglo American</strong>, down 6p at 19.38.</p> <p><strong>Burberry</strong>, whose shares dropped sharply after a shock profit warning earlier this month, edged another 1p lower to \u00a310.36 despite Credit Suisse issuing a positive note on the luxury goods group. The bank said the longer term outlook was good, and put an outperform rating on the shares, although it cut its target price from \u00a316 to \u00a314.</p> <p>Drinks group <strong>Diageo</strong> added 2.5p to 1722.5p on reports it was in talks to buy a stake in Indian distiller United Spirits, three years after the failure of a similar move.</p> <p>Finally industrial group <strong>Tanfield</strong> dropped 44% to 28.75p after its US electric car associate Smith Electric Vehicles cancelled a proposed flotation on Nasdaq because it could not achieve an acceptable valuation.</p>",

Apart from increased earnings forecasts, our target price upgrade reflects more optimistic long-term assumptions on margins in digital and a revaluation of Pearson's emerging market education assets, which we now value separately. But Imperial Tobacco dropped 34p to \u00a323.65 on profit taking after Thursday's better than expected trading update. Lonmin lost 16.5p to 594p ahead of an expected cash call of up to $1bn. The platinum producer's balance sheet will come under increasing strain after it agreed a wage deal after a bitter dispute in South Africa. The agreement at the Marikana mine followed six weeks of industrial action which has led to production stoppages and protest in which 45 people have died. It will add 14% to the company's wage bill from October, and Credit Suisse said: Following the Marikana agreement we downgrade our earnings [forecast] from $218mm to $95m in 2012 and from $195m to $29m in 2013. We believe Lonmin will struggle to ramp up to 750,000 ounces (its optimal capacity) in 2013, and we moderate our volume forecast to 660,000 ounces of platinum in 2013 (from 750,000 ounces). On our new numbers Lonmin will likely breach covenants until 2014 under our base case price forecasts. While in 2009 the group managed to arrange a covenant waiver we think this time there is a genuine funding gap and as such a recapitalization (including equity) of Lonmin continues to be needed. On our base case (and spot) forecasts net debt will climb close to $700m by the end of 2013 (or in 12 months time). A full recapitalization (replacement of debt) would need $1bn equity and this would arguably reset the company. A smaller $500m rights issue in our view would be enough to pay down some covenanted debt, but not enough to restart growth plans and would need to be complimented with a bond if growth was to be restarted. Others continued to be hit by industrial action, including the platinum subsidiary of Anglo American, down 6p at 19.38. Burberry, whose shares dropped sharply after a shock profit warning earlier this month, edged another 1p lower to \u00a310.36 despite Credit Suisse issuing a positive note on the luxury goods group. The bank said the longer term outlook was good, and put an outperform rating on the shares, although it cut its target price from \u00a316 to \u00a314. Drinks group Diageo added 2.5p to 1722.5p on reports it was in talks to buy a stake in Indian distiller United Spirits, three years after the failure of a similar move. Finally industrial group Tanfield dropped 44% to 28.75p after its US electric car associate Smith Electric Vehicles cancelled a proposed flotation on Nasdaq because it could not achieve an acceptable valuation.",

      "bodyText": "Burberry shares have barely recovered since they tumbled following a shock profit warning last week. The company said like for like sales growth was flat in the ten weeks to 8 September with a slowdown towards the end of that period. But after a meeting with the company, analysts at Credit Suisse reckon there is still long term value in the luxury goods group's shares and maintained their outperform rating, albeit with a reduced target price of \u00a314, down from \u00a316.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne's debt reduction plans took another blow last month as government borrowing hit its highest on record for any August. Public sector net borrowing excluding financial sector interventions \u2013 the government's preferred measure \u2013 widened to \u00a314.41bn from \u00a314.37bn in August 2011 \u2013 and is now the largest it has been since records began in 1993. That takes the deficit for the tax year to date to \u00a331bn. But, stripping out the transfer of Royal Mail pension assets, the deficit has actually widened 22% to \u00a359bn so far this year. George Buckley at Deutsche Bank said Friday's public finance data suggested the government will miss its targets by about \u00a310bn or \u00a320bn. The 22% increase in the deficit between April and August compares with the government's target of reducing the deficit by 4.6% this year. With the UK mired in recession, benefit payments rose while key sources of income \u2013 such as corporation tax \u2013 fell. The public finances data show corporation tax since April was 10% lower than the same period last year. Overall tax receipts for the tax year to date inched up 0.4%, just a fraction of the 3.9% rise the Office for Budget Responsibility is forecasting for the year. The figures leave the Treasury's calculations in tatters and could force Osborne into an embarrassing climbdown at his autumn statement in December. Chris Leslie MP, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, claimed Osborne was now borrowing more than planned because of his failed economic plans. \"With the longest double-dip recession since the second world war, the government has borrowed over \u00a310bn more in the first five months of this year than in the same period in 2011. \"And this is billions more in borrowing not to invest in the jobs of the future, but simply to pay for the mounting costs of economic failure as the double-dip recession leads to higher benefit bills and lower tax revenues.\" Weak growth blamed The chancellor said in his first budget that the market should judge his commitment to stronger public finances by his success in eliminating the structural deficit over five years, and cutting national debt as a proportion of GDP by the 2015/2016 financial year. But the government has since been forced to extend its austerity programme by another two years and David Cameron has warned that it could continue until 2020. Osborne is now faced with the choice of imposing further cuts or scrapping his targets. Most economists believe more cuts or tax rises would damage the economy further. The Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, seemed to prepare the ground for the dreadful public finances data on Thursday night, when he endorsed tearing up the government's debt-reduction goal. King said in an interview on Channel 4 that it would be acceptable for the chancellor to miss his targets if the economy continued to grow slowly. In one bit of good news, the ONS revised down last year's public sector net borrowing by \u00a37bn. The Treasury latched onto this point and the exchequer secretary, David Gauke, said: \"This is further evidence that we are dealing with our debts and getting the deficit down.\" Chris Williamson of Markit said the ballooning deficit was clearly linked to disappointing economic growth, which he blames on a combination of spending cuts and falling demand from the eurozone. \"It seems likely that the disappointing economic performance this year is due to a combination of factors, with the eurozone crisis hitting export performance while austerity has subdued domestic demand. This has been clearly evident from consumer confidence surveys, which showed household sentiment falling sharply after austerity measures were first introduced by the coalition and remaining subdued ever since.\"",

      "body": "<p>Recent indications of a weakening global economy have led many people to wonder how pervasive poor economic performance will be in the coming years. Are we facing a long global slump, or possibly even a depression?</p> <p>A fundamental problem in forecasting nowadays is that the ultimate causes of the slowdown are really psychological and sociological, and relate to fluctuating confidence and changing \"animal spirits,\" about which George Akerlof and I have written. We argue that such shifts reflect changing stories, epidemics of new narratives, and associated views of the world, which are difficult to quantify.</p> <p>In fact, most professional economists do not seem overly glum about the global economy's prospects. For example, on 6 September, the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oecd.org%2Feco%2Feconomicoutlookanalysisandforecasts%2FInterimassessmentpresentation6September2012.pdf&amp;ei=mhRcUJSiKoyzhAfjioDwBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6AktJh-E76M-E7LMLhyhTniOecg&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">OECD issued an interim assessment on the near-term global outlook, written by Pier Carlo Padoan</a>, that blandly reports \"significant risks\" on the horizon \u2013 the language of uncertainty itself.</p> <p>The problem is that the statistical models that comprise economists' toolkit are best applied in normal times, so economists naturally like to describe the situation as normal. If the current slowdown is typical of other slowdowns in recent decades, then we can predict the same kind of recovery.</p> <p>For example, in a paper presented last spring at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oecd.org%2Feco%2Feconomicoutlookanalysisandforecasts%2FInterimassessmentpresentation6September2012.pdf&amp;ei=mhRcUJSiKoyzhAfjioDwBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6AktJh-E76M-E7LMLhyhTniOecg&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">James Stock of Harvard University and Mark Watson of Princeton University unveiled a new \"dynamic factor model,\"</a> estimated using data from 1959 to 2011. Having thus excluded the Great Depression, they claimed that the recent slowdown in the US is basically no different from other recent slowdowns, except larger.</p> <p>Their model reduces the sources of all recessions to just six shocks \u2013 \"oil, monetary policy, productivity, uncertainty, liquidity/financial risk, and fiscal policy\" \u2013 and explains most of the post-2007 downturn in terms of just two of these factors: \"uncertainty\" and \"liquidity/financial risk.\" But, even if we accept that conclusion, we are left to wonder what caused large shocks to \"uncertainty\" and to \"liquidity/financial risk\" in recent years, and how reliably such shocks can be predicted.</p> <p>When one considers the evidence about external economic shocks over the past year or two, what emerges are stories whose precise significance is unknowable. We only know that most of us have heard them many times.</p> <p>Foremost among those stories is the European financial crisis, which is talked about everywhere around the globe. The OECD's interim assessment called it \"the most important risk for the global economy\". That may seem unlikely: Why should the European crisis be so important elsewhere?</p> <p>Part of the reason, of course, is the rise of global trade and financial markets. But connections between countries do not occur solely through the direct impact of market prices. Interacting public psychology is likely to play a role as well.</p> <p>This brings us to the importance of stories \u2013 and very far from the kind of statistical analysis exemplified by Stock and Watson. Psychologists have stressed that there is a narrative basis to human thinking: people remember \u2013 and are motivated by \u2013 stories, particularly human-interest stories about real people. Popular stories tend to take on moral dimensions, leading people to imagine that bad outcomes reflect some kind of loss of moral resolve.</p> <p>The European crisis began with a Greek meltdown story, and it appears that the entire global economy is threatened by events in a country of only 11 million people. But the economic importance of stories bears no close relation to their monetary value (which can be measured only after the fact, if at all). It depends, instead, on their story value.</p> <p>The Greek crisis story began in 2008 with reports of widespread protests and strikes when the government proposed raising the retirement age to address a pension funding shortfall. Reports began to appear in global news media portraying an excessive sense of entitlement, with Greeks taking to the streets in protest, even though the increase was modest (for example, women with children or in hazardous jobs would be able to retire with full benefits at just 55, up from 50).</p> <p>That story might have invited some gossip outside of Greece, but it gained little purchase on international attention until the end of 2009, when the market for Greek debt started to become increasingly unsettled, with rising interest rates causing further problems for the government.

      "bodyText": "Recent indications of a weakening global economy have led many people to wonder how pervasive poor economic performance will be in the coming years. Are we facing a long global slump, or possibly even a depression? A fundamental problem in forecasting nowadays is that the ultimate causes of the slowdown are really psychological and sociological, and relate to fluctuating confidence and changing \"animal spirits,\" about which George Akerlof and I have written. We argue that such shifts reflect changing stories, epidemics of new narratives, and associated views of the world, which are difficult to quantify. In fact, most professional economists do not seem overly glum about the global economy's prospects. For example, on 6 September, the OECD issued an interim assessment on the near-term global outlook, written by Pier Carlo Padoan, that blandly reports \"significant risks\" on the horizon \u2013 the language of uncertainty itself. The problem is that the statistical models that comprise economists' toolkit are best applied in normal times, so economists naturally like to describe the situation as normal. If the current slowdown is typical of other slowdowns in recent decades, then we can predict the same kind of recovery. For example, in a paper presented last spring at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, James Stock of Harvard University and Mark Watson of Princeton University unveiled a new \"dynamic factor model,\" estimated using data from 1959 to 2011. Having thus excluded the Great Depression, they claimed that the recent slowdown in the US is basically no different from other recent slowdowns, except larger. Their model reduces the sources of all recessions to just six shocks \u2013 \"oil, monetary policy, productivity, uncertainty, liquidity/financial risk, and fiscal policy\" \u2013 and explains most of the post-2007 downturn in terms of just two of these factors: \"uncertainty\" and \"liquidity/financial risk.\" But, even if we accept that conclusion, we are left to wonder what caused large shocks to \"uncertainty\" and to \"liquidity/financial risk\" in recent years, and how reliably such shocks can be predicted. When one considers the evidence about external economic shocks over the past year or two, what emerges are stories whose precise significance is unknowable. We only know that most of us have heard them many times. Foremost among those stories is the European financial crisis, which is talked about everywhere around the globe. The OECD's interim assessment called it \"the most important risk for the global economy\". That may seem unlikely: Why should the European crisis be so important elsewhere? Part of the reason, of course, is the rise of global trade and financial markets. But connections between countries do not occur solely through the direct impact of market prices. Interacting public psychology is likely to play a role as well. This brings us to the importance of stories \u2013 and very far from the kind of statistical analysis exemplified by Stock and Watson. Psychologists have stressed that there is a narrative basis to human thinking: people remember \u2013 and are motivated by \u2013 stories, particularly human-interest stories about real people. Popular stories tend to take on moral dimensions, leading people to imagine that bad outcomes reflect some kind of loss of moral resolve. The European crisis began with a Greek meltdown story, and it appears that the entire global economy is threatened by events in a country of only 11 million people. But the economic importance of stories bears no close relation to their monetary value (which can be measured only after the fact, if at all). It depends, instead, on their story value. The Greek crisis story began in 2008 with reports of widespread protests and strikes when the government proposed raising the retirement age to address a pension funding shortfall. Reports began to appear in global news media portraying an excessive sense of entitlement, with Greeks taking to the streets in protest, even though the increase was modest (for example, women with children or in hazardous jobs would be able to retire with full benefits at just 55, up from 50). That story might have invited some gossip outside of Greece, but it gained little purchase on international attention until the end of 2009, when the market for Greek debt started to become increasingly unsettled, with rising interest rates causing further problems for the government. This augmented news reports about Greek profligacy, and thus closed a negative feedback loop by attracting intensifying public interest, which eventually fuelled crises in other European countries. Like a YouTube video, the Greek story went viral. One might object that most people outside of Europe surely were not following the European crisis closely, and the least informed have not even heard of it. But opinion leaders, and friends and relatives of the least informed in each country, were following it, and their influence can create an atmosphere that makes everyone less willing to spend. The Greek story seems connected in many people's minds with the stories of the real-estate and stock-market bubbles that preceded the crisis in 2007. These asset bubbles were inflated by lax lending standards and an excessive willingness to borrow, which seemed similar to the Greek government's willingness to take on debt to pay lavish pensions. Thus, people saw the Greek crisis not just as a metaphor, but also as a morality tale. The natural consequence was to support government austerity programmes, which can only make the situation worse. The European story is with us now, all over the world, so vivid that, even if the euro crisis appears to be resolved satisfactorily, it will not be forgotten until some new story diverts public attention. Then as now, we will not be able to understand the world economic outlook fully without considering the story on people's minds. \u00a9 Project Syndicate 1995\u20132012",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Conservative party treasurer is calling for a major change in tax laws so that Britain can compete with offshore havens. Lord Fink, the Tory donor and hedge fund chief, disclosed in an interview that he had lobbied George Osborne for a cut in taxes on invisible earnings so that he and other hedge funders no longer feel obliged to set up companies in places such as the Cayman Islands. His comments came as a Guardian investigation reveals that 68 MPs and peers, who can influence Britain's tax laws, are either directors or non-executive directors of firms linked to tax havens. The findings show how widespread the use of offshore jurisdictions has become in British business life \u2013 even by companies which have lawmakers and major public figures on their boards. Politicians and companies have claimed that many of the offshore firms are established in these jurisdictions for operational business functions or administrative reasons rather than to secure a lower tax liability. Fink, who is a director of three firms which have subsidiaries or a parent company in the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and Guernsey, said: \"I don't see why the UK should not compete for jobs that at present are going to the Cayman Islands. I lobbied George Osborne when the Tories were in opposition. I have long felt that the British government loses jobs to tax havens by allowing the Revenue to have these rather archaic rules.\" The new business minister, Michael Fallon, the former trade secretary Peter Lilley and the backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg are among six Tory MPs who are listed as officers of firms established in, or linked to, jurisdictions known for opaque practices and low tax. Sixty-two peers including the Tory peer and composer Lord Lloyd-Webber, the former Lib Dem business spokesman Lord Razzall and Labour's Lord Carter of Coles are also involved with businesses that have offshore connections. Lloyd-Webber's company said its offshore subsidiary was dormant. Razzall said his company, which offers services including tax mitigation to clients, had not indulged in aggressive avoidance. Lord Carter has not responded. Of the 68 parliamentarians who have links to offshore havens, 27 are Tories, 17 are Labour peers, three are Lib Dem peers and another 21 are either crossbench or non-affiliated peers. The Guardian examined the registers of MPs' and lords' interests to identify companies where they are registered as directors or non-executive directors. This information was cross-referenced with accounts or other financial records to find out if the companies were registered or had a parent company or subsidiary in a tax haven. Revenue &amp; Customs does not provide a list of tax havens. The Guardian has drawn upon a list of 35 jurisdictions identified for their secrecy and low tax compiled for the US Congress in 2009. The findings follow a national debate over the use of tax loopholes, prompted by claims from Osborne and David Cameron that they will clamp down on loopholes that allow \"morally repugnant\", albeit legal, aggressive tax avoidance. Anger at tax avoidance was heightened after revelations about the tax affairs of celebrities including the comedian Jimmy Carr. Legal tax avoidance represents nearly 14% of the UK tax gap, according to the Treasury. Research commissioned by the campaign group Tax Justice Network has found that at least \u00a313tn of wealth has been hidden offshore. Of the parliamentarians identified, most claimed the offshore firms were not being used for tax or corporate purposes. Many of the politicians and companies also said they made large tax contributions in the UK. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, which is conducting an inquiry into tax loopholes, said the findings were worrying because of the lack of transparency in offshore havens. \"As MPs, these individuals should be voting for proper transparency so we can see that these companies pay proper tax in the UK. The number of peers involved is bad enough. But to find that Tory MPs are setting themselves up as non-executives on companies that are connected to these places where there is such a lack of scrutiny and probity is just reprehensible and beyond belief,\" she said. Fallon was until two weeks ago a non-executive director of Tullett Prebon, the international money brokers. He stepped down when he took his post in the reshuffle. In 2008, he criticised Gordon Brown over the nationalisation of Northern Rock after it emerged the bank had a subsidiary in a tax haven. Under Fallon's directorship, for which he was paid \u00a351,000 a year when he left, Tullett also had an offshore operation in Guernsey. Tullett is registered in England, but it owns subsidiaries in secretive, low-tax jurisdictions including the Channel Islands, Switzerland and, until last year, Bermuda. He stood down as chairman of Tullett's remuneration committee in 2009 after an outcry over the company's decision to offer help to move staff to countries with more favourable tax regimes after the announcement of a tax on City bonuses. Fallon said none of Tullett's subsidiaries in Guernsey, Jersey and Switzerland were set up for tax reduction purposes and that the Guernsey and Jersey companies were resident for UK tax. The company said its Swiss arm was serving customers there and that Tullett had achieved HMRC's \"low risk\" status. Rees-Mogg declares his directorship of three separate companies related to Somerset Capital Management LLP on parliament's register of financial interests. However, he says he is not required to declare Somerset Capital Management (Cayman) Ltd (SCMC), which he also controls with two other directors, because it has no turnover or profit and the UK company receives all its revenue. \"I do not believe people have any obligation to pay more tax than the law requires but SCMC has no tax benefit to me, Somerset Capital Management or to our clients,\" he said. Tony Baldry, the Conservative MP for North Oxfordshire, was awarded a knighthood in the Queen's birthday honours. On a \u00a364,000 salary, he acts as an independent non-executive director at Woburn Energy whose parent company is registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven. He said the company was independent from its parent, Cetus, and the offshore links were \"entirely as a consequence of the ownership structure of Cetus prior to its investment in Woburn\". Peter Lilley was recently appointed non-executive chairman of Tethys Petroleum, which has interests in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The company is registered in the Cayman Islands. He said: \"Tethys would not have a UK tax liability if it migrated to the UK since, as an exploration company, it reinvests its revenues in exploration, which extinguishes any tax liability under UK tax law. It of course pays taxes, royalties and production share to local governments in countries where it operates.\" The Tory former defence minister Nicholas Soames is chairman of private security contractor Aegis, owned by a Swiss holding company and with subsidiaries in the British Virgin Islands. Soames said: \"All trading profits of the group are either paid to or taxed as part of Aegis Defence Services Ltd's own activities and that company is fully taxable in the UK.\" Jonathan Evans, MP for Cardiff North, is non-executive chairman of Phoenix Life Ltd. Accounts from Companies House show Phoenix's parent company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and resident in Jersey. Evans did not respond to questions about the company. Comments will be turned on at 8am on 21 September 2012 \u2022 This article was amended on 21 September 2012 because the original said Michael Fallon moved from chairman to non-executive director of Tullett Prebon in 2009. Fallon has never been the company's chairman; the post he stood down from in 2009 was the chairmanship of its remuneration committee.",
