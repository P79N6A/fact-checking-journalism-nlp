      "bodyText": "Retailers must do more to stamp out human rights abuses by their suppliers after a Guardian investigation found prawns sold in the UK were produced with the help of slaves, ministers are warning. Jenny Willott, the consumer affairs minister, said retailers must have a policy on sourcing ethical products, as ignoring the consumers' concerns about forced labour and dangerous working conditions could risk putting them out of business. In the first ministerial intervention since the expos\u00e9 two weeks ago, Willott ordered the British Retail Consortium (BRC) to produce new guidance on urgent steps its members must take to improve transparency about human rights abuses linked to food, drink, clothing and other products. Karen Bradley, Home Office minister for modern slavery, also called on firms to stop working with suppliers with links to forced labour, saying they have a \"social responsibility to ensure that those that they do business with are not involved in the exploitation of others\". In a separate development, Foreign Office minister Lady Warsi said the coalition will look to raise concerns with Thailand about the use of slaves to produce prawns sold in UK stores. The senior Conservative acknowledged that the UK's influence is \"limited\" but said the government will air the issue in diplomatic discussions and expects Thailand to investigate. Their responses are far stronger than the government's initial reaction to the revelations. Asked about the allegations at the time, David Cameron's official spokesman said consumers had to choose whether to eat seafood produced through slavery. \"Consumer standards and retail standards and social responsibility is often driven by consumers and rightly so,\" he said. The Guardian found that slaves involved in prawn production are being forced to work in Thailand for no pay for years at a time, under threat of extreme violence. It found prawns farmed with the help of slavery are sold in leading global supermarkets including Tesco, Walmart, Costco and Carrefour, among others. At the time UK retailers involved condemned slavery and human trafficking but would not depart from pre-prepared statements. UK ministers have until now been silent on the subject, but the US state department last week relegated Thailand to the lowest rank in its Trafficking in Persons (TiP) report \u2013 meaning it is now ranked no better than North Korea, Iran or Saudi Arabia in the way it protects workers from abuse. In a strongly-worded letter to the BRC, due to be sent on Wednesday, Willott highlighted the findings of the Guardian probe, writing: \"Following the anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster earlier this year, we saw another high profile case involving oppressive labour practices in the production of prawns in Thailand. \"Consumers are increasingly aware of these issues and concerned about them. As a result of this public interest, we have an opportunity to highlight those companies taking positive action and encourage others to make a real difference.\" Willott's letter stops short of Labour's demands for the coalition to force firms to declare any links to suppliers with suspected links to slavery in their annual reports. But it makes clear retailers should be doing more to put transparency about supply chains at the heart of their business. She said: \"All companies, including those in the retail sector, need to make sure they are giving the right information to their customers and are being open about their supply chains. Shoppers more than ever want to know how what they buy got from the factory to the shelf. They are also not afraid to speak up or vote with their feet if they think those producing their goods are being abused or exploited. \"Businesses must be aware that ethical sourcing and transparency about their supply chains must be part of their policy, not an add-on. They ignore consumer concerns at their peril and even run the risk of going out of business.\" Willott singled out high street giant Marks &amp; Spencer for its long-standing and high profile \"Plan A\" ethical policy and the fashion retailer H&amp;M for its clarity on ethical sourcing and information about its clothing ranges. The BRC's guidance \u2013 due to be published in the autumn \u2013 will mention existing good practice such as human rights reporting (which some UK-based firms already routinely do), information on ethical auditing and membership of various accreditation schemes such as the Ethical Trading Initiative. But the government will say on Wednesday that it wants companies to be doing much more \u2013 asking the BRC to take the lead \u2013 in the face of the results of a new poll showing that shoppers are taking the issue of ethical practices very seriously in their shopping habits. Findings from an Ipsos Mori poll published by the Department for Business show that more than four in five (83%) shoppers say the ethical standards of retailers matter a great deal to them. Two in five (39%) admit their shopping decisions are influenced by this even given the squeeze on household incomes. The same proportion (38%) say they are willing to spend more on a product if a company acts in an ethical way. Environmental campaigners and human rights groups called the revelations of slavery in the prawn supply chain a wake-up call for consumers and urged shoppers to boycott cheap Thai prawns and other imported seafood if supermarkets cannot guarantee the goods have been sourced ethically.",

On the two votes on pay, 23% voted against the remuneration report which outlines last year's pay deals, while 32% voted against the remuneration policy which sets out the pay deals for the next three years. The unrest takes place as the company, which owns the Citigate, Grayling, Huntsworth Health and Red agencies, appoints a new chairman \u2013 Lord Myners \u2013 to replace the former Goldman Sachs banker Richard Sharp. Myners recently stepped down from the board of the troubled Co-operative Group and has a reputation for corporate governance reform. He was chairman of Guardian Media Group until he joined the Labour government as City minister during the 2008 banking crisis. The annual report shows that Chadlington received \u00a31m last year and is entitled to an automatic pay rise in line with inflation. It has been reported that Sharp and another non-executive director, Joe McHale, did not stand for re-election to the board because of tensions with Chadlington. The largest shareholder in Huntsworth is Chinese investor BlueFocus, which has a 20% stake.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has been accused by MPs of behaving like an unreliable boyfriend, giving mixed messages on when the first rise in interest rates is likely. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, appeared to play down the case for an early rate rise when questioned by the Commons Treasury select committee yesterday, despite earlier leading markets to believe a hike was possible before the end of 2014. Pat McFadden, Labour MP and a member of the select committee, said there had been \"a lot of different signals\" over the past year about when rates might rise, which was confusing for consumers and businesses. \"We've had a signal that rates probably wouldn't rise until 2016, we then had a market expectation that rates would go up in 2015, we then got a speech saying that might be an underestimation. It strikes me the Bank is behaving a bit like an unreliable boyfriend. One day hot, one day cold, and the people on the other side of the message are left not knowing where they stand.\" Andrew Tyrie, the committee's chairman, said that since Carney arrived at the Bank almost a year ago, there had been \"quite a lot of guidance, not all of it pointing in the same direction\". Under pressure to explain the apparent confusion surrounding the Bank's stance on rates, Carney insisted the monetary policy committee (MPC) had been consistent in approach, and said the data would dictate the timing of the first rate rise. However, he said that weaker than expected wage growth suggested there was still considerable a significant amount of slack in the economy to be used up before a rise would be necessary. \"Taken in isolation, the developments on the wage front suggest to me that there has been more spare capacity in the labour market than we previously had thought,\" he said, adding that low wage growth was balanced against the possibility that growth would be stronger than expected in the second half of the year. The pound fell to $1.697, as investors interpreted the comments as a signal that an early rate rise was less likely. Carney said that the exact timing of the first rise in rates \u2013 which has been on hold at 0.5% since March 2009 \u2013 would be driven by the data. He said that the most important point was not the timing but that increases in the cost of borrowing would be \"limited and gradual\". Markets have been confused by Carney's guidance on rates. At the May inflation report, Carney said the first rise was most likely to be in the second quarter of 2015. A month later, he surprised the City by warning in his Mansion House speech that a rise \"could happen sooner than markets currently expect\". Carney suggested that his comments had been designed to correct market expectations that there was only a 15% chance of a rate increase before the end of 2014. He told the TSC that as a governor of a G7 central bank for the past seven years \u2013 in Canada and then the UK \u2013 he was well aware that his speech would move markets. \"We'd like to see the market adjust to the data. Just as our opinions are updating, [markets] should adjust to the data. A short-term market for expectations of Bank rate that moves around with the data is a healthy thing.\" Sam Hill, a senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets, said that overall Carney's message at the TSC was a more balanced assessment than expected, but the risks of an early rate hike remain. Meanwhile, the Institute of Directors said it was breaking with the consensus among business organisations and calling for the first rise in interest rates this autumn. James Sproule, the IoD's chief economist, said: \"As the recovery takes hold it will soon be the time to start taking interest rates to a level where monetary policy can once again become an effective economic lever. \"Ideally, this rise in interest rates will be achieved gradually, starting in the autumn of 2014, with an aim of reaching a more normal level, perhaps 3%, by autumn 2015.\"",

      "body": "<p>Key investors have been told to press Britain's leading companies to explain how they would cope with the departure of their chief executive or other senior boardroom figures.</p> <p>The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) has recommended that its members, who oversee about \u00a3900bn of investments, check boards' leadership and succession plans, especially at complicated companies with long-serving chief executives.</p> <p>The call came as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/24/carpetright-losses-widen-european-woes\" title=\"\">Lord Harris</a>, the founder of Carpetright, said he would stay on as chairman of the struggling retailer until a successor was found, reversing his earlier plan to step down in September.</p> <p>Leadership questions are also hanging over about 10% of companies in the FTSE 100, including some of its biggest names, such as British Gas owner Centrica, Prudential and Tesco. The NAPF has already highlighted such succession questions at Centrica and BG Group, the oil explorer.</p> <p>Centrica has been hit by a series of departures, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/11/centrica-chief-sam-laidlaw-energy-prices\" title=\"\">chief executive Sam Laidlaw, who is set to leave by the end of the year</a>. BG has been looking for a new boss since Chris Finlayson left in April after just over a year in the job.</p> <p>Will Pomroy, policy lead on stewardship and corporate governance at the NAPF, said: \"With many companies becoming ever more global and complex, management succession is a primary shareholder risk in a number of circumstances.</p> <p>\"The development of detailed succession plans, including an internal pipeline of talent, coupled with strong independent boards is vital in ensuring smooth transition. There is an increasing desire for greater reassurance to be provided via transparent reporting and open dialogue.\"</p> <p>Other companies on investors' lists include Prudential, Britain's biggest insurer by market value, and WPP, the world's biggest advertising company. Tidjane Thiam, Prudential's chief executive, has been in the job for more than five years, which is roughly the average tenure for a top chief executive.</p> <p>Thiam's career has spanned politics and business and in 2012 he turned down the chance to run the private sector arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has said she intends to serve out her term until 2016 but Thiam is seen as a potential replacement. He is also in demand on the international business circuit after shaking off a rocky start to oversee rapid growth at Prudential's Asian business.</p> <p>A fund manager with a large investment in Pru said: \"I suspect it [the IMF] is probably not imminent now but I don't think he will be short of offers in the commercial world, either. That is why this [succession planning] has got to be kept under review. I think it would be good practice for all industries but it would be a requirement in the financial industry.\"</p> <p>A Prudential spokesman declined to comment.</p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell has been the boss of WPP since 1985, building the company almost from scratch through a series of acquisitions. There is no sign of Sorrell, who is 70 next year, resigning.

      "bodyText": "Key investors have been told to press Britain's leading companies to explain how they would cope with the departure of their chief executive or other senior boardroom figures. The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) has recommended that its members, who oversee about \u00a3900bn of investments, check boards' leadership and succession plans, especially at complicated companies with long-serving chief executives. The call came as Lord Harris, the founder of Carpetright, said he would stay on as chairman of the struggling retailer until a successor was found, reversing his earlier plan to step down in September. Leadership questions are also hanging over about 10% of companies in the FTSE 100, including some of its biggest names, such as British Gas owner Centrica, Prudential and Tesco. The NAPF has already highlighted such succession questions at Centrica and BG Group, the oil explorer. Centrica has been hit by a series of departures, including chief executive Sam Laidlaw, who is set to leave by the end of the year. BG has been looking for a new boss since Chris Finlayson left in April after just over a year in the job. Will Pomroy, policy lead on stewardship and corporate governance at the NAPF, said: \"With many companies becoming ever more global and complex, management succession is a primary shareholder risk in a number of circumstances. \"The development of detailed succession plans, including an internal pipeline of talent, coupled with strong independent boards is vital in ensuring smooth transition. There is an increasing desire for greater reassurance to be provided via transparent reporting and open dialogue.\" Other companies on investors' lists include Prudential, Britain's biggest insurer by market value, and WPP, the world's biggest advertising company. Tidjane Thiam, Prudential's chief executive, has been in the job for more than five years, which is roughly the average tenure for a top chief executive. Thiam's career has spanned politics and business and in 2012 he turned down the chance to run the private sector arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has said she intends to serve out her term until 2016 but Thiam is seen as a potential replacement. He is also in demand on the international business circuit after shaking off a rocky start to oversee rapid growth at Prudential's Asian business. A fund manager with a large investment in Pru said: \"I suspect it [the IMF] is probably not imminent now but I don't think he will be short of offers in the commercial world, either. That is why this [succession planning] has got to be kept under review. I think it would be good practice for all industries but it would be a requirement in the financial industry.\" A Prudential spokesman declined to comment. Sir Martin Sorrell has been the boss of WPP since 1985, building the company almost from scratch through a series of acquisitions. There is no sign of Sorrell, who is 70 next year, resigning. But with WPP still doing multiple deals, investors are concerned a successor could struggle to run the company, even though that will not stop some voicing criticism over Sorrell's pay packet at its annual meeting on Wednesday. WPP's annual report said it reviewed 100 of its top people last year as part of its succession planning. Shareholders in Standard Chartered question whether the bank is prepared for when Peter Sands stands down. Richard Meddings, the finance director and long-time heir apparent, leaves at the end of this month. In the struggling grocery sector, Morrisons chairman, Sir Ian Gibson, has said he will leave within a year, raising questions over the future of his chief executive Dalton Philips. Philip Clarke at Tesco faces questions about his future after what some investors think was a badly handled passing of responsibility from Sir Terry Leahy. Marks &amp; Spencer's Marc Bolland needs his three years of heavy investment to start showing returns. Tim O'Toole, the chief executive of FirstGroup, is also under pressure after John McFarlane, his new chairman, criticised the transport company's past strategy. Investors are wrestling with demands from Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, to be paid a multimillion-pound bonus. Ashley is deputy chairman of the retailer but he is behind its strategy, and the board has indicated it needs to pay him more to keep him. Lack of leadership planning can cause chaos. HSBC erupted into civil war in 2010 when the board refused to promote Michael Geoghegan from chief executive to chairman. Shareholders are applying greater scrutiny after what some see as questionable decisions in recent handovers when long-serving chief executives have stood down. At Burberry, Christopher Bailey, the chief creative officer, took over as chief executive last month with no previous boardroom experience. He replaced Angela Ahrendts, who had been in place for eight years. Experian, the credit checking company, went against governance guidelines by deciding to elevate Don Robert to chairman after more than seven years as chief executive. Robert will take over next month from Sir John Peace. Shareholders were unhappy that Peace was the chairman of Experian, Standard Chartered and Burberry. The NAPF wants more long-term thinking at companies so that departing bosses do not leave their replacements with problems that should have been addressed before. Clarke's defenders say he has had to deal with Sir Terry's legacy of neglecting Tesco's UK business while expanding abroad. Philips at Morrisons has refused to blame his predecessor, M&amp;S's Bolland, but has said Morrisons had no online business or convenience stores when he joined. Bolland has claimed that investment in M&amp;S's stores and online operation was long overdue when he replaced Sir Stuart Rose. Pomroy said: \"As recent examples have demonstrated, the impact of management decisions often come to light post-departure. Ensuring executives are focused on creating a sustainable legacy is vital.\"",

Or at least</p> <p>Louise explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The BofE has bought \u00a3375bn of gilts and so is owed that amount by the government. But the BofE now owes the banking system an additional \u00a3275bn. So net net, the bank's balance sheet has only expanded \u00a3100bn. The maturity has changed in that it <strong>owns</strong> longer dated gilts but <strong>owes</strong> overnight money to banks. But the BofE can probably ignore this. </p> <p>This argument has the added benefit is that it is quite complex and so will be difficult to explain. So the British public may just ignore it. The Bank of England has come up with a reason to not reverse QE, not sell the \u00a3375bn of gilts back to the market. And its critics will point out that this is monetising debt. And so it becomes a complicated argument of semantics which most of the population will not bother to try and understand.

      "bodyText": "PS: a former MPC member responds.... America's former central bank chief, Alan Greenspan, famously joked that: \"If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\" It sometimes feels like Mark Carney has given Greenspan's wisdom a twist -- saying something clearly, then following it with a surprising change of position. So, having sounded unusually hawkish in his Mansion House speech 12 days ago, this time Carney donned his dovish plumage. \u2022 So, the first thing we learned is that wage growth is weaker than the Bank expected, and that makes an early interest rate rise a little less likely. As Carney put it: \"The developments on the wage front suggest to me .... that there has been more spare capacity in the labour market than we previously had thought.\" That point was echoed by the other BoE policymakers, with David Miles in particular saying that there's plenty of slack to mop up. That's why the pound fell against the dollar, to $1.697. \u2022 Forward guidance gets fuzzier by the day. Mark Carney says the Bank wants traders to watch the data and react accordingly. That sounds terribly like what they used to do when Mervyn King was running Threadneedle Street (see Larry Elliott for more) And the key data to watch will relate to productivity, and real wages (ie, whether earnings outpace inflation). \u2022 Carney still expects rate rises to be steady, and gradual. And in three-year's time, they'll still be \"materially\" below 5%, he insisted. This is the key quote: \"As the economy progresses, the time to normalise interest rates is edging closer, it's coming closer. But what is most relevant is that those adjustments will be to a level of interest rates, through a gradual process that is likely to be materially lower than historic averages.\" \"Particularly with respect to the entrepreneurs and business people ... what's most relevant to those individuals, as for households, is not the timing of the first interest rate move but the expected path of interest rates over the medium term.\" \u2022 Unwinding the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme is going to take a long time, and may never be completed. Carney doesn't expect to start selling any gilts until rates are someway north of 1%. And new rules on financial stability mean the BoE have a good (?) excuse to keep some for a long time after that. Monetising the national debt? As Louise Cooper explains, it could all come down to semantics. \u2022 MPs are starting to have fun at Mark Carney's expense. Andrew Tyrie's scepticism over forward guidance is well known, but it was Pat McFadden MP who sparked chortles in the Wilson Room, dubbing the Bank an \"unreliable boyfriend\". McFadden said: \"We've had a lot of different signals...I mean it strikes me that the Bank's sort of behaving like an unreliable boyfriend. \"One day hot, one day cold, and the people on the other side of the message are left not really knowing where they stand.\" A far cry from Mark Carney's billing as \"the outstanding central banker of his generation\" when he was appointed. That's all for today. Thanks. GW. Our economics editor Larry Elliott says the Treasury committee are right to have their doubts about the Bank of England. He writes: As the first anniversary of Carney's arrival at the Bank nears, his main policy initiative \u2013 forward guidance \u2013 lies dead in the water. His testimony before MPs may have been intended to convey the message that nothing has really changed since the publication of the May inflation report, but in truth he has turned the clock back to the days when the MPC's approach was to assume that the future was unknowable and that the interest-rate decision had to be judged afresh each month. So what then is the difference between monetary policy under Mervyn King and monetary policy under Mark Carney? Apart from the bigger salary and the Canadian accent, not a great deal, it would appear. In the sporting metaphors beloved by both men, they take each game as it comes. Ouch. Here's the full piece: MPs are right to be sceptical of Mark Carney's forward guidance Shares are picking up on Wall Street on the back of that decent economic data, Over in America, two pieces of economic data have just added to the growing belief that the US economy is recovering nicely. The US consumer confidence index has hit its highest level since January 2008, jumping from 82.2 last month to 85.2. And the number of new home sales has also hit a six-year high, surging by 18.6% to an annual rate of 504,000 new homes in May. That's the highest level since May 2008, and the biggest monthly rise since January 1992. America's economy does appear to be putting last winter's disruption, which forced its economy into contraction, behind it. The ever-magisterial Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury committee, has now issued a response to today's hearing appearance. And he sounds less than impressed with Mark Carney -- suggesting that the Bank needs to be clearer about when the governor is flying solo, and when he's representing the monetary policy committee: Tyrie says: \u201cIn the space of a few minutes, the Governor confirmed that his remarks on interest rates at the Mansion House both reflected his personal views and commanded the unanimous support of the MPC. \u201cWe have already had two versions of forward guidance, and several further pieces of signalling. \u201cMPC members should be encouraged to give their views. We will need greater clarity, in future, on whether their remarks, including those of the Governor, are made in a personal capacity or on behalf of the MPC.\u201d (those remarks were covered here) Analyst Louise Cooper has provided a handy chart, showing how the Bank of England's balance sheet changed since launching its \u00a3375bn bond-buying quantitative easing programme. QE is shown in red, while the amount of money banks place with the BoE on deposit (on top of the legal minimum) is in blue. It shows that, as the BoE bought gilts from commercial banks with new money, most of the proceeds were then returned to the BoE on deposit. Only \u00a3100bn escaped the banking sector to stimulate the real economy. That feels like an argument against doing QE at all! Especially as the 'stimulus effect' hasn't reached wage packets, and has instead pushed up asset prices. But it's also an argument for not worrying too much about reversing QE, as the \"cumulative balance sheet\" hasn't really changed. Or at least Louise explains: The BofE has bought \u00a3375bn of gilts and so is owed that amount by the government. But the BofE now owes the banking system an additional \u00a3275bn. So net net, the bank's balance sheet has only expanded \u00a3100bn. The maturity has changed in that it owns longer dated gilts but owes overnight money to banks. But the BofE can probably ignore this. This argument has the added benefit is that it is quite complex and so will be difficult to explain. So the British public may just ignore it. The Bank of England has come up with a reason to not reverse QE, not sell the \u00a3375bn of gilts back to the market. And its critics will point out that this is monetising debt. And so it becomes a complicated argument of semantics which most of the population will not bother to try and understand. Perfect politically. Especially with one third of the national debt sitting in the Bank's electronic vaults.... Pat McFadden's joke about the Bank of England acting like an \"unreliable boyfriend\" by changing its guidance on interest rates so often has got plenty of attention. But is it really fair? ITV's Richard Edgar suggests that Mark Carney is a little misunderstood: Sterling took a knock as he spoke, falling 0.3 per cent against the dollar. His words seem to imply rates aren't about to rise imminently after all. Confused? You're not alone. But take heart: Mr Carney thinks we're all missing the point. \"What matters is not the timing but the path of interest rates ... which [we have] indicated will be gradual and limited.\" Or to put it another way, it should be no surprise that the era of record low interest rates is coming to an end but when the rates do rise it will be in little steps. Not so much an unreliable boyfriend as a rather complicated one, perhaps. More here: Is Mark Carney really the 'unreliable boyfriend' of monetary policy? Eimear Daly also warns that the UK recovery could come to a shuddering halt if the Bank of England botches the job and raises rates too fast (here's why) Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says Mark Carney was clearly more dovish than expected, in another u-turn by the governor. \"The Bank of England\u2019s testimony to the Treasury Select Committee left money markets reeling from yet another whipsaw in policy outlook. After suggesting that rate hikes may happen sooner than expected in his Mansion House speech, Carney shocked the market with a far more dovish performance. Today's hearing showed clear confusion within the Bank of England over when it should start raising borrowing costs, she adds: The MPC members grappled to explain the contradiction between robust employment gains and strong nominal growth rates versus weak wages growth and benign inflation. The testimony shows that it is the top officials in the Bank that are the doves, and the rest of the Committee who are hawks. \u201cDespite recognising that the UK economy has a lot more momentum than previously thought, Carney cannot shake the inconsistency of weak wage growth, which he believes proves the existence of spare capacity in the UK economy and justifies later rate rises. Hungary's central bank just followed Turkey's lead, and cut interest rates. It trimmed 10 basis points (0.1%) off base rate, to a new record low of 2.3%. It's time for traders to \"take the stabilisers\" off, reckons RBC Capital Markets. They believe Mark Carney's message today is that investors must recognise that the BoE will respond to data, and follow suit. RBC writes: When the MPs finally got round to asking Governor Carney about the motivation behind his famous comment in the Mansion House speech that the first rate hike \"could happen sooner than markets currently expect\" it became clear that it wasn't because he has already decided that rates will go up before the end of 2014.... Both he and the rest of the Committee feel as though markets haven't been responsive enough to recent stronger data on the economy. For all the critisicms of forward guidance the Governor appears to be feeling the need to remind markets that in the post-threshold guidance world, the formulation of market rate expectations should be more sensitive to volatility in the data than it has been. Chris Williams, CEO of Wealth Horizon, isn't convinced by Mark Carney's claim that the public have embrace the forward guidance: : \u201cDespite its protestations, the Bank of England has significantly overestimated the level of clarity that the market and consumers have on its strategy around interest rates. Williams also questioned whether the UK public can really be expected to focus on the \"medium term\", rather than fixating on when that first rate rise will come: \"The Governor has asked the country to focus on the medium rather than the short term. Yet, markets can expect volatility when rates start to climb and the average mortgage repayment could rise by hundreds of pounds a year. So, understandably, retail investors and homeowners are unlikely to focus on the medium term when even in the short term any rate rise will have a significant impact for them. \"These concerns need to be addressed. We need to ensure clarity of expectations, something that the TSC was asking for, but I'm not sure that is what the country is getting.\" So, did Mark Carney deliver a hawkish appearance, or a dovish one? Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, reckons the governor and colleagues were actually \"pretty balanced\", on the question of when rates might rise. Mr. Carney stressed that the decision on when interest rates will start to rise will be driven by the data over the coming months and stated that he expected market expectations to move in line with the data. He indicated that his Mansion House speech when he said that interest rates \u201ccould happen sooner than markets currently expect\u201d was aimed at correcting market belief that there was only around a 15% probability that interest rates would rise before the end of this year. Mr. Carney observed that the recent very low earnings growth data could be a sign that there was more slack in the labour market than the MPC had previously thought but he balanced this by observing that the economy looks to have more momentum than had been expected. Reaction to the Treasury committee hearing is flooding in. Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart &amp; Co, says that today's session shows that Mark Carney was deliberately sending a signal to the markets in his Mansion House speech (see 10.33am for details) He tells me: I agree, Carney knows what reactions he will get!...A showman &amp; politician: Winter expects that the first rate hike will come in November or December. Breaking away from Mark Carney briefly - Turkey's central bank has just cut one of its interest rates, for the first time since dramatically hiking borrowing costs in January. The bank cited \"an improvement in global liquidity conditions\" as it trimmed its one-week repo rate by 75 basis points to 8.75%. It left the other rates unchanged - despite pressure from the Turkish government to reverse the rate hikes imposed five months. The pound fell back against the US dollar during Mark Carney's testimony, losing about 0.35 of a cent to $1.699. Sterling weakened after Mark Carney suggested (at 9.48am) there is more spare capacity in the economy than the MPC thought, after the latest unemployment data shows weak wage growth. He said: \"The developments on the wage front suggest to me .... that there has been more spare capacity in the labour market than we previously had thought.\" And finally, David Miles tried to play down the speculation over when interest rates might rise -- saying that the chatter about whether the first hikes come in November, or next March, is \"largely noise\". And that's the end of the session - I'll pull together the key points, and reaction, now. Mark Carney has predicted that UK interest rates will still be \"materially\" below 5% in three year's time. The Bank of England governor made the prediction as he defended his forward guidance on interest rates (again). He told the Treasury Committee that the various iterations of forward guidance has helped underpin the recovery, which has been the strongest in the G7. The priority now is to turn \"a successful recovery is turned into a durable and balanced expansion\", says Carney. And looking ahead, he predicted: If you look out to a three-year horizon my personal view is they will still be materially below historical averages, that is materially below the 5% historical average, because there are huge forces that are still operating on this economy. And he goes on to name several forces, including: The weakness of Europe the repair of public balances the \"weight of debt\" within British households and the changes taking place within the UK's financial system after the great recession As Carney puts it: All those factors will influence the medium-term path of interest rates. He was responding after Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, accused the governor of some fluctuating guidance in his 11 months in office. Carney insisted he had been consistent, and helped to deliver the recovery. Carney declines to say whether there's \"a growing housing crisis in London\" -- as the Bank's Financial Policy Committee is announcing its latest decisions on Thursday. But you're a Londoner, governor.... Yes, one of 10 Londoners on the FPC, says Carney, playing his purdah card. But he does then point out that the lack of supply, relative to demand, is a key dynamic in the housing market. MPC member David Miles also argues that the Bank of England might well hold onto some of the gilts it bought via QE during the crisis. That's partly because of new rules that mean the BoE's balance sheet should be higher than before the crisis, Miles says. Hang on, says Stuart Hosie MP. When you launched QE, you told us that it would be temporary, and reversed, so you weren't imply printing new money. Now it sounds like you've changed policy. Is this a policy change, or a pragmatic tweaking? Carney also cited new rules on financial stability which mean commercial banks need to hold more reserves, and thus the Bank of England does too. But if we don't unwind QE fully, it's because of reasons of financial stability, not monetary stimulus, he says..... John Thurso MP also asks about the issue of unwinding the quantitative easing bond-buying programme. He reminds Charlie Bean (or is it Sir Charlie? Bean says he doesn't care really) about a recent speech he gave, warning that there could be 'potholes' on the road to normalisation. Does that mean that the Bank could simply keep all \u00a3375bn of gilts in its vaults forever? (having mopped up a third of the national debt with newly created money) Bean flags up the danger that unwinding QE could potentially mean that commercial banks could become stuffed with gilts, and then forced to ditch them on the market. There's likely to be an increase in volatility as UK monetary policy returns to normal, Carney predicts. Onto the issue of when the Bank might start to unwind its QE programme, under which it bought \u00a3375bn of UK gilts (government bonds). Another crucial challenge facing the BoE as the economy returns to normal. David Ruffley MP points out that Bank recently said that the asset purchase scheme won't be reduced until interest rates have reached a level from where they could be cut. Does that mean over 1%? Carney declines to be too specific, but yes, his personal view is that rates would have to be higher than 1% before QE is unwound. Incidentally -- Toby Nangle, fund manager at City firm Catalyst, has just written a fascinating blog post about the whole issue of QE. He suggests there's an argument that the BoE should sell some long-dated government bonds before raising rates. It's here. Monetary transmission mechanisms \u2013 who cares? (Me actually) A question about the impact of rate rises on mortgages holders. Does Carney agree with the Office for Budget Responsibility, which warned that 24% of Britain's 11 million mortgage holders would have to increase their income, cut their spending or refinance their loan if interest rates rise by 2.5%? Carney cautions that he's not sure that the spread (between the rates that banks borrow and lend) will narrow as interest rates rise. And that could mean that more than 24% of mortgage-holders would be affected. Quote of the Day! Pat McFadden accuses the Bank of acting like an \"unreliable boyfriend\" by changing its message on forward guidance. One day you're hot, the next day you're cold, McFadden says -- not a recipe for a strong relationship. Carney rejects the suggestion he's acting like a rotter. Speak to businesses around the country, and they'll say that they understand that rates will be \"limited and gradual\". And they are likely to peak at \"historically low\" levels. But after years of record low rates, people cannot assume they will be frozen forever. But has forward guidance actually achieved clarity of expectations? Carney claims it has. When he goes around the country, he sees that businesses and households understand his message. And that is that \"the time to normalise interest rates is edging closer\" as the economic recovery progresses, but it will be gradual and only occur when spare capacity has been cut. Pat McFadden MP takes us back to last August - Mark Carney's honeymoon, when he announced forward guidance. Was the MPC unanimously behind him then, in predicting rates wouldn't rise until 2016? Carney says that Martin Weale had reservations (which came out in last year's minutes), and defends forward guidance. With hindsight, in August we were \"more right than most\" in our growth predictions, but we expected productivity to rise more than it did. The welcome consequence is that unemployment rose (as firms took on more staff rather than squeezing more out of their existing staff). But it does mean there is still spare capacity to be mopped up. Sir Charlie Bean gets a curveball -- does he approve of Mark Carney's antics at Mansion House? Bean declines to give a view on whether the speech was advisable - the governor is entitled to act as he sees fit But he does hammer home the point about making the markets change their view -- the MPC was surprised that financial markets didn't appear to fully reflect the 'economic and geopolitical' uncertainties. Jesse Norman MP suggests that market-moving news such as the Mansion House speech ought to occur in a more formal way? (ie, through the MPC minute). Did Carney expect the reaction? Carney says that everything a G7 central bank governor does is potentially market-moving - he learned that in Canada. So what were you trying to do at Mansion House? We wanted the market to adjust to the data, just as we adjust to the data. We were surprised that it hadn't adjusted, Carney says. So you were trying to tighten the markets? A market that moves around based on the data is a healthy thing. So as the data changes, the market path of the likely future path of interest rates should change, Carney explains. In other words - he knew exactly what he was doing. Tyrie asks Ian McCafferty if he was consulted about the Mansion house speech - after all, if did move the markets (just as the World Cup kicked off, too) McCafferty says he was consulted, and that the speech was consistent with the latest data the MPC had examined. How about David Miles? Miles says the speech represented Mark Carney's views, but doesn't express any concerns Onto the Mansion House speech. Andrew Tyrie asks whether the warning that interest rates might rise sooner than expected was the governor's view, or the Monetary Policy Committee's It was my speech, Carney replies, therefore my views. But it was also consistent with the MPC's last meeting, when they expressed surprise that the market weren't pricing in a higher chance of a rate rise this year. John Mann MP pushes the witnesses about wage growth - and questions whether the Bank's data is correct. Charlie Bean says there are signs of above-inflation pay rises in parts of the economy, such as construction, but they're still isolated. Mann then says that employers in HIS constituency of Bassetlaw, in Nottinghamshire, repot that they are agreeing pay rises of 3.6% to 3.7%. That's much higher than the average weekly earnings data. Bean suggests that the difference is partly because private sector firms are offering pay rises higher than in the private sector. Another point regarding rebalancing the UK economy -- David Miles cites Britain's reliance on Europe as an export market as a reason why the recovery was slow; building up our sales to the Middle East, say, will take many years. Steve Baker MP then suggests that the Bank of England should raise interest rates now, if the UK is serious about rebalancing from consumption to investment. Carney doesn't look convinced -- he says rates will rise when the economy is strong enough to merit higher borrowing costs, rather than as a tool to reshape it. Steve Baker MP, the newish boy on the committee, asks Carney whether the recovery is slowed by the fact that neither labour nor capital are homogonous (ie, you can't simply shift them from one part of the economy to another) Carney agrees that it's true, but says there are many challenges in rebalancing the economy. And Charlie Bean agrees that the process of \"creative destruction of capital\" has been less rapid after the last recession because the Bank cut interest rates so low (ie, 'zombie firms have been able to keep operating) How much progress have we made towards rebalancing the UK economy, asks George Mudie? Carney says some progress has been made -- the recovery is less dependent on consumer spending, and there are signs that business investment is on the rise. The recovery is more balanced than before, but the job isn't completed. Mudie moves into the net -- where is the evidence that the UK is actually rebalancing more towards industry? Competitiveness in manufacturing is determined by several factors, Carney says, and the BoE does not have a GDP share target for any section of the economy. He also cautions that the strength of the pound is not, yet, matched by improvements in competitiveness. Brooks Newmark MP asks Carney about the \"acceleration\" in wage growth recently. That's not the case, the governor replies. The Bank \"expects\" real earnings to grow later this year. The pick-up in wages could be about to happen. But there has not been an acceleration in earnings growth yet, Carney insists. Mark Carney spells out the Bank's view of how, and when rates will rise. The timing of the first rate rise will be driven by the data, and the rises will be limited and gradual, he says. Brooks Newmark MP homes in on one worry -- that Britain, with its fast-growing economy, could be heading for a capacity squeeze if there is less slack in the labour market than expected. Carney says the MPC believes there is still spare capacity in the economy, mainly in the labour market, which needs to be absorbed before the Bank starts to normalise interest rates. So could that include people working part time who'd like to shift to work full time? Exactly, Carney replies. There's spare capacity because people want to work more hours. What's the Bank's assessment of the equilibrium level of the unemployment rate? Carney says it could well be lower than previously thought -- perhaps 6% to 6.5%, but then he cites work suggesting it could be as low as 5.5% to 5.75%. The unemployment rate fell to 6.6% in the February-April quarter. Ian McCafferty says it's hard to be too precise about the amount of spare capacity in the UK economy. And David Miles says he believes there is still a \"significant degree\" of spare capacity. Over to Sir Charlie -- who says we must resist \"spurious\" precision in assessing how much slack remains to be mopped up as the economy grows. But he does believe that real wages will pick up later this year as the labour market tightens and growth continues. Carney adds that the weak wage growth needs to be balanced against stronger than expected growth figures. (ie, the economy is expanding faster than we thought, but people aren't feeling it in their pay packets) Andy Love MP asks what the latest labour market figures, showing real wages still falling, means for the state of the economy. Carney says that, if all else is equal, that suggests there's more spare capacity than he thought (but all else is never equal) Onto business... Tyrie asks for Mark Carney's view on the productivity puzzle, as to why the UK economy hasn't recovered more of its lost productivity. The governor says that the productivity gap, compared to the pre-crisis trend, is probably 16 percentage points. About 4 percentage points is down to mis-measurements. Another reason is that R&amp;D isn't treated as investment (but will be soon). The bank is trying to do a better job of capturing how much value is added by the service sector. And Carney says that the drop in North Sea oil and gas output, and the hit taken by the City in the crisis, are also factors. That leaves an unexplained quarter of lost productivity though. But there's a sting in the tail! Tyrie says the committee wants senior people who leave the Bank of England to write a 'valedatory' note, on what they learned at the BoE, and lessons for their successors. Bean says he'd be willing to do that, after an 'air gap' to collect his thoughts. How long? A year, Bean suggests. We can live with that, says Tyrie. Andrew Tyrie starts the session by a tribute to \"Sir Charlie\" Bean, who is leaving the bank this summer. You've been a top-flight public servant for the bank and the country, Tyrie says, blending loyalty and independence. Not always easy. And we're off, in the Wilson Room of Portcullis House. Mark Carney is taking his seat before the Treasury Committee, alongside deputy governor Sir Charles Bean, and MPC members David Miles and Ian McCafferty. Still waiting for the session to begin - often, MPs have a short private meeting before their guests arrive. You can watch the session here, on Parliament Live (right-click to open it in a new tab) So...what might the MPs ask Mark Carney and colleagues? Here's a few ideas: 1) What was he trying to achieve at the Mansion House 12 days ago, when he warned that the first rate rise could come sooner than the markets expect? 2) What changed between May's inflation report, when Carney still appeared dovish, and the Mansion House speech? 3) Could he please define Forward Guidance today - under what conditions could interest rates start to rise? 4) Does the rest of the MPC still support forward guidance? (a question best directed to Charlie Bean, Ian McCafferty and David Miles too) 5) How would conditions in the UK be different if he hadn't pledged to leave interest rates unchanged until the labour market recovered, last August? Everyone loves a counterfactual, right? Just 20 minutes until the start of Mark Carney's testimony in parliament (previewed earlier). Jeremy Cook of World First, the currency firm, reckons that the governor's recent change of tone will not be \"warmly accepted\" by the Treasury committee. It stands to reason that Carney will not want to flip-flop twice in less than a fortnight in his testimony and further bullish chatter on the economy will be needed on the prospects for the UK economy. But Carney could cite last week's sharp drop in inflation as a reason not to raise rates, Cook adds: There is the definite risk that the Governor leans on low inflation and lower wages to try and get him out of hole that he may feel he has dug with his newly hawkish comments The IFO survey of German business confidence has just been released, and it's weaker than expected. The index tracking the business climate fell to 109.7, compared to estimates of 110.3, and down from 110.4 last month. There's also a shake-up at defence group Chemring, as it struggles to cope with government military cutbacks. The ejector seat-maker's CEO has left the company with immediate effect, as it reported that its pre-tax loss widened to \u00a372m in the first half of the year. Shares are down 6.5%. European stock markets are calm this morning, with the main indices up around 0.15% to 0.4%. With little to scare traders today, there's a feeling of summer torpor in the air. UK pharmaceutical firm Shire is one of the biggest risers in London, up 1.1%. Yesterday it announced new revenue targets in an effort to repel a takeover bid from AbbVie. In the currency markets, the pound is flattish at $1.7027 against the US dollar, around its highest level in nearly five years. Mark Carney isn't the only central banker in the news...the head of Germany's Bundesbank has rejected calls from France and Italy for the eurozone's fiscal pact to be watered down. Jens Weidmann warned it would be fatal for the Stability Pact, which forces countries to stick to deficit and debt targets, to be changed. Writing in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, Weidmann said: \"Doubts about the sustainability of government finances could cause massive shocks to the currency union.\" Leaked documents yesterday showed some EU leaders are pushing for the budget rules to be re-interpreted to put more emphasis on economic growth, ahead of a summit this week. In the City, shares in speciality chemicals company Croda have tumbled over 7% after it issued a profit warning today -- and the strong pound has been blamed. Croda, whose producs are used in cosmetics and industrial chemicals, told shareholders that the strength of sterling will hit its profits from overseas. A slowdown in Europe hasn't helped either. Many City economists are eager to hear why Mark Carney suddenly changed his tune on the likely path of interest rates two weeks ago, at Mansion House. The governor's warning that rates could rise sooner than the markets expect sent the pound rattling to its highest level since August 2009, to over $1.702. That change of tune threatens to undermine his 'forward' guidance message (which has already been rebranded once after the unemployment rate fell faster than expected). Brian Hilliard, an economist at Societe Generale, reckons Carney is now \"flip-flopping around\", telling Bloomberg that: \u201cWe get very strong signals from the BOE and they become meaningless a month later.\u201d Bloomberg's reporter Manus Cranny reckons today's session is 'incredibly important', for the credibility of forward guidance. He flags up that the minutes of the Bank's last MPC meeting were 'incredibly hawkish'; revealing that more members are prepared to vote for a rate rise. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the governor will be pushed to explain his \"chameleon-like\" change of view: The likelihood is that Carney will try and balance his remarks about any rate rise being data dependant, and given that inflation is falling and wage growth remains weak it is more likely that the market could well be getting ahead of itself on this one. In any event, whatever happens today, after the events of the last few weeks, the Bank's policy of forward guidance is looking distinctly shambolic. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, business and the eurozone. One main event this morning -- Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before the Treasury committee to answer questions on the latest Inflation Report. And while it's not my place to give the governor any forward guidance, he can probably look forward to a testing inquisition from MPs. They'll be demanding answers on exactly why Carney, after months of guiding down expectations of a rate rise, used his Mansion House speech two weeks ago to warn that they could actually rise sooner than expected. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie hasn't hidden his distain for Carney's policy of pledging that interest rates won't rise until the labour market has improved; committee member Jesse Norman was outright dismissive last week, defining Forward Guidance as: ...a lot of arm waving until the governor tells us when he thinks rates are going to go up or down.\u201d The Bank's forecasting abilities (not always its strongest suit) could also come under scrutiny, now that inflation has hit a fresh five-year low of 1.5%, further from the 2% target. Carney will share the spotlight with deputy governor Charlie Bean, and MPC members David Miles and Ian McCafferty. Miles had been seen as the most dovish member of the committee, but even he is now talking about probably voting for a rate rise before the year is out. What else is afoot? Not a huge amount (!), but we do get the latest IFO survey, which measures the German business climate, at 9am BST. And there's a few gobbets of corporate news around; including Carpetright reporting that pre-tax profits halved last year.

      "bodyText": "Sky has suspended its controversial door-to-door sales operation with immediate effect, with its UK-wide team of 550 \"Sky Walkers\" told they face redundancy. A Guardian investigation in May brought to light numerous claims of mis-selling, with agents themselves blowing the whistle. A Sky spokeswoman said the proposal to end doorstep selling was not connected to customer complaints about its sales team. Sky summoned its agents to a series of meetings around the country at noon on Tuesday to begin an official consultation on axing their jobs. They were told to appoint a representative for each regional team and have been suspended from their roles until the process is complete. The satellite broadcaster decided to bring its sales teams in-house three years ago, following customer complaints about doorstep sales by its contractors. The Sky Walkers were introduced some years ago to help Sky reach its target of 10 million customers by 2010. The company says its decision to move away from doorstep sales predates the complaints, and that it will now rely on web marketing and telesales to attract new customers. A spokeswoman said: \"We've been reviewing the way we sell our products to better suit customer demands. The way customers like to shop is changing, with online becoming more important. In addition, as well as new customers joining Sky, a significant part of our growth now comes from selling additional products to existing customers with whom we already have a relationship. \"As customers choose other ways to buy our products, door-to-door sales are becoming less viable and we're proposing to withdraw from this activity. We'll consult with employees before taking a final decision and will work to find alternative roles for those affected should the proposal go ahead.\" The Sky Walkers were paid a commission worth up to 50% of salary to persuade households to switch TV and broadband providers or persuade existing ones to extend their contracts and buy more products. But there have been complaints that agents lied about broadband speeds and download limits, and promised services that were not part of their packages. A group of concerned Sky Walkers decided to blow the whistle, agreeing to be interviewed on video by the Guardian about sharp practices. Sky disputed the whistleblowers' claims, arguing it had rigorous training and management systems in place. The agents, some of whom have worked for Sky for several years, said pressure to sell had increased sharply in recent months. One agent working in the Midlands said: \"I have been in sales nearly 20 years and I have never been under this much pressure before. We get constant phone calls and text messages. Three times a day we have to tell managers the numbers of doors that we have knocked on, the number of people spoken to and the sales we have made. I'm looking for another job with less money and less pressure.\" With managers' bonuses reliant on their teams hitting sales targets, the agent from the Midlands said staff who did not make seven sales a week were told to work on Saturdays, even though the official sales target was six new customers. Agents also claimed that they were encouraged to target the elderly and young unemployed parents on the grounds that they were an \"easy sell\". It is understood Sky will in future rely on other forms of selling, including online marketing and telesales, to sign up new customers. The company employs 25,000 people and is growing, having added 1000 staff in the last 12 months.",

      "bodyText": "It's hard to fault Andrew Tyrie's take on Mark Carney's attempts over the past six weeks to explain the Bank of England's approach to interest-rate increases. We've had quite a lot of guidance, the chairman of the Commons Treasury committee said drily, not all of it consistent. Predictably, the governor insisted that there had been no flip-flopping. Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee had been consistent in its approach. Consistent? Really? Are we talking about the same Bank? Yes, we are. The one that used its May inflation report to point out that there was spare capacity in the economy that needed to be used up before borrowing costs were raised. The one that since Carney's Mansion House speech just 29 days later has been sending out the message that rates might go up sooner than the financial markets think. And the one, judging by Carney's evidence to the Treasury committee, that is now back to pointing out how nugatory real earnings growth is a sign of slack in the labour market. What is clear is that Carney and his fellow MPC members have left the City entirely baffled. What's also clear is that what happens to official interest rates is now entirely dependent on the incoming economic data. A weak set of inflation numbers will see expectations of a rate rise diminish; a strong purchasing managers' index will see odds on an early increase shorten. This is a recipe for volatility, precisely the opposite of the Bank's avowed policy. Indeed, as the first anniversary of Carney's arrival at the Bank nears, his main policy initiative \u2013 forward guidance \u2013 lies dead in the water. His testimony before MPs may have been intended to convey the message that nothing has really changed since the publication of the May inflation report, but in truth he has turned the clock back to the days when the MPC's approach was to assume that the future was unknowable and that the interest-rate decision had to be judged afresh each month. So what then is the difference between monetary policy under Mervyn King and monetary policy under Mark Carney? Apart from the bigger salary and the Canadian accent, not a great deal, it would appear. In the sporting metaphors beloved by both men, they take each game as it comes.",

      "body": "<p>It's hard to fault Andrew Tyrie's take on Mark Carney's attempts over the past six weeks to explain the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/24/bank-of-england-unreliable-boyfriend-interest-rates\" title=\"\">Bank of England's approach to interest-rate increases</a>. We've had quite a lot of guidance, the chairman of the Commons Treasury committee said drily, not all of it consistent.</p> <p>Predictably, the governor insisted that there had been no flip-flopping. Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee had been consistent in its approach.</p> <p>Consistent? Really? Are we talking about the same Bank? Yes, we are. The one that used its May inflation report to point out that there was spare capacity in the economy that needed to be used up before borrowing costs were raised. The one that since Carney's Mansion House speech just 29 days later has been sending out the message that rates might go up sooner than the financial markets think. And the one, judging by Carney's evidence to the Treasury committee, that is now back to pointing out how nugatory real earnings growth is a sign of slack in the labour market.</p> <p>What is clear is that Carney and his fellow MPC members have left the City entirely baffled. What's also clear is that what happens to official interest rates is now entirely dependent on the incoming economic data. A weak set of inflation numbers will see expectations of a rate rise diminish; a strong purchasing managers' index will see odds on an early increase shorten. This is a recipe for volatility, precisely the opposite of the Bank's avowed policy.</p> <p>Indeed, as the first anniversary of Carney's arrival at the Bank nears, his main policy initiative \u2013 forward guidance \u2013 lies dead in the water. His testimony before MPs may have been intended to convey the message that nothing has really changed since the publication of the May inflation report, but in truth he has turned the clock back to the days when the MPC's approach was to assume that the future was unknowable and that the interest-rate decision had to be judged afresh each month.</p> <p>So what then is the difference between monetary policy under Mervyn King and monetary policy under Mark Carney? Apart from the bigger salary and the Canadian accent, not a great deal, it would appear. In the sporting metaphors beloved by both men, they take each game as it comes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Carpetright founder Lord Harris has performed a U-turn about stepping down from the loss-making company and plans to remain on the board to advise incoming chief executive Wilf Walsh. \"Wilf will be left to run the business but during the learning phase I will be there to help,\" said Harris who is moving out of the retailer's headquarters in Purfleet, Essex to a new base in Orpington. \"He is going to be in head office and I'll be in my office and he can call me when he wants.\" Now 72, Harris was recalled last year to run the business he founded in 1988 after the then chief executive Darren Shapland quit suddenly. The appointment of Walsh, the former managing director of the bookmaker Coral follows several difficult years for the company as sales and profits collapsed during the financial crisis. Almost \u00a312m of exceptionals pulled the company deeper into the red in the year to 26 April with a pre-tax loss of \u00a37.2m on sales of \u00a3447.7m. The write-offs included \u00a36.6m relating to \"onerous\" lease provisions on closed UK stores it has been unable to dispose of. On an underlying basis pre-tax profits had more than halved to \u00a34.6m from \u00a39.7m a year earlier. The slump in financial performance was caused by a \u00a33.8m loss at Carpetright's non-UK business, which is mainly in the Netherlands. Carpetright's expansion into the Dutch market in 2002 turned sour after one of Europe's biggest property bubbles burst. But business was also lacklustre in the UK, where revenue dropped 1.5% and like-for-like sales fell 0.2%. The figures were in line with City expectations following three profit warnings in the past year. Carpetright's shares, which have fallen about 20% since early April, closed down 4.75p to 494.25p. With Walsh due to join the company from next month, Harris had said last month that he would leave the board at September's annual meeting and work as a consultant to advise Walsh. He now plans to stay on as chairman after September until a replacement arrives and may then remain on the board as a non-executive director on the strength of his family's 20% stake in the company. Other shareholders are understood to be supportive of Harris's decision to stay. Harris said there would \"definitely\" be a new chairman as he had other business interests to pursue including his chain of school academies and part ownership of top show-jumping horse Ursula XII. Harris said the new arrangement was better than the old one as he would still be entitled to attend board meetings, which many investors with holdings of a similar size would seek. Carpetright's business is closely tied to the property market because households buy new flooring when they move or plan to move house. Britain's property market surged during the company's financial year but little benefit flowed through to Carpetright sales. Harris said the time lag before the improving UK property market feeds through to sales had increased because tighter regulation and taxes had eaten into homebuyers' disposable income. \"They have to pay a larger deposit than they used to and they have got stamp duties which gives them less money,\" he said. As a result, buyers are waiting to fit new carpet and flooring whereas before it was one of the first things they did, he said. Earlier this year Carpetright was forced to adjust its pricing policies after the Office of Fair Trading criticised it and other floor and furniture sellers for advertising reductions that were not genuine. Harris said the business had not been affected by the OFT decision. \"We are acting well within the rules now,\" contined Harris. \"People get genuine prices with genuine discounts and we are doing that. We worked within the law and they wanted to change the law. We have seen no difference.\" Harris has been revamping stores but Freddie George, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said Walsh would have to take more radical action to overhaul Carpetright. \"His priority will be to update and modernise the current concept. This is likely to involve significant capital expenditure and restructuring costs. The current concept, in our view, is too focused on price and not aspirational enough for mainstream customer needs.\"",
