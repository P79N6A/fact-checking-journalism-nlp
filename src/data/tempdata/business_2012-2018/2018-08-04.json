      "bodyText": "As I watched Coles cower to complaints and decide first to provide free plastic bags indefinitely and then announce a deadline of 29 August, I was struck by how climate change has utterly destroyed the minds of conservatives. Here was a pretty straightforward proposition to get behind \u2013 not least for those who believe in small government. In New South Wales and Victoria, unlike in other states where a legal ban on plastic bags has been in place for some time, Coles and Woolworths instituted a ban of their own volition. The plastic bag ban is not really about climate change, it\u2019s about conservation \u2013 the tool conservatives such as Tony Abbott used to counter criticism they did not care about the environment. It was the thinking behind Abbott\u2019s Green Army, with that old-fashioned personal-responsibility aspect about it. Get out and plant some trees, pick up some rubbish and huzzah, look at me, I care about the environment, and unlike those greenies who just want to destroy jobs, I\u2019m doing something that matters. But sigh, no. Conservatives have been rendered so bereft by climate change that anything carrying even the slightest taint of an environmental impact is viewed with distrust. And so the plastic bag ban quickly became a new focus of the culture wars. It\u2019s all rather odd, but fits perfectly within a strain of thought that has decided the way forward is to ignore evidence and instead pursue an ideology of wilful ignorance. It has led to the point where there are barely any conservative commentators worth reading or listening to. It\u2019s not that there are no intelligent conservative thinkers, but the lunacy of climate change denial and distrust of expertise has so infected the conservative media that prominence is now almost exclusively given to those for whom a worldwide conspiracy is more believable than reports by multiple universities and public agencies. What\u2019s more, their realisation that they can spout their views free of supportable evidence on this issue has also led to an unlocking of all manner of views they once kept hidden, but which now come forth with great delight. It\u2019s a small jump from viewing climate change as a global conspiracy to decrying the conspiracy of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d in either ignorance or lack of care about its antisemitic roots. Add together the Australian conservative cultural cringe that always sees them flock to embrace the most D-grade right-wingers from North America \u2013 such as Lauren Southern \u2013 and you get a rather pathetic mix of dull thinkers shifting ever more towards promulgation of hatred in an effort to imitate those so lacking in insight that their arguments get defeated even as they espouse them. No longer do such voices feel even a need to pre-empt criticism as they did in the old days by saying \u201csome of my best friends are...\u201d Now the full ugliness is put on display \u2013 such as this week when Andrew Bolt was given free rein in his syndicated News Corp column to criticise, in his view, the clusters of Chinese, Vietnamese, Indians, Jews, and Muslims in parts of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as Italian migrants who still speak Italian at home and a quick drive-by at Indigenous people just to ensure he completed his full racial bingo card. The other problem is this virus of odious ignorance has also infected the conservative parties. We see this most visibly in talk of migration and climate change, and so virulent is this strain of ignorance and hatred that the remaining members in the Liberal party who might have kept some slight connection with rational thought now self-censor both their politics and their policy. The national energy guarantee being pushed by Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg is a prime example. It is at best a policy that does little harm but virtually no good, but which is miles removed from the sentiments on climate change policy Turnbull espoused nearly 10 years ago. The best you could argue is that instead of raising the share of renewables in the energy sector to 34% by 2030 as would occur should no new policy come into effect, it will raise it to 36%. Of course, all this needs to be taken on faith, given the government is not releasing the full modelling of the scheme. But really, why would you want people to see evidence? That would be like believing granting $444m of public funds to a charity should require some sort of tender process, and that is just not the way things are done by this government. But even this is too much. Abbott remains opposed to the Neg because he claims the policy is about lowering emissions rather than power prices. It appears the fact that emissions will actually increase under the Neg is not enough to satisfy him. What\u2019s worse is that while Abbott and Co are already against the emissions reduction target of between 26% and 28% by 2030, they are even more opposed to the possibility floated by Frydenberg of allowing the target to be reviewed in five years\u2019 time. This opposition could see the target set in legislation, meaning the ability to change this miserable policy would be beholden to future Senates should a political party not divorced from reality gain power in the years ahead. And you would think reality would be hitting the conservative side of politics pretty hard right now, given the drought affecting vast parts of NSW and South Australia. Yet even here we have Barnaby Joyce threatening to pull his support (such as it is) for the Neg should it mean the agricultural sector is required to reduce its emissions. Thus we remain stuck in a situation where the bar seems set at hoping to achieve a third or fourth-best policy, all because one side of politics has become so bereft of thought that not only is it unable to admit that climate change exists, it cannot even cope with the thought of people having to reuse shopping bags. It would be funny were it not so pathetic. Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "Last year the chief economist at the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, gave a fear-inducing speech that warned of Armageddon in the jobs market. Robots threatened 15 million UK jobs, he said. This dystopian picture of busy machines and queues of jobless Britons was replaced this month by a rosier view from PwC, which made the opposite claim: robots and artificial intelligence could create as many jobs as they destroy, which happens to be around 7 million. Then the University of Oxford said 35% of UK jobs could be automated, while a 2017 McKinsey report warned 5% of UK jobs were highly automatable. The MIT Technology Review has identified at least 18 different predictions about automation. This article is not about robots, AI or even the debate raging over the impact of Brexit. It\u2019s about the detachment from history and real life \u2013 stemming from a disastrously narrow education \u2013 that allows economists to make such claims, and the damage that does to public debate about important matters. This month, the pressure group Rethinking Economics said Britain\u2019s universities were failing to equip economics students with the skills that businesses and the government say they need. Following extensive interviews with employers, including organisations such as the Bank of England, it found that universities were producing \u201ca cohort of economic practitioners who struggle to provide innovative ideas to overcome economic challenges or use economic tools on real-world problems\u201d. Moreover, the group said, \u201cwhen political decisions are backed by economics reasoning, as they so often are, economists are unable to communicate ideas to the public, resulting in a large democratic deficit.\u201d You could easily level that criticism at the economists forecasting the impact of AI. What are people supposed to think when those who study the field come up with such wildly varying predictions? More importantly, what will politicians think they should do? Nothing, probably, given the confusion. The Rethinking group is concerned that university departments only train, rather than educate, huge numbers of graduates for econometrics jobs across the banking, insurance and consulting sectors. In our increasingly student-led system, these young people don\u2019t want to mess around with history or modules on inequality. They are on a mission to make money for themselves in the private sector. If they were diverted into discussions of economic history, they might find out we are about to repeat the mistakes of the past and trigger another financial crisis. Even more inhibiting, their course might show that higher inequality dampens workers\u2019 incentives to increase productivity, and might prompt them to ask why young economists in the City are paid colossal amounts of money to analyse bond yields or forecast oil prices. Pay them less, share the money around, and productivity might improve. Failing that, let a robot do their job. Despite the pressure on universities to feed the financial industry with young, focused minds, there are efforts under way to broaden the outlook of economics graduates. The Core project was adopted by 13 UK universities last September. It is an improvement, albeit an incremental one, that brings back a bit of Marxism (though just a discussion of Karl\u2019s labour-market theory). The developers of the programme also claim it has freed itself from neoliberal thinking, which judges markets to be self-adjusting and consumers and businesses to be operating with the same information. The world is full of asymmetric power and information relationships, and Core reflects this. Nonetheless, Joe Earle, chief executive of the charity Economy, says Core puts a gloss on a course that still puts maths first and critical thinking second. \u201cWhen people demand a revolution, minor reforms often gain support because they can be framed in such a way that they appear to simultaneously address the concerns of the critics while maintaining the status quo. This is exactly what is happening in economics,\u201d he says. It seems it is still seen as radical to analyse the flows of money in the world as if much of it was stolen, and how that skews investors\u2019 decisions. But it\u2019s not radical: it\u2019s a fact. Tax alleviation structures dominate company decisions, but are rarely debated by students. Some of the money will be drug money or gains from organised crime. But most of it will be money that avoided tax in the country where it was generated. Such a discussion would give students the chance to hear varied perspectives, challenge assumptions, and explore how different values and goals can lead to different conclusions. It shows that the academics behind Core still have work to do. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 August 2018 to remove an incorrect reference to the Core project having obtained funding from the Economic and Social Research Council.",

      "bodyText": "It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks for America\u2019s high-flying technology stocks, even by their own unique standards. Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China. But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u2019s market value \u2013 losing more than \u00a390bn \u2013 after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers. On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u2019s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u201cboring bonehead questions\u201d and ignored queries from investors. But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday. Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u201cFaangs\u201d \u2013 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u2013 have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth. Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u201cThat [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u2019s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u201d Here we look at where the big names stand \u2013 and where they could go from here. Facebook The social network\u2019s stock market value plunged by more than \u00a390bn \u2013 the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u2013 as it felt the effect of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The group made more than $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u2013 slightly ahead of expectations \u2013 but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security. Verdict For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u2019s right that he\u2019s the only one who can get it back out. However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u201cfeeds\u201d to self-deleting \u201cstories\u201d, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u2019t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u2019s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in. Alphabet Google\u2019s parent company smashed Wall Street\u2019s profit expectations, sending its shares soaring to a record high. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u2013 down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u2013 but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u2013 well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year. Verdict Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u2019s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u2019s fine over Google\u2019s Android monopoly isn\u2019t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u2013 if it weren\u2019t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u2013 but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward. Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u2013 and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u2013 but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook. Amazon The globe-spanning online retailer announced record quarterly profits of $2.5bn \u2013 double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u2013 sending the share price to an all-time high. Advertising and cloud computing were the big growth areas. Verdict Remember when it just sold books? Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u2013 where it\u2019s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u2013 to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u2019t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s. Apple Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the first public company to be valued at $1 trillion, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u2013 slightly less than anticipated \u2013 but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up. Verdict Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u2019s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u2019s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up. The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September. But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u2019s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u2019s report: \u201cservices\u201d and \u201cother products\u201d. Services \u2013 which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u2013 have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it. Tesla Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u2019s financial sustainability and outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech. On Wednesday the electric-car maker reported a record $717m loss for the last three months, but the shares climbed because revenue hit $4bn and Musk promised profitability later this year. He said there had been a \u201cmind-blowing leap forward\u201d in the number of cars rolling off the lines. Verdict Elon Musk\u2019s responsible-boss routine on Tesla\u2019s earnings call appeared to restore investor confidence following his disastrous performance three months ago, when he rejected \u201cboring bonehead questions\u201d from Wall Street analysts concerned about Tesla\u2019s fundamentals. But whether he\u2019s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan. Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u2019s had to shift production to an external \u201ctent\u201d, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u2019t enough \u2013 to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u2019s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u2019s), it\u2019ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u2019s first commercially feasible electric truck. Twitter Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers. It lost 1 million users in the last three months and predicted a \u201cmid-single-digit millions\u201d decline in the next three-month period. The social media service reported net income of $100m during the second quarter, but tech companies need to show they can deliver uninterrupted growth to impress Wall Street. Verdict In 2016, Twitter moved its app from the \u201csocial networking\u201d section of the App Store to the \u201cnews\u201d section. At the time, it was seen as a capitulation to Facebook, but now it looks like a piece of genuine insight into what the company could offer to users and how the service differs from its competition. Like all news services, when there\u2019s a lot of news, the company booms, and there is certainly a lot of news right now. That has fed into a good performance over the last year. The last quarter is a different story, of course. Twitter still has to tackle the same trust and safety issues as Facebook and Google, with a fraction of the money and engineering talent. And, as with Facebook, Wall Street just doesn\u2019t want to play ball: Twitter deletes millions of fake accounts, and investors punish it with a 20% plunge in stock price. Would they really prefer to invest in a site riddled with bots? Netflix The video streaming service was first of the tech firms out of the gate, posting figures in mid-July. Its latest three-month results sent its shares tumbling after it missed subscriber-number expectations for the first time in five years: it signed up more than 5 million new users, which was about a million fewer than the company and the market had expected. Verdict Netflix\u2019s strategy has changed a lot over the years, from posting DVDs, to streaming licensed movies, to streaming licensed TV shows. These days, its focus is on original serialised programming, which changes the way to think about its content costs: they\u2019re no longer a recurring expense eating into the margin, but a long-term investment. And, as analyst Ben Thompson notes, the spending in effect works towards customer acquisition: the more content on Netflix, the more reason there is to join the site. Which is why, when subscriber growth slows, the whole thing looks unstable. The smallest of the Faangs hasn\u2019t achieved the escape velocity of its peers, and a dip could always turn into a death dive. Spotify In only its second financial report since flotation, the music streaming service reported an 8 million rise in the number of paid subscribers, to 83 million during the second quarter. Spotify has yet to record a profit, but the increase suggests it is still staving off competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Amazon and Apple for music streaming customers. Its operating loss widened from \u20ac79m to \u20ac90m (\u00a380m). Verdict The music streaming market still has room to grow, as the stubborn markets for digital downloads and CDs demonstrate. But everyone knows it\u2019s eventually going to be a winner-takes-all battle. That\u2019s because, unlike video, there\u2019s little reason to have subscriptions to multiple streaming services, and strong economies of scale. So Spotify\u2019s stock price is essentially a representation of one simple question: will it win, or will Apple Music? In Spotify\u2019s favour is its large and growing free service, which brings in substantial ad revenue and is a crucial pipeline for new users \u2013 and the Android market, where it lacks a strong competitor. Working against it: a competitor with much deeper pockets.",

Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206/0_46_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk\u2019s recent outbursts have worried investors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gene Blevins/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tesla</h2> <p>Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u2019s financial sustainability and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/18/elon-musk-apologises-for-calling-thai-cave-rescue-diver-a-pedo\">outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk</a> that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech. On Wednesday the electric-car maker reported a record $717m loss for the last three months, but the shares climbed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/01/tesla-latest-losses-revenue-elon-musk-report-q2\"> because revenue hit $4bn and Musk promised profitability later this year</a>. He said there had been a \u201cmind-blowing leap forward\u201d in the number of cars rolling off the lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902I7Ien8g6t4or/\" data-alt=\"Tesla shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902I7Ien8g6t4or/\">Tesla shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>Elon Musk\u2019s responsible-boss routine on Tesla\u2019s earnings call appeared to restore investor confidence following his disastrous performance three months ago, when he rejected \u201cboring bonehead questions\u201d from Wall Street analysts concerned about Tesla\u2019s fundamentals. But whether he\u2019s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan.</p> <p>Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u2019s had to shift production to an external \u201ctent\u201d, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u2019t enough \u2013 to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u2019s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u2019s), it\u2019ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u2019s first commercially feasible electric truck.</p> <h2>Twitter</h2> <p>Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/27/twitter-share-price-tumbles-after-it-loses-1m-users-in-three-months\">lost 1 million users in the last three months</a> and predicted a \u201cmid-single-digit millions\u201d decline in the next three-month period. The social media service reported net income of $100m during the second quarter, but tech companies need to show they can deliver uninterrupted growth to impress Wall Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39024qv2eKcTU0Ob/\" data-alt=\"Twitter shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39024qv2eKcTU0Ob/\">Twitter shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Verdict </strong>In 2016, Twitter moved its app from the \u201csocial networking\u201d section of the App Store to the \u201cnews\u201d section. At the time, it was seen as a capitulation to Facebook, but now it looks like a piece of genuine insight into what the company could offer to users and how the service differs from its competition. Like all news services, when there\u2019s a lot of news, the company booms, and there is certainly a lot of news right now. That has fed into a good performance over the last year.</p> <p>The last quarter is a different story, of course. Twitter still has to tackle the same trust and safety issues as Facebook and Google, with a fraction of the money and engineering talent. And, as with Facebook, Wall Street just doesn\u2019t want to play ball: Twitter deletes millions of fake accounts, and investors punish it with a 20% plunge in stock price. Would they really prefer to invest in a site riddled with bots? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7926550ef5825421f1b736314acb2c22280e771e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7926550ef5825421f1b736314acb2c22280e771e/0_24_2848_1709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage \u2013 a Netflix original.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage \u2013 a Netflix original.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Myles Aronowitz/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Netflix</h2> <p>The video streaming service was first of the tech firms out of the gate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/16/netflix-subscribers-numbers-forecasts-wall-street\">posting figures in mid-July</a>. Its latest three-month results sent its shares tumbling after it missed subscriber-number expectations for the first time in five years: it signed up more than 5 million new users, which was about a million fewer than the company and the market had expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902AnzUmYOX8bRe/\" data-alt=\"Netflix shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902AnzUmYOX8bRe/\">Netflix shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>Netflix\u2019s strategy has changed a lot over the years, from posting DVDs, to streaming licensed movies, to streaming licensed TV shows. These days, its focus is on original serialised programming, which changes the way to think about its content costs: they\u2019re no longer a recurring expense eating into the margin, but a long-term investment. And, as analyst Ben Thompson notes, the spending in effect works towards customer acquisition: the more content on Netflix, the more reason there is to join the site. Which is why, when subscriber growth slows, the whole thing looks unstable. The smallest of the Faangs hasn\u2019t achieved the escape velocity of its peers, and a dip could always turn into a death dive.</p> <h2>Spotify</h2> <p>In only its second financial report since flotation, the music streaming service reported an 8 million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/26/spotify-beats-expectations-by-reaching-83m-subscribers\">rise in the number of paid subscribers, to 83 million</a> during the second quarter. Spotify has yet to record a profit, but the increase suggests it is still staving off competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Amazon and Apple for music streaming customers. Its operating loss widened from \u20ac79m to \u20ac90m (\u00a380m).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902fmh9G6SjEUQt/\" data-alt=\"Spotify shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902fmh9G6SjEUQt/\">Spotify shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>The music streaming market still has room to grow, as the stubborn markets for digital downloads and CDs demonstrate. But everyone knows it\u2019s eventually going to be a winner-takes-all battle. That\u2019s because, unlike video, there\u2019s little reason to have subscriptions to multiple streaming services, and strong economies of scale. So Spotify\u2019s stock price is essentially a representation of one simple question: will it win, or will Apple Music? In Spotify\u2019s favour is its large and growing free service, which brings in substantial ad revenue and is a crucial pipeline for new users \u2013 and the Android market, where it lacks a strong competitor. Working against it: a competitor with much deeper pockets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street investors are still hot for music technology \u2013 at least that was the message Sonos Inc broadcast this week after its stock SONO surged 33% above its IPO price in its market debut. Shrugging off lacklustre opening trading, the maker of popular, high-end wireless and voice recognition speakers, closed out the day at over $19 a share on Thursday, giving the 16-year-old Californian company an implied market value of $1.95bn . If it holds, Sonos flotation could end a curse that\u2019s been hanging over commodity technology since companies like Fitbit and GoPro surged at IPO and then crashed. What makes Sonos different, company executives argued last week, is that unlike, say, smartphones and headphones, their speakers aren\u2019t locked into updating cycles. \u201cPeople are used to buying commodity tech that needs to be replaced, but we\u2019re differentiated because our product persists,\u201d Mike Groeninger, Sonos\u2019 vice president of finance, told Marketwatch. With Sonos, the argument goes, consumers perceive brand loyalty because the Sonos systems are of high quality and will simply add to existing systems when they move or add music-streaming to new areas of the homes. Sonos backs up that argument with data showing that said 27% of Sonos households own four or more products, and more than 61% of its households have registered more than one device. Where Sonos products need to be replaced, Groeninger continued, it\u2019s because its hardware can\u2019t support advances in streaming technology. \u201cWe\u2019re not forcing obsolescence,\u201d he pointed out. But if that were all true, and Sonos was uniquely blessed with longterm customer loyalty, then stock analysts could reasonably expect Sonos\u2019 first day numbers to come in more robustly. One potential problem is that Sonos\u2019 greatest asset in partnering with streaming services Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify is also its most glaring consumer tech weakness: those companies could decide to move into the hardware business. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at Ayondo markets, commented that despite Sonos\u2019 opening day performance his main concern is that Sonos will experience a negative share price performance similar to Fitbit. \u201cFitbit is another well-run company with popular products, yet its future profitability can be heavily affected when tech conglomerates, like Apple or Google, decide to produce and manufacture similar, niche devices themselves, which consequently undermines market share.\u201d The company\u2019s vulnerability to Amazon, for instance, was revealed earlier this month when it was revealed in an SEC filing that the e-shopping giant could disable its Alexa voice recognition technology on Sonos\u2019 speakers on \u201climited notice\u201d. In its filing, Sonos also acknowledged that not only could Amazon disable Alexa integration but \u201cAmazon could also begin charging us for this integration which would harm our operating results\u201d. \u201cIn the filing, we\u2019ve just been very upfront about the fact that we could turn off people\u2019s service, they could turn them off. We\u2019re transparent by nature, so that\u2019s in there,\u201d Sonos CEO Patrick Spence told CNBC on Thursday. Morgan Stanley recently estimated that more than 70% of US households will own a smart speaker with voice commerce capabilities by 2022 and half of all web searches will be voice activated. The category will become so important to the data tech giants, the report recommended, that Google should give away a free Home Mini smart speaker to every US household. The $3.3bn this would cost Google parent Alphabet to execute would be a \u201csmall price to pay\u201d for the opportunity, it added, since the potential to make money off the trend will likely go to Amazon and Google because of their dominance in their voice recognition technologies and smart speaker technology. For Sonos, then, perhaps the best policy would be to remain on good terms. The company\u2019s sales have been increasing, albeit modestly from a loyal customer base that drove sales to nearly $1bn last year. The company, still based in Santa Barbara, Californi, where it was founded, has posted annual losses in its three most recent fiscal years.",
