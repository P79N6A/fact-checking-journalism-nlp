      "bodyText": "The security firm G4S is being paid for looking after empty beds in a secure training centre (STC) that is the focus of allegations of widespread abuse by staff, the Guardian has learned. The company has received over \u00a3260,000 since the abuse story broke. The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, said G4S was running rings round the government and the public was losing confidence in its cosy relationship with the firm. The Youth Justice Board (YJB), which oversees the detention of young people in England and Wales, told the Guardian that 47 children are detained at Medway STC in Kent. But G4S is being paid to look after the full capacity of 76. Following the allegations, the YJB announced it would stop sending children to Medway. Earlier this month, a Panorama investigation revealed footage, taken by an undercover reporter working as a guard at Medway, in which children were being assaulted by staff, who later boasted about the abuse to colleagues. Staff were also seen talking freely about falsifying records of violent incidents. Under STC rules, if more than two children are fighting, it is classified as staff losing control of the centre and G4S faces heavy fines. Footage showed a guard saying: \u201cIf we get an incident with four kids, it will get split up so they, G4S, don\u2019t get fined.\u201d The allegations of abuse, now under investigation by police, include children being hit on the head and being restrained against STC rules. One child said he could not breathe as a guard was pressing on his windpipe. G4S, the world\u2019s biggest security firm, has a troubled history of running STCs. In 2004, 15-year-old Gareth Myatt died after being restrained by three adult guards at Rainsbrook STC, operated by the company. Before he died, he told guards he could not breathe. G4S runs England\u2019s three STCs \u2013 Medway, Oakhill in Milton Keynes and Rainsbrook in Northamptonshire. But following a damning inspection report last year, the contract to run Rainsbrook was taken away, although the company is in place until May when MTCnovo will take over. The inspection at Rainsbrook found children had been subjected to degrading treatment and racist comments from staff. Six members of staff were dismissed. In 2014, following a Guardian investigation, 14 children who had been unlawfully restrained in STCs run by G4S and Serco were awarded damages amounting to \u00a3100,000. Neither company admitted liability but paid two-thirds of the damages. The remaining third was paid by the YJB. Last November, the charities Article 39, the Howard League for Penal Reform and Inquest, wrote to Tom McNally, chairman of the YJB, asking if provisions had been made in the five-year contract for G4S to run Rainsbrook should it be found that children had not been properly cared for there. In reply, Lin Hinnigan, YJB chief executive, said: \u201cThe contract can be terminated if performance levels reach certain trigger points, if there is a breach of contract which adversely affects the provision of custodial services, or if the contractor fails to submit or complete rectification plans.\u201d Carolyne Willow, director of children\u2019s rights charity Article 39, said: \u201cIf the allegations of assault and child cruelty and falsifying records at Medway turn out to be true, surely there would be no question about breaches of contract? Otherwise, the care and safety of children has not been written into the contract, which would be an extraordinary failing.\u201d G4S charges the government \u00a3138,051 per child per year at Medway. In the 24 days since the YJB stopped sending children there, the company will receive \u00a3263,242.25 for the 29 empty beds. Following the allegations, G4S said it had suspended or sacked seven members of staff at Medway. The Guardian has learned that figure has risen to 11 and G4S is seeking that number of replacement staff. Burnham said: \u201cG4Ss are clearly running rings round this government and have got them wrapped around their little finger. Whatever happens, G4S can\u2019t lose. Even when it is alleged they have been responsible for appalling breaches of contract they still come up trumps, and make even more money. \u201cThe public is losing patience with this government\u2019s cosy relationship with this company. G4S can\u2019t get paid for people they are not looking after, especially when there is evidence that their officers abused children in the first place. G4S should return any money immediately and there needs to be a wider review of the nature of all the contracts the government holds with G4S.\u201d A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cAs per the contract agreement with G4S for the running of Medway Secure Training Centre, the company is paid based on the availability of places and not the number of people at the establishment at any given time. This is a standard form of agreement that is in place for many establishments that are operated by external companies on behalf of the MoJ. \u201cWe have also established a review of the youth justice system, led by Charlie Taylor. He will report back later this year with recommendations on how to improve the treatment of young people in our care.\u201d Eric Allison is the Guardian\u2019s prison correspondent and was a consultant on Panorama\u2019s Teenage Prison Abuse Exposed.

      "bodyText": "For entrepreneur Lauren Dickerson, water mills are an ancient form of renewable energy that can be brought into the 21st century. \u201cAs early as the year 1050 AD, there were an estimated 6,000 water mills in the UK. These water mills remained fundamentally important to the UK economy through [to] the end of the 19th century when they were overtaken by coal power as the dominant [energy] source,\u201d she says. Through their company Lunagen, Dickerson and her co-founders have created a system to generate electricity from slow moving water. It is an attempt to capture energy from rivers and streams where other technologies are not viable \u2013 which they say will reimagine water mills for the modern era. The Lunagen system works by placing turbines in the river, which are powered by the flow of water and generate power which is then converted into electricity. The end result can be used to power a home or it can be fed back into the power grid. A typical system using hydropower \u2013 the energy contained in flowing water - involves dams, where the force of released water spins the blades of a turbine. Where Lunagen say there is a gap in the market is in using smaller-scale, slow flowing waters where building dam-like infrastructure is impossible. \u201cThere just is not the force of energy \u2026 to power that turbine to generate enough electricity to pay back the whole cost. By not using a dam, by using the whole resource of the flow that is coming through [the river], we are able to dramatically reduce the cost of \u2026 the project,\u201d said Will Penfold, another of the four cofounders of the company. The turbines are still in development but they will be made from fibreglass and will be fitted into modular units which will then be placed into the water. The modules will be placed across the entire span of where the water is flowing, meaning that all of the flowing water goes through the turbines. On top of each turbine is a generator where the energy is converted to electricity. It will then be stored in a battery or fed back into the grid, said Penfold. \u201cThey move as the water goes through and they spin. They generate the electricity and it moves onto a battery or connects to the grid or a house,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could have one or two turbines in the river and it would generate electricity. But not much. If you create this blockage across the river you can get 10 times as much out of each type of turbine because the water cannot flow around it. It has to go through it.\u201d It is envisaged that the modules which hold the turbines will come in standard sizes, so they can be fitted across the river depending on how many are needed. \u201cDepending on how wide and deep your river is, you can daisy chain these modules together,\u201d says Dickerson. This system will enable people to generate energy from streams on the grounds of their houses, she says. Using the example of grounds where there is a stream two metres wide and a metre deep, she said it would be impractical to build a dam as the grounds could be flooded - as well as it being costly to install. \u201cThese turbines are going to be able to be dropped into the flow with very minimal civil engineering work,\u201d she said. The turbines will be aimed at the lower end of the energy generation market, from small streams which may generate enough energy to supply a house to small community projects where the flow of water will supply four or five homes. The company\u2019s projections are that the installed system will cost one third of what a small hydroelectric system costs. \u201cWe [believe] that a good project would have a 50% capacity factor meaning that it is generating the maximum amount of electricity about 50% of the time,\u201d says Dickerson. According to Dickerson, the average cost of a conventional system which generates power from flowing water is between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 a kilowatt [kW] of capacity, which includes the cost of the turbines and the infrastructure. A small community energy project would be about 10kW in size while a home with a stream running through it would use about 2kW. The Lunagen will system will cost \u00a33,500 per kW installed, she says. Following tests in water tanks, Lunagen is building prototypes to put into a live water flow. Although it is their ambition to be selling the units by the middle of the year, the company could face hurdles. Wildlife could be one problem. Conscious of one recurring criticism of dam projects, Lunagen claims that fish will not be harmed by the turbines. Hydroelectric dams have been criticised for their effect on fish populations, in some instances blocking movement and affecting migratory patterns. Lunagen claims that the system allows fish to swim through the turbines although further tests in a live environment are required. Dickerson said that they may also have to combat perceptions that the turbines represent a flooding risk. A permit from the Environment Agency will be needed to put the system in place, says Penfold, which could take three or four months to secure. The smaller market \u2013 homes and small schemes \u2013 which Lunagen is targeting is not being serviced by other products, says Penfold, and will not require as much money to begin as other bigger projects on rivers such as the Thames. The company\u2019s ambitions are to scale up and then start generating energy from larger rivers and irrigation canals, in countries like India, Pakistan, Canada and Australia. \u201cIn the UK the agricultural economy was largely built up on the back of mills that were profligate around the UK. Our research shows over 10,000 mills at one time in the last several hundred years existed in this country so this actually really is a little bit of a part of our heritage. It just takes a little bit of a different form and design but we are going back to our roots,\u201d says Dickerson.

It has to go through it.\u201d <br></p> <p>It is envisaged that the modules which hold the turbines will come in standard sizes, so they can be fitted across the river depending on how many are needed. \u201cDepending on how wide and deep your river is, you can daisy chain these modules together,\u201d says Dickerson.</p> <p>This system will enable people to generate energy from streams on the grounds of their houses, she says. Using the example of grounds where there is a stream two metres wide and a metre deep, she said it would be impractical to build a dam as the grounds could be flooded - as well as it being costly to install. \u201cThese turbines are going to be able to be dropped into the flow with very minimal civil engineering work,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>The turbines will be aimed at the lower end of the energy generation market, from small streams which may generate enough energy to supply a house to small community projects where the flow of water will supply four or five homes. The company\u2019s projections are that the installed system will cost one third of what a small hydroelectric system costs. \u201cWe [believe] that a good project would have a 50% capacity factor meaning that it is generating the maximum amount of electricity about 50% of the time,\u201d says Dickerson.</p> <p>According to Dickerson, the average cost of a conventional system which generates power from flowing water is between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 a kilowatt [kW] of capacity, which includes the cost of the turbines and the infrastructure. A small community energy project would be about 10kW in size while a home with a stream running through it would use about 2kW. The Lunagen will system will cost \u00a33,500 per kW installed, she says. <br></p> <p>Following tests in water tanks, Lunagen is building prototypes to put into a live water flow. Although it is their ambition to be selling the units by the middle of the year, the company could face hurdles.</p> <p>Wildlife could be one problem. Conscious of one recurring criticism of dam projects, Lunagen claims that fish will not be harmed by the turbines. Hydroelectric dams have been criticised for their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/08/hydro-dam-boom-threatens-third-of-worlds-freshwater-fish\">effect on fish populations</a>, in some instances blocking movement and affecting migratory patterns. Lunagen claims that the system allows fish to swim through the turbines although further tests in a live environment are required. Dickerson said that they may also have to combat perceptions that the turbines represent a flooding risk. A permit from the Environment Agency will be needed to put the system in place, says Penfold, which could take three or four months to secure.</p> <p>The smaller market \u2013 homes and small schemes \u2013 which Lunagen is targeting is not being serviced by other products, says Penfold, and will not require as much money to begin as other bigger projects on rivers such as the Thames. The company\u2019s ambitions are to scale up and then start generating energy from larger rivers and irrigation canals, in countries like India, Pakistan, Canada and Australia.</p> <p>\u201cIn the UK the agricultural economy was largely built up on the back of mills that were profligate around the UK. Our research shows over 10,000 mills at one time in the last several hundred years existed in this country so this actually really is a little bit of a part of our heritage. It just takes a little bit of a different form and design but we are going back to our roots,\u201d says Dickerson.</p> <ul> <li> You can read our archive of The innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/the-innovators\">here </a>or <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.<br></li> </ul> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 January 2016 because an earlier version referred to kilowatt-hour [kWh].

    "webTitle": "UK GDP figures to be released amid global economic jitters", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The resilience of the British economy in the face of stuttering global markets will be tested this week, with the publication of official UK growth figures due on Thursday. The first snapshot of GDP in the final months of 2015 is expected to show that growth held up at a modest pace, helping the UK outperform other advanced economies during last year as a whole. Economists forecast that the figures will show growth of 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, slightly faster than growth of 0.4% in the previous quarter, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll. But with worries about China\u2019s downturn and the wider global economy clouding the outlook, there is significant uncertainty over the UK\u2019s performance. Individual economists\u2019 forecasts range from 0.3% to 0.6%. Weak retail sales figures for the key Christmas season released last week fanned fears that the GDP figures could disappoint. There have also been warnings from businesses that the looming EU referendum is hurting confidence and forcing some firms to put investment plans on hold. With polls pointing to a tight vote, the pound has fallen sharply in recent weeks. Howard Archer, an economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said there were some factors helping to shore up UK growth, notably rising employment and a low oil price, which have both boosted consumer spending. But he added that, at the same time, the UK was \u201cclearly finding growth hard to come by at the moment and facing significant domestic and global uncertainties\u201d. \u201cWe expect GDP growth in the fourth quarter to have been disappointingly limited again to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. This would see year-on-year growth slow to 1.8%, the weakest since the first quarter of 2013,\u201d Archer said. At the annual World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Osborne called the UK a \u201cbright spot\u201d in the world economy. However, amid signs of Britain\u2019s economy losing steam, he sought to shift the focus to external forces by repeating a warning that the UK faced a \u201cdangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy\u201d. Economists expect that despite Osborne\u2019s vow five years ago to rebalance the economy towards more manufacturing and exports, the UK\u2019s service sector was again relied on to drive growth in the fourth quarter. Manufacturers were hurt last year by a strong pound, which makes UK exports more expensive, as well as a slump in orders for machinery from the North Sea oil and gas industry after the plunge in oil prices. Reports from the construction industry have also been downbeat, with the latest figures pointing to a drop in output in November amid warnings from building companies that a lack of skilled workers is delaying projects. The data so far did not point to a marked rebound in the fourth quarter, said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, forecasting 0.5% growth in that period. In a slowdown from the 2.9% growth rate in 2014, Investec predicts growth for 2015 as a whole will come in at 2.2% and will pick up only slightly to 2.4% this year. Shaw implied that growth could turn out even weaker. \u201cThe degree of financial market volatility at the start of this year highlights a more intense set of downside risks facing the economy,\u201d he said. Against the backdrop of a softening world economy and a slowdown in the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney sent clear hints to financial markets last week that interest rates would be held at their record low of 0.5% for many months to come. It is Carney\u2019s US counterparts who will grab market attention this week. After a tumultuous start to the year for stocks and commodities, all eyes will be on the US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision on Wednesday. Having raised borrowing costs for the first time in almost a decade in December, the central bank is widely expected to leave policy on hold for now. Investors will scour the statement accompanying Wednesday\u2019s decision from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for clues as to whether slumping oil prices and stock market volatility will slow the pace of anticipated rate rises this year. Expectations for a March increase have already dimmed in recent weeks. \u201cGiven the turbulence in financial markets, we will be looking to see if the Federal Reserve offers any calming words in the press release accompanying the FOMC policy decision,\u201d said James Knightley, senior economist at ING Financial Markets. \u201cGiven the inflation outlook is increasingly benign and the concerns that market volatility will have a negative influence on sentiment and economic activity, we suspect the general tone will be to emphasise that policy tightening is not on a pre-determined path and that the Fed will be closely watching events.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wall Street\u2019s heavy hitters have a secret: the performance coach. While still rare, money mentors are slowly becoming a trend in the world of finance. They teach traders to remain calm, not panic and be confident. Much of their work has been confidential, until now. Billions, the new high-stakes finance drama that debuted on Showtime last Sunday, has shone a new light on their secret world. The fictional performance coach at Billions\u2019 Axe Capital is played by Maggie Siffs. Her character, Wendy Rhoades, is part HR, part therapist as well as the wife of district attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti). If you are a trader at Axe Capital, one session with Wendy Rhoades can turn your luck around. They call her Dr Mojo. For Wendy Rhoades, helping anxious traders find their alpha and providing support to female traders in the mostly male profession is just a part of a typical day. The hedge fund, where she works, was founded by Bobby \u201cAxe\u201d Axelrod, who also occasionally needs a Mojo makeover. \u201cYour value to this firm is absolute,\u201d he tells her. \u2018Go back to your Bloomberg and cut bait on your losers\u2019 One of Axe\u2019s underlings, Mick Danzig, is played by Nathan Darrow. Darrow\u2019s favorite scene is when Siff\u2019s character tells him: \u201cGo back to your Bloomberg and cut bait on your losers.\u201d In the scene, Darrow\u2019s character \u2013 sporting the typical Wall Street uniform of a fleece vest \u2013 tells Rhoades that his performance has been slipping. \u201cYou don\u2019t need meds. You are just listening to the wrong voice,\u201d Rhoades tells him. You are tuned in to the one yelling at you over the loudspeaker that you are fucking stupid and your performance blows and you are ignoring the quiet one, inside, telling you where the alpha is. Now, that\u2019s the voice that got you here and it\u2019s still there if you are willing to listen. What\u2019s that voice telling you? \u201cStand up,\u201d she orders him, shortly before making him beat his chest while repeating out loud a figure that he brought in last year: $7.2m. That scene is \u201cmore entertainment than reality\u201d, says Denise Shull, a self-styled \u201cneuroeconomist\u201d and performance coach. In real life, there is less chest pounding and more reassuring. Many traders question whether they belong, whether they are smart enough or good enough, Shull says. \u201cEveryone thinks that these guys are super confident and have no self-doubt, but that\u2019s not true. You are always as good as your next trade. There is always an element of continuously wanting to improve themselves.\u201d Without the need to improve, they and their firms might not make it, she said. \u201cAs the competition is increasing in the industry, to be on top of your game, you need to be serious and to be serious about what you do,\u201d says Boris Pilichowski, consultant and trading coach who runs London-based coaching firm Axis Minds. To him, \u201cbeing serious\u201d includes spending time evaluating one\u2019s performance and trying to determine how to improve. \u201cIf you are not looking at your practice and you are not in the mindset of continuous improvement, you aren\u2019t going to make it.\u201d Coaching is still rare on Wall Street Coaching, especially at hedge funds and other financial firms, is still not common. It is, however, a market that\u2019s developing fast, says Pilichowski. Shull estimates that about one in five firms has worked with a performance coach. \u201cA lot of firms don\u2019t get that there is a psychology to trading and working with it and using it as strategy can be a real benefit,\u201d explains Shull, who gets hired by individuals as well as firms. \u201cJust as often I get individuals at firms who say they want to work with a psychology coach but they are afraid to bring it to the firm or their [chief investment officer].\u201d Probably the most well known example of a performance coach working with a hedge fund is Ari Kiev, a psychiatrist who spent more than a decade working with traders at SAC Capital Advisors. A couple of years after Kiev\u2019s death, Shull interviewed with SAC to replace him as the executive coach but did not get the job. Many have speculated that Giamatti\u2019s character on Billions is modeled after US attorney Preet Bharara, and chief Axe man Bobby Axelrod (Damina Lewis) is the fiction version of Steve Cohen, founder of SAC. Andrew Ross Sorkin, the New York Times reporter and co-creator and co-producer of the show, denies that the characters have been modeled after Bharara and Cohen. But the Kiev-angle is only likely to increase speculation. Cohen hired Kiev in 1992. Just months before he died, in January 2009, Kiev announced that he was going to launch a consulting practice. \u201cThis consulting practice effectively allows me to broaden my reach and offer customized services to an increasing number of fund managers who are recognizing the importance of a psychological perspective in managing investments,\u201d he said at the time. Pilichowsky, a former trader, says he works with a small team of hand-selected coaches. Their jobs is not to judge their clients, but rather to work with them and help them improve. Often time this means working with clients on handling stress and raising awareness of how they behave in certain situations. \u201cIt\u2019s psychological, but I don\u2019t put people on the sofa,\u201d says Pilichowski. \u201cWhen you come to a competitive market, it\u2019s all about the emotions because there is nothing that the other guy doesn\u2019t have. If everyone has the same information, everyone has the same power of calculation, everyone has the same spreadsheet, the difference between me and that guy is going to be about the way we manage it emotionally. Don\u2019t panic. Don\u2019t go too fast. Don\u2019t be jealous.\u201d The most common emotion experienced by traders is the fear of missing out, says Shull. \u201cPeople are afraid to just cut their losses because they are afraid the trade will come back. It\u2019s usually not even about the money. It\u2019s about: \u2018If I get out now and the trade comes back, I will look like an idiot\u2019.\u201d As a former trader, Shull says she knows how it feels when traders are \u201cafraid to get out of the loser\u201d. It\u2019s the same problem that Mick Danzig, Nathan Darrow\u2019s character on Billions, struggled with. Shull, who had seen the pilot at the time of the interview, said that she looks forward to watching the first season of the show. \u201cI like Damian Lewis. Obviously, I like the fact that they\u2019ve got a coach on the show. The dominatrix piece of that coach is, you know, kind of interesting,\u201d Shull laughs, referring to Wendy Rhoades\u2019 evening hobby. \u201cI think it will be entertaining.\u201d",

You are just listening to the wrong voice,\u201d Rhoades tells him. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You are tuned in to the one yelling at you over the loudspeaker that you are fucking stupid and your performance blows and you are ignoring the quiet one, inside, telling you where the alpha is.

Many traders question whether they belong, whether they are smart enough or good enough, Shull says.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone thinks that these guys are super confident and have no self-doubt, but that\u2019s not true. You are always as good as your next trade. There is always an element of continuously wanting to improve themselves.\u201d </p> <p>Without the need to improve, they and their firms might not make it, she said. </p> <p>\u201cAs the competition is increasing in the industry, to be on top of your game, you need to be serious and to be serious about what you do,\u201d says Boris Pilichowski, consultant and trading coach who runs London-based coaching firm <a href=\"http://www.axis-minds.com/what-we-do/overview/\">Axis Minds</a>. To him, \u201cbeing serious\u201d includes spending time evaluating one\u2019s performance and trying to determine how to improve. \u201cIf you are not looking at your practice and you are not in the mindset of continuous improvement, you aren\u2019t going to make it.\u201d</p> <h2>Coaching is still rare on Wall Street</h2> <p>Coaching, especially at hedge funds and other financial firms, is still not common. It is, however, a market that\u2019s developing fast, says Pilichowski. Shull estimates that about one in five firms has worked with a performance coach.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of firms don\u2019t get that there is a psychology to trading and working with it and using it as strategy can be a real benefit,\u201d explains Shull, who gets hired by individuals as well as firms. \u201cJust as often I get individuals at firms who say they want to work with a psychology coach but they are afraid to bring it to the firm or their [chief investment officer].\u201d</p> <p>Probably the most well known example of a performance coach working with a hedge fund is Ari Kiev, a psychiatrist who spent more than a decade working with traders at SAC Capital Advisors. A couple of years after Kiev\u2019s death, Shull <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/denise-shull-what-i-learned-at-sac-2012-11\">interviewed with SAC</a> to replace him as the executive coach but did not get the job.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b52a86169c8fd497b9c48deacec4d3a908587168\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b52a86169c8fd497b9c48deacec4d3a908587168/0_18_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damian Lewis as Bobby \u201cAxe\u201d Axelrod and Paul Giamatti as Chuck Rhoades in Billions (Season 1, Episode 1). - Photo: JoJo Whilden/SHOWTIME - Photo ID: Billions_101_5107.R\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damian Lewis as hedge fund owner Bobby \u2018Axe\u2019 Axelrod and Paul Giamatti as district attorney Chuck Rhoades in Billions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JoJo Whilden/Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many have speculated that Giamatti\u2019s character on Billions is modeled after US attorney Preet Bharara, and chief Axe man Bobby Axelrod (Damina Lewis) is the fiction version of Steve Cohen, founder of SAC. Andrew Ross Sorkin, the New York Times reporter and co-creator and co-producer of the show, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/billions-showtime-andrew-ross-sorkin-brings-wall-street-drama-to-tv\">denies </a>that the characters have been modeled after Bharara and Cohen. But the Kiev-angle is only likely to increase speculation.</p> <p>Cohen hired Kiev in 1992. Just months before he died, in January 2009, Kiev announced that he was going to launch a consulting practice. \u201cThis consulting practice effectively allows me to broaden my reach and offer customized services to an increasing number of fund managers who are recognizing the importance of a psychological perspective in managing investments,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/psychiatrist-and-trading-coach-ari-kiev-launches-kiev-consulting-60790217.html\">he said at the time</a>.</p> <p>Pilichowsky, a former trader, says he works with a small team of hand-selected coaches. Their jobs is not to judge their clients, but rather to work with them and help them improve. Often time this means working with clients on handling stress and raising awareness of how they behave in certain situations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s psychological, but I don\u2019t put people on the sofa,\u201d says Pilichowski.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you come to a competitive market, it\u2019s all about the emotions because there is nothing that the other guy doesn\u2019t have. If everyone has the same information, everyone has the same power of calculation, everyone has the same spreadsheet, the difference between me and that guy is going to be about the way we manage it emotionally.

Don\u2019t be jealous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cc5edad9a79c9c1b2acbc8c85206638dcd78cd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cc5edad9a79c9c1b2acbc8c85206638dcd78cd8/0_0_3600_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maggie Siff as Wendy Rhoades in Billions (Season 1, Episode 1). - Photo: JoJo Whilden/SHOWTIME - Photo ID: Billions_101_3674.R\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In one scene, Rhoades admits she gets \u2018turned on\u2019 by her job.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JoJo Whilden/Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most common emotion experienced by traders is the fear of missing out, says Shull.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are afraid to just cut their losses because they are afraid the trade will come back. It\u2019s usually not even about the money. It\u2019s about: \u2018If I get out now and the trade comes back, I will look like an idiot\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>As a former trader, Shull says she knows how it feels when traders are \u201cafraid to get out of the loser\u201d. It\u2019s the same problem that Mick Danzig, Nathan Darrow\u2019s character on Billions, struggled with.</p> <p>Shull, who had seen the pilot at the time of the interview, said that she looks forward to watching the first season of the show. </p> <p>\u201cI like Damian Lewis.

      "bodyText": "Until the spasm in the markets interfered, Davos 2016 was supposed to be about how humankind will cope in the new age of the smart machine. While share prices were gyrating, the bigger picture was obscured. There is a fourth industrial revolution happening and it is likely to be as profound in its effects as the previous three. The first Industrial Revolution was about harnessing steam power so that muscle could be replaced by machines. The second was driven by electricity and a cluster of inventions from the late 19th century onwards \u2013 including the internal combustion engine, the aeroplane and moving pictures. A third revolution began in the 1960s and was based on digital technology, personal computing and the development of the internet. Industrial Revolution 4.0 will be shaped by a fresh wave of innovation in areas such as driverless cars, smart robotics, materials that are lighter and tougher, and a manufacturing process built around 3D printing. A pity then that the World Economic Forum was overshadowed by falling share prices and the cost of oil because the impact of the fourth industrial revolution will be felt long after investors have stopped fretting about a hard landing in China. Davos was, in some ways, a good forum for the gathering of technology pioneers, business leaders and politicians to consider some of the implications of what will be a very different sort of economy. Just to take one example, smart machines will soon be able to replace all sorts of workers, from accountants to delivery drivers and from estate agents to people handling routine motor insurance claims. On one estimate, 47% of US jobs are at risk from automation. This is Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s \u201cgales of creative destruction\u201d with a vengeance. There are three myths about Industrial Revolution 4.0. The first is that it won\u2019t really have as big an impact as the previous periods of change, most especially the breakthroughs associated with the second industrial revolution. In the past, it has always taken time to feel the full effects of technological change and many of today\u2019s advances are in their infancy. It is far too early to say that the car or air travel will prove to be less important than the sequencing of the human genome or synthetic biology. The second myth is that the process will be trouble free provided everything is left to the market. It is a fantasy to believe that the wealth created by the fourth Industrial Revolution will cascade down from rich to poor, and that those displaced will just walk into another job that pays just as well. Indeed, all the evidence so far is that the benefits of the coming change will be concentrated among a relatively small elite, thus exacerbating the current trend towards greater levels of inequality. This was a point stressed by the Swiss bank UBS in a report launched in Davos. It notes that there will be a \u201cpolarisation of the labour force as low-skill jobs continue to be automated and this trend increasingly spreads to middle class jobs.\u201d A similar argument is made by Klaus Schwab, the man who runs Davos, in a book on the Fourth Industrial Revolution handed to each of the delegates at this year\u2019s World Economic Forum. Schwab compares Detroit in 1990 with Silicon Valley in 2014. In 1990 the three biggest companies in Detroit had a market capitalisation of $36bn (\u00a325bn), revenues of $250bn and 1.2 million employees. In 2014, the three biggest companies in Silicon Valley had a considerably higher market capitalisation ($1.09tn) generated roughly the same revenues ($247bn) but with about 10 times fewer employees (137,000). It is easier to make money today with fewer workers than it was a quarter of a century ago. Setting up and running a car company was an expensive business and required a lot of workers. A company that makes its money out of a smart app requires less capital, doesn\u2019t have to pay for storage or transport in the way that car companies do and incurs virtually no extra costs as the number of users increases. In the jargon of economics, the marginal costs per unit of output tend towards zero and the returns to scale are high. This explains why tech entrepreneurs can get very rich very young. Technological change has always been disruptive. There was a polarisation of income and wealth in the first wave of industrialisation at the beginning of the the 19th century, and this gave rise to political and institutional change over the 100 years between 1850 and 1950: the spread of democracy; the emergence of trade unions; progressive taxation and the development of social safety nets. These helped create bigger markets for the consumer goods that were spawned by the second Industrial Revolution: TVs, radios, vacuum cleaners and the like. But over the past four decades a political model that both facilitated the spread of technology and provided some protection against its disruptive consequences has come under attack. Welfare states have become less generous, levels of long-term unemployment are much higher, taxation has become less progressive, politics has increasingly been dominated by those with the deepest pockets who can lobby the loudest. Philip Jennings, general secretary of the global UNI union said: \u201cWe need some governance to ensure a democratic evolution and that requires public policy discussion. There is the opportunity to shape technology to improve people\u2019s lives; through connectivity, education, health. We shouldn\u2019t be fearful and fatalist about it.\u201d There is, though, a third and final myth: namely that all will be well provided the fruits of an economy dominated by artificial intelligence and smart robots can be redistributed, perhaps through a citizen\u2019s income so that we can all have more leisure time when machines do all the work. But redistribution, even assuming it happens, is only part of the story. Making his first visit to Davos, the Archbishop of Canterbury said the changes likely to be brought about required not just an economic but also a spiritual response. \u201cThis is not just about money, it is about what it is to be human\u201d, said Justin Welby. Schwab said: \u201cThe changes are so profound that, from the perspective of human history, there has never been a time of greater promise or potential peril. My concern, however, is that decision makers are too often caught in traditional, linear (and non-disruptive) thinking or too absorbed by immediate concerns to think strategically about the forces of disruption and innovation shaping our future.\u201d He\u2019s right, although there is a simpler way of putting it: faced with the challenge of disruptive new technology, the current political framework is no longer fit for purpose and its shortcomings are likely to lead to a backlash that could turn very nasty. That should concern not just Schwab and the Archbishop of Canterbury but also the investment bankers of Wall Street and the tech billionaires of Silicon Valley.",

Welfare states have become less generous, levels of long-term unemployment are much higher, taxation has become less progressive, politics has increasingly been dominated by those with the deepest pockets who can lobby the loudest. </p> <p>Philip Jennings, general secretary of the global UNI union said: \u201cWe need some governance to ensure a democratic evolution and that requires public policy discussion. There is the opportunity to shape technology to improve people\u2019s lives; through connectivity, education, health. We shouldn\u2019t be fearful and fatalist about it.\u201d </p> <p>There is, though, a third and final myth: namely that all will be well provided the fruits of an economy dominated by artificial intelligence and smart robots can be redistributed, perhaps through a citizen\u2019s income so that we can all have more leisure time when machines do all the work.</p> <p>But redistribution, even assuming it happens, is only part of the story. Making his first visit to Davos, the Archbishop of Canterbury said the changes likely to be brought about required not just an economic but also a spiritual response. \u201cThis is not just about money, it is about what it is to be human\u201d, said Justin Welby.</p> <p>Schwab said: \u201cThe changes are so profound that, from the perspective of human history, there has never been a time of greater promise or potential peril. My concern, however, is that decision makers are too often caught in traditional, linear (and non-disruptive) thinking or too absorbed by immediate concerns to think strategically about the forces of disruption and innovation shaping our future.\u201d </p> <p>He\u2019s right, although there is a simpler way of putting it: faced with the challenge of disruptive new technology, the current political framework is no longer fit for purpose and its shortcomings are likely to lead to a backlash that could turn very nasty. That should concern not just Schwab and the Archbishop of Canterbury but also the investment bankers of Wall Street and the tech billionaires of Silicon Valley.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Blink and you missed last week\u2019s turmoil on the financial markets. On Wednesday, billions were wiped off share prices; on Thursday and Friday they were wiped back on. The FTSE 100 index ended the week higher than it started. Just a bout of new year jitters? Can investors now settle back and enjoy a period of calm? Probably not. It is easy to laugh, or groan, at markets\u2019 ability to swing from gloom to optimism, but volatility tends not to appear out of thin air. Take a step back from this week\u2019s excitement and remember that London\u2019s blue-chip index has lost about 1200 points since its closing peak of 7104 in April last year. The factors driving that 17% decline are unlikely to disappear quickly. Last week\u2019s brief panic suggests investors fear it wouldn\u2019t take much to intensify the pressure. The first ingredient is the oil price. In theory, low prices \u2013 transferring wealth from oil exporting countries to oil importers \u2013 are good for global growth because consuming economies tend to spend their gains more readily. But the process is neither mechanical nor instantaneous. The immediate effect of lower oil prices is cuts in investments by oil companies. Some $400bn (\u00a3280bn) of projects are reckoned to have been cancelled or delayed in the past year. Further down the economic chain, airlines can afford to delay investment in more efficient planes when fuel is cheap. That all represents activity removed from the global economy. Corporate earnings, taken as a whole, could fall before cheap oil relubricates the engine. Second, there is China, where 2015 saw the slowest rate of economic growth for a quarter of a century. A rate of 6.9% (if one trusts the official data) still looks slick when viewed from the west; what\u2019s more, it\u2019s what the Chinese authorities had modelled as they attempted to encourage consumption to replace an unsustainable level of spending on infrastructure. But how is that Chinese growth being generated? If the explanation is merely larger helpings of debt \u2013 in an economy assumed to be riddled with bad loans and loss-making steel makers, shipbuilders and other state-backed enterprises \u2013 that is not sustainable either. In the meantime, confidence has been dented in Beijing\u2019s ability to keep all the balls in the air. The handling of the upsets in China\u2019s own stock market has veered from naive to farcical. A third factor \u2013 less obvious, but critical to big investors\u2019 mood \u2013 may be the US Federal Reserve\u2019s quarter-point increase in interest rates at the end of last year. Central banks \u2013 especially the Fed \u2013 were the handmaidens to the post-2009 recovery in stock markets as their quantitative easing and cheap money forced down bond yields and drove investors into riskier investments. A first increase in US rates since 2006 was meant to signal the moment when the US economy, at least, was strong enough to leave the hospital ward. The problem is that the rest of the world may not be. There may be $1 trillion of dollar-denominated loans in China, for example. That limits China\u2019s ability to devalue the yuan \u2013 but a devaluation may yet be seen in Beijing as the lesser evil, if growth slows further. A serious devaluation, as opposed to the baby steps taken so far, would re-set the terms of global trade, probably with grim consequences in the rest of Asia. There are, of course, many reasons to think calamity will not happen. The International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts this week but still expects 2016 to be stronger than 2015. The Fed could ease pressure caused by a stronger dollar by delaying further rate rises; already Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank is dropping hints that he could step up quantitative easing in the eurozone. Cheaper oil should, eventually, raise spirits among the winners. The muddle-through thesis, then, is definitely alive. But the alternative \u2013 a serious global slowdown \u2013 no longer looks such an outside bet. Expect more wild days for share prices. Shell\u2019s white elephant? Oil workers in Aberdeen will be watching events in the Hague this coming Wednesday as closely as anyone. They will be hoping that some miracle occurs so that Dutch and other international investors in Shell suddenly swing against the \u00a335bn merger with rival BG that is coming up for a final vote. Ben van Beurden, the Shell chief executive, will almost certainly win the day and that could result in many Scottish oil workers being sacrificed in a blitz of job cuts needed to justify the tie-up. Europe\u2019s biggest oil company only needs 51% of the votes and, while the City has generally grumbled about it, only one well-known shareholder, Standard Life, has pledged to vote \u201cno\u201d. The agreed takeover was hatched when the price of Brent blend was sailing along at over $60. Now that it is down to half that level, the deal does not really make sense. Shell argues the cost of crude will bounce back soon enough. Even if that is not the case, then a package of measures to cut combined costs will ensure that the deal is \u201cvalue-enhancing\u201d, as the corporates like to say. Shell has already slashed 500 jobs in the North Sea, an area that is the highest-cost oil province in the world and will be an easy target for further savings. The oil giant has promised to cut 10,000 jobs this year worldwide and sell off \u00a320bn of assets from a combined entity. Most investors in Shell have decided to believe Van Beurden. Why? Few want a public row with such an illustrious name as Shell and some will have an investment banking arm making a fortune out of the fees for arranging this buyout. They may also own BG shares and therefore the deal balances out for them. But a lot of it is just inertia. It is the corporate equivalent of a white elephant, like the HS2 rail line or Hinkley Point power station. Who wants to create a fuss, properly crunch the numbers and stand in its way? Sterling slide While everyone watches the equity markets, the pound is quietly falling out of bed. Sterling has dropped 7% in trade-weighted terms in just two months. That\u2019s a fall only surpassed once since the monetary policy committee took control of UK interest rates in 1997, say economists at investment bank UBS. So what is going on? The economic signals, from weak retail sales to falling factory output, point to an economic slowdown. But nothing dramatic enough to justify such a sell-off in the pound. The Bank of England has hinted at interest rates staying on hold for the time being, just as its US counterpart starts to raise borrowing costs. But again, this only goes part way to explaining sterling\u2019s slide. It leaves one obvious culprit: Britain\u2019s looming EU referendum. With polls tight, expect more pressure on the pound as the Brexit vote approaches. It\u2019s good news for embattled exporters, but not so nice for holidaymakers.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s nine months since Shell announced it was buying BG Group in an agreed \u00a347bn deal and almost everything has changed. Back in April, the oil price appeared to be recovering from its fall below $50 a barrel but the price has since plunged below $30. The International Energy Agency warned last week it could fall further in a world \u201cawash\u201d with oil. Shell and BG shareholders vote on the takeover this week but, despite the industry\u2019s dire state, they will approve the deal, now worth \u00a335bn to reflect Shell\u2019s depressed share price. This is partly due to faith in the ability of Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, to make it work. It\u2019s also because most big shareholders don\u2019t want to rock the boat in public with a company as powerful as Shell. Only Standard Life has broken ranks by declaring it would vote against. Big oil mergers in the past were defensive measures to bulk up when markets were bad, but the Shell-BG combo was meant to be more strategic. Van Beurden took over two years ago with a reputation as a cost cutter and he will need to display that ability. His task has been made easier by Helge Lund, BG\u2019s boss, who only worked a few weeks before his chairman agreed the deal with Shell. BG\u2019s results last week were good and Lund will at least have earned some of the \u00a325m he is expected to get when he leaves. A big week of numbers for the British economy After the chancellor\u2019s new year warning of a cocktail of threats to the economy and an alarming start to 2016 in the markets, Thursday\u2019s GDP figure will get more attention than usual. The first estimate for the fourth quarter of 2015 will appear in the same week as two CBI sector surveys. Monday\u2019s industrial trends figures could make gloomy reading, with manufacturing expected to suffer from the slowdown in China and continued weakness in the eurozone. On the same day as the GDP announcement, the CBI\u2019s distributive trades survey, which charts retail activity, could give an indication of whether consumers were starting to worry about bad economic signals at the end of 2015. Last week\u2019s official retail sales figures showed tills rang less in December than they have for six years. Economists had pencilled in growth of 0.5% for the fourth quarter after a figure of 0.4% the previous quarter, a Reuters poll carried out before the retail sales figures revealed. But because the UK relies so heavily on consumer spending, some scribblers are now preparing for a weaker number. There may be trouble ahead. Dixons hopes for a Christmas camel Dixons Carphone reports on Christmas trading this week but people should already have a rough idea of how things went. The electricals retailer published a trading statement a week or so before Christmas and reported its busiest day ever on the Black Friday discount day in late November. Seb James, the ebullient chief executive, said trading had dipped after Black Friday but argued this was part of a new pattern resembling two humps of a camel. He predicted record Boxing Day sales during the post-Christmas second hump. If James\u2019s confidence is borne out, the owner of Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse will be one of the winners from a tough Christmas for Britain\u2019s retailers. It will be interesting to see what sold, given that Argos, one of the losers, suffered falling demand for tablets and white goods while AO World, the online retailer, sold lots of white goods, TVs and kitchen gadgets. Dixons probably gained at Argos\u2019s expense because its rival had problems with its website, whereas Dixons\u2019s seems to have held up during the festive onslaught. Televisions, NutriBullets and fitness trackers were selling well when old Etonian James \u2013 a friend of David Cameron and one of Britain\u2019s poshest bosses \u2013 last updated the market.",

His task has been made easier by Helge Lund, BG\u2019s boss, who only worked a few weeks before his chairman agreed the deal with Shell. BG\u2019s results last week were good and Lund will at least have earned some of the \u00a325m he is expected to get when he leaves.</p> <h2>A big week of numbers for the British economy</h2> <p>After the chancellor\u2019s new year warning of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/07/george-osborne-warns-uk-economy-faces-cocktail-of-threats\" title=\"\">a cocktail of threats to the economy</a> and an alarming start to 2016 in the markets, Thursday\u2019s GDP figure will get more attention than usual.</p> <p>The first estimate for the fourth quarter of 2015 will appear in the same week as two CBI sector surveys. Monday\u2019s industrial trends figures could make gloomy reading, with manufacturing expected to suffer from the slowdown in China and continued weakness in the eurozone.</p> <p>On the same day as the GDP announcement, the CBI\u2019s distributive trades survey, which charts retail activity, could give an indication of whether consumers were starting to worry about bad economic signals at the end of 2015. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/22/fears-for-economy-as-christmas-dip-in-retail-sales-is-revealed\" title=\"\">Last week\u2019s official retail sales figures</a> showed tills rang less in December than they have for six&#xa0;years.</p> <p>Economists had pencilled in growth of 0.5% for the fourth quarter after a figure of 0.4% the previous quarter, a Reuters poll carried out before the retail sales figures revealed. But because the UK relies so heavily on consumer spending, some scribblers are now preparing for a weaker number. There may be trouble ahead.</p> <h2>Dixons hopes for a Christmas camel</h2> <p>Dixons Carphone reports on Christmas trading this week but people should already have a rough idea of how things went. The electricals retailer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/dixons-carphone-beats-forecast-with-23-percent-rise-in-profits\" title=\"\">published a trading statement a week or so before Christmas</a> and reported its busiest day ever on the Black Friday discount day in late November.</p> <p>Seb James, the ebullient chief executive, said trading had dipped after Black Friday but argued this was part of a new pattern resembling two humps of a camel. He predicted record Boxing Day sales during the post-Christmas second hump.</p> <p>If James\u2019s confidence is borne out, the owner of Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse will be one of the winners from a tough Christmas for Britain\u2019s retailers. It will be interesting to see what sold, given that Argos, one of the losers, suffered falling demand for tablets and white goods while AO World, the online retailer, sold lots of white goods, TVs and kitchen gadgets.</p> <p>Dixons probably gained at Argos\u2019s expense because its rival had problems with its website, whereas Dixons\u2019s seems to have held up during the festive onslaught. Televisions, NutriBullets and fitness trackers were selling well when old Etonian James \u2013 a friend of David Cameron and one of Britain\u2019s poshest bosses \u2013 last updated the market.</p>",

But Britain would miss the European Union even more.\u201d The speaker was a senior member of the Italian government, in response to a question about the attitude of Italians to the thorny issue of Brexit. The occasion was the annual Venice Seminar, where members of the Italian government speak frankly, but not for direct attribution, on the political and economic scene. For many years the views expressed at those seminars about the Italian economy have been a triumph of hope over experience. For example, the Italian economy managed, after the initial impact of the great recession of 2008-10, to contract further in 2011 and 2012 when even the British economy was beginning to recover. There was then a period of flatlining during which optimistic forecasts were offered to us, but never fulfilled, as Italians hung on to their substantial savings and spent little. It now looks as though Italian \u201cconsumers\u201d \u2013 ie citizens \u2013 are dipping into their savings and the economy is finally growing again, assisted by various measures which it is claimed have boosted confidence. There is also, of course, the beneficial impact on real incomes of the lower price of oil. At a time when much of the gloom and doom emanating from Davos stems from the impact on the finances of oil-exporting nations, the bonus to oil-importing nations seems to have been underestimated. I hope I am not alone in being slightly surprised that, after the serious recessions experienced in the west and Japan as a consequence of the two oil shocks of the 1970s \u2013 when huge increases in the price removed purchasing power and caused a serious inflationary spiral \u2013 the reverse movement in oil prices should also be considered an all-round disaster. There are winners and losers. Apart from anything else, the impact on inflation is such that policymakers have a lot of scope to relax fiscal policy without in any way breaching their inflation targets. Italian ministers and officials are rightly calling for greater flexibility from Brussels with regard to fiscal rules on taxation and public spending. They feel they have gone a long way in meeting cries for \u201cstructural reform\u201d of the economy, although there is no doubt plenty of scope for more. Meanwhile, as prime minister Matteo Renzi points out: \u201cThe EU fixation on austerity is actually destroying growth.\u201d The difference drawn by Italian officials between current attitudes towards the EU in the UK and Italy is between \u201cEuroscepticism\u201d in the UK and \u201cEurocriticism\u201d in Italy. (Edward Heath, who, as prime minister, took us into what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, had another word to describe the anti-Europeans in his party: \u201cEuroseptics\u201d, pronounced with some venom.) The Italian government is already preparing for a conference in Rome next year to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Amid the travails of countries such as Spain and Italy during an economic crisis caused by the financial crash and exacerbated by the structure of the eurozone and its policies, the continued devotion to the euro has often puzzled outsiders. In that respect, it is interesting to see that our own prime minister, after some ambivalence, has adopted the view I first heard from George Soros: namely that by being a member of the EU but not of the eurozone or the Schengen agreement \u2013 passport-free movement in continental Europe \u2013 the UK has \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d. More than 60 years have passed since the Messina conference of 1955, where the groundwork for the Treaty of Rome was prepared, but which prime minister Anthony Eden refused to attend. His more enlightened successors spent most of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s trying to persuade the French that we wanted to rectify Eden\u2019s mistake. It is difficult for many of us who followed all the shenanigans \u2013 including the successive \u201cNo\u2019s\u201d from President de Gaulle \u2013 to believe that, at a time when there are so many pressing problems that require pan-European cooperation, the Conservative party should be so obsessed with Brexit. From now until the referendum, the public are going to be bombarded with statistics from both sides. It will not be the end of the world if we leave, but it will almost certainly be the end of the UK, on the reasonable assumption that Scotland would want to break away. The idea that we should tear up treaty arrangements negotiated over decades, and then renegotiate from a position of bargaining weakness, almost beggars belief. Moreover, it is an ill-founded scare story that if we remain in the EU we are destined to participate in a political union. The others know our position and accept it, but are quite happy to go along with a Cameron claim that this reality is the result of triumphant negotiations on his part. There is endless reading available on the pros and cons of being in or out, but one highly readable book is Brexit by Denis MacShane, who was minister for Europe in the Blair government. It is subtitled \u201cHow Britain Will Leave Europe\u201d but that is a publisher\u2019s come-on. MacShane hopes it won\u2019t happen, but fears it will unless the pro-Europeans get their act together. My own view is that the British remain essentially conservative with a very small \u201cc\u201d and, other things being equal, would balk at such a retrograde step. But the opinion polls are worrying for us pro-Europeans, and the prime minister, although now apparently having stood up to be counted, is terrified of how migration will affect public opinion. I therefore draw solace from the fact that last week the odds at William Hill were 2-5 for a vote to stay in and 9-5 for Brexit. The big question is: will voters follow the money in the end?",

      "bodyText": "What is happening on global markets? The new year kicked off with a global stock market and commodities rout over worries about the global economic outlook and China\u2019s economy in particular. Plunging prices recovered at the end of last week, partly on reassurances of more stimulus to come from the European Central Bank, but traders are bracing for more volatility. At one point, oil prices fell below $28 per barrel \u2013 a 25% drop since the start of the year \u2013 on the combined effects of a supply glut and waning demand. Investors have dumped riskier stocks in favour of safe-haven assets, such as gold and government bonds. The FTSE 100 index of London-listed shares bounced back but is still down more than 5% since the start of the year. What do the experts think? Cutting its forecasts for global growth, the International Monetary Fund expressed concern about a slowdown in emerging market economies, China\u2019s difficult rebalancing away from an exports-driven economy, lower commodity prices and the ending of ultra-loose monetary policy in the US, which has just raised its interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The IMF warned that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed if key challenges are mishandled. The European Central Bank has also pointed to the downward pressure on eurozone growth for similar reasons. Its president, Mario Draghi, hinted the ECB was ready to print more money and cut borrowing costs, to counter those headwinds. What is China\u2019s role in this? Worries about China\u2019s true economic strength are at the heart of the jitters. After more than a decade of double-digit growth, during which it overtook Japan to become the world\u2019s second largest economy, things have inevitably slowed down. Last year China\u2019s GDP officially expanded by 6.9%, the slowest pace for 25 years; some say the true picture could well be half that. Other economic data from China has underscored the country\u2019s mammoth task of rebalancing the economy away from reliance on its vast manufacturing sector and exports to a more diverse mix. China\u2019s woes are being felt in other economies because it is such a big commodities consumer: the slowdown in the world\u2019s biggest energy user is weighing on oil prices. There have also been dramatic swings on China\u2019s stock markets. A debt-fuelled rush of individual investors helped inflate a bubble on China\u2019s main exchanges but it burst last summer. There have been more steep falls in recent weeks. The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen is down 16% since the start of this year and 42% since a peak last June. More worrying are the moves in China\u2019s currency. Beijing stunned markets last August by devaluing the yuan, taken by some as a distress signal. A weaker yuan cheapens Chinese exports, shoring up its manufacturing sector. But the fear is that China will \u201cexport\u201d deflation because a cheaper yuan cuts the price of its imports in advanced economies. Sharp swings in the currency this month have fanned fears China could repeat last summer\u2019s move but policymakers insist they have no fresh intentions to weaken the yuan. Finally, there is scant confidence among investors in Beijing\u2019s ability to manage economic transition following a string of seemingly futile interventions in markets and confused messages from policymakers. Six interest rate cuts since November 2014 have failed to halt the economic slowdown. A mechanism to curb stock exchange volatility \u2013 a so-called \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d \u2013 was introduced this month and then scrapped within days after it appeared to merely exacerbate the mayhem on markets. Amid worries about whether Beijing will keep its word over stabilising the yuan, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has urged China to communicate better with financial markets. But China cannot carry the blame alone, say experts. Despite rapid growth it makes up only 13% of the world economy, notes Ha-Joon Chang, who teaches economics at Cambridge University. As of 2014, the US, the eurozone and Japan together accounted for nearly half of the world economy. \u201cThe rich world vastly overshadows China,\u201d Chang says. Is this a repeat of the 2008 crisis? Speaking in Davos, billionaire speculator George Soros said: \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market \u2026 The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub-prime housing. Today it is China, where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d Others warn that the vast money-printing programmes by central banks known as quantitative easing have flooded markets with easy money and propped up asset prices while little has been done in the last seven years to address fundamental economic problems. Those analysts warn that big imbalances remain in the global economy, that the world\u2019s banking system has not been reined in and national governments have made little progress in restructuring their economies towards more diverse sources of jobs and growth. Should investors keep calm and carry on? Yes, say other experts: the underlying economic data is not that weak and markets will soon stabilise. Emerging economies with dollar-denominated debts are certainly facing challenges as the US raises interest rates, but the outlook for the dominant developed economies looks better, they argue. Even Nouriel Roubini, the economist known as Dr Doom who predicted the last crash, told Davos: \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d Fears about China are also overdone, say others, including Steve Schwarzman, billionaire boss of the private equity firm Blackstone Group. \u201cIf I thought China was in a freefall I would be really concerned. I actually don\u2019t. The consumer and the service economy is holding up pretty well in China,\u201d Schwarzman told Bloomberg Television in Davos.",

Other economic data from China has underscored the country\u2019s mammoth task of rebalancing the economy away from reliance on its vast manufacturing sector and exports to a more diverse mix.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5371ee8b9fbad42c366f3c6398ae2720821d2ba8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5371ee8b9fbad42c366f3c6398ae2720821d2ba8/0_23_3618_2171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A container ship being loaded in Qingdao, Shandong province, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A container ship being loaded in Qingdao, Shandong province, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China\u2019s woes are being felt in other economies because it is such a big commodities consumer: the slowdown in the world\u2019s biggest energy user is weighing on oil prices. There have also been dramatic swings on China\u2019s stock markets. A debt-fuelled rush of individual investors helped inflate a bubble on China\u2019s main exchanges but it burst last summer. There have been more steep falls in recent weeks. The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen is down 16% since the start of this year and 42% since a peak last June.</p> <p>More worrying are the moves in China\u2019s currency. Beijing stunned markets last August by devaluing the yuan, taken by some as a distress signal. A weaker yuan cheapens Chinese exports, shoring up its manufacturing sector. But the fear is that China will \u201cexport\u201d deflation because a cheaper yuan cuts the price of its imports in advanced economies. Sharp swings in the currency this month have fanned fears China could repeat last summer\u2019s move but policymakers insist they have no fresh intentions to weaken the yuan.</p> <p>Finally, there is scant confidence among investors in Beijing\u2019s ability to manage economic transition following a string of seemingly futile interventions in markets and confused messages from policymakers. Six interest rate cuts since November 2014 have failed to halt the economic slowdown. A mechanism to curb stock exchange volatility \u2013 a so-called \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d \u2013 was introduced this month and then scrapped within days after it appeared to merely exacerbate the mayhem on markets. Amid worries about whether Beijing will keep its word over stabilising the yuan, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has urged China to communicate better with financial markets.</p> <p>But China cannot carry the blame alone, say experts. Despite rapid growth it makes up only 13% of the world economy, notes Ha-Joon Chang, who teaches economics at Cambridge University. As of 2014, the US, the eurozone and Japan together accounted for nearly half of the world economy. \u201cThe rich world vastly overshadows China,\u201d Chang says.</p> <h2><strong>Is this a repeat of the 2008 crisis?</strong><br></h2> <p>Speaking in Davos, billionaire speculator George Soros said: \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market&#xa0;\u2026 The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub-prime housing. Today it is China, where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d Others warn that the vast money-printing programmes by central banks known as quantitative easing have flooded markets with easy money and propped up asset prices while little has been done in the last seven years to address fundamental economic problems. Those analysts warn that big imbalances remain in the global economy, that the world\u2019s banking system has not been reined in and national governments have made little progress in restructuring their economies towards more diverse sources of jobs and growth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afcfb8de68616b932e0f1c7be022995263fe9c11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afcfb8de68616b932e0f1c7be022995263fe9c11/0_41_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Soros\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Soros: \u2018The cause of the disequilibrium is different.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Should investors keep calm and carry on?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, say other experts: the underlying economic data is not that weak and markets will soon stabilise. Emerging economies with dollar-denominated debts are certainly facing challenges as the US raises interest rates, but the outlook for the dominant developed economies looks better, they argue. Even Nouriel Roubini, the economist known as Dr Doom who predicted the last crash, told Davos: \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d</p> <p>Fears about China are also overdone, say others, including Steve Schwarzman, billionaire boss of the private equity firm Blackstone Group. \u201cIf I thought China was in a freefall I would be really concerned. I actually don\u2019t. The consumer and the service economy is holding up pretty well in China,\u201d Schwarzman told Bloomberg Television in Davos.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They were studying the snow forecasts in Davos on Friday. But the 3,000 bankers and CEOs who had flown to the Swiss ski resort for the annual gathering of the global business elite were not interested in what conditions would be like on the slopes this weekend. Rather, they were focused on the monster blizzard stalking the US. At the end of a week in which the price of oil had fallen to a 12-year low, the price of the black stuff was finally moving north again, breaching the symbolic $30 mark. The reason? Traders were betting that demand for fuel would increase as the big freeze gripped large parts of the US. The world\u2019s stock markets were also clawing back lost ground. With many having been in bear territory \u2013 defined as a 20% fall from their peak \u2013 they were buoyed by hints from the European Central Bank that it was considering further action to boost the eurozone\u2019s crumbling economy. It was the signal that the markets were desperate for after days of relentless bad news that stretched from the Arabian Gulf to Wall Street, from steelworks in south Wales to oil rigs in the North Sea, and which had begun with the bombshell announcement that China\u2019s GDP had grown by \u201conly\u201d 6.9% in 2015, its lowest rate in 25 years. As the Davos jamboree wound up on Saturday, Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse, captured the mood. \u201cThe market is very worried about China,\u201d he said, adding that dealers were sceptical about official figures showing its economy was growing at close to 7%. \u201cThe markets believe there may be a hard landing or a very significant reduction in growth which will have a big impact on the rest of the world. There is a fear that we are walking into a global recession.\u201d But with central banks\u2019 interest rates at historic lows and billions of pounds in quantitative easing \u2013 printing money \u2013 expended, the institutions charged with breathing life into a flatlining global economy have few weapons to draw on. \u201cI think that the arsenal of many central banks has been significantly depleted and we no longer have many of the options that existed in years past,\u201d said Eric R Peterson, partner at consultancy giant A T Kearney. \u201cMy sense is that we have an incredibly complex and challenging combination of short-term and long-term-range challenges to face. When you put it all together, in my view you have a global economy on a hair-trigger. In the short term even the most minor shocks or perturbations can generate very significant effects.\u201d Sitting off the coast of Iran in the Strait of Hormuz are huge tankers loaded with an estimated 50 million barrels of oil now waiting to be given their destination. Ship brokers in London are on red alert for new business coming out of Iran as one of the world\u2019s largest oil producers bursts back into life, now that sanctions against it have been lifted. Tanker experts at Clarkson, the world\u2019s biggest broker, said they had already seen one request to charter a Suezmax-sized tanker for a shipment of crude from Iran to a westward destination. \u201cThings are a bit hazy at the moment, and it will take time to get going,\u201d said one broker, pointing out the sanctions deal was signed off only last weekend. But already Iran\u2019s re-entry to the oil markets is having an impact. And it could not have come at a worse time. The International Energy Agency is warning that oil markets could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d this year. The US fracking revolution has meant the world\u2019s superpower is no longer heavily reliant on Middle Eastern oil. But, despite this, Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers are keeping the wells pumping. This is happening at a time when economies are slowing, which means a decline in demand for fuel. And it is not just China that is causing concern. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest global forecast downgrades the outlook for many emerging countries, notably Russia, Brazil and South Africa. For commodity producers \u2013 the likes of mining firms that extract iron ore and steel manufacturers \u2013 a global slowdown threatens their profitability. Many have seen their share prices plunge as analysts judge them to be overvalued. And where commodity producers lead, other businesses often follow. \u201cI think the concern about the recovery remaining fragile must have increased and that, even if the market is overreacting, the downturn in stock prices could be bad for the economy,\u201d said Wouter Den Haan, an economics professor at the London School of Economics. \u201cWe may get a stalling of the recovery or possibly another recession. I don\u2019t see Armageddon, but I do see the risk factors on the downside getting bigger.\u201d A chief concern is that the recovery after the 2008 crash has been built on shaky foundations. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through this major recession and lots of these problems aren\u2019t really fixed,\u201d Den Haan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the financial sector has changed that much. Growth in the UK and US is nice, but it\u2019s really not the kind of growth that we\u2019ve seen in past recoveries.\u201d At Davos it was left to Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, to promote an upbeat message. She pointed out that the fund predicts the world economy will grow 3.4% this year, up from 3.1% in 2015. But even Lagarde had to temper this message by admitting there were four significant downside risks to the prediction: China; the impact of falling commodity prices on producers; the fragile state of some emerging market economies such as Russia and Brazil; and the possible disruption that could be caused by the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates when other central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, are still providing additional stimulus. Concerns about these risks are gaining momentum. As Thiam pointed out, large institutional investors have been taking their money out of the markets. Some of the exodus has been driven by the huge sovereign wealth funds that were built up by the major oil producers when the cost of crude was above $100 a barrel, liquidating investments now that oil prices are plunging. But psychology is also playing a part. The herd is in danger of stampeding. One senior policy maker attending Davos said he was reassured that commercial banks were now forced to hold more capital as insurance against losses than was the case two years ago, because otherwise the meltdown would have been more serious. This may help to explain why the prevailing view in Davos was that, at best, 2016 will be a bumpy year marked by modest growth and market turbulence. But, in private, many were more pessimistic. The unspoken fear is that 2016 could turn into another slump similar to that which followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. This is certainly the view of Albert Edwards, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and the City\u2019s leading bear. In a recent and characteristically pessimistic note to his bank\u2019s clients, Edwards warned that the world was on the brink of \u201canother debacle every bit as large as the 2008 global financial crisis\u201d. His warning was heavy on hyperbole. \u201cI believe the events we now see unfolding will drive us back into global recession,\u201d said Edwards, who predicts \u201ca trade war not unlike that in the 1930s\u201d. He pointed out that, on 23 December, in response to the devaluing of China\u2019s yuan currency, a move that made its exports cheaper, the US hiked tariffs on Chinese steel imports by a staggering 256%. For workers caught in the crossfire, a trade war can be ruinous. The 750 workers at Tata Steel\u2019s plant at Port Talbot in south Wales who were laid off last week know only too well what the cheap price of Chinese steel means. Oil rig workers in the North Sea also face an uncertain future as other oil producers refuse to blink and continue feeding the global glut. More than a dozen offshore rigs, the highest number in more than a decade, have been towed into the Scottish Firth as the plunge in crude prices has all but killed off North Sea exploration. Two rigs have already been towed away to be scrapped in Turkey. More are expected to arrive soon. Edwards is clear about whom he blames for what is happening to the global economy. The central banks\u2019 deployment of quantitative easing \u2013 the buying back of debt from banks to give them cash to start lending again \u2013 has helped inflate asset prices around the world. \u201cThe illusion of prosperity is shattered as boom now turns to bust,\u201d Edwards warns. Such strident views are not shared by many economists. But even more moderate commentators, notably the Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz, appear concerned that the economic tectonic plates are shifting. \u201cThere\u2019s a reasonable chance that there is something more fundamental going on,\u201d Stiglitz said last week. \u201cThere was a kind of excessive euphoria; undoubtedly the QE monetary policy pumped up asset prices but didn\u2019t do much for pumping up the real economy. Where was all the liquidity going? Some of it went just into the balance sheet and wasn\u2019t lent out, but some of it went to increasing asset prices. \u201cMany analysts, including me, believed that there was going to be a major correction. Very hard to tell when. Whenever there is such a major correction there are ups and downs.\u201d The turbulence in the markets \u2013 and in particular the speed with which it has erupted \u2013 caught the Bank of England wrongfooted. Having been upbeat about the UK\u2019s economic prospects only late last year, governor Mark Carney finds himself declaring \u201cnow is not the time to raise UK rates\u201d. While this is good news for people with variable rate mortgages, it is an embarrassing admission that the economic recovery is built on anything but solid foundations. Confirmation of this came in figures published on Friday showing that British retail spending at Christmas suffered its biggest year-on-year fall in more than six years. The figures indicated that Britain\u2019s economy was slowing. This has political consequences: the UK\u2019s tax take is now unlikely to meet the Treasury\u2019s predictions. As a result, few now will bet on the chancellor, George Osborne, meeting his budget goals when the financial year ends in March. Market meltdowns should carry a health warning. While they can presage wider economic problems, they are not infallible barometers. As the late American economist Paul Samuelson famously observed: \u201cThe stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.\u201d JP Morgan\u2019s asset management team believes much of the gloom has been overdone. They observe: \u201cMuch of the bad news has already been priced into markets which are forward looking and have known about the slowdown in China for a while. We think the outlook is slightly better from here. China\u2019s growth rate remains high relative to everywhere else. We are still looking at an economy that over the next five years could expand by more than $5 trillion. So the message is not to panic.\u201d This will be a comfort to UK banks which have significant exposure to China and Hong Kong. But few believe that, following Friday\u2019s rally, there are no nasty shocks ahead. Indeed, some analysts fear further falls in the market could turn into a rout. \u201cIn the short term, the FTSE\u2019s commodities-led rally has legs and we cannot rule out a move towards 6,000 in the coming sessions,\u201d Jawaid Afsar, a senior trader at Securequity, told Reuters. \u201cHowever, its medium-longer-term remains uncertain \u2026 the FTSE is still flirting around its \u2018bear market\u2019 territory and a fall below 5,800 could lead to a slump towards the 5,200-5,300 area.\u201d Many people would be forgiven for thinking that when traders\u2019 screens flash red it has little to do with them. But they would be wrong. Pensions experts Hargreaves Lansdown calculate that a 20% fall in the value of a pension pot close to retirement could wreck a person\u2019s best-laid plans. For example, a 65-year-old with \u00a350,000 in their pension at the end of April 2015 could have bought an annual annuity income of \u00a32,739. Despite an increase in annuity rates, the market downturn means that the same 65-year-old can now expect to buy an annual income of just \u00a32,306. Whether those due to retire in a few years\u2019 time, or indeed those still working in Britain\u2019s ailing steel and oil sectors, can dare hope for a rosier future will to some extent be determined by the scale and speed of China\u2019s slowdown. Ominously, George Soros, the financier who forced Britain out of the European exchange rate mechanism by betting against the pound, used his appearance at Davos to warn that a hard landing for China was now \u201cunavoidable\u201d. Soros stressed that he was not offering a prediction. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m observing it.\u201d",

The unspoken fear is that 2016 could turn into another slump similar to that which followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.</p> <p>This is certainly the view of Albert Edwards, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and the City\u2019s leading bear. In a recent and characteristically pessimistic note to his bank\u2019s clients, Edwards warned that the world was on the brink of \u201canother debacle every bit as large as the 2008 global financial crisis\u201d.</p> <p>His warning was heavy on hyperbole. \u201cI believe the events we now see unfolding will drive us back into global recession,\u201d said Edwards, who predicts \u201ca trade war not unlike that in the 1930s\u201d. He pointed out that, on 23 December, in response to the devaluing of China\u2019s yuan currency, a move that made its exports cheaper, the US hiked tariffs on Chinese steel imports by a staggering 256%. For workers caught in the crossfire, a trade war can be ruinous. The 750 workers at Tata Steel\u2019s plant at Port Talbot in south Wales who were laid off last week know only too well what the cheap price of Chinese steel means.</p> <p>Oil rig workers in the North Sea also face an uncertain future as other oil producers refuse to blink and continue feeding the global glut. More than a dozen offshore rigs, the highest number in more than a decade, have been towed into the Scottish Firth as the plunge in crude prices has all but killed off North Sea exploration. Two rigs have already been towed away to be scrapped in Turkey. More are expected to arrive soon.</p> <p>Edwards is clear about whom he blames for what is happening to the global economy. The central banks\u2019 deployment of quantitative easing \u2013 the buying back of debt from banks to give them cash to start lending again \u2013 has helped inflate asset prices around the world. \u201cThe illusion of prosperity is shattered as boom now turns to bust,\u201d Edwards warns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68fabba5381016845a1ec3709328ead676fd9a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68fabba5381016845a1ec3709328ead676fd9a4/479_128_3391_2036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Stiglitz: \u2018Many of us believed that there was going to be a major correction.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Stiglitz: \u2018Many of us believed that there was going to be a major correction.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such strident views are not shared by many economists. But even more moderate commentators, notably the Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz, appear concerned that the economic tectonic plates are shifting.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reasonable chance that there is something more fundamental going on,\u201d Stiglitz said last week. \u201cThere was a kind of excessive euphoria; undoubtedly the QE monetary policy pumped up asset prices but didn\u2019t do much for pumping up the real economy. Where was all the liquidity going? Some of it went just into the balance sheet and wasn\u2019t lent out, but some of it went to increasing asset prices.</p> <p>\u201cMany analysts, including me, believed that there was going to be a major correction. Very hard to tell when. Whenever there is such a major correction there are ups and downs.\u201d</p> <p>The turbulence in the markets \u2013 and in particular the speed with which it has erupted \u2013 caught the Bank of England wrongfooted. Having been upbeat about the UK\u2019s economic prospects only late last year, governor Mark Carney finds himself declaring \u201cnow is not the time to raise UK rates\u201d.</p> <p>While this is good news for people with variable rate mortgages, it is an embarrassing admission that the economic recovery is built on anything but solid foundations. Confirmation of this came in figures published on Friday showing that British retail spending at Christmas suffered its biggest year-on-year fall in more than six years. The figures indicated that Britain\u2019s economy was slowing. This has political consequences: the UK\u2019s tax take is now unlikely to meet the Treasury\u2019s predictions. As a result, few now will bet on the chancellor, George Osborne, meeting his budget goals when the financial year ends in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/01/economic-stormkeyrisesfalls/giv-271671Acu8aEPZtDV/\" data-alt=\"key falls graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/01/economic-stormkeyrisesfalls/giv-271671Acu8aEPZtDV/\">key falls graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Market meltdowns should carry a health warning. While they can presage wider economic problems, they are not infallible barometers. As the late American economist Paul Samuelson famously observed: \u201cThe stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.\u201d</p> <p>JP Morgan\u2019s asset management team believes much of the gloom has been overdone. They observe: \u201cMuch of the bad news has already been priced into markets which are forward looking and have known about the slowdown in China for a while. We think the outlook is slightly better from here. China\u2019s growth rate remains high relative to everywhere else. We are still looking at an economy that over the next five years could expand by more than $5 trillion. So the message is not to panic.\u201d</p> <p>This will be a comfort to UK banks which have significant exposure to China and Hong Kong. But few believe that, following Friday\u2019s rally, there are no nasty shocks ahead. Indeed, some analysts fear further falls in the market could turn into a rout.</p> <p>\u201cIn the short term, the FTSE\u2019s commodities-led rally has legs and we cannot rule out a move towards 6,000 in the coming sessions,\u201d Jawaid Afsar, a senior trader at Securequity, told Reuters. \u201cHowever, its medium-longer-term remains uncertain \u2026 the FTSE is still flirting around its \u2018bear market\u2019 territory and a fall below 5,800 could lead to a slump towards the 5,200-5,300 area.\u201d</p> <p>Many people would be forgiven for thinking that when traders\u2019 screens flash red it has little to do with them. But they would be wrong. Pensions experts Hargreaves Lansdown calculate that a 20% fall in the value of a pension pot close to retirement could wreck a person\u2019s best-laid plans. For example, a 65-year-old with \u00a350,000 in their pension at the end of April 2015 could have bought an annual annuity income of \u00a32,739. Despite an increase in annuity rates, the market downturn means that the same 65-year-old can now expect to buy an annual income of just \u00a32,306.</p> <p>Whether those due to retire in a few years\u2019 time, or indeed those still working in Britain\u2019s ailing steel and oil sectors, can dare hope for a rosier future will to some extent be determined by the scale and speed of China\u2019s slowdown. Ominously, George Soros, the financier who forced Britain out of the European exchange rate mechanism by betting against the pound, used his appearance at Davos to warn that a hard landing for China was now \u201cunavoidable\u201d. Soros stressed that he was not offering a prediction. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m observing it.\u201d</p>",
