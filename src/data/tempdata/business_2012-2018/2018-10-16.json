      "bodyText": "Britain has dropped two places to eighth in an influential global competitiveness index, with the risk of Brexit further damaging its international standing. The World Economic Forum (WEF), which runs the annual Davos gathering of business and political leaders, said that the UK had been overtaken by Hong Kong and Japan on its annual ranking of the world\u2019s 140 most competitive economies. The league table \u2013 topped by the United States for the first time in a decade \u2013 found that Europe as a whole was now less competitive than East Asia and the Pacific regions. It also warned that the majority of global economies were ill-prepared for rapid advances in technology. The WEF assessed the world\u2019s biggest economies across almost 100 different indicators, from the quality of infrastructure to life expectancy and the jobs market. The Geneva-based organisation also added several new metrics to its 2018 study, such as workforce diversity, press freedom and how hierarchical the biggest companies are in a particular economy. While Britain remains the fourth most competitive economy in Europe behind Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, the WEF suggested that it could slip further behind because Brexit stood to damage its attractiveness to international buyers and sellers of goods and services. \u201cBrexit \u2026 will by definition weaken the United Kingdom\u2019s markets component as integration with the EU is rolled back,\u201d the report said. The WEF said Britain had slipped in the 2018 ranking due to a deterioration in domestic labour mobility, which measures the extent to which people move between the different regions of a country to find work. Basing its judgment on a survey of company executives, it said the UK had fallen from 17th in the world for internal labour mobility last year to 48th in 2018. British workers have finally started to see their wages rise at the fastest pace in almost a decade, while unemployment has dropped to the lowest level since the mid-1970s. Younger people are, however, moving jobs less frequently than in the past, while economists believe the pull factor of higher wages in places like London and the south-east has dwindled, arguing that rapid growth in housing costs had eaten into incomes. Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWe saw a big drop-off in job-to-job moves during the crisis, and though it\u2019s since risen, it\u2019s still about 20% below the level it was pre-crisis. \u201cAs the economy recovered people become a bit more adventurous and switch jobs more, but not back to levels we\u2019ve seen.\u201d The WEF report argued that Britain currently looks less prepared than some of its economic rivals to take advantage of rapid technological change, given weak rates of adoption of IT equipment, relatively poor provision of mobile and fibre broadband, and the relatively poor digital skills of the population. It praised the country for having \u201cvery well-functioning markets\u201d for the buying and selling of goods and services, which rank fourth in the world, a healthy level of business innovation and for the strength of its financial markets.",

    "webTitle": "Wall Street posts biggest gains in seven months as markets roar back - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Boom! Wall Street has surged more than 2%, racking up its biggest one-day gains since March. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 547 points to end the day at 25,798, a gain of 2.17%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 2.16%, while a solid tech stock rally swept the Nasdaq 2.9% higher. As covered earlier, optimism in New York was boosted by strong results by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. New of a record number of vacancies across US firms, and a jump in industrial production, also calmed some of the anxiety that has been building in the markets. And no sooner had Wall Street closed, than Netflix was reporting results -- and impressing traders. That\u2019s probably all for today... Wall Street may also be taking heart from the latest US employment data. Today\u2019s JOLTS report shows that the number of job openings in the U.S. reached another all-time high of 7.1 million in August. The Labor Department also reported that American workers voluntarily quit their jobs at a rate of 2.4% in August, matching July\u2019s 17-year high. No lack of optimism on Wall Street right now. The Dow is up 471 points, which would be its best day since late March if we blew the final whistle now. Amid the optimism today, a note of caution rings out. Investors are their least optimistic about global economic prospects since the financial crisis broke out. Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s latest global fund manager survey found that 38% of investors think that global economic growth will decelerate in the next 12 months, the highest percentage since November 2008. That may explain why last week\u2019s sell-off caught hold (it doesn\u2019t explain why stocks are back up today, though!) European stock markets also ended the day strongly, with the main indices all sharply higher. Italy led the way, despite hints that Brussels will reject its 2019 budget, teeing up a deeper row with the new government in Rome. Wall Street is rallying because investors are focusing on \u201cupbeat earnings\u201d, says Marketwatch. We covered earlier that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had outperformed expectations. That has boosted confidence in America\u2019s corporate sector Johnson &amp; Johnson, the pharmaceuticals group, also did well in the last quarter, partly thank to strong sales of cancer drugs and a pick-up at its baby care business. Here\u2019s the details: Earnings per share: $2.05, adjusted, vs. $2.03 expected Revenue: $20.3 billion vs. $20.05 billion expected This all boost confidence in corporate earnings, and suggests that economic demand is still robust. Today\u2019s rally is showing some stamina. The Dow is now up by 408 points, or 1.6%, at 25,661 points, and on track for its best day in several months. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx sums up the day\u001d: With confidence lifted by a pair of strong earnings updates from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the Dow Jones showed signs of getting its mojo back after the bell. The US index surged 280 points as the session got underway, rocketing above 25500 having neared 25100 on Monday. These gains helped feed into the European markets, with the DAX and CAC both shooting up 1%. This despite the unresolved budget issues between Italy and the EU. Not content with sparring with Theresa May and her Brexit negotiators, Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested that the Italian government have a slim chance of getting their controversial budget approved, with the President of the European Commission claiming the EU would \u2018revolt\u2019 it Italy got its own way. While its peers raced off into the distance, the FTSE was left panting behind, only able to add 20 or so points as the day went on. That\u2019s because the pound, ignoring the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, rose around half a percent against both the dollar and the euro, boosted by a better than forecast, 9 year high wage growth reading. There are plenty more chances for the FTSE to get its revenge, however, not only with Wednesday\u2019s inflation and Thursday\u2019s retail sales data, but the impending, hugely important mid-week summit between EU leaders. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has closed 30 points higher at 7059, as today\u2019s wave of optimism sends shares up. However, the rally was held back by currency effects - the strengthening pound pulls down the value of multinational companies\u2019 earnings. US stocks are pushing higher too! The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow have both gained 1.5%, as Wall Street tries to recover some of last week\u2019s 4% slide. European stocks are romping higher in late trading, sending the Stoxx 600 index of the region\u2019s largest companies up 1.5%. Goldman and Morgan Stanley are giving the markets a lift, agrees Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. He reckons recent US interest rate hikes are helping the banks, but also making life tougher for retailers: Morgan Stanley posted Q3 profits of $1.17c a share, well above estimates of $1.03c, while Goldman Sachs also blew past expectations coming in at $6.28c a share, $0.90c above consensus. There was some weak spots on the fixed income side, however by and large the numbers painted a fairly positive outlook. These sorts of numbers should be expected given the higher interest rate environment and higher fees from M&amp;A, however we also need to see similar sorts of activity in areas that reflect consumer discretionary spending, which could be impacted by higher rates. On the retail front things are a little more concerning, given this week\u2019s news from Sears, while this morning\u2019s announcement from Wal-Mart could also be a cause for concern. The company downgraded its earnings outlook for 2019 citing the impact of higher costs in absorbing its acquisition of India\u2019s Flipkart for $16bn. It also warned that sales growth in its e-commerce division would be 5% lower in 2019 than this year, with growth of 35% expected, below this years expected 40% rise. The rally is back on! Shares have opened higher on Wall Street, as investors try to put last week\u2019s turmoil behind them. The Dow has jumped by 233 points, or 0.9%, with the Nasdaq streaking 1.2% higher. Today\u2019s decent results from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs seem to be shoring up confidence in New York. European markets are pushing higher too, as traders regain their risk appetite (for the moment, anyway...) Let\u2019s not get carried away, though.... oh too late! In another boost to confidence, America\u2019s factories have expanded their output for the fourth month in a row. US industrial production rose by 0.3% in September, boosted by gains in manufacturing and mining, beating forecasts of 0.2% growth. That\u2019s down on August\u2019s 0.4%. The Federal Reserve also said manufacturing output increased 0.2% in September after rising 0.3% in August. Britain is getting a new \u00a350 note, but the big question is who should be on it? Speculation is bubbling away today about which famous Brit should appear on the back of the note, which will be made out of flexible plastic polymer [the Queen has a monopoly on the front]. Ladbrokes have issued odds, putting former Labour PM Clement Attlee and Crimean war heroine Mary Seacole as joint favourites: Noor Inayat Khan is another strong candidate. She served in Britain\u2019s Special Operations Executive as a wireless operator in occupied France in the second world war, before being captured, shackled for months, and later killed at Dachau concentration camp. As the Mirror reported back in August: She had become the first female radio operator to infiltrate occupied Paris, posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre and the George Cross. But Noor\u2019s story has been largely overlooked, becoming a footnote in history. It wasn\u2019t until 2012 that a memorial bust of Noor went up in London\u2019s Gordon Square \u2013 not only the first statue to an Indian woman in Britain, but the first to any Muslim. She was one of only three women in Winston Churchill\u2019s secret army, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), to be awarded the George Cross, and the other two \u2013 Violette Szabo and Odette Hallowes \u2013 have had films made about their lives. A petition has been set up to promote Inayat Khan\u2019s case, and it\u2019s got Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat\u2019s backing too: Writer Emily Poole has some other good suggestions for the Bank of England to consider: Those results from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are giving the markets a much-needed boost. Wall Street is now expected to open higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average called 150 points or 0.6% higher. Europe is already catching a bid, with almost all the main indices pushing higher. The only laggard is Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, which is being pulled down by the stronger pound. Also just in: one of Goldman Sachs key trading divisions has just suffered a chunky drop in takings. Net revenues at Goldman\u2019s Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) operation shrank by 10% year-on-year to $1.31bn in the last quarter, its latest financial results show. Goldman pins the blame on \u201can environment characterised by low client activity amid low levels of volatility.\u201d Investment banking did better, with net revenues rising by 10% year-on-year to $1.98bn. So overall, profits beat forecasts. David Solomon, Goldman\u2019s new CEO (and a career investment banker) says: \u201cWe delivered solid results in the third quarter driven by contributions from across our diversified client franchise. Year-to-date earnings per share is the highest in our history and year-to-date return on equity is the highest in nine years, notwithstanding our continued investment in growth opportunities. We remain well positioned to continue delivering for our clients and shareholders.\u201d Here\u2019s some early reaction: Just in: Profits at Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley have jumped by 19%. MS posted earnings of $2.11bn in the last quarter, or $1.17 per share. That\u2019s up from 93 cents per share last year, and up from forecasts of $1.01 per share. The company\u2019s equity trading desk, bond traders, and investment banking division all posted higher-than-expected earnings, despite market jitteriness. Chief executive James Gorman says: \u201cWe produced strong results across the franchise. Despite the seasonal summer slowdown in the third quarter, we reported solid revenue and earnings growth.\u201d Here\u2019s some early reaction: Sterling has jumped by half a cent this morning, following today\u2019s unexpectedly strong wage growth. This has pushed the pound up to $1.321, recovering last week\u2019s Brexit-induced losses. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Asset Management, explains why: \u201cWages in the UK are growing at a rate not seen since January 2009. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 3.1% in the three months to August. Unsurprisingly unemployment stayed at its low of 4%. It\u2019s interesting that productivity, however, remains less robust and any pick up could lead to some concerns about inflation. \u201cThis is all a continuation of the current trend, but it does reinforce the fact that there are bright spots in the UK economy. It\u2019s unlikely that interest rate expectations will change as a result of the data, particularly with the overhang of Brexit. Markets are unlikely to be significantly impacted by this, given broader concerns, but sterling will gain some support.\u201d Faster earnings growth might encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates sooner, to prevent inflation being pushed up. Higher interest rates make it more profitable to hold sterling, thus the pound goes up. However, it\u2019s hard to see the BoE tightening policy quickly, at least until Brexit is resolved: While the jump in nominal pay growth to 3.1% is encouraging, what really matters is real pay -- how much workers take home after adjusting for inflation. And on that measure, earnings are rising at the fastest since 2016. Good news, but less dramatic than the headline number. Also, one month\u2019s pay rise doesn\u2019t make up for 10 years of weak earnings growth. British workers are still earning less than before the 2008 financial crisis, once you adjust for inflation. The Resolution Foundation have the details: Pawel Adrjan, chief economist at jobs site Indeed.com, reports that the number of job vacancies is still rising. That suggests firms need to keep paying workers more, to attract them. The pick-up in wage growth to 3.1% per annum with unemployment holding at 4% are extremely good news, say Costas Milas and Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool. They believe it shows Britain\u2019s economy is growing faster than official data suggest: Notice that the pickup in wage growth has not put upward pressure on the unemployment rate. This is consistent with our view that the UK economy can afford paying higher wages because it is growing better than currently thought. Indeed, our latest LSE blog suggests that since the EU Referendum vote the UK economy has over-performed by 0.5% per annum based on monthly GDP evidence compared to what the traditional quarterly GDP data suggests. Consequently, we are taking the view that the ONS will revise upwards its quarterly GDP growth sooner than later. This could happen as early as the 9th of November when the ONS will report its first GDP estimate for 2018 Q3. Alok Sharma, minister of state for employment, has welcomed the jump in pay growth, saying: \u201cI am particularly encouraged that wages continue to be on the up, outpacing inflation for the seventh month in a row and regular pay is up 3.1% on the year. \u201cAnd with unemployment at its lowest since the 1970s, since 2010 there are more people with the security of a job, more people with a regular salary, and more people able to support their families - and that is thanks to action this Government has taken to build an economy that works for everyone.\u201d Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, agrees that workers have the upper hand in pay negotiations: Employers are having to offer better financial packages to workers to retain their staff. Employees remain in short supply: unemployment remained at the very low level of 4%, as low as it has been since the mid-1970s. It is still a little too soon to be sure that worker scarcity will continue to drive wage growth upwards over a longer period, but initial signs are encouraging. The British Chambers of Commerce has struck a cautious note, warning that pay rises depend on rising productivity: Dr. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor for EY ITEM Club, believes UK earnings are back on an \u201cupward track\u201d. However, he\u2019s concerned that the number of people in work has dipped -- perhaps a sign that Brexit is hitting the jobs market. Here\u2019s his take: The labour market showed signs of losing momentum as employment fell 5,000 in the three months to August. Nevertheless, unemployment dropped by 47,000 as the inactivity rate rose. This kept the unemployment rate down at a 43-year low of 4.0%. Employment fell marginally despite the economy picking up over the summer. GDP was up 0.7% on a three-month/three-month basis in August The loss of momentum in the labour market may well be at least partly caused by employers finding it harder to find suitable candidates \u2013 in some cases significantly influenced by fewer workers coming from the EU. There is certainly evidence of this in a number of surveys (including from the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents and the purchasing managers). Indeed, it is notable that despite reduced employment growth, the number of vacancies was an elevated 832,000 in the three months to August Pay growth is looking perkier, buoying hopes that jobs market tightness may finally be feeding through to a pick-up in pay Regular earnings growth climbed to 3.1% in the three months to August, the best for nearly a decade. It held up relatively well at 3.1% in August after spiking to 3.2% in July. Growth in private sector regular pay was stable at 3.3% in August itself. Total earnings growth rose to 2.7% in the 3 months to August Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, has crunched through today\u2019s data. He encouraged that real pay (nominal pay minus inflation) is growing, and has also spotted that more people are getting full-time jobs. \u201cThe latest labour market statistics provide mixed news. Employment has fallen slightly in the latest 3 month period, but unemployment has also fallen \u2013 by some 47000 and the unemployment rate now stands at 4.0%. The numbers of economically inactive people rose by some 103000. Large falls in employment are recorded amongst part-time employees (55000) and full-time self-employed workers (35000). At the same time, the number of full-time employees rose by some 87000. Taken together, these statistics reflect the continuing restoration of normality to the labour market, with more workers now employed in secure full-time jobs, and fewer in less secure part-time jobs and self-employment. \u201cTotal pay (on the preferred 3 month measure) rose by some 2.7% in August, while regular pay (again on the preferred 3 month measure) rose by 3.1%. This is the first increase of more than 3% in this indicator in ten years. With CPI inflation [including housing costs] at 2.4% in August, these data indicate some long overdue growth in real pay.\u201d Although wages are up, Britain\u2019s employment rate has dropped a little. That may show that the jobs boom is fading, after a strong run. In June-August, there were 32.39 million people in work. That\u2019s 289,000 more than a year ago, but around 5,000 fewer than in March to May 2018. The number of people classed as unemployment dropped again, though. The Office for National Statistics explains: The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 75.5%, lower than for March to May 2018 (75.7%) but higher than for a year earlier (75.1%). There were 1.36 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 47,000 fewer than for March to May 2018 and 79,000 fewer than for a year earlier. It appears that British workers are finally benefitting from the scarcity of labour and demanding more for their services. Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at wealth management firm Sanlam UK, explains: Wages keep on going from strength to strength, as competition for workers is finally feeding through to pay. The Bank of England will be keeping a watchful eye on any upwards pressure this puts on inflation, but it should also help support the consumer and their ability to handle higher interest rates should bank need to increase interest rates. However, until the outcome of Brexit becomes clearer, rates are likely to be placed on hold.\u201d The bad news is that CPI inflation was 2.7% in August, taking a chunk out of workers\u2019 pay packets. That was up from 2.5% in July (the mid-point for today\u2019s jobs data), suggesting price pressure are building. But still, at least real wages are growing. BREAKING: Britain is finally getting a pay rise. Basic pay jumped by 3.1% per year in the three months to August, the fastest rate since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. That\u2019s up from 2.9% a month ago. Total pay (including bonuses) rose by 2.7% during the quarter, up from 2.6%. That\u2019s the fastest growth since February. In another boost, Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has stuck at 4.0%, the joint lowest since December 1974 to February 1975, according to the Office for National Statistics. More to follow! Merlin Entertainment, the firm behind Legoland and Alton knows all about roller coasters. Unfortunately, its investors are getting a stomach-churning ride this morning. Shares in the company have slid by 8%, after its latest financial results failed to impress the City. On the upside, Merlin\u2019s like-for-like revenue have grown by 1.4% this year, and it opened two new parks -- Peppa Pig World of Play in Shanghai, and The Bear Grylls Adventure in Birmingham. But shareholders aren\u2019t pleased to hear that like-for-like growth at Legoland was flat. Merlin also slipped in a warning that cost pressures are building, partly due to \u201ctighter labour markets in a number of regions\u2019. In other words, it\u2019s having to pay its staff more to recruit and retain them. Good news for the workers! Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: The market may be concerned by the caveat that the cost environment remains challenging amid tighter global labour markets. \u201cA growing number of governments with more restrictive policies on immigration and, in the UK, the Brexit process are limiting freedom of movement and this issue could continue to affect large-scale employers of lower wage workers such as Merlin.\u201d Global investors are a little less anxious than yesterday, reports Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Risk sentiment is slightly stronger this morning, Asian equities mixed rather than a sea of red, bond yields generally a bit higher. The Italian budget has been sent to Brussels for consideration, which is positive, while Mi Barnier has headed to Brussels to report on the lack of Brexit progress, which isn\u2019t positive but isn\u2019t new news. The Saudi stock market is down 2% this morning, as Riyadh comes under growing pressure over the disappearance and apparent murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. According to CNN, Saudi Arabia is preparing to say that Khashoggi was killed during \u201can interrogation that went wrong\u201d, after he entered the Saudi consulate in Ankara two weeks ago. Donald Trump has dispatched U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet with the Saudi royal family to discuss the situation. Analysts suggest that the international outcry over Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist, could hit international investment into the country, especially as several top bosses are now shunning its \u2018Davos in the desert\u2019 investment conference. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says trading is confused and cautious this week. Asian equity markets fell on Monday and continued to be dragged lower on Tuesday, despite at a slower pace. European stocks recovered slightly but appetite to risk remained limited as a cautious mood continued to dominate U.S. markets flipping between gains and losses throughout most of Monday\u2019s session to end the day in red as Technology selloffs dominated the overnight trading session. There still seems to be lot of uncertainty in global financial markets after last week\u2019s steep selling. The S&amp;P 500 closed below its 200-days moving average on Monday, a signal that won\u2019t be liked by trend-following investors. A failure to return above this average today may encourage further bears to join the crowd. European stock markets have opened cautiously, as City traders await today\u2019s UK jobs data. 2018 is turning into a year to forget for Chinese investors: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover whether Britain\u2019s labour market is holding up, in the face of Brexit deadlock and global trade war. New unemployment figures are expected to show that the jobless rate remained at just 4%, the lowest in around 43 years. But crucially, economist want to see wages outpacing inflation again. Last month, basic pay growth jumped to 2.9% per year - the fastest in over three years, while total pay growth was 2.6% higher. Similar figures are expected today (for the three months to August). Strong pay growth would suggest that workers were finally getting the upper hand over bosses, and taking advantage of the tight labour market. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says the unemployment report will give the City a welcome distraction from the UK government\u2019s negotiations with the EU (and itself). Brexit developments are expected to remain the key driver of the pound; however, for a few fleeting minutes traders will turn their attention to UK jobs data. Unemployment is forecast to remain constant in August at 4%. Weekly earnings are expected to remain steady at 2.9% in the 3 months to August. It will take a significant beat to the upside to inject some optimism into the pound. On the other hand, any weakness in the figures could drag on the pound given the downside risks of Brexit already making the pound sensitive. Also coming up today The financial markets remain edgy following last week\u2019s losses. Over in Asia, Chinas Shanghai composite index has dropped by almost 1%, but Australia has gained 0.5% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei is up 1.2%. Traders are still anxious that we could see further losses, after Wall Street endured its biggest fall since March last week. Fears over US interest rate moves, trade, the oil price and the health of the global economy all abound. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA explains: Regional markets are trading more positively this morning as overall regional volatilities are falling. A weaker US dollar profile is helping to cool depreciation pressure on the Yuan as overextended shorts are getting pared. Don\u2019t confuse this recovery with anything other than consolidation amidst a protracted downtrend in Asia equities. Traders are looking to sell upticks given that intraday volatility can ignite on the drop of a dime. Italy\u2019s government has submitted its 2019 budget plans to the European Union, teeing up a likely clash over its spending plans. The budget includes running a deficit of 2.4% of GDP - higher than the EU target - plus lowering the retirement age and giving more help to poorer families. Plus, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will be reporting financial results.

On the other hand, any weakness in the figures could drag on the pound given the downside risks of Brexit already making the pound sensitive.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Also coming up today</h2> <p>The financial markets remain edgy following last week\u2019s losses. Over in Asia, Chinas Shanghai composite index has dropped by almost 1%, but Australia has gained 0.5% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei is up 1.2%.</p> <p>Traders are still anxious that we could see further losses, after Wall Street endured its biggest fall since March last week.

A fair wind behind renewables Call it a small but significant moment in the energy market: Scottish Power, one of the big six energy firms, is betting its future in power generation entirely on wind. It is selling four gas stations in England, plus two hydro schemes and a pumped storage plant in Scotland, to Drax for \u00a3702m. Scottish Power, which is owned by Spanish group Iberdrola, calls the move a culmination of a 25-year strategy to reduce carbon emissions. But the transaction also serves to highlight the winning economics of wind. The position has been transformed since the days when vast subsidies were required to erect the turbines. As recently at 2014, offshore generators wanted a guaranteed \u00a3150 per megawatt hour (MWh) for their output. In last year\u2019s auction for government subsidies, two big offshore farms came in at \u00a357.50 per MWh, which is lower even than today\u2019s wholesale market price. It\u2019s safe bet that prices will fall again in next year\u2019s auction. Turbines have become bigger, installation costs have fallen and the cables to get the power to shore are more efficient. The government should draw an obvious lesson from this quiet tale of improvement. Aside from the urgent environmental need to switch to renewables \u2013 they must supply 70-80% of the world\u2019s energy by 2050, warned the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last week \u2013 investing faster in wind makes financial sense for consumers. It\u2019s true, as everybody knows, that baseload supplies will still be needed for the days when the wind doesn\u2019t blow. But a government that was serious about reducing the cost of energy would spend less time championing price caps on bills and more time on securing lower generation costs. Price caps won\u2019t guarantee lower bills; cheaper generation may.

      "bodyText": "A Royal Mail director has admitted the company\u2019s management was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by its failure to engage with shareholders before a large-scale pay revolt in July, as MPs described as \u201castounding\u201d a \u00a35.8m payout to secure a new chief executive. Orna Ni-Chionna, the head of Royal Mail\u2019s pay committee, said she had been taken by surprise at the strength of opposition to the pay deal offered Rico Back and leaving package for his predecessor as chief executive Moya Greene. Nearly three-quarters of investors refused to support the company\u2019s remuneration policy in one of the biggest pay revolts in UK corporate history at Royal Mail\u2019s annual meeting in July. In a bruising encounter with the cross-party business, energy and industrial strategy select committee on Tuesday, Ni-Chionna said: \u201cObviously, that was a huge disappointment and a shock to us. We were lulled by the fact that we thought we\u2019d explained it well [to investors]. That is the mistake that we made.\u201d The committee was critical of Royal Mail\u2019s decision to pay Back a \u00a35.8m \u201cgolden hello\u201d for breaking an existing contract with an European subsidiary, GLS. Ni-Chionna said Royal Mail had been keen to retain Back within the group, and confirmed the payout was not subject to tax in the UK. Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said it was \u201ca woeful tale\u201d of poor shareholder engagement at Royal Mail, which was privatised in 2013. \u201cRoyal Mail failed to consider any alternative to Rico Back as their new chief executive and splashed out \u00a35.8m on breaking his contract, a sum that could have hired 252 postmen and postwomen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe heard that no UK tax was paid on this astounding multimillion-pound deal, a sum paid for by UK customers as they post their letters and parcels, and an amount which would appal postmen and postwomen and the wider public.\u201d Royal Mail was accused of being in thrall to its chief executives rather than considering the needs of shareholders. \u201cWhy is it that you and your [pay] committee just go weak at the knees when it comes to a powerful chief executive?\u201d asked the Labour MP Peter Kyle. Ni-Chionna, who is also deputy chair of the National Trust, said the company had learned lessons, adding: \u201cI\u2019m very aware that Royal Mail is a very special company. We mean a lot to people. Our postmen and women mean a lot to people. \u201cI really am embarrassed that we got this engagement with shareholders so wrong and I want to assure the committee that we won\u2019t do that again.\u201d In the same session on executive pay, the transnational consumer goods company Unilever said it had failed to listen to shareholder concerns by pressing ahead with the ill-fated plan to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam. The firm had learned lessons less than two weeks after it was forced to scrap the plans, MPs were told. Peter Newhouse, director and executive vice-president for reward at Unilever, was asked whether the company had a poor track record of listening to shareholders \u2013 after more than a third voted against the firm\u2019s pay policy in May. \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds like a sensible way of looking at it.\u201d Royal Mail has a pay ratio of 78 to one, when comparing Greene\u2019s \u00a31.8m pay package as chief executive with the \u00a323,000 average starting pay of a postal worker. Reeves said the ratio at Unilever was 315 to one, more than twice the FTSE 100 average of 146 to one. Last year the chief executive, Paul Polman, received a pay package worth \u20ac11.7m (\u00a310.3m). At Unilever\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in the UK in May, 36% voted against a pay policy that could hand bigger bonuses to Polman and his senior colleagues. After the select committee hearing, Reeves said: \u201cCompanies need to pay much more attention to their shareholders, workers and the public when they set chief executive pay. \u201cAs a committee we will continue to take a close eye to the issue of corporate pay and examine what impact government action, such as pay-ratio reporting, is likely to have on delivering fair pay.\u201d Both firms admitted they had yet to respond to shareholder concerns over pay raised at their annual meetings, but said they would meet investors and publish a statement of action in the coming months.",

As well as the king-size, 40% gold bedsheets, which are expected to sell for between \u00a330,000-\u00a350,000, there is a gold Methuselah (6-litre) bottle of Dom P\u00e9rignon (\u00a315,000-\u00a320,000) a gold-painted Ferrari (\u00a3350,000-\u00a3450,000) and a solid gold, life-size bust of the supermodel Kate Moss by the artist Marc Quinn (\u00a3300,000-\u00a3400,000). \u201cThis is Sotheby\u2019s first-ever sale devoted to gold,\u201d Frangos, Sotheby\u2019s head of sales, said. \u201cAnd we have something for everyone, from the 1977 Ferrari 512 Berlinetta Boxer, to a chair that was once in Paris\u2019s Tuileries Palace, to gold art.\u201d The most highly valued item in the 63-lot Midas Touch sale is a gold painting by the French artist Yves Klein.

Klein is reported to have said: \u201cGold was really something. Those leaves literally fluttered in the slightest draught on the padded dish you had to hold in one hand while catching them in flight with the knife in the other.\u201d Frangos said the idea to hold a sale devoted entirely to gold was prompted by the growing popularity of the precious metal, despite a 36% decline in its value since hitting a peak of $1,890 per ounce in 2011. Gold was valued at about $1,220 per ounce on Tuesday. He said the pieces had been valued for their artistic or cultural significance rather than their simple weight in gold. Frangos said there had been a lot of interest in the sale from overseas tourists, particularly from the Middle East and Asia, who had popped in to see the items on display in the auction house in Mayfair, London. He said the Ferrari, which is one of only four its kind in the world, had attracted the most attention. The car is painted in a rare shade of metallic gold called oro chiaro metallizzato, which pairs with a chestnut-brown leather interior.",

    "webTitle": "Bellway to replace Grenfell-style cladding on two developments", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the country\u2019s biggest housebuilders has agreed to cover the cost of replacing combustible Grenfell-style cladding, ending months of financial uncertainty for hundreds of householders. Bellway has set aside \u00a35.9m to carry out works to replace combustible cladding used on two of its apartment developments, Prospect Place in Cardiff and New Festival Quarter in east London. The move follows threats from the housing secretary, James Brokenshire, that builders could face enforcement action if they do not \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and remove unsafe cladding quickly. The UK is facing an estimated \u00a31bn bill to replace defective cladding on 468 high-rise buildings. The cladding is similar to that which spread the fire at Grenfell Tower, claiming 72 lives. At the government\u2019s last count, only 32 of the buildings had been fully repaired. Barratt Homes, Legal and General, L&amp;Q, Galliard Homes, Mace Group, Taylor Wimpey and Peabody have all agreed to cover costs, but others have not. Campaigners from Greater Manchester will protest on Wednesday in London outside Brokenshire\u2019s office, calling for tougher action. Among them will be residents from a complex known as Green Quarter in central Manchester who say they live in fear of fire while a dispute continues over who should pay to replace it. They will be joined by fuel poverty campaigners, warning that thousands of flats could be left freezing over the winter as cladding and insulation is stripped off.

      "bodyText": "Neoliberalism has caused \u201cmisery and social polarisation\u201d yet remains in vogue with the Coalition government, according to the economist Bernie Fraser. The former Treasury secretary and Reserve Bank governor has made the comments in a presentation circulated to participants of the Australia Institute\u2019s revenue summit to be held in Canberra on Wednesday. Michael Keating, a former secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, will also use the summit to raise doubts about the Morrison government\u2019s budget forecasts. In the background notes for Fraser\u2019s speech, seen by Guardian Australia, he says that Australia\u2019s 27 consecutive years of economic growth is a \u201cstandout\u201d, \u201cWinx-like\u201d performance. But the record deserves only \u201cqualified applause\u201d because \u201ctoo many Australians remain unemployed, under-employed, underskilled, underpaid and lack job security\u201d. Fraser warns that society has become \u201cless fair, less compassionate and more divided\u201d and \u201cmore devoid of trust in almost every field of human activity\u201d in the past 20 years. \u201cAs a disinterested player in climate change negotiations and a miserable foreign aid donor, we have slipped well down the list of good global citizens.\u201d Political ideologies appear to have contributed to inequality and disadvantage in Australia in that time, he argues. Fraser in large part blames \u201cneoliberalism\u201d and its influence on policymaking for the \u201cdisconnect between Australia\u2019s impressive economic growth story and its failure on so many markers to show progress towards a better, fairer society\u201d. \u201cFavouring the market system ahead of the state system, and individual interests ahead of community interests, can lead to profoundly unfair social outcomes. \u201cThose unable to afford access to decent standards of housing, healthcare, and other essential services have to settle for inferior arrangements, or go without.\u201d Fraser says charitable organisations see the effects of \u201creal poverty\u201d that result in \u201cmisery, anxiety and loss of self-esteem of mothers unable to put food on the table for their kids, of old and young homeless people, and the victims of domestic violence and drug overdoses\u201d. Fraser summarises the key thrusts of neoliberalism as \u201cthe pursuit of the lowest possible rates of income and most other taxes and the maximum restraint on government interventions and spending programs\u201d. Evidence in Australia and overseas shows the influence of neoliberalism on fiscal policy \u201cand the misery and social polarisation that has come with it\u201d, he says. The global financial crisis \u201cshould have\u201d marked a tipping point, when the \u201cidealised view of financial markets being self-regulating\u201d was shattered. While Australia \u201cavoided the worst traumas of the GFC\u201d with prompt fiscal and monetary policy responses, in Europe \u201ctaxes were increased and spending programs slashed\u201d, resulting in a further five or six years of severe recession. Fraser says that all political ideologies \u2013 taken to extremes \u2013 can be divisive and cause damage, including an ideology \u201cbased on a state system\u201d. But the former Reserve Bank governor focuses on neoliberalism because it \u201cremains in vogue\u201d. The Morrison government \u201ccontinues to reaffirm its over-riding commitment to lower taxation, and to assert that this is the best way to increase investment, jobs and economic growth\u201d - despite the lack of evidence to support the theory. Although Fraser recognises that politics never can or should be taken out of policymaking, he suggests the best course is to \u201chammer away\u201d at flaws of particular approaches. For example, Fraser praises \u201cthe avoidance of costly tax cuts accruing to large corporations\u201d as a positive development \u2013 referring to the Turnbull government abandoning the big business component of its $50bn 10-year company tax cut plan. He suggests the \u201cquick done-deal\u201d of Labor signing up to the Coalition\u2019s proposed acceleration of the cut to taxes on small and medium business was an example that \u201cpolitical interests are always lurking nearby\u201d. In a separate presentation Keating \u2013 who headed PM&amp;C from 1991 to 1996 \u2013 warns the government\u2019s promise to cap expenditure while simultaneously cutting taxes and returning the budget to surplus is based on overly optimistic assumptions of growth in GDP, wages and productivity. According to Keating, the government must stop assuming there have been no structural changes in the relationship between unemployment and the rate of wage increases. He notes that predictions of a tightening labour market leading to higher wages are predicated on assumptions of growth averaging 3% or as much as 3.5%. He will also say a sustained return to past rates of economic growth will be impossible unless we can ensure a reasonably equitable distribution of income, involving a faster rate of wage increases, especially for the low-paid.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has announced that, in addition to groceries, its inquiry into Sainsbury\u2019s planned buyout of Asda will examine the sale of petrol, toys, school uniforms and small kitchen appliances. The extent to which fast-growing discount chains Aldi and Lidl act as \u201cclose alternatives\u201d to the two traditional grocers will also be considered by the Competition and Markets Authority, according to a statement outlining the major issues it is considering in relation to the \u00a310bn merger of the UK\u2019s second- and third-largest supermarkets. Stuart McIntosh, the chair of the independent inquiry group carrying out the in-depth investigation, said: \u201cMillions of people shop at Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s every week, so it is essential we carry out a thorough investigation into their proposed merger. Our job is to find out whether the merger will result in people paying more or being faced with less choice or a poorer-quality shopping experience.\u201d The CMA has already begun surveying shoppers and will also ask retailers, suppliers and other interested parties for their views on the merger, including whether discounters now provide a sufficient competitive threat to prevent a merged Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda putting up prices or reducing the quality of their groceries in large stores. Previous inquiries have only considered discounters as major competitors to convenience stores and small supermarkets. In the statement published on Tuesday, the CMA made clear it was prepared to reassess that position. It will also look at the plans for expansion by online players, such as Ocado and Amazon, which deliver groceries straight to shoppers\u2019 homes, and how competition from these newer rivals might evolve. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda are hoping that the CMA will upgrade its view of the threat from discounters and online rivals, where an increasing number of families now buy their weekly shop, as that is likely to reduce the number of stores they will be forced to offload in order to gain approval for the deal. Last month, the CMA identified 463 places where the merged group might have to offload stores as there was a \u201crealistic prospect of a significant lessening of competition\u201d where the supermarkets\u2019 catchment areas overlapped. That initial analysis of the effect of the merger only took into account potential overlap between the two chains\u2019 medium-sized and largest stores and those of their four traditional rivals. It said a more detail assessment, including a look at the role of the discounters, would be a matter for the \u201cphase two\u201d investigation, which is now under way. Aside from groceries, the CMA said the latest phase of its inquiry would look closely at the market for toys, children\u2019s clothing \u2013 especially school uniforms \u2013 and small electrical appliances such as toasters or shavers because it said that Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda controlled a large portion of sales in those categories. The regulator is also concerned that an increase in Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda\u2019s power over suppliers would have an adverse affect on shoppers because it would prompt them to put up prices for other retailers to fund price cuts demanded by the new group, which would control nearly 30% of the market. The companies have previously said major suppliers would have to bear the brunt of a pledge to reduce the price of everyday products after their merger. A spokesperson for Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda said: \u201cWe recognise that this is an important merger and welcome the detailed and thorough review by the CMA. We look forward to working constructively with the CMA and inquiry panel during this second phase of the process and to making our case that the proposed merger is pro-competitive.\u201d",

In the statement published on Tuesday, the CMA made clear it was prepared to reassess that position.</p> <p>It will also look at the plans for expansion by online players, such as Ocado and Amazon, which deliver groceries straight to shoppers\u2019 homes, and how competition from these newer rivals might evolve.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/j-sainsbury\">Sainsbury\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/asda\">Asda</a> are hoping that the CMA will upgrade its view of the threat from discounters and online rivals, where an increasing number of families now buy their weekly shop, as that is likely to reduce the number of stores they will be forced to offload in order to gain approval for the deal.</p> <p>Last month, the CMA identified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/27/sainsburys-and-asda-could-close-400-stores-to-complete-merger\">463 places where the merged group might have to offload stores as there was a \u201crealistic prospect of a significant lessening of competition\u201d</a> where the supermarkets\u2019 catchment areas overlapped.</p> <p>That initial analysis of the effect of the merger only took into account potential overlap between the two chains\u2019 medium-sized and largest stores and those of their four traditional rivals.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s workers have started to repair the damage from a lost decade of wage growth after increased competition for workers pushed the government\u2019s preferred measure of pay to its highest level since the UK was deep in recession a decade ago. The latest health check on the labour market from the Office for National Statistics showed that regular pay \u2013 which excludes bonuses \u2013 was 3.1% higher in the three months ending in August than in the same quarter a year earlier. The ONS said regular pay had not been growing at a faster rate since the final three months of 2008, the period when the government had to bail out UK banks following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. But it added that the acceleration in wages growth in recent months still left real pay \u2013 adjusted for the impact of price increases \u2013 \u00a311 a week lower than it was before the financial crisis erupted. Annual pay growth including bonuses also edged up in the latest quarter, from 2.6% to 2.7% \u2013 barely keeping pace with rising prices. The ONS head of labour market statistics, David Freeman, said: \u201cPeople\u2019s regular monthly wage packets grew at their strongest rate in almost a decade but, allowing for inflation, the growth was much more subdued.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee concentrates on movements in regular pay when assessing wage pressures in the economy, and has been predicting that the fall in unemployment to its lowest level since the mid-1970s would lead to a pick-up in earnings. Threadneedle Street\u2019s regional agents have been reporting that firms are having more difficulty finding staff, a finding supported by the entertainment group Merlin. The company that runs Alton Towers, Legoland and Madame Tussauds warned in its latest financial results that cost pressures were building as a result of tighter labour markets in London and the south-east. Merlin\u2019s chief executive, Nick Varney, said: \u201cThis follows a number of years of legislation-driven cost pressures in the UK leisure industry, including the unconsulted introduction of the national living wage, apprenticeship levy and a significant increase in business rates. \u201cWhile the picture of near full employment in these regions is good news at present, to make this wider reaching throughout the UK and sustainable in the case of any shock or downturn, the government needs to support entry-level jobs. It could do this by increasing the threshold for national insurance contributions, allowing employers to attract more people into work and invest in skills development.\u201d Alok Sharma, the employment minister, said he was encouraged by the rise in wages, adding that it was the seventh month in a row that regular pay had outstripped inflation. But the TUC said the tightening of the labour market was still not leading to decent pay increases. Its general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe government should use the budget to fund a new deal for public-sector pay, which is barely growing in real terms. And the prime minister must make sure that work pays by raising the minimum wage to \u00a310, cracking down on insecure work, ending unfair pay for agency workers and banning zero-hours contracts.\u201d Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s jobs surge is at last feeding through to higher wages, with pay packets growing at their fastest rate since the financial crisis almost a decade ago. \u201cThis pay momentum is very welcome, reflecting a tight labour market with near record numbers of people in work and unemployment at a 43-year low. However, it comes off the back of a truly awful decade for wages. \u201cFurther pay gains may come from falling inflation in the months to come, but sustaining them will require faster productivity growth in the months and years ahead.\u201d The latest ONS figures showed little movement in employment or unemployment in the latest quarter. Employment fell by 5,000 to 32.39 million, while unemployment dropped by 47,000 to 1.36 million. The unemployment rate remained at 4%. Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon, said there was no need for the MPC to respond to the pick-up in earnings with a fresh increase in interest rates. \u201cThe MPC needn\u2019t worry that wage growth is about to get out of control, given the renewed weakness in demand for labour and the remaining pockets of slack,\u201d Tombs said. He added that one reason for the pick-up in earnings had been higher pay for NHS workers in July, which had not been replicated across the rest of the public sector.",

      "bodyText": "WPP is in advanced talks to buy the Financial Times\u2019s London headquarters for more than \u00a390m in another significant break from the Sir Martin Sorrell era. The media and advertising group is understood to be close to striking a deal for the building, as new its chief executive, Mark Read, continues to ring the changes after the company founder\u2019s abrupt resignation in April. The FT is due to vacate the building next year, to return to its previous offices at Bracken House near St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. It is unclear which parts of the sprawling WPP business may be moved to the One Southwark Bridge location, but it could well become the company\u2019s new UK headquarters. In August, WPP relinquished the lease on its Mayfair headquarters, which Sorrell used from the late 1980s to mastermind the company\u2019s growth into the world\u2019s largest marketing services group. The mews house, which housed about 30 of WPP\u2019s 200 core UK staff, is close to Shepherd Market, where Sorrell is alleged to have visited a sex worker, an allegation he strenuously denies. Relinquishing the lease was a symbolic decision by Read while he was jointly running WPP on an interim basis; he was confirmed as chief executive in September. WPP\u2019s head office functions are being moved into two locations, one near the Financial Times building and the other in Sea Containers House, on the South Bank, where the company already has advertising businesses. At the time of moving out of Mayfair, Read said: \u201cWe are reviewing our working environment to make it fit for purpose and ready for our new requirements. And, specifically, to create a more modern and attractive office that is better suited to more collaborative ways of working.\u201d If the deal, first reported by Property Week, is agreed, it would be several years before any WPP operations moved into the Southwark building. The offices are too big for just its head office staff, so they could also house one or more of its agency groups. Pearson, which sold the FT to Japanese media group Nikkei for \u00a3844m in 2015, originally kept hold of the building but decided to put it up for sale in May. It is also exploring a sale of its flagship London premises on the Strand. It was initially reported that Pearson was hoping One Southwark Bridge would fetch more than \u00a3100m.

      "bodyText": "A blacklist of 21 countries whose so-called \u201cgolden passport\u201d schemes threaten international efforts to combat tax evasion has been published by the west\u2019s leading economic thinktank. Three European countries \u2013 Malta, Monaco and Cyprus \u2013 are among those nations flagged as operating high-risk schemes that sell either residency or citizenship in a report released on Tuesday by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Paris-based body has raised the alarm about the fast-expanding $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) citizenship by investment industry, which has turned nationality into a marketable commodity. In exchange for donations to a sovereign trust fund, or investments in property or government bonds, foreign nationals can become citizens of countries in which they have never lived. Other schemes, such as that operated by the UK, offer residency in exchange for sizable investments. The programme operated by Malta is particularly popular because as a European member state its nationals, including those who buy citizenship, can live and work anywhere in the EU. The country has, since 2014, sold citizenship to more than 700 people, most of them from Russia, the former Soviet bloc, China and the Middle East. But concern is growing among political leaders, law enforcement and intelligence agencies that the schemes are open to abuse by criminals and sanctions-busting business people. Transparency International and Global Witness, in a joint report published last week, described how the EU had gained nearly 100,000 new residents and 6,000 new citizens in the past decade through poorly managed arrangements that were \u201cshrouded in secrecy\u201d. Also on the OECD blacklist are a handful of Caribbean nations that pioneered the modern-day methods for the marketing of citizenship. These include Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, and St Kitts and Nevis, which has sold 16,000 passports since relaunching its programme in 2006. After analysing residence and citizenship schemes operated by 100 countries, the OECD says it is naming those jurisdictions that attract investors by offering low personal tax rates on income from foreign financial assets, while also not requiring an individual to spend a significant amount of time in the country. Second passports can be misused by those wishing to \u201chide assets held abroad\u201d, according to the thinktank. Its flagship initiative is a framework for countries to cooperate in the fight against tax evasion by sharing information. Known as the Common Reporting Standard, the framework allows for details of bank accounts an individual might hold abroad to be sent to their home tax office. The OECD believes the ease with which the wealthiest individuals can obtain another nationality is undermining information sharing. If a UK national declares themselves as Cypriot, for example, information about their offshore bank accounts could be shared with Cyprus instead of Britain\u2019s HM Revenue and Customs. \u201cSchemes can potentially be abused to misrepresent an individual\u2019s jurisdiction of tax residence,\u201d the OECD warned. The final names on the list are Bahrain, Colombia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Montserrat, Panama, Qatar, Seychelles, Turks and Caicos Islands, United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. Together with the results of the analysis, the OECD is also publishing practical guidance that will enable financial institutions to identify and prevent cases of avoidance through the use of such schemes, by making sure that foreign income is reported to the actual jurisdiction of residence.",

    "webTitle": "Scottish Power shifts to 100% wind generation after \u00a3700m Drax sale", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Scottish Power has ditched fossil fuels for electricity generation and switched to 100% wind power, by selling off its last remaining gas power stations to Drax for more than \u00a3700m. Iberdrola, Scottish Power\u2019s Spanish parent company, said the move was part of its strategy to tackle climate change and would free it up to invest in renewables and power grids in the UK. The deal also marks a significant expansion and diversification for Drax, whose main business is a coal- and biomass-fired power station in North Yorkshire. Included in the \u00a3702m sale are four gas power stations in England, two hydro schemes and a pumped storage plant in Scotland. That leaves Scottish Power producing all its power from windfarms. While it has many onshore, the firm\u2019s growth is in offshore windfarms, including East Anglia One, which should take the crown of the world\u2019s largest when it opens in 2020. However, the company\u2019s 5 million domestic customers will still be supplied with a mix of green and brown electricity, with some bought from other coal and gas power plant operators. The ScottishPower chief executive, Keith Anderson, said: \u201cWe are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy.\u201d Asked why the firm was selling off its hydro assets too, given they generate green energy, he said that it was partly because they were in the same company as the gas plants and made the sale simpler. But it was also because investment in new hydro was a \u201cdifficult, complex and slow process\u201d compared to wind and solar, Anderson said. Drax will see an immediate boost in its earnings, adding an estimated \u00a390m-\u00a3110m profit in 2019. The company made a profit of \u00a3229m in 2017. The acquisition positions Drax as a key player to fill in the gaps in the UK energy system at times when solar and wind power output is low. It also means that if the company fails to secure the subsidies needed for the new gas power station it wants to build at its North Yorkshire site then it will still have a broad portfolio. The chief executive of Drax Group, Will Gardiner, said: \u201cAs the system transitions towards renewable technologies, the demand for flexible, secure energy sources is set to grow. We believe there is a compelling logic in our move.\u201d He added that the deal was \u201cmuch more about the water than the gas\u201d. While the gas plants were relatively old and would therefore be beaten out of the market as and when new gas plants get built, the hydro plants would keep \u201crunning for a long time\u201d, he said. But the four gas plants acquired by Drax, in Kent, Hertfordshire, Sussex and Lancashire, also give the company what Gardiner called \u201cattractive options\u201d to build further new gas units, if it can make the economics work. Industry watchers said they thought Drax had paid a high price for the power stations. Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein, said the \u00a3702m was \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than what it valued the portfolio. Green groups said the deal showed the government should back renewable energy firms rather than fossil fuel and nuclear companies. Kate Blagojevic, head of energy at Greenpeace UK said: \u201cBig utilities across Europe have been shedding their dirty fossil fuel infrastructure because it makes economic and environmental sense.\u201d The deal is due to complete at the end of the year.",

      "body": "<p>Scottish Power has ditched fossil fuels for electricity generation and switched to 100% wind power, by selling off its last remaining gas power stations to Drax for more than \u00a3700m.</p> <p>Iberdrola, Scottish Power\u2019s Spanish parent company, said the move was part of its strategy to tackle climate change and would free it up to invest in renewables and power grids in the UK.</p> <p>The deal also marks a significant expansion and diversification for Drax, whose main business is a coal- and biomass-fired power station in North Yorkshire.</p> <p>Included in the \u00a3702m sale are four gas power stations in England, two hydro schemes and a pumped storage plant in Scotland. That leaves Scottish Power producing all its power from windfarms.</p> <p>While it has many onshore, the firm\u2019s growth is in offshore windfarms, including East Anglia One, which should take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/06/worlds-largest-offshore-windfarm-opens-cumbrian-coast-walney-extension-brexit\">the crown of the world\u2019s largest</a> when it opens in 2020.</p> <p>However, the company\u2019s 5 million domestic customers will still be supplied with a mix of green and brown electricity, with some bought from other coal and gas power plant operators.</p> <p>The ScottishPower chief executive, Keith Anderson, said: \u201cWe are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy.\u201d</p> <p>Asked why the firm was selling off its hydro assets too, given they generate green energy, he said that it was partly because they were in the same company as the gas plants and made the sale simpler.</p> <p>But it was also because investment in new hydro was a \u201cdifficult, complex and slow process\u201d compared to wind and solar, Anderson said.</p> <p>Drax will see an immediate boost in its earnings, adding an estimated \u00a390m-\u00a3110m profit in 2019. The company <a href=\"https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Drax-Group-plc-Full-year-results-for-the-12-months-ended-31-December-2017.pdf\">made a profit of \u00a3229m in 2017</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The acquisition positions Drax as a key player to fill in the gaps in the UK energy system at times when solar and wind power output is low.</p> <p>It also means that if the company fails to secure the subsidies needed for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/20/drax-power-station-boss-warns-against-reliance-electricity-imports-interconnectors\">new gas power station it wants to build at its North Yorkshire site</a> then it will still have a broad portfolio.</p> <p>The chief executive of Drax Group, Will Gardiner, said: \u201cAs the system transitions towards renewable technologies, the demand for flexible, secure energy sources is set to grow. We believe there is a compelling logic in our move.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the deal was \u201cmuch more about the water than the gas\u201d. While the gas plants were relatively old and would therefore be beaten out of the market as and when new gas plants get built, the hydro plants would keep \u201crunning for a long time\u201d, he said.</p> <p>But the four gas plants acquired by Drax, in Kent, Hertfordshire, Sussex and Lancashire, also give the company what Gardiner called \u201cattractive options\u201d to build further new gas units, if it can make the economics work.</p> <p>Industry watchers said they thought Drax had paid a high price for the power stations. Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein, said the \u00a3702m was \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than what it valued the portfolio.</p> <p>Green groups said the deal showed the government should back renewable energy firms rather than fossil fuel and nuclear companies.</p> <p>Kate Blagojevic, head of energy at Greenpeace UK said: \u201cBig utilities across Europe have been shedding their dirty fossil fuel infrastructure because it makes economic and environmental sense.\u201d</p> <p>The deal is due to complete at the end of the year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Paddy Power Betfair has been fined \u00a32.2m by the gambling industry regulator for failing to protect customers and stop stolen money being gambled. The Gambling Commission said during 2016, the betting group failed to intervene when customers displayed signs of problem gambling and did not carry out adequate anti-money-laundering checks. An investigation by the regulator revealed that two customers were allowed to gamble \u201csignificant sums\u201d of stolen money on the company\u2019s betting exchange, Betfair. One of the customers was the former boss of Birmingham Dogs Home, Simon Price, who spent money with Betfair that he had stolen from the charity. He was jailed in December for five years for defrauding the charity of \u00a3900,000 over a four-year period. Failings were also identified involving three online customers and in the betting firm\u2019s shops, including weaknesses in its source of wealth and social responsibility checks. The executive director of the commission, Richard Watson, said: \u201cAs a result of Paddy Power Betfair\u2019s failings, significant amounts of stolen money flowed through their exchange and this is simply not acceptable. Operators have a duty to all of their customers to seek to prevent the proceeds of crime from being used in gambling. \u201cThese failings all stem from one simple principle: operators must know their customer. If they know their customer and ask the right questions then they place themselves in a strong position to meet their anti-money-laundering and social responsibility obligations.\u201d Of the \u00a32.2m, \u00a31.7m will be donated to Gamble Aware, the independent charity working to reduce gambling-related harm in Britain. The money stolen from Birmingham Dogs Home by Price and spent with Betfair will be returned to the charity. More than \u00a350,000 will be paid towards the commission\u2019s investigative costs. The Paddy Power Betfair chief executive, Peter Jackson, said: \u201cWe have a responsibility to intervene when our customers show signs of problem gambling. In these five cases our interventions were not effective and we are very sorry that this occurred. In recent years, we have invested in an extensive programme of work to strengthen our resources and systems in responsible gambling and customer protection.\u201d The latest penalty is part of a wider clampdown by the Gambling Commission on failures within the betting industry. In February, it fined William Hill \u00a36.2m for failing to protect consumers and prevent money laundering.",

      "bodyText": "Sacha Romanovitch, the first UK female chief executive of a major City accountancy firm, will step down from Grant Thornton by the end of this year. The company said Romanovitch would leave her job once a successor was identified. \u201cFollowing discussions with Sacha, the board has agreed that a new CEO is the logical next step to create long-term sustainable profits for the firm,\u201d said Ed Warner, independent chair of Grant Thornton UK\u2019s partnership oversight board. Romanovitch said: \u201cAs we enter the next phase of our plans, following discussions with Grant Thornton\u2019s board, we have agreed that the time is right for a new chief executive to take the firm forward. I will be working to support a smooth transition to our next chief executive, focusing on continuing to deliver sustainable value for our clients through our diverse and talented team.\u201d Romanovitch has worked at Grant Thornton for 28 years, becoming a partner in 2001 and becoming chief executive of the global accountancy firm\u2019s UK business in 2015. She introduced changes including capping her own salary at 20 times the firm\u2019s average pay. The firm\u2019s partnership structure was overhauled with a John Lewis-style profit-sharing scheme for all staff, rather than just partners. Last month, an unnamed Grant Thornton insider claiming to speak for 15 partners or directors [\u00a3] leaked to several news organisations the contents of Romanovitch\u2019s annual performance review and an unsigned complaint saying she had \u201cmisdirected\u201d the firm. The anonymous writer accused Romanovitch of pursuing a \u201csocialist agenda\u201d and that the firm had no focus on profitability under her leadership and was \u201cout of control\u201d. Romanovitch responded: \u201cA small cadre of partners will find it hard we are making decisions that will depress profits in the short-term but will help profits in the long-term \u2026 If profits get unhinged from purpose it might not hurt you now, but it will come back and bite you on the bum.\u201d The accountancy industry is under intense scrutiny after a series of high-profile company collapses in recent years including Carillion, which was audited by KPMG. The UK\u2019s audit watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), laid out a series of changes earlier this month to tackle what it admitted was the \u201cunderlying falling trust in business and the effectiveness of audit\u201d. The FRC proposed that big accountancy firms could be banned from earning lucrative consultancy fees at businesses they audited and severely rebuked KPMG, finding \u201ca deterioration in the quality of the audits that we inspected to an unacceptable level\u201d. The FRC is itself under intense pressure to improve its performance. It has been widely criticised as being too timid and too close to the firms it is supervising and is the subject of a government review, led by Sir John Kingman, to determine if it is fit for the future. Grant Thornton handles the accounts of Patisserie Holdings, owner of Patisserie Valerie, which has been rocked by an accounting scandal and came close to collapse before getting a \u00a320m lifeline from its chairman Luke Johnson. The FRC said on Friday it was looking into the Patisserie Holdings case. The Serious Fraud Office has said separately it has opened an investigation into an unidentified individual in connection with the scandal. In August, Grant Thornton was fined \u00a34m by the FRC after four of its senior staffers admitted misconduct in handling the financial audits of Nichols Plc and the University of Salford. In 2016, Grant Thornton was criticised by MPs investigating the collapse of retailer BHS for its role advising Dominic Chappell, the three-time bankrupt who bought the business a year before its demise. Grant Thornton said that it was only doing \u201cfinancial due diligence\u201d for Chappell\u2019s consortium in the pre-acquisition period. Its post-deal consultancy work was undertaken because it believed it had \u201cexperience of real value to share with BHS and its management\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "If you thought John McDonnell\u2019s plan to force all big companies to give a collective 10% stake to their workers was a detailed policy announcement, think again. Judging by a comment aimed at a business audience, the shadow chancellor is prepared to be flexible. \u201cIf you can achieve the same objective by a different route, then come and talk to us,\u201d said McDonnell in an interview with the FT. Let us hope flexibility includes a willingness to start almost from scratch. The only strong part of plan A was the enthusiasm for boosting employees\u2019 share stakes. The problem lay in basic features of McDonnell\u2019s \u201cinclusive ownership funds\u201d. The most glaring flaw \u2013 obvious to anyone who crunched a few numbers \u2013 was that the plan didn\u2019t look like share ownership as the rest of the world understands the term. The central oddity was that individual employees would merely be entitled to a maximum of \u00a3500 from dividends every year and any dividend balance would go to the Treasury. At Lloyds Banking Group last year, that would have meant 68,000 staff sharing \u00a334m while the Treasury received \u00a3185m if the 10% ownership limit had been reached. That is plainly more of a tax-raising measure than anything else. More extreme examples can be found at other FTSE 100 companies. One could point to other difficulties. Would companies depress wages and pensions contributions in response? Who would decide how the collectively owned shares are voted? Would the employees or the Treasury collect the proceeds from the 10% stake when companies are taken over? Employee share ownership is fertile territory for a popular policy and McDonnell\u2019s instinct was sound on that score. But any credible approach can\u2019t involve the Treasury helping itself to a few billion quid. And, in the interest of fairness to UK-owned companies, the shadow chancellor, if he wants to take the route of compulsion, must explain how he would impose his plan on foreign firms operating in the UK. If he can overcome those hurdles, McDonnell could have something workable. But it will require more than technical tweaks. Superdry sloppy on currency hedges Clothing retailers complaining about the warm weather has become an annual autumn event. Last year Next was first out of the traps. This time it is Superdry, where the additional grumble was about the long, hot summer. The company estimates the weather-related whack to profits this financial year will be \u00a310m, a hefty blow. Superdry wants to reduce reliance on \u201cheavier weight product\u201d, meaning jackets and coats. Good idea, but it would have been better to start more than five months ago. Yet the more alarming part for investors was probably the other half of the warning. Losing \u00a38m from foreign exchange hedges is sloppy and the explanation was weak. The financial instruments did not provide \u201cthe same degree of protection as expected\u201d and the fault seems to have been caused by poor communication between buying teams and the finance department. Its chief executive, Euan Sutherland, says the company is now on top of the problem. One should hope so. Hedging currency risk is basic stuff for clothing firms with international expansion plans. The boasts about being a modern \u201cglobal digital brand\u201d are less impressive if \u00a38m can be lost via lack of old-fashioned financial discipline. The result is that, instead of full-year profits of about \u00a3110m, the City now expects a figure slightly below \u00a390m. It would represent the first fall in annual profits since 2012. In the circumstances, the severe 21% fall in the share price looks about right. Johnson has egg on his face over Patisserie borrowing \u201cI didn\u2019t even know there were bank overdraft facilities,\u201d said Luke Johnson at the weekend, talking about how on earth Patisserie Holdings, where he is the long-standing executive chairman, could report net cash of \u00a328.8m in May but confess to having net debt of \u00a39.8m last week. His declaration of ignorance was too loose. Under \u201cliquidity risk\u201d, page 10 of Patisserie\u2019s 2017 accounts clearly stated that \u201cshort-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities\u201d. Page 38 recorded zero borrowing at the balance sheet date but repeated the information that the group \u201chas a short-term overdraft facility in place\u201d. Page 39, while stating that cash balances fund normal trading activity, added: \u201cThe group also has access to both short-term and long-term borrowings to finance individual projects.\u201d So what, precisely, was Johnson claiming in the Sunday Times? Was he saying that separate borrowing facilities were set up without his knowledge? Or was he conceding that he didn\u2019t know the true state of the authorised facilities? There is a big difference between the two positions.",
