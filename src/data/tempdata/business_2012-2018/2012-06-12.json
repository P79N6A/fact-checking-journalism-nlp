      "bodyText": "Columbia University is facing accusations of a conflict of interest relating to the role of its president in cheerleading for the boss of JP Morgan Chase, one of Columbia's most generous financial backers. Lee Bollinger, who has been president of Columbia since 2002, has been a vocal supporter of Jamie Dimon despite mounting criticism of the JP Morgan chief executive since the revelation of a $2bn trading loss at the bank's London office. But critics say Bollinger has put Columbia, one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the United States, in an awkward position because of the financial support it receives from JP Morgan. In the wake of the trading scandal, there have been calls for Dimon to step down from his role on the board of the New York Federal Reserve, one of the institutions with regulatory oversight of Wall Street banks. On Monday, Bollinger said those making such calls were \"foolish\". His intervention was significant because Bollinger is chairman of the New York Fed's board of directors: he became the first board member to speak in defence of Dimon. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal Bollinger said: \"I do not think he should step down.\" Bollinger said critics had a false understanding of how the Fed works. \"Jamie, myself [and] the other members of the board do not get involved in oversight of the supervisory function of the New York Fed,\" Bollinger said. On Tuesday 53 Columbia students, alumni and staff signed a letter to Bollinger accusing him of abdicating his responsibilities at the university. \"As an educator, you have a special responsibility to demonstrate moral and intellectual credibility, something you have failed to do in this situation,\" they wrote, calling on him to withdraw his support and push for Dimon's resignation. \"Three years after the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, the country is struggling to rebuild its economy.

There is some suggestion that Osborne thought his remarks were off the record. His comments came as hopes faded that the weekend announcement of a \u20ac100bn (\u00a381bn) bank rescue package would be enough to bring an end to the two-and-a-half year crisis as anxiety about developments in Greece, Italy and Cyprus as well as Spain gripped financial markets. Osborne also expressed unhappiness with the way the rescue package for Spain's banks was organised. \"What is depressing \u2026 is that everyone said to the eurozone that if you do not directly recapitalise these banks, if you do it via the Spanish sovereign, then you are not going to convince the market that the Spanish sovereign is entirely credible \u2026 and yet they went ahead down this route.\" Interest rates on Spanish bonds rose to 6.8% on Tuesday, a rate not seen since the pre-euro days of the 1990s, the spread between German bonds widened to a record 537 basis points and the cost of insuring Spain against a debt default reached an all-time high.

The remarks brought a furious rebuke from the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, who said they were \"completely inappropriate\" for an EU finance minister.

      "bodyText": "Jeffrey Rosen, the chairman of the remuneration committee of WPP, will be in the firing line on Wednesday when investors are expected to hand a stinging rebuke to the advertising and media company over its pay policies. An investment banker who led the discussions with shareholders over a 30% salary rise for the chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, Rosen faces a protest vote against his re-election to the board following a deterioration in the relationship with investors in the FTSE 100 company. The remuneration report \u2013 which contains the details of the rise in Sorrell's salary to \u00a31.3m and a total pay rise of 60% when bonuses are included \u2013 is also believed to be on course to be the sixth remuneration report defeated by shareholders this year. This would be a record tally of defeats since the vote on pay policies was introduced almost 10 years ago and would mark a high point in the so-called \"shareholder spring\" this year following the consultation by business secretary Vince Cable over executive pay. Cable will later this month outline the precise new powers he intends to hand investors to clamp down on pay, although he seems set to back-track on annual binding votes on future pay deals in addition to the current advisory vote. A 75% threshold may be imposed, however, on a binding vote on any new pay policies. Premier Farnell endured a 30% protest against its pay policies on Tuesday and further rebellions are expected in the coming weeks as the annual general meeting season continues. The WPP chairman, Philip Lader, is expected to admit to those who attend the meeting that the company needs to embark on a fresh round of discussions with City institutions over pay deals. But Lader, a former US ambassador to London, is also likely to continue to defend the need to increase Sorrell's pay on commercial grounds, arguing the chief executive has not had a rise since 2007 and needs to be paid in line with his global peers. Sorrell last week made a highly unusual defence of his pay packet, writing in the Financial Times that he had set up WPP from one room with two people and market value of \u00a31m to the \u00a310bn company it is today, with 160,00 staff in 108 countries. A vote against the remuneration report has been cards since a number of high profile proxy voting agencies \u2013 who exercise votes on behalf of big institutions \u2013 had recommended a vote against the pay awards. While the agencies did not recommend a vote against Rosen, who is managing director of investment bank Lazard, some investors are also thought to have cast votes to protest against his handling of the pay award by either voting against him or deliberating abstaining. He could face a protest of around 20% \u2013 similar to that faced by Alison Carnwath, the Land Securities chairman who chairs the remuneration committee at Barclays at the bank's annual meeting in April. Rosen settled on a 30% rise in Sorrell's salary only after trying to win backing in private for a 50% rise in negotiations with investors last year. The row over executive pay has been reignited following a survey by Manifest/MM&amp;K which showed FTSE 100 chief executive pay had risen 12% last year when the index fell 5%. MPs also seized upon the mood against top pay at a Treasury select committee when leading City figures faced hostile questions about why executives needed bonuses when nurses and teachers worked for their salaries and the potential impact of putting employees on remuneration committees. \"I don't think there's a silver bullet,\" said David Pitt-Watson, chair of Hermes Focus Asset Management. The rise in salaries and disparity between boardroooms and ordinary staff was evidence that the system was not working well, he added.

      "bodyText": "The Spanish banking bailout has been roundly booed by the markets so it must be time for a new big idea. Here's one: Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European commission, is urging all EU countries to adopt a banking union, meaning centralised supervision of banks, a cross-border guarantee scheme for depositors and an EU rescue fund for failing banks. This certainly counts as a grand vision \u2013 even a potential game-changer, in the jargon of the crisis. But could it really be put in place by next year, as Barroso suggested in his FT interview? Not a chance. The central flaw is obvious: Germany simply isn't about to agree overnight to underwrite directly banks in Spain, Portugal and elsewhere in exchange for a mere pledge that a supercharged banking supervisor would prevent foul play. The danger in a banking union, as the Bundesbank was quick to say on Tuesday, is that weak banks could be stuffed with sovereign debt to lower artificially the cost of borrowing for a struggling sovereign. That's a formula for making strong members of the eurozone directly liable for the debts of the stragglers. It's wishful thinking to believe Angela Merkel could be bounced into such a commitment \u2013 or, at least, not before fiscal union, meaning central control of eurozone budgets, has happened and been seen to work, a process that would take many years. Indeed, the structure of the Spanish bailout is evidence that a ringfenced rescue fund for banks is currently a non-starter. The \u20ac100bn (\u00a381bn), or whatever the final figure turns out to be, is being directed through the Spanish government and will count as national debt. The euro leaders knew (let's assume) they were running the risk that Spain's cost of borrowing would soar (as it has) but they chose that course anyway because it was the only politically viable option. So what's Barroso's game in pushing so hard for banking union? Maybe he believes a few ingredients of his idea could survive German objections, and so convince investors that a decisive step has been taken towards fiscal union. That, too, seems like wishful thinking. The only element of banking union that looks unproblematic is the notion of a common banking supervisor in the eurozone. But that's only easy to agree because it doesn't alter current arrangements dramatically. There are already Basel III rules for banks on capital thresholds and liquidity and even a pan-European regulator for banks, in addition to national supervisors. Adding a further layer of centralisation wouldn't amount to much, as investors would quickly realise. One is left with the explanation that the euro authorities are running out of ideas. The surge in Spanish and Italian bond yields, to 6.74% and 6.17% respectively, says as much.",

The latest involved Royal Dutch Shell, which was said to be interested in Paris-listed oil group Maurel &amp; Prom. The French group has a presence in Africa and Latin America, works in 11 countries and is currently valued at \u20ac1.2bn although gossips suggested Shell would have to pay substantially more to win the day.

Ahead of the Rio+20 Earth summit later this month, she said the rich should restrain their demands for higher incomes while there are still 200 million people worldwide looking for a job and poverty is on the rise. Giving her clearest backing yet to green taxes and a range of measures to protect the environment, she argued for taxes on petrol-guzzling cars among a range of green measures to tackle climate change. \"It has been 20 years since world leaders first went to Rio to commit to the noble goal of protecting the planet for future generations. And now, 20 years on, we will be journeying back to Rio to affirm our commitment to sustainable development \u2013 the idea that we should strive for economic growth, environmental protection and social progress at the same time,\" she said in a speech in Washington on Tuesday. \"The idea that different economic, environmental and social objectives can be seen as distinct aspects of a single vision, essential parts of a connected whole.\" But she said the current economic crisis in Europe and slowing growth worldwide, coupled with the growing threat from climate change and social tensions could wreck the efforts of leaders to chart a more sustainable future. \"Over the past four years, we have been mired in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And we are not out of it yet. \"In fact, tensions are on the rise again, and financial stability risks have once more moved front and centre. Great uncertainty hangs over global prospects. \"Too many regions today are still stuck in a trap of low growth and high unemployment,\" she said. \"Right now, 200 million people worldwide cannot find work, including 75 million young people trying to take their first step on the ladder of success. \"So we need a strategy that is good for stability and good for growth \u2013 where stability is conducive to growth and growth facilitates stability.\" Lagarde, a right-wing former French finance minister, recently caused a storm of controversy after she accused Europeans of blocking progress to end the current financial crisis. Asked if she sympathised with Greeks impoverished by austerity measurers demanded by Brussels, she said the children of Niger were more her concern. It also emerged that Lagarde pays no tax on her $467,940 (\u00a3298,675) a year salary. Ahead of the summit, she said taxes on petrol and other carbon fuels could raise billions of dollars for green investment projects. \"Right now, less than 10% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions are covered by formal pricing programmes. Only a handful of cities charge for the use of gridlocked roads. Farmers in rich countries are undercharged \u2013 if charged at all \u2013 for increasingly scarce water resources.\" She added: \"Many countries continue to subsidise polluting energy systems. These subsidies are costly for the budget and costly for the planet. Countries should reduce them. But in doing so, they must protect vulnerable groups by tightly focusing subsidies on products used by poorer people, and by strengthening social safety nets.\"",

    "webTitle": "UK manufacturing performance much poorer than it first appears", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A combination of the crisis in the eurozone and weak domestic demand is putting the skids under the UK's manufacturing sector once again. Like the economy as a whole, industry is still struggling to get back to the level of output at which it entered recession and is once again facing severe headwinds. The latest release from the Office for National Statistics showed that industrial production \u2013 the sum of manufacturing, North Sea output and electricity, gas and water supply \u2013 remained unchanged between March and April. This, though, was a much poorer performance than it looked on the surface. Firstly, industrial production was boosted by a strong weather-related increase in gas and electricity supply caused by the unusually cold spring weather. Manufacturing, which makes up two-thirds of industrial production, saw a 0.7% month-on-month decline. Secondly, business surveys had suggested that April had been quite a good month for Britain's factories and there were hopes that higher production would help the economy grow in the second quarter of 2012 following declines in the last three months of 2011 and the first three months of 2012. It now looks even likelier that gross domestic product will fall for a third successive quarter between April and June, particularly given the impact on output from the extra bank holiday. Clearly, the travails of the single currency are having an impact, and the intensification of the euro's sovereign debt problems following the Greek and French elections in early May suggests that worse is to come for UK exporters. That, though, is not the end of the story. Manufacturers are also finding it hard to sell into a home market where consumers are wary and businesses reluctant to invest. Most disturbing of all are the long-term trends highlighted by Tuesday's ONS report. Manufacturing is 8% below its pre-recession peak and shows no sign whatsoever of being the engine for economic rebalancing sought by ministers. In the recoveries of the 1980s and 1990s, a big fall in the value of sterling led to a strong, if temporary, rebound in manufacturing output. Despite a 25% reduction in the value of the pound since 2007, that has not happened this time. This suggests that the UK's problems are deeply structural: there is insufficient manufacturing capacity, ageing plant and machinery and a tendency for cash-strapped firms to use a cheaper currency to increase margins on their existing export sales rather than as a way of breaking into new markets. This is all happening at a time when the North Sea is running dry. Oil and gas extraction in April was 59% of its level in 2008, a quite staggering decline in such a short period. As a nation, we have become used to North Sea production compensating for the hollowing out of manufacturing. That is no longer a tenable proposition, and it is nothing short of a national scandal that the chance has been blown to use this once-in-a-lifetime windfall to refit the economy for the 21st century.",

      "body": "<p>A combination of the crisis in the eurozone and weak domestic demand is putting the skids under the UK's manufacturing sector once again.</p> <p>Like the economy as a whole, industry is still struggling to get back to the level of output at which it entered recession and is once again facing severe headwinds.</p> <p>The latest release from the Office for National Statistics showed that industrial production \u2013 the sum of manufacturing, North Sea output and electricity, gas and water supply \u2013 remained unchanged between March and April.</p> <p>This, though, was a much poorer performance than it looked on the surface. Firstly, industrial production was boosted by a strong weather-related increase in gas and electricity supply caused by the unusually cold spring weather. Manufacturing, which makes up two-thirds of industrial production, saw a 0.7% month-on-month decline.</p> <p>Secondly, business surveys had suggested that April had been quite a good month for Britain's factories and there were hopes that higher production would help the economy grow in the second quarter of 2012 following declines in the last three months of 2011 and the first three months of 2012. It now looks even likelier that gross domestic product will fall for a third successive quarter between April and June, particularly given the impact on output from the extra bank holiday.</p> <p>Clearly, the travails of the single currency are having an impact, and the intensification of the euro's sovereign debt problems following the Greek and French elections in early May suggests that worse is to come for UK exporters. That, though, is not the end of the story. Manufacturers are also finding it hard to sell into a home market where consumers are wary and businesses reluctant to invest.</p> <p>Most disturbing of all are the long-term trends highlighted by Tuesday's ONS report. Manufacturing is 8% below its pre-recession peak and shows no sign whatsoever of being the engine for economic rebalancing sought by ministers. In the recoveries of the 1980s and 1990s, a big fall in the value of sterling led to a strong, if temporary, rebound in manufacturing output. Despite a 25% reduction in the value of the pound since 2007, that has not happened this time. This suggests that the UK's problems are deeply structural: there is insufficient manufacturing capacity, ageing plant and machinery and a tendency for cash-strapped firms to use a cheaper currency to increase margins on their existing export sales rather than as a way of breaking into new markets.</p> <p>This is all happening at a time when the North Sea is running dry. Oil and gas extraction in April was 59% of its level in 2008, a quite staggering decline in such a short period. As a nation, we have become used to North Sea production compensating for the hollowing out of manufacturing. That is no longer a tenable proposition, and it is nothing short of a national scandal that the chance has been blown to use this once-in-a-lifetime windfall to refit the economy for the 21st century.</p>",

      "bodyText": "BMW workers in Birmingham will build the hi-tech engines for the automotive group's i8 hybrid sports car after beating competition from sister factories in Germany and Austria. BMW said the engines could have been made at its facilities in Munich or in Steyr, Austria, but it had been encouraged by the UK government's support of the domestic car industry, where BMW employs about 6,100 manufacturing staff. The three-cylinder petrol engines for the plug-in hybrid car \u2013 which alternate between a conventional combustion engine and battery power \u2013 will be made exclusively at BMW's Hams Hall site in Birmingham, which also makes engines for the BMW-owned Mini brand. Ian Robertson, BMW's head of sales and marketing, said a UK investment spree by carmakers, backed by support from ministers in recent years, had influenced the decision. He said: \"There are some very encouraging steps in terms of what the government and industry has been doing. \"Our activity in manufacturing also follows our sales and we see that the UK market is not only a strong volume market but also has a high proportion of premium.\" The i8 project is not expected to add many jobs because the Hams Hall site, which employs nearly 800, is highly automated and produced more than 430,000 engines last year. The investment for the i8 is largely covered by a \u00a3500m capital expenditure programme announced by BMW last year. The car is expected to launch in 2014. Speaking at the 2012 international summit at the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), Robertson added: \"Our 3 series car is regularly in the top 10 for volume sales in the UK. And the premium market here is very large, about 25% (of sales).\" Robertson said the strong appetite for premium vehicles in the UK, as underlined by recent record profits at Jaguar Land Rover, required an \"ongoing manufacturing presence\". \"We see the UK as a very strong market going forward in terms of sales,\" he said, pointing out the manufacturing cost benefits of making cars in cheaper sterling and adding: \"We see the government balancing the economy towards manufacturing. The conditions for manufacturing are good here.\" Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive, said: \"The announcement that BMW will build its new i8 sports car engine in the UK at its Hams Hall plant is great news for the UK and demonstrates that international companies continue to see the UK as a competitive manufacturing base and key market for new products.\" The SMMT has set an all-time manufacturing target for the industry and has predicted that the UK could surpass the 1.92m cars produced in 1972, with more than 2m units manufactured in 2015. It would represent a significant leap on 2001, when the industry produced1.3m units . Nonetheless, the industry is growing apace in the wake of significant investment announcements by manufacturers with a strong UK presence, such as Honda and Nissan, as well as homegrown players such as Jaguar Land Rover. In the first four months of 2012 car manufacturing in the UK increased by 11.8% compared with the same period in 2011. In another boost for UK industry, Bombardier Aerospace in Belfast announced its biggest ever order for aircraft thanks in large part to global investor Warren Buffett. The Belfast division of Bombardier located at four sites across the city is to build 100 Challenger Jets worth at minimum \u00a31.3bn. The order comes from Buffett's company NetJets and secures the jobs of more than 5,000 workers. Bombardier is the biggest manufacturer based in Northern Ireland.",

The US federal government could emulate this example by compensating the states more generously for their Short-Term Compensation programmes. Its failure to do so not only inflicts avoidable pain and suffering on the unemployed, but also threatens to inflict long-term costs on American society. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2012",

IAG chief executive Willie Walsh accused the government of \"doing everything it can to suppress and damage\" the aviation industry, saying it \"tops the list\" of governments worldwide that \"don't get it\". Walsh said: \"They government takes for granted aviation's economic contribution \u2013 and that it will continue despite their efforts to suppress it.\" He cited the lack of capacity, high taxation and a stringent visa regime deterring foreign visitors as the three major factors. \"I think it's fascinating, the prime minister travelling round the world highlighting Rolls Royce and the great engines that they make and forgetting that most of those engines are on British aircraft. There's no recognition of that. \"It's completely disconnected in terms of strategy and we're suffering seriously as a result.\" Picking up on a familiar theme at the conference of Iata, the International Air Transport Association, he said that air passenger duty, \"the highest aviation tax in the world\", was destroying jobs. \"The UK can see this tax money coming in but are blind and deaf to the negative effects.\" While Walsh said he had \"given up\" talking about the third runway at Heathrow and that the Thames Estuary airport, championed by Boris Johnson among others, would never happen. Asked about the anticipated, and delayed, policy review, which has ruled out Heathrow expansion in advance, he said: \"The fact that we don't have an aviation policy two years into this government \u2013 and they're going to exclude the obvious \u2013 tells you everything you need to know. \"Heathrow is the number one airport in the world and the debate in the UK is whether to close it down. In a decade, people will look back and say how did we let this happen?\" Walsh contrasted the value placed on aviation in the UK with that of China, the conference hosts, and the \"progressive economy\" of the UAE, which has become the fourth ranked nation in the world for international passengers. \"If we had that attitude we'd not only have a fantastic industry but a much stronger global economy.\" Tourist chiefs also voiced their frustration in Beijing. David Scowsill, the head of the World Travel and Tourism Council, said that the British government \"doesn't listen on a whole range of issues\" from visas to taxes, and accused it of being \"rude and frankly dismissive\" to officials from South Africa and the Caribbean who had tried to press their concerns over the damage British flight taxes were doing to their own economies.
