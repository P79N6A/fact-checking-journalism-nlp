      "bodyText": "Pay for chief executives at Britain\u2019s biggest listed companies rose more than six times faster than wages in the wider workforce last year as the average boss\u2019s pay packet hit \u00a33.9m. Chief executive pay at businesses on the FTSE 100 index surged 11% on a median basis in 2017 while average worker earnings failed to keep pace with inflation, rising just 1.7%, according to the High Pay Centre\u2019s annual review of top pay. A worker on a median salary of \u00a323,474 would have to work 167 years to earn the median annual pay of a FTSE 100 boss \u2013 up from 153 years in 2016, the report showed. The gap between bosses and workers widened despite government efforts to hold companies accountable for runaway pay. Use of the median figure, which smooths out the impact of outsize payments by taking the mid-point when all CEO payments are lined up from the biggest to smallest, mitigated the effect of the two largest and most controversial pay awards: the \u00a347.1m awarded to Jeff Fairburn of the housebuilder Persimmon, last year\u2019s biggest earner; and \u00a342.8m for Simon Peckham, the boss of industrial turnaround specialist Melrose. City investors said the report showed that companies were not listening. Andrew Ninian, director of stewardship and corporate governance at the Investment Association, which represents major fund managers, said: \u201cInvestors have repeatedly highlighted their concerns with excessive CEO pay, so it is frustrating that the message does not appear to be getting through to some FTSE 100 boardrooms. This year we have seen more FTSE 100 companies get significant votes against their remuneration reports than in previous years.\u201d Almost half the votes cast at Persimmon\u2019s annual meeting in April opposed Fairburn\u2019s pay package. Uproar over his pay forced Fairburn to say he would take about half this year\u2019s payout, which could be worth about \u00a360m. At Melrose, which bought the engineering company GKN in May, more than a quarter of shareholder votes failed to back Peckham\u2019s pay deal. Pay at Persimmon and Melrose sent the mean figure for chief executive pay \u2013 which divides total pay for FTSE 100 bosses by the number of CEOs \u2013 up 23% to \u00a35.7m in 2017, which is nine times the rate of mean wage growth. Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Commons business committee, said the government should take tougher measures on pay if company boards, and the remuneration committees that set executive wages, do not step in. She said: \u201cExcessive executive pay undermines public trust in business. When CEOs are happily banking ever-larger bonuses while average worker pay is squeezed, then something is going very wrong.\u201d The report, compiled with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, will reignite the debate over unequal pay following years of workers\u2019 pay being squeezed by weak pay growth and rising prices. Pay growth has slowed to its weakest in a year, official figures showed on Tuesday. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cMost people\u2019s wages are still below 2010 levels and are barely keeping up with inflation. So when they see the fattest cats get fatter yet again with an 11% pay rise, it\u2019s no wonder people question the fairness of our society.\u201d Theresa May vowed to crack down onhigh executive pay when she became prime minister, but the government has watered down its proposals and scrapped a pledge to put workers on boards. Last year\u2019s report by the High Pay Centre\u2019s, a thinktank, showed the median figure for chief executive pay falling 12% and some experts had said companies were showing restraint. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, the umbrella body for British trade unions, said: \u201cPay for most people is barely rising at all. So working people will find it hard to understand why fat cat executives are splashing the cash for themselves. \u201cWorkers should get seats on boardroom pay committees to bring a bit of common sense to pay decisions. And the government should put the minimum wage up to \u00a310 an hour to give more workers a fairer share of the wealth they create.\u201d Other big earners in 2017 included Rob Perrins of the housebuilder Berkeley, whose pay rose \u00a317m to \u00a327.9m, and Sky\u2019s Jeremy Darroch, whose pay jumped to \u00a316.3m from \u00a34.6m. Pay at Persimmon, Melrose and other companies was pushed up by long-term incentive plans (LTIPs), which are meant to reward performance over several years. Shareholders have questioned whether LTIPs are a good way to reflect performance but the plans made up 56% of chief executive pay in 2017 \u2013 up from 48% a year before. The report said LTIPs rewarded individual executives when generally rising share prices, economic growth and the efforts of other workers also contributed to the company\u2019s performance. There were seven FTSE 100 female chief executives in the period covered, with the data based on accounts of FTSE 100 companies in June 2018. The highest earner was Emma Walmsley, boss of GlaxoSmithKline, who was paid \u00a34.9m. The mean figure for women bosses was \u00a32.8m \u2013 less than half the \u00a35.9m average for men. Men are paid more than women in eight out of 10 companies and organisations that reported figures under government rules. The government will require public companies with 250 employees or more to publish and justify the gap between pay for their chief executive and their average worker salary from the start of 2019. The government\u2019s critics have said its measures fall short of the governance revolution promised by May. The High Pay Centre\u2019s report called on companies to implement the new rules immediately and to show the gap between the top 1% of earners and the wider workforce. Companies should also strip back commentary on pay to the essentials to make it easier to understand, the report said.",

They enjoyed a collective 11% pay rise in 2017, having suffered a shocking 12% fall in 2016, according to the annual tally from the High Pay Centre and personnel body CIPD. The average big-company boss got \u00a33.9m. The compilers talk about \u201csignificant government and regulatory developments\u201d in the past year and how \u201cwe might have expected greater downward pressure to be exerted on top by remuneration committees and shareholders.\u201d They sound surprised by their numbers, but shouldn\u2019t be. Any real government pressure evaporated as soon as Theresa May abandoned her tough talk about putting workers on boards. The mandatory publication of pay ratios, to show the difference between the rewards of the boss and the average worker, looms from 2020 but remuneration committees may merely see another opportunity to baffle outsiders by adding complexity to their already-dense reports. That leaves shareholders to apply the brake. The Investment Association, the fund management trade body, these days keeps a \u201cname and shame\u201d list of offenders who have suffered a 20%-plus revolt against a pay report. The tactic is worth a try but it remains to be seen whether any company can, in practice, be shamed. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the business select committee, is nevertheless looking for shareholders to hold boards to account. She should summon a few to understand what she\u2019s up against. Don\u2019t choose the virtuous and more vocal crew who protest against the most egregious packages. Pick on some of the 51% of Persimmon investors who thought chief executive Jeff Fairburn deserved his \u00a375m help-to-buy bonus. It is that silent majority of supine fund managers, resistant to scrutiny of their own rewards, who set the underlying tone. Is private ownership the only way for long-term interests? It\u2019s not quite Elon Musk and Tesla, but esure founder Sir Peter Wood will indeed be staying with the business after the proposed \u00a31.2bn, or 280p-a-share, sale to private equity group Bain Capital. He will roll over \u00a350m of his \u00a3360m stake into the new privately owned structure. If all goes well, he\u2019ll probably make another fortune. From Bain\u2019s point of view, it makes solid sense to keep Wood. As the man says himself, he\u2019s launched seven insurance companies over the years (Direct Line being the other big one) and the new owner probably doesn\u2019t want him to open an eighth. Wood will be locked in for five years. The interesting bit is why he wants to quit the public markets. \u201cAs a private company and with Bain Capital\u2019s backing, esure will be able to invest behind the innovation required to fully realise the opportunities in this market,\u201d he says. Why can\u2019t the investment flow in quoted-company form? Wood\u2019s answer is a Musk-like grumble about the demands of quarterly reporting and shareholders\u2019 appetite for dividends. In his view, the insurance game is about to undergo a data and analytics revolution and the challenge is best tackled with the freedom that privacy allows. Esure\u2019s investors can\u2019t complain too much about the sale price of 280p. On a like-for-like basis that adjusts for the spin-off of price comparison website GoCompare, they are getting about a third more than the flotation price of 2013. But the take-private trend is depressing. Is the stock market now seen as so infected with short-termism that long-term risk-taking is impossible? Sadly, in too many cases, the answer seems to be yes. Royal Mail\u2019s check is delayed in the post Royal Mail committed a serious breach of competition law, says regulator Ofcom, which has imposed a \u00a350m fine for alleged dirty pricing tricks that it says were designed to see off competition in the delivery of bulk mail. The company says its hands are clean and it will appeal. One side will eventually win this quarrel, but it has taken four and a half years to reach this point. Ofcom opened its investigation in February 2014 following a complaint from Whistl, which at the time was trying to break into the delivery market. Indeed, the regulator came to its preliminary judgment \u2013 confirmed in all major respects on Tuesday \u2013 in June 2015. Competition cases are complex, but that\u2019s going some. Delay may also have killed any prospect of competition in the \u201cfinal mile\u201d market, the very thing Ofcom supposedly wanted to encourage. Whistl withdrew at the time of the preliminary ruling and no other firm has stepped up. A \u00a350m penalty may look like bold regulation, but the judgment has taken so long to arrive that it will probably make no practical difference.",

    "webTitle": "Turkey pledges lira support as President Erdo\u011fan announces US goods boycott  \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A late update: Donald Trump is increasingly unhappy that Turkey still hasn\u2019t released Andrew Brunson from house arrest, two years after the pastor was arrested on espionage charges. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told a press briefing that: \u201cThe president has a great deal of frustration on the fact that Pastor Brunson has not been released as well as the fact that other U.S. citizens and employees of diplomatic facilities have not been released. Time for a recap. Turkey\u2019s government has come out fighting today against the market turmoil that sent its currency tumbling in recent days. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan raised the stakes, declaring that Turkey will boycott electronic products from the US. The Turkish president told an audience in Ankara that: \u201cWe will boycott US electronic products. \u201cIf they have iPhone, the other side has Samsung. In our country there is Venus, Vestel.\u201d Finance minister Berat Albayrak also tried to restore confidence, pledging: We will make all kinds of preparations, from A to Z.... You will see that our lira will become stronger.\u201d Albayrak also took a swing at America, saying that the US dollar had lost credibility after being used as a tool for \u201cpolitical punishment\u201d. Turkey\u2019s environment minister also jumped on the boycott bandwagon, saying US products wouldn\u2019t be used for Turkish construction projects. After days of losses, the lira has finally caught a break. It has rallied by over 8% against the US dollar today, back to 6.3 lira to the $, from almost 6.9 on Monday night. But the diplomatic rift between Turkey and the US hasn\u2019t been fixed. The White House is still demanding the release of American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been held since the 2016 coup. Analysts argue that Turkey needs to take decisive steps to prevent the market mayhem continuing; eg, an interest rate hike, improved relations with America, and a strategy to lower Turkey\u2019s current account deficit. Ripples from the Turkish crisis pushed India\u2019s rupee to a record low this morning, apparently forcing the Indian central bank to intervene in the FX markets. Over developing market currencies, such as the Mexican peso and the South African rand, strengthened though. In other news.... Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to a new 43-year low, but wage growth remains disappointingly slow. Germany has posted 0.5% growth in the last quarter, helping the wider eurozone to expand by 0.4% - the same the the UK. After a calmer day than Monday, European stock markets have closed for the night. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 fell by 30 points, or 0.4%, even though worries about Turkey have faded. Mining stocks dragged the index down, as investors switched their attention to worrying about China instead. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Mining stocks are in the red after China revealed disappointing economic indicators overnight. Beijing confirmed that fixed asset investment grew by 5.5% - a record low. Industrial output held steady at 6% in July, but economists were expecting an increase of 6.3%. Retail sales rose by 8.8%, which was below the 9.1% forecast, and it was a slower rate compared with the 9% growth in June. The updates suggest that the Chinese economy is continuing to soften, and this prompted traders to dump mining stocks like Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The German DAX ended the day flat while the French CAC index dipped by 0.17%. And in Istanbul, the Turkish stock market closed 0.75% higher - recovering some of Monday\u2019s selloff. At some stage, the Turkish leadership must move on from simply promising to protect the lira, and actually take action. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group says president Erdo\u011fan must take three steps. allows the Central Bank to significantly hike interest rates; de-escalate tensions with the US by releasing Pastor Andrew Brunson (or signalling a commitment to doing so) restore medium-term investor confidence via a credible program of fiscal consolidation and economic reform. The Turkish crisis could be a good opportunity for the EU to strengthen its relationship with Ankara. After all, both sides have experienced Donald Trump\u2019s confrontational approach to diplomatic relations and trade. Rahman says: Trump\u2019s unpopularity in Europe makes it highly unlikely EU leaders are going to rally behind his approach. If anything, senior EU officials point to the \u201ccommonalities\u201d that the EU and Turkey now both face vis-\u00e0-vis the US\u2014on tariffs, threats and much besides\u2014and suggest these might be used as a jumping off point for any discussion that follows: \u201cWe will tell the Turks we have sympathy for the situation they are in, but not how they are handling it\u201d, says one. Multiple meetings between EU and Turkish counterparts over the coming months will present an opportunity for the EU to better assess the situation; convey its concerns about Turkey\u2019s deep-seated economic problems and reforms needed to fix them; and to potentially strengthen co-operation with Ankara. Turkey will be represented at the EU foreign ministers meeting at the end of the month; a potential Turkey, Russia, France and Germany summit, though still not confirmed, is scheduled for 7 September; and Erdogan is slated to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the end of September. Erdogan is also likely to want to avoid triggering another crisis with the EU. Indeed, earlier yesterday, Albayrak tweeted a very positive response to German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier\u2019s criticism of new US tariffs. The Turkish mainstream (i.e. pro-AKP) media have also been quoting dovish remarks by Merkel. This suggests EU-Turkey relations are likely to continue to thaw, as we saw on 17 May at the EU-Western Balkans summit in Sofia. The blizzard of comments from top Turkish politicians is helping to underpin the country\u2019s currency. As this chart shows, the lira has recovered to around 6.5 lira-to-the-US dollar today - down from 6.88 lira/$ at the close of play on Monday. Traders are cheered by finance minister Albayrak\u2019s pledge to make the lira stronger, and his pledge to stick to free market principles. That\u2019s being taken as a pledge not to impose capital controls to shore up the exchange rate. Finance minister Berat Albayrak also pledged: \u201cWe will protect the lira, we will march with the lira and the lira will strengthen greatly in the coming period.\u201d And on the US dollar, he said: \u201cThe dollar has lost its credibility. In times when the dollar has been turned into a tool for political punishment, we will continue to strongly take steps to protect the lira in international trade.\u201d Turkey\u2019s finance chief has pledged to protect Turkish companies through the currency crisis, and predicted that the lira will recover its losses. Berat Albayrak, Treasury and finance minister (and president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s son-in-law), said the government would protect the economy while sticking to free market rules and maintaining fiscal discipline. Details were scarce, though - but it\u2019s enough to keep the lira around 6.5 to the US dollar, a 5% gain today. Albayrak told members of the ruling AK Party, that: \u201cWe will make all kinds of preparations, from A to Z.... You will see that our lira will become stronger.\u201d (thanks to Associated Press for the quote). Albayrak also followed Erdo\u011fan\u2019s lead, by declaring that the US dollar is being used a means to \u201cpolitically\u201d punish nations, and has lost credibility. That\u2019s a bold claim, given the US dollar has strengthened to a one-year high, while Turkey\u2019s currency slumped to an all-time low of 7 lira to the dollar yesterday.... Turkey\u2019s boycott of American goods is gathering pace! The Turkish environment minister, Murat Kurum, has announced that Turkey will not use US goods in construction projects, Reuters reports. Kurum added that Turkey was going through an economic siege, due to \u2018speculative moves\u2019 in the value of the US dollar. The idea that Turkey will stop buying iPhones has received a mixed reception on the streets of Istanbul. Some Turkish citizens support president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s boycott of US electronics, but others think the idea won\u2019t work. Reuters reports: \u201cWe supported him with our lives on July 15,\u201d shopkeeper Arif Simsek said, referring to a failed 2016 military coup. \u201cAnd now we will support him with our goods. We will support him until the end.\u201d But shopkeeper Umit Yilmaz scoffed. \u201cI have a 16-year-old daughter. See if you can take her iPhone away ... \u201cAll these people are supposed to not buy iPhones now? This can\u2019t be.\u201d America has renewed its efforts to get pastor Andrew Brunson released from house arrest, two years after he was accused of espionage related to the 2016 Turkish attempted coup. Reuters has the details: The U.S. Charge d\u2019Affaires in Turkey visited Andrew Brunson, the evangelical pastor whose detention and trial on terrorism charges has sparked a crisis between the two countries, and repeated a call on Tuesday for his case to be resolved. Jeffrey Hovenier, speaking outside Brunson\u2019s home in the coastal province of Izmir where he is under house arrest, said Washington wanted the pastor\u2019s case \u201cas well as the case of the other unjustly detained Americans, and the Turkish national employees of the U.S. diplomatic mission\u201d resolved fairly, swiftly and transparently. I mentioned earlier that White House National Security Adviser John Bolton told Turkey\u2019s US ambassador yesterday that relations between the two countries won\u2019t thaw until Brunson is released. The Turkish lira is holding onto its earlier gains, and is still up 5% at 6.5 lira to the US dollar. Edward Park of investment management firm Brooks MacDonald fears the rally won\u2019t last, though, unless Ankara take decisive action. How bad could the situation in Turkey get? Nick Brooks of asset management firm Intermediate Capital Group believes things will get worse before they get better, given its weak economic position. Brooks argues for a sharp hike in interest rates (from 17.75% today): The fundamental problem in Turkey has been the build-up of unsustainable economic imbalances (current account deficit if 6.3% of GDP, Corporate foreign exchange debt is 35% of GDP, inflation rate of 16%), while the economy is now in a vicious downward spiral with the fall in the lira leading to concerns about corporate and financial sector solvency, further pushing down the currency and increasing capital outflows. Only a sharp hike in interest rates to halt capital outflows and incentivise inflows will halt the downward spiral. Capital controls, if implemented, will not be effective as Turkey needs foreign capital inflows to fund its current account deficit and to re-finance large foreign currency borrowing coming due this year. Investors will not bring new funds into the country if they don\u2019t believe they will be able to get it back out. Miranda Xafa, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, reckons Turkey could be forced to seek a bailout. Otherwise, it will struggle to repay debts issued in foreign currencies such as the US dollar, she explains: Amid fears that the Turkish currency crisis could pull down the eurozone, the German tabloid Bild has analysed the immediate effects it might have on German consumers. In a rather flippant article, it suggests the price of the popular chocolate spread Nutella should go down (as the hazelnuts in it come from Turkey). Jeans, and other items of clothing which Germany buys en masse from Turkey, should also get cheaper, it adds. But there are risks too. German banks have a \u20ac17bn stake in Turkey, the paper points out (paywall). That\u2019s less than other eurozone nations, such as Spain, whose BBVA bank is one of the most exposed to Turkey. Turkey\u2019s problems have been building for a while, points out Witold Bahrke, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. Bahrke explains how the strengthening US dollar has made Turkey\u2019s current account deficit (the gap between what it imports and exports) a bigger problem. Turkey is in a genuine currency crisis, with the lira falling 30% over three days. Fundamentally speaking, the reason for the Turkish meltdown is primarily a large current account deficit, which is 6% of GDP, and reliance on outside capital. Markets do not care if liquidity stays abundant but can turn toxic when global liquidity dries up due to higher interest rates, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet shrinks, and the US dollar strengthens. Making things worse, there are serious doubts about the ability of policymakers to correctly assess what kind of storm is currently brewing and how to deal with it. Adding to the pain, a dispute between Washington and Ankara around the arrest of a US pastor in Turkey has prompted Trump to impose additional tariffs on Turkey this week. Altogether, we have a perfect storm. Why is Erdo\u011fan so implacably opposed to raising Turkish interest rates, even though inflation has bubbled to dangerous levels? In a nutshell, the Turkish leader has an unorthodox view of economics, arguing that higher rates actually create inflation. Back in May, he called interest rates the \u201cmother and father of all evil\u201d. A month earlier, he criticised the Bank of Turkey for defying him and raising borrowing costs, making the markets concerned about central bank independence. The conventional view, though, is that higher borrowing costs squeeze prices down, as they make credit less affordable. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, thinks Erdo\u011fan\u2019s views are based on experience of Turkey\u2019s previous financial problems \u201cThe current Turkish situation bears all of the hallmarks of the Asian and Russian economic crises of 1997-98, which finally spilled over into the West and led to a short, sharp bear market in developed market share prices, while Turkey last got into serious trouble in 2000-01 when the lira collapsed. \u201cThat crisis followed a period of rip-roaring growth funded by a rising budget deficit and rampant overseas borrowing that left the economy overheating \u2013 which all sounds very familiar today, given Turkey\u2019s $200 billion-plus of overseas debt, inflation in the high-teens and a current account deficit that represents nearly 6% of GDP. \u201cWhen the smash came in 2000, the Turkish lira halved in value and GDP plunged while unemployment and inflation soared. This all happened under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which offered more than $20 billion in financial assistance between 1999 and 2003, in return for a package of interest rate hikes and fiscal austerity. \u201cThis economic disaster paved the way for the 2002 general election victory of the newly-created Justice and Development (AKP) Party under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, so no investor should be surprised by how Mr Erdogan is now responding. \u201cHis rise to power was at least partly fuelled by public discontent with the IMF\u2019s version of economic orthodoxy, so it is no wonder he is determined not to follow the path of higher interest rates and lower government spending now. \u201cGiven that he also called interest rates \u2018the mother of all evil\u2019 in a speech last May, raising the question of whether he wanted to pay interest and repay overseas loans, let alone could do so, all it needed was some unexpected development to puncture confidence in Turkish assets and prompt capital flight. After all, \u2018capital will always go where it\u2019s welcome and stay where it\u2019s well treated\u2019, as one-time Citigroup chairman Walter Wriston once said, and it may well be that Turkey now no longer fits that bill. Turkey\u2019s currency crisis won\u2019t abate until the country\u2019s central bank is allowed to raise interest rates, argues David Kohl, chief currency strategist at Swiss bank Julius Baer. He writes: The Turkish lira has depreciated dramatically over the last few days. However, it is not the overall macro backdrop of Turkey that is so disastrous as to justify the sharp drop of the currency. Economic activity, including export dynamics and domestic demand, is actually growing at a solid pace. The sharp depreciation of the currency is driven by the fact that the Turkish economy is in constant overheating mode, with inflation above 15%. The reluctance of the central bank to step in has been weighing on the lira. Increasing signs that President Erdogan has been expanding his powers into the central bank, preventing rate hikes and articulating an outright demonisation of high interest rates, has led to the panic selling of the currency. Reuters have published more quotes from president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speech in Ankara today. On the currency crisis, he called for Turkey to stay united: \u201cTogether with our people, we will stand decisively against the dollar, forex prices, inflation and interest rates. We will protect our economic independence by being tight-knit together.\u201d He threatened retaliatory action against America\u2019s sanctions and tariffs: \u201cWe will impose a boycott on U.S. electronic products. If they have iPhones, there is Samsung on the other side, and we have our own Vestel here.\u201d Erdo\u011fan\u2019s also urged businesses to keep investing, and not be put off by the market turmoil: \u201cIf we postpone our investments, if we convert our currency to foreign exchange because there\u2019s danger, then we will have given into the enemy.\u201d Shares in Turkish electronics firm Vestel have soared by almost 8%. It\u2019s benefitting from president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s call for Turks to buy its Venus smartphone instead of Apple\u2019s iPhone. Erdo\u011fan hasn\u2019t always been so dismissive of iPhones. Back in the attempted coup in 2016, the Turkish leader famously used Apple\u2019s FaceTime service to mobilise his supporters. Erdo\u011fan made a video call to a Turkish television network, urging the people to \u201cconvene at public squares and airports\u201d to oppose the Turkish military forces who were trying to overthrow him. The appeal worked, and Erdo\u011fan has been tightening his grip on the Turkish levers of power ever since. By threatening to boycott American electronics, president Erdo\u011fan is signalling that he won\u2019t be cowed by the market turmoil. It\u2019s an interesting threat. Turkey\u2019s population is almost 80 million strong, meaning plenty of potential consumers. But...given the slump in the lira, US goods such as iPhones are now much more expensive for Turkish consumers - so sales of pricy imports were already likely to fall. Investors may be concerned that Ankara isn\u2019t trying to calm the crisis - instead, relations with the Trump administration could be getting worse. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com puts it: Erdogan fired a shot back at the US with a statement saying he would ban US electronic goods. I can\u2019t imagine Apple is too worried about this, but it nevertheless points to a worrying deterioration in relations between Ankara and Washington. Erdogan doubling down like this won\u2019t help market sentiment. However, the lira is still holding onto its early gains as the currency stages a cautious recovery, after days of heavy losses. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speech: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country will boycott U.S.-made electronic goods amid a diplomatic spat that has helped trigger a Turkish currency crisis. Showing no signs of backing down in a standoff with the U.S., Erdogan suggested that Turkey would stop procuring U.S.-made iPhones and buy Korean Samsung or Turkish-made Vestel instead. He said: \u201cIf they have the iPhone, there is Samsung elsewhere. We have Vestel.\u201d It was unclear how Erdogan intended to enforce the boycott. Erdogan also renewed a call for Turks to convert their dollars into the Turkish lira, to help strengthen the currency. The Turkish lira has nosedived in value in the past week over concerns about Erdogan\u2019s economic policies and after the United States slapped sanctions on Turkey angered by the continued detention of an American pastor. NEWSFLASH: Turkey\u2019s president is giving another defiant speech, threatening to boycott American electrical goods in response to US sanctions. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has told an audience in Ankara that the US was targeting Turkey. He warns: We will boycott US electronic products. If they have iPhone, the other side has Samsung. In our country there is Venus, Vestel [the Turkish smartphone brand]. Erdo\u011fan also makes a direct threat towards the White House, warning that those who are waging \u201ceconomic warfare\u201d against Turkey will pay a price. According to Bloomberg, he says: There is a price we\u2019re paying for the period we\u2019re in. But there will be a price [which] those who\u2019re waging an economic warfare against Turkey will also pay. Erdo\u011fan is vowing to maintain a \u201cfirm political stance\u201d, as his government takes the necessary measure to protect its economy. Erdo\u011fan also argued that flip-flopping was not in the Turkish nation\u2019s character, and that switching to foreign currencies would be \u201cgiving in to the enemy\u201d. He\u2019s speaking at an event organised by Turkish think tank Seta (the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research). These charts show the divide in Britain\u2019s labour market, with unemployment at a 43-year low, but wage growth decidedly underwhelming: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new 43-year low. The UK\u2019s jobless rate dropped to just 4.0% in April-June 2018, down from 4.2% previously. That\u2019s the lowest level since the winter of 1975, when Harold Wilson was prime minister. The Office for National Statistics reports that the number of people in work rose, while those out of work fell. However, the number of people dropping out of Britain\u2019s labour force also rose, and more people became self-employed. Here\u2019s the details: The number of people in employment increased by 42,000 on the quarter to 32.39 million in the second quarter of 2018. Unemployment declined by 65,000 on the quarter to 1.36 million. The level of inactivity increased by 77,000 on the quarter, resulting in the inactivity rate increasing to 21.2%. The number of self-employed people increased by 22,000 on the quarter to 4.77 million in the second quarter of 2018. However, people aren\u2019t feeling the benefits in their pay packets. Total earnings (including bonuses) only rose by 2.4% per year during the quarter, down from 2.5%. Germany has beaten expectations by growing by 0.5% in the second quarter of 2018. The eurozone\u2019s largest economy benefitted from stronger domestic demand from households and companies. Statistics body Destatis also reports that German exports rose during the quarter, while imports increased at an \u201ceven stronger\u201d pace. Germany has outpaced the UK over the the last quarter (UK GDP rose by 0.4%), and was rather faster than France\u2019s 0.2% expansion. German growth in the first quarter of 2018 was also revised higher, from 0.3% to 0.4%. Teis Knuthsen of Denmark\u2019s Kirk Kapital points out that Germany has now been growing for four years in a row: However, economist Ulrik Bie thinks Germany could still falter in the months ahead, as Turkey\u2019s crisis and the US-China trade wars bite. Despite the rupee\u2019s slide, the picture is brighter in other emerging markets this morning. South Africa\u2019s rand has gained 2%, as it bounces back after hitting a two-year low during Monday\u2019s selloff . Russia\u2019s rouble is up 1.5%, reaching 66.76 to the US dollar having struck 68 (also a two-year low) on Monday. The Mexican peso is also catching a break, up 1% too. Turkey\u2019s stock market is also rallying this morning, up over 2% in early trading. That mean shares have clawed back most of Monday\u2019s losses. After days of very heavy losses, Turkey\u2019s currency is recovering some ground. The lira has risen by around 5%, taking it back to 6.5 lira to the US dollar from over 6.88 late last night. That could be a sign that investors are recovering their nerve - however, this still leaves the lira in a precarious place (it was worth 3.7 lira to the dollar at the start of 2018). India shares another problem with Turkey, and indeed with all emerging markets -- the strengthening US dollar. As America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, capital is being sucked out of developing markets and back to the US (because dollars offer a higher rate of return). That weakens EM currencies, putting pressure on their central banks to raise interest rates too -- which undermines growth. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: Economies with large current account deficits such as India, Argentina and South Africa will come under increased economic pressure as the Fed continues to tighten monetary policy. The rupee\u2019s woes are a sign that emerging market contagion is worsening, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com: India\u2019s rupee slipped to a record low against the dollar, with one USD buying 70 rupees at one point this morning. This follows the chaos in the Argentine peso market on Monday as the currency plumbed fresh depths even as the central bank raised interest rates by 5 percentage points to 45%. The rand is coming off its lows but the pressure across the board is there to see. The Financial Times says the rupee is suffering from investors\u2019 concerns about India\u2019s lack of progress in fiscal consolidation and the country\u2019s widening current account deficit. That sounds rather similar to Turkey\u2019s problems (without the diplomatic row with America, of course) Overnight, America has warned Turkey that it won\u2019t end the diplomatic row between the two countries until US pastor Andrew Brunson is released from house arrest. White House National Security Adviser John Bolton met Turkey\u2019s ambassador to the US, Serdar Kilic, yesterday and insisted that Brunson -- who was arrested in 2016 and charged with espionage -- must be freed. Bloomberg explains: President Donald Trump\u2019s top national security aide warned Turkey\u2019s ambassador on Monday that the U.S. has nothing further to negotiate until a detained American pastor is freed, according to two people familiar with the matter, signaling a standoff between the countries will continue as Turkey\u2019s financial meltdown spreads to emerging markets. More here. Last night, my colleague Martin Chulov reported that a misunderstanding between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan over Brunson, and a Turkish woman detained in Israel, may have helped caused the crisis. The Indian government is urging people not to panic about the rupee\u2019s slide to a record low this morning. Subhash Chander Garg, economic affairs secretary at the ministry of finance, has blame the move on \u2018external factors\u2019 (a reference to the Turkish crisis, and the wider US dollar rally, I think), adding that there is no need to worry. Newsflash: India\u2019s rupee has fallen to a record low, as Turkey\u2019s currency woes sends ripples through emerging markets. The rupee fell to 70.09 to the US dollar on Tuesday morning, as investors fretted that the lira crisis will spread to other developing nations. The slide means the rupee has lost a tenth of its value so far this year. Traders in Mumbai report that the Indian central bank may have stepped in to stabilise the currency after it fell through the 70-point mark for the first time over. N. S. Venkatesh, chief executive of the Association of Mutual Funds in India, told the AFP newswire that: \u201cInvestors are concerned that the rupee has crossed the 70 benchmark today.... The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policy has shown concern for the rupee\u2019s fluctuations so investors should not be worried by knee-jerk reactions in the forex market.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Turkey is in the eye of the storm today thanks to the currency crisis that has wiped a third off the lira\u2019s value in the last week. As we covered yesterday, the Turkish crisis gave other emerging markets a jolt yesterday - forcing Argentina to hike its interest rates to 45% after the peso hit an all-time low. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan refused to bow to pressure from the markets yesterday. Instead, he hit out at the US for imposing sanctions in an attempt to force Turkey to release an American pastor named Andrew Brunson, who is currently under house arrest. He declared: \u201cWe are together in NATO and then you stab your strategic partner in the back.\u201d Currently the lira is bobbing around 6.8 to the US dollar, close to Monday\u2019s all-time low of 7.2. Turkey\u2019s central bank seems to have calmed the crisis a little, by pledging yesterday to provide liquidity to its banking sector. But worries over Turkey are mounting; its inflation rate is pushes higher, its current account deficit is worryingly high, and its companies may struggle to repay loans taken out in US dollars. The markets remain unconvinced that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government can cope with the currency crisis, triggered by the diplomatic spat with Washington that has resulted in higher U.S. tariffs. Many economists argue that Turkey urgently needs a big rate hike, something Erdogan has opposed in the past. European stock markets are expected to open higher, having been dragged down by Turkish worries on Monday. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says investors will be watching emerging markets today. The selloff in the Turkish Lira and the knock-on effects to other currencies and asset classes will continue to attract attention through today\u2019s session. Also coming up today New UK unemployment data is expected to show that Britain\u2019s jobless rate stuck at 4.2%, the lowest in over 40 years. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that wage growth probably remains weak, with basic pay expected to only rise by 2.7% year-on-year. We also get a new estimate of eurozone growth in the last quarter; it will probably confirm that the region\u2019s economy expanded by just 0.3% in April-June.

Back in May, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-currency/turkeys-erdogan-calls-interest-rates-mother-of-all-evil-lira-slides-idUKKBN1IC1NV\">he called interest rates the \u201cmother and father of all evil\u201d</a>.

This all happened under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which offered more than $20 billion in financial assistance between 1999 and 2003, in return for a package of interest rate hikes and fiscal austerity.</p> <p>\u201cThis economic disaster paved the way for the 2002 general election victory of the newly-created Justice and Development (AKP) Party under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, so no investor should be surprised by how Mr Erdogan is now responding.</p> <p>\u201cHis rise to power was at least partly fuelled by public discontent with the IMF\u2019s version of economic orthodoxy, so it is no wonder he is determined not to follow the path of higher interest rates and lower government spending now.</p> <p>\u201cGiven that he also called interest rates \u2018the mother of all evil\u2019 in a speech last May, raising the question of whether he wanted to pay interest and repay overseas loans, let alone could do so, all it needed was some unexpected development to puncture confidence in Turkish assets and prompt capital flight.

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has been fined a record \u00a350m by the UK communications regulator for breaching competition law when it discriminated against its only major rival for delivering letters. Ofcom said the company had abused its dominant position by penalising wholesale customers that sought to deliver bulk mail such as bank statements and council tax demands door to door. The penalty followed an investigation into a complaint by Whistl about changes Royal Mail made to wholesale customer contracts in early 2014, including price increases. At the time, Whistl was expanding its business to compete directly with Royal Mail by employing workers to deliver letters in parts of the UK. Previously the company, known as TNT at the time, had collected and carried out an initial sort of the letters before handing them all to Royal Mail for a final sort and delivery. Ofcom said Royal Mail increased prices for competitors that did not reach volume targets for the whole of the UK. This in effect meant any competitor employing its own delivery workers in certain parts of the country, as Whistl did, would have to pay higher prices in areas where it used Royal Mail. Royal Mail makes \u00a31.5bn a year from delivering so-called access mail that is collected by other companies. Ofcom said under the 2014 price changes Whistl had to pay 0.25p more per letter for Royal Mail to make the final delivery than other operators that used it for all of the UK. Ofcom said Royal Mail had used its dominant position in the mail market to penalise any wholesale customer that tried to compete with it on bulk mail delivery. As a result, Whistl scrapped plans to extend its delivery services to new areas in 2015. It had intended to expand to cover 40% of the country, but the failed expansion ran up losses of \u00a310m. Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom\u2019s competition director, said: \u201cRoyal Mail broke the law by abusing its dominant position in bulk mail delivery. \u201cAll companies must play by the rules. Royal Mail\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable and it denied postal users the potential benefits that come from effective competition.\u201d Royal Mail shares closed down 1.6% to 454.9p. Ofcom said it inspected Royal Mail\u2019s internal documents covering its price changes. They showed the adjustments were part of a deliberate strategy to limit competition in delivery as a direct response to the threat of competition from Whistl, the regulator said. Royal Mail said it was very disappointed by Ofcom\u2019s decision and strongly rejected any suggestion that it broke competition law, adding that that the decision was \u201cwithout merit and fundamentally flawed\u201d. It argued that the 2014 price change was never implemented or paid, adding that it had been \u201crobustly stress tested by Royal Mail under competition law and the relevant regulatory framework\u201d. The company said it was designed to protect its service from \u201ccherry picking\u201d letter delivery and the general decline in mail volumes. Royal Mail said it would lodge an appeal against Ofcom\u2019s fine with the competition appeal tribunal within the next two months. When Whistl, which was owned by the Dutch delivery company PostNL, launched its delivery service in London, Manchester and Liverpool, Royal Mail criticised the move. It said if competitors were allowed to take business in densely populated areas Royal Mail\u2019s deliveries to rural districts would be threatened because profitable deliveries in towns and cities subsidised those in remote locations. Ofcom told Royal Mail to respond to extra competition by becoming more efficient. Under the terms of its privatisation in 2013, Royal Mail is committed to maintaining its universal service at least until 2021.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Terry Thomas, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield, who has died aged 80, brought vision, change and empathy into the dry world of the British bank, proclaiming that banking was too important to be left to bankers. He joined the Co-operative Bank in 1973 and became its managing director in 1988, at which point he seized the reins decisively. Terry caught the mood of the bank\u2019s ethically minded and often well-heeled customers. He democratised the gold card \u2013 making it available to a far wider range of customers and guaranteeing that it would be free for life. The Co-operative Bank was already a member of two international networks of people\u2019s banks, which gave it distinctive representation in Europe and the world. Terry added to that the international Social Venture Network in which he joined entrepreneurs such as Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop, who shared the vision of creating and managing a socially responsible business. This led to his completing the differentiation of the Co-operative Bank from its old-fashioned rivals by launching the idea of an \u201cethical stance\u201d. Terry took bold moves with sensible caution and made it clear from the beginning that the bank was adopting the positions of its customers, not giving them moral lessons. The son of Mildred, who ran a greengrocery stall, and Emrys, a transport manager, Terry was born in Carmarthen, south-west Wales, and educated at the town\u2019s Queen Elizabeth grammar school. He was inspired by his national service to go into a progressive career, in which he was supported by his future wife Lynda Stevens, a teacher. Even so he told Lynda when he joined National Provincial in 1962: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will get a proper job later.\u201d National Provincial merged into the National Westminster Bank in 1970. The decisive career step for Terry came the following year, when he was seconded to the Joint Credit Card Company in 1971 to create, on behalf of straggler banks, a competitor to Barclaycard. He was part of the team that chose Access as the name for the new brand, but by the time the credit card was launched, Terry had been appointed marketing manager at the Co-operative Bank \u2013 the first marketing manager of any British bank. Terry introduced the first Co-operative Bank credit card and brought the marketing buzzword \u201cfree\u201d into current accounts. Banks had been used to charging a small fee for each transaction, offset by a notional interest rate paid on the account balance, but free banking was a compelling proposition. In January 1975 the Co-operative Bank introduced free current account banking as long as the customer maintained a positive balance. Although it was 11 years before any of the big banks followed the Co-operative\u2019s lead, this remains the basis of current account banking today. In 1984, he was seconded part-time to become the first managing director of Unity Trust, the financial institution established jointly by the Co-operative and leading trade unions to deter German and Israeli banks trying to attract the deposits of the UK trade unions. At Unity he brought the employee share ownership plan (esop) to Britain, following a fact-finding mission to the US. Times have changed and nowadays what Terry did in banking terms might not so easily be seen as a good thing. The credit cards that made life easier for millions are now also seen as traps for the unwary; free banking is considered deceptive; ethical stances as a bold norm. When Terry introduced punitive charges for customers who overdrew without permission, it was accepted as a short sharp lesson \u2013 now it is considered unfair practice. But in the 21st century, when commercial bankers have misbehaved to incredible degrees, popular faith in everyday banking and even in the bank manager of yore remains remarkably high. That is due in no small part to Terry. He was a lifelong supporter of the Labour party, so the Co-operative movement gave him a natural home. He was made a CBE in 1997, the year he retired from the bank; and received a peerage as Lord Thomas of Macclesfield later in the year, but a heart problem was to curtail a second career in politics. His second great loyalty after Wales was to his adopted homeland in the north-west. He was the first chair of the East Manchester partnership, and played a part in the 2000 Olympic bid which prepared the way for Manchester\u2019s successful bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games. In 1998 he was appointed the first chairman of the North West Development Agency. He is survived by Lynda, whom he married in 1963, and their three sons. \u2022 Terence James Thomas, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield, born 19 October 1937; died 1 July 2018",

    "webTitle": "Former Co-op director says she was sacked after equal pay claim", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A former executive at the Co-operative Group has alleged that she was sacked after raising an equal pay claim and warning the company could be paying men and women differently for the same roles. Sam Walker, who was in charge of HR, brought a claim of equal pay, discrimination and unfair dismissal against the Co-op, which will be heard over the next two weeks. Giving evidence at an employment tribunal in Manchester on Tuesday, Walker said she was appointed chief HR officer in February 2014 when the Co-op was \u201cin crisis\u201d. In her witness statement, she said she first raised questions about equal pay in 2015 after comparing her salary to other male executives who sat alongside her on the board. She was sacked the following year. Andrew Burns QC, for the Co-op, suggested to Walker that she was \u201cthrown into the deep end\u201d. She replied: \u201cI think anyone taking that job at the time was being thrown in the deep end, because the business was in crisis.\u201d Walker denied having been \u201cparachuted\u201d into the role and being out of her depth. Walker\u2019s witness statement paints a picture of turmoil at the Co-op from 2013-14, with large salaries given to board members in an effort to stop them leaving. She said that in 2014, significant increases were agreed for the then general counsel, Alistair Asher, and the then chief external affairs officer, Nick Folland, who were paid \u00a3550,000, while Walker and the then chief strategy planning officer, Paula Kerrigan, were offered \u00a3400,000 \u201costensibly because we were newly promoted to our roles\u201d. According to Walker\u2019s lawyers, an independent assessment of executive roles by the Hay Group in January 2015 rated her higher than Asher and Folland, with Kerrigan\u2019s role on a par with Asher\u2019s and higher than Folland\u2019s. Walker said she raised equal pay concerns three times with the group\u2019s then chief executive, Richard Pennycook, between November 2015 and the following January. On the first occasion, in mid-November, Walker said she handed Pennycook an article titled The Rise of the Chief People Officer and told him she was performing that role \u201cbut did not have equal value\u201d with other company executives, all but one of whom were men. The following month, Walker said she told Pennycook in a telephone call that she wanted to be \u201crecognised and valued alongside my male peers\u201d. Giving evidence on Tuesday, she said: \u201cIt was very clear I was talking about money at the time and I felt I was doing a job as big as them [her male colleagues]. \u201cI said I wanted to be valued and I\u2019m not currently being valued. I didn\u2019t use the word \u2018victim\u2019. It was very clear it was about pay, which is why when [Pennycook] rang me from Austria, it was all about pay. It was about value because I saw [my role] as the same value as the guys.\u201d She added in her statement: \u201cHowever, I do not see my case simply as being about my own position. Equal pay for women generally is a matter of real importance and concern to me. I am an active member of the Fawcett Society, and am committed to the promotion of transparency and fairness for women at work.\u201d A Co-op spokesman said: \u201cWe do not accept that Sam Walker was discriminated against or treated detrimentally, and intend to fully and robustly defend the various claims brought by Sam.\u201d Walker denied Burns\u2019s suggestion that she had a \u201cvery bumpy\u201d relationship with members of the Co-op board \u2013 who the tribunal heard had privately questioned her performance \u2013 saying only that there were disagreements. The tribunal heard that senior executives had also questioned Walker\u2019s performance over the progress of a huge IT project called 1HR, which Burns described as \u201cover time and over budget\u201d. The IT system was due to be implemented by 1 January 2016, but by October of the previous year, concerns had been raised that it would not be ready on time, the tribunal heard. Walker said the project had not been on track since it launched, but she had brought in the \u201cright people\u201d to improve performance. \u201cLike the rest of the [Co-op structure] rebuild, we inherited a mess. We were trying to rebuild the Co-op,\u201d she said. In her witness statement, Walker said the company went through a regrading exercise of all staff, and she told Pennycook in 2016 that it was \u201cnot looking good\u201d from an equal pay perspective. \u201cI told him that I thought the Co-op had an equal pay problem, which not only exposed the business to legal claims but was inconsistent with the Co-op\u2019s declared values,\u201d she said. Walker said she reminded him that she was, by then, the only woman on the executive committee and wanted to address what she saw as unequal pay. She said she proposed more holidays for herself so her \u201cpro-rated pay could be equivalent to the men on the executive committee\u201d. Her statement said Pennycook at first seemed open to the idea and told her that his wife had made the \u201ctough decision\u201d to step down as a partner at her GP practice and become a regular GP, so she could spend more time with their children, and it was the best decision they had made as a family. Walker said: \u201cI was shocked. I knew he meant well, but it was such old-fashioned and stereotypical thinking.\u201d But Walker said that instead of accepting her proposal, she was instead told she had to accept a new, reduced role. \u201cI had thought I had found a solution that wouldn\u2019t add cost to the company, and here I was finding myself being demoted, suddenly deemed not to be performing and having the function I had built up over two years taken away from me and split up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only reason I could think I was being treated in this way was because I had dared to raise the issue of equal pay.\u201d During the negotiations, her daughter, who is severely disabled, sustained a brain injury and Walker was signed off sick in March 2016. After an evaluation, she was diagnosed with trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, and she is now on medication. Walker was told her employment had been terminated at the start of April. Following her dismissal, Walker submitted a grievance, which was rejected a year later by the Co-op non-executive director Lord Victor Adebowale, who found there was no suggestion of unreasonable discriminatory behaviour. Walker\u2019s appeal against that decision was rejected. Walker argued in her statement that the case was not about money, but \u201cright and wrong\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up in a man\u2019s world, I\u2019ve had a 28-year career with mainly just men around the table once I reached senior positions, and all the time I have been conscious that they have been paid more,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot leave that career, which I now accept is damaged beyond repair by simply making this claim, without trying to put something right. \u201cAll the cases that come to court are class actions. The costs and the intimidation put individuals off. It is a living hell.\u201d Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the women\u2019s rights charity stood \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with Walker. \u201cWomen repeatedly suspect they are undervalued and underpaid. This is illegal, but it is often impossible for individuals to challenge without comparative pay data,\u201d she said. \u201cThe system needs reform to provide real transparency and impose time limits on equal pay cases, which can drag on for years. Otherwise it will continue to operate in favour of employers.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Turkish lira recovered some of its losses on Tuesday, with the country\u2019s finance minister pledging to take steps to support the under-pressure currency. There was some respite for the lira after days of heavy losses. The currency rose 5% to about 6.5 to the dollar on Tuesday afternoon, after slumping 20% in the past four working days. The country\u2019s central bank stepped in on Monday by pledging to provide liquidity to its banking sector. Berat Albayrak, Turkey\u2019s treasury and finance minister, and President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s son-in-law, provided further support with defiant comments on the national currency. Albayrak told members of the ruling AK party: \u201cWe will protect the lira, we will march with the lira and the lira will strengthen greatly in the coming period.\u201d He also attacked the US currency, saying it had \u201clost all credibility\u201d, despite the dollar trading at one-year highs against most major currencies. \u201cIn times when the dollar has been turned into a tool for political punishment, we will continue to strongly take steps to protect the lira in international trade,\u201d he added. Turkey\u2019s stock market also recovered, closing up about 0.75%, compared with a loss of nearly 4% on Monday. In another defiant speech on Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan threatened to boycott American electrical goods in response to US sanctions, and warned that those who were waging \u201ceconomic warfare\u201d against Turkey would pay a price. Nafez Zouk of Capital Economics said: \u201cThe collapse of the lira has thrust Turkey into a currency crisis, leaving the authorities with two difficult options to prevent it from morphing into a debt and liquidity crisis: either accept an economic slowdown (and possible recession) induced by tighter fiscal and monetary policies, or resort to capital controls.\u201d He thought that capital controls \u201cseem more palatable than a recession\u201d, adding: \u201cOn their own, however, capital controls won\u2019t solve Turkey\u2019s problems, and will only make the adjustment process more painful down the line.\u201d In another sign that investor anxieties over Turkey\u2019s market meltdown are easing, South Africa\u2019s rand rose 1.2% against the dollar after sliding more than 9% on Monday, its biggest drop since the financial crisis. The Russian rouble also recovered 1.8% after hitting its weakest levels since 2016 on Monday, and the Mexican peso gained 0.5%. The Indian rupee fell past 70 per dollar for the first time, before recovering and stabilising at about the 70 level. The MSCI EM currency index, which tracks the main emerging markets currencies, recovered 0.3% after Monday\u2019s 0.66% drop. European stock markets rose, while the FTSE 100 index in London slipped 0.16%. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: \u201cThe dollar is crushing everything in its path at the moment and this is not good for emerging markets or global growth. \u201cHowever, the fears of contagion can be over-egged and we note that the dangers so far seem confined to countries with large current account deficits and high dollar financing, as well as some corporates, largely banks, with exposure to that debt. Nevertheless, as stimulus is gradually unwound, we are seeing the markets test countries with exposure to dollar debt in a way not seen for some years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Pay growth in Britain has slowed to its weakest in almost a year despite a fall in the jobless rate to a fresh 43-year low and the biggest annual drop in workers from the EU since modern records began more than two decades ago. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed wage inflation cooling in the second quarter of 2018 even though unemployment fell from 4.2% to 4.0% \u2013 its lowest level since the winter of 1974-5. The trend in earnings confounded predictions from the Bank of England that a tighter labour market would intensify pay pressures and brought Threadneedle Street\u2019s decision to raise interest rates earlier this month under fresh scrutiny. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee cited upward pressures on earnings as the main reason for hiking the cost of borrowing to 0.75% earlier this month, but the latest official figures showed both the main measures of earnings \u2013 for total pay and for pay excluding bonuses \u2013 fell back. The annual growth rate of total pay dipped from 2.5% to 2.4% while regular pay growth eased from 2.8% to 2.7%, even though the number of unfilled vacancies stood at 829,000 and there was a fall of 86,000 in the number of EU nationals working in Britain. Real pay \u2013 average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation \u2013 edged up 0.1% including bonuses, and rose by 0.4% excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier, the ONS said. In June alone, regular pay was \u00a3488 a week before tax and other deductions, up from \u00a3474 a year earlier. Average total pay, including bonuses, rose to \u00a3518 a week from \u00a3507 a week. The ONS numbers also showed there were 780,000 people on zero-hours contracts in their main job, 104,000 fewer than a year earlier. The sector showing the largest annual fall in the number of people on zero-hours contracts, in which employees are not guaranteed a minimum number of work hours, was in the health and social work sector which recorded a decline of 62,000. Senior ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: \u201cFor the first time since we started tracking zero-hours contracts, we\u2019ve seen a substantial fall in the number of people on one in their main job.\u201d He added: \u201cThe growth in employment is still being driven by UK nationals, with a noticeable drop over the past year in the number of workers from the so-called A8 eastern European countries in particular.\u201d The number of people from those countries \u2013 the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia \u2013 employed in Britain has fallen steadily by nearly 6,000 since the start of this year, the ONS figures show. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cAchieving sustained increases in wage growth remains a key challenge, with sluggish productivity, underemployment and the myriad of high upfront business costs weighing down on pay settlements. As such, there remains precious little sign that wage growth is set to take-off \u2013 undermining a key assumption behind the monetary policy committee\u2019s recent decision to raise rates.\u201d Chris Williamson, chief economist at data firm Markit, said: \u201cThe disappointing pay trend runs counter to expectations at the Bank of England and, alongside signs of the economy losing some momentum again at the start of the third quarter, will add to suspicions that interest rates will not rise again in the immediate future, and most likely not until a smooth route through the Brexit process becomes apparent. Unemployment declined by 65,000 on the quarter to 1.36 million.. The number of people in work increased by 42,000 from the previous quarter to just under 32.4 million - the slowest quarterly growth since the autumn of 2017. Secretary of state for work and pensions Esther McVey said: \u201cWith the unemployment rate falling further to just 4%, and youth unemployment down over 45% since 2010, school leavers this week can look forward to a growing jobs market, improving the prospects for their future careers.\u201d The Resolution Foundation thinktank noted that the three sectors with the fastest pay growth were construction, financial services and insurance, and hotels and restaurants, while real pay fell in a number of other areas including health and social work, utilities, agriculture and the arts.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Homebase has confirmed plans for a wave of store closures that will result in at least 42 DIY outlets shutting by early next year, putting more than 1,500 jobs at risk. On top of the closures, which are fewer than had been feared last week, Homebase is understood to be asking for rent cuts of about 90% on 18 more stores, making it possible they will also close with potentially hundreds more job cuts. Homebase said it would redeploy staff where possible. The retailer wants to cut rents on \u2013 or close \u2013 nearly a fifth of its 241-store chain, via a company voluntary agreement (CVA), a controversial insolvency procedure used by struggling firms to shut underperforming shops. Under the process, Homebase will also promise to continue paying market rents on about half its stores but will ask for smaller rent reductions on another 60 and business rate reductions on all the stores where it wants rent cuts. Damian McGloughlin, chief executive of Homebase, said: \u201cLaunching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. \u201cThe CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.\u201d Restructuring experts at Alvarez &amp; Marsal will carry out the CVA, which will require the support of landlords via a vote on 31 August. At present, all stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as the process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees. The planned restructuring comes on top of a store closure programme kicked off by the former owner Australian owner Wesfarmers in February under which 16 stores have shut. The latest round of Homebase closures have been expected since the sale of the business this year by Wesfarmers to Hilco, a retail turnaround specialist, for \u00a31. Hilco has axed 303 jobs at Homebase\u2019s head office in Milton Keynes and its horticultural buying office in Swindon as it tries to revive the struggling DIY chain, which had 250 stores and 12,000 staff at its peak under Wesfarmers. It currently employs 11,000 people. Wesfarmers bought Homebase for \u00a3340m in 2016 with the aim of importing its Bunnings home improvement brand from Australia to the UK by converting Homebase stores. The strategy ended in disaster as its product mix, focused on heavy tools and large barbecues, was unsuitable for British shoppers who missed the kitchens, bathrooms and soft furnishings Homebase previously sold. Homebase could see some resistance to the CVA from landlords after a string of retailers including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercarehave used the process to cut rents and downsize. The process is designed to stave off administration and save the business, but landlords say it is being misused as a quick way to downsize during tough times on the high street. A group of landlords settled out of court after challenging a CVA process in train at House of Fraser before the department store was bought by Sports Direct via a pre-pack administration. However, Stephanie Pollitt, the assistant director of real estate policy at the landlords\u2019 trade body the British Property Federation said: \u201cHomebase and Alvarez &amp; Marsal have demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners\u2019 interests have been properly taken into account.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone economy has shrugged off growing trade tensions to grow faster than previously estimated in the three months to the end of June, as Germany and the Netherlands beat expectations. GDP growth in the eurozone was revised higher from 0.3% to 0.4% between April and June, matching the rate in the first quarter, said Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical office. GDP was also up 0.4% in the 28 EU countries. The previous reading had sparked concerns over a slowdown in the 19 nations in the eurozone. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy, surprised with 0.5% growth in the second quarter. It has grown for four years in a row, putting it on track for its longest expansion on record. It benefited from stronger demand from households and companies, while exports also rose. Growth in the first quarter was revised up to 0.4% from 0.3%. Germany outpaced the UK, which grew 0.4% in the second quarter, and France, which expanded 0.2%. The Dutch economy was even stronger, growing 0.7% in the second quarter, with trade bouncing back from a weak first quarter. However, the independent economist Ulrik Bie cautioned that German growth could disappoint in coming quarters, hit by mounting global trade tensions and Turkey\u2019s financial crisis. Senior ING economist Bert Colijn noted that eurozone growth had eased from a \u201cspectacular 2017\u201d, with growth in household incomes slowing due to higher inflation and only modest wage growth and weaker confidence, hit by trade concerns. \u201cWith global concerns anything but subsiding, it seems that subdued investment will remain likely in the months ahead. A eurozone economy performing at the current pace of 0.4% for the rest of the year, therefore, seems to be the base case for the moment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Timothy Hochstedler is from the village of Colon, Michigan, which has a small Amish community, and recently started a new business offering horse and buggy rides in his authentic Amish vehicle. So what to name this little venture? Amish Buggy Rides? Tim\u2019s Horse and Wagon? Nope. How about: \u201cAmish Uber\u201d. Genius. Publicity followed \u2013 and lots of it. \u201cUber is a cool thing,\u201d Hochstedler told local news station WMMT. \u201cEvery single year something new comes in and Uber is hot right now, so we have the Amish Uber.\u201d Let\u2019s be clear: this is not Uber. In fact, it\u2019s not even close. Hochstedler doesn\u2019t work for Uber. He charges a flat $5 for a ride. There are no other drivers in his company but him. There\u2019s no app, no GPS and no other technology being used. You can\u2019t even find him on your smartphone. If you want a ride you\u2019re going to have to flag him down on the road and hope he\u2019s available. In other words, this Amish entrepreneur is pretty much doing what many others of his like have been doing for centuries: offering buggy rides to wide-eyed tourists and other fascinated bystanders. Except he\u2019s borrowed Uber\u2019s name. And the customers love it! \u201cFirst time Ubering and we\u2019re riding in a buggy!\u201d one Amish Uber rider said in the WMMT report. \u201cIt was fascinating,\u201d said another. \u201cIt\u2019s not an activity you typically associate with the Amish.\u201d The customers aren\u2019t the only ones gushing about Amish Uber either. The media has been covering the story like Donald Trump himself is driving the buggy. There are stories about Amish Uber everywhere. Regardless of whether the new venture is a prank or not (and it really could be) I still say: good for him. Premeditated or not, Hochstedler has stumbled on a marketing tactic that always has a decent chance of succeeding: just come up with a product or service that\u2019s comparable to another well-known brand, create a similar name (be careful!) and hope people either confuse your product for the real thing or are so amused by your ingenuity that they buy from you anyway. It\u2019s the copycat model and it\u2019s all around us. Take a quick trip to your local grocery store and you\u2019ll see laundry detergent boxes that look very similar to each other and crackers that are like the original, but aren\u2019t. There are ketchup bottles that look like Heinz \u2026 but they\u2019re not. There\u2019s Dr Pepper \u2026 and Dr Publix (and Dr Browns too). There\u2019s Pringles \u2026 and Chipz. There\u2019s Nike \u2026 and, well a bunch of other knock-offs that try to be like Nike. Copycat brands are not a new thing. But are they a sustainable business model? One big downside of all the media attention about Amish Uber is that the attorneys at Uber are sure to have noticed Hochstedler by now and for all we know a cease and desist letter is already in the mail. Then again, it\u2019s possible that Uber has bigger fish to fry and may not want any negative publicity from forcing a sweet Amish guy to shut down his business and therefore may just leave him alone. Regardless of what happens, just remember: this kind of marketing can be effective, but it can also be very risky. I may be enticed to try out a buggy ride with Amish Uber if I\u2019m ever in Colon. But as a long-term business strategy I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m sold that this is the right direction for any entrepreneur.",

    "webTitle": "Mike Ashley says he aims to keep 47 House of Fraser stores open", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley is hoping to keep 47 of 59 House of Fraser stores open, partly by turning over floors of larger shops to Sports Direct or his Flannels chain, it has emerged. The Sports Direct owner, who is in discussions with landlords about new rent deals, said he wanted to retain 80% of House of Fraser\u2019s stores and bring in \u201ccool brands of the moment\u201d. \u201cWe think the biggest and most important thing House of Fraser is missing is luxury brands. We think it will make a big difference,\u201d he told the Sun. Ashley said that in stores such as the one in Birmingham, whole floors could be turned over to Sports Direct under his strategy for the business, which he bought out of administration for \u00a390m on Friday. Sports Direct is already in talks with landlords, via the advisory services company CBRE, about rent agreements that could mean 12 closures \u2013 fewer than the 31 planned by House of Fraser\u2019s previous owners. Among the stores that could be saved is the Oxford Street flagship in London \u2013 if the right rental deal can be agreed. Ashley is running House of Fraser\u2019s stores under licence from the company\u2019s administrator, EY, so he is free to hand back the keys without penalty on any store he does not want. He is likely to have up to a year to arrange the reassignment of each lease and decide on the store\u2019s future. It has also emerged that a group of five landlords were awarded a \u00a31m cash pay out as part of an out of court settlement with House of Fraser\u2019s former owners, relating to a company voluntary arrangement agreed just before the department store fell into administration. However, the landlords were only paid \u00a3100,000 before the company went bust according to Drapers, the fashion industry trade journal. While Ashley, and Sports Direct\u2019s \u201chead of elevation\u201d, Michael Murray, the fiance of his daughter Anna, are expected to cut tough deals with landlords in the coming weeks, suppliers are having a much rougher ride. Sports Direct has written to suppliers \u2013 due to be paid this week and thought to be owed more than \u00a360m \u2013 informing them they will only be paid once the firm comes out of administration. The suppliers had hoped Ashley would honour their debts in the interests of good relations in the future. The \u00a390m paid by Ashley went towards paying House of Fraser\u2019s bondholders and banks, with other creditors not expected to receive more than 3p in the pound from administrators. One supplier told the Guardian: \u201cIt is very, very concerning. Ashley is trading the stores on the back of suppliers\u2019 money. We were hoping he would give us back something.\u201d Pensioners are also likely to lose out under the deal. The House of Fraser pension fund has not been taken on by Ashley and so will be assessed by the industry-funded lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund. It is likely to be sold to a specialist insurance fund, but the higher costs involved in that process mean the House of Fraser fund could be more than \u00a3160m in deficit, so members yet to draw a pension will not get their full benefits.",
