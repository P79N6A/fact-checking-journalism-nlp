      "bodyText": "Last week came the news that the treasurer had decided that not all debt was bad and the May budget papers would differentiate between debt for infrastructure projects and that for recurrent spending. While this is sensible, we need to be wary the new accounting measures are not used to justify cuts to spending on services and welfare payments \u2013 all in the name of reducing \u201cbad debt\u201d. It\u2019s not often the treasurer does something I have been calling for him to do. The shift to differentiate between types of debt in the budget papers is a welcome and sensible move \u2013 if incredibly hypocritical. You don\u2019t need to be too much of a soothsayer to imagine the response from the Liberal party given their continual attacks against debt (of any kind) were an ALP government to have done the same. When the LNP took over power in 2013, net debt was $153bn, and the latest projections have that amount rising to $363bn by 2019-20, so it makes good political sense to redefine some of that amount as \u201cgood\u201d. It is also good budgetary sense, but we should not be too excited about where this change will lead. Mostly it is about giving greater emphasis to a figure that is already in the budget papers. Budget papers are not the easiest reading \u2013 as with most accounting documents, they also involve a fair degree of obfuscation. For example, when we normally talk of the budget deficit, we refer to the \u201cunderlying cash balance\u201d. But the budget papers also include the \u201cheadline cash balance\u201d, the \u201cfiscal balance\u201d and the \u201cnet operating balance\u201d. Each has its reasons for being, but Morrison will now highlight the \u201cnet operating balance\u201d. Normally the figure is found in Statement 3 of Budget Papers Number 1, presumably it\u2019ll make its way in Statement 1. This in itself won\u2019t make much difference \u2013 it\u2019s not a new measure and the two balances move in line with each other. The biggest difference is that because the operating balance excludes capital investment, it is usually smaller \u2013 a good thing if you want to argue that you are getting back to surplus faster. The big change will be how debt is counted. At the moment, it is just one big pile. Morrison appears to be suggesting the budget will divide it into debt used to finance recurrent expenditure and that for financing capital investment \u2013 ie infrastructure. He is hoping that differentiating between the two types will give him a better story to sell to ratings agencies about the stability of the government\u2019s finances, and thus keep our AAA rating. For most Australians, however, the measures won\u2019t have much impact. But we need to careful of getting what we wished for \u2013 that the move is sensible does not mean the impact will necessarily be positive. The best thing about this measure is it reduces one of the budgetary roadblocks to infrastructure spending \u2013 because such spending will now be treated somewhat separately and thus not seen exclusively as adding to the deficit. But we should not fall into the trap of thinking all infrastructure spending is good or worthwhile. We only need to look at the government\u2019s Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which has $5bn worth in concessional loans to give to projects. The decision-making processes of the NAIF have been opaque, and there are suggestions it is considering a loan to the Adani coalmine project and possibly a \u201cclean coal\u201d power plant \u2013 not exactly things you\u2019ll find on Infrastructure Australia\u2019s list of high priorities. The opportunity for regional boondoggles is high \u2013 especially given the National party is a member of the Coalition. After all, just this month Barnaby Joyce dismissed the need for a cost-benefit analysis for shifting government agencies and departments from Canberra to other regional centres. The reason of course is the cost-benefit analysis to move the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to Joyce\u2019s own electorate in Armidale found it would cost $25.6m, produce no real benefits and involve \u201csignificant risks\u201d due to loss of key staff. Just because the government is now happy to concede that spending can actually create jobs and improve productivity, we shouldn\u2019t assume any greater rigour on how that investment money is spent. But a greater issue of concern is that this will do little to shift us from the stupid \u201csurplus good; deficit bad\u201d narrative \u2013 it will just change what we may focus on as being the surplus or deficit. And crucially there is the danger that the badge of \u201cbad\u201d debt will quickly shift to include certain spending. Debt on recurrent spending is \u201cbad\u201d only in the sense that it continues and is not an \u201cinvestment\u201d for which there is an expected return in some form \u2013 either to the budget or the economy. But that does not mean recurrent spending is bad. Spending on health, education, defence, or social security is not bad \u2013 it is vital! And yet under this new labelling, I can see certain spending quickly being given the moniker of \u201cbad\u201d. This is a government that has gone out of its way to demonise welfare spending \u2013 to the point of purposefully misleading people about the total cost of welfare spending and of the incomes of those on welfare compared with people in work. So we should fully expect the government will use this new measure of debt to argue that welfare payments and other recurrent government services lead to \u201cbad debt\u201d and thus need to be cut. The changes to how the budget balance and debt is counted in various tables shouldn\u2019t actually affect Australians, but they certainly will if the government uses the new tables to justify cuts to services and welfare payments \u2013 and we should all be alert to any moves to do so.",

      "bodyText": "The row brewing over the state pension triple lock plays into a wider debate about incomes and wealth in old age and how, as a society, we adapt to the escalating costs of improved life expectancy, increasing care costs and, crucially, property prices. It is becoming clear that the answer for many people is to take the Italian approach. In addition to eating pizza and pasta, they do everything to avoid paying higher taxes and hoard whatever assets they have accumulated. Protecting the family\u2019s finances becomes a priority as the state vanishes from the scene. And a family is no longer the traditional British nuclear family, but one that resembles the Italian extended family, where grandparents and parents feel obliged to provide more than just a good start in life for the youngest members. They must also dig deep to provide financial support, possibly for as long as they are alive. This trend lies behind the Tory promise to raise the inheritance tax threshold for couples to \u00a31m by 2020. It can also be seen when wealthy pensioners argue that the government should maintain the state pension as a universal benefit and even continue paying the winter fuel allowance. House prices play an important role. No one should want house prices to rise at double or treble the rate of earnings growth to reach affordability levels that effectively mean homes in places with decent jobs are out of reach for most people. The latest figures show the UK housing market is currently matching average loan-to-income ratios seen just before the 2008 crash. These are worrying times for financial regulators. Yet there is almost an audible cheer down every British street when a house or flat sells for more than the previous one. Similarly, headlines predicting a downturn can spark panic. That\u2019s the case in the suburbs of Burnley as much as in Guildford\u2019s more well-to-do avenues. Property is something to hang on to and maximise. Pay as little stamp duty or capital gains tax as you can. Make sure the proceeds are recycled to provide a leg-up for your own offspring. Even those who hate the tyranny of rising house prices feel unable to play by an older set of socialistic rules when it feels like everyone else is looking after number one. It is against this backdrop, one where baby boomers, whatever their background and income level, are hoarding their money and assets as best they can, that the debate over the triple lock plays out. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, first hinted at the need to ditch many of the tax and benefit promises made by the Tories before the 2015 election in the autumn statement last year. It was Hammond who was first to say the triple lock on pensions \u2013 which links the basic state pension to whichever is the higher of earnings growth, inflation or 2.5% \u2013 needs to be rethought. Since then, Theresa May has dodged questions about the triple lock, revealing her sympathy for a review. Hammond and May can see that the economy is weakening, following a squeeze on disposable incomes from higher inflation and stagnant wages growth. The knock-on effect to lower tax receipts is going to put pressure on the government\u2019s finances and the chancellor will need to raise money to keep his deficit reduction plan on track. On the surface, scrapping the third element of the triple lock, the guarantee of a 2.5% annual rise in the state pension, merely fits into this broad tax and benefit grab by the Treasury. The message is that pensioners must join the rest of society as austerity bites. Labour, which has promised to maintain the triple lock, and pensioner groups argue that those on the lowest incomes will be the worst affected. That\u2019s true, especially when the government\u2019s cuts in the real value of the state second pension, and the move to a flat-rate pension, are taken into account. However, campaigning for a universal benefit also feathers the nests of the better off. And why should today\u2019s workers make sure pensions increase at a faster rate than their own pay, especially when it leads to greater income inequality among the old? And yes, income inequality is growing among the country\u2019s 12 million pensioners. A spokesman for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Paris-based thinktank, said last week that the answer for Britain was to means-test the basic pension. An alternative would be to design an income tax system specifically for the country\u2019s 12 million pensioners; one that increases the tax burden for the third who have more than enough money to enjoy their retirement. Or, at least, charge the 1.1 million retirees who are still working national insurance. Unfortunately, all these proposals meet with the same cry from the boomers. \u201cWe must save to pay for our own care and support our children.\u201d So it\u2019s impossible to shift the dial in favour of all the young while the state refuses to look after the elderly in care, and build enough homes for those on low and middle incomes to bring down prices. Only then will wealthy boomers stop taking more out than they put in and hoarding it.",

The knock-on effect to lower tax receipts is going to put pressure on the government\u2019s finances and the chancellor will need to raise money to keep his deficit reduction plan on track.</p> <p>On the surface, scrapping the third element of the triple lock, the guarantee of a 2.5% annual rise in the state pension, merely fits into this broad tax and benefit grab by the Treasury.</p> <p>The message is that pensioners must join the rest of society as austerity&#xa0;bites.</p> <p>Labour, which has promised to maintain the triple lock, and pensioner groups argue that those on the lowest incomes will be the worst affected.</p> <p>That\u2019s true, especially when the government\u2019s cuts in the real value of the state second pension, and the move to a flat-rate pension, are taken into account.</p> <p>However, campaigning for a universal benefit also feathers the nests of the better off. And why should today\u2019s workers make sure pensions increase at a faster rate than their own pay, especially when it leads to greater income inequality among the old? And yes, income inequality is growing among the country\u2019s 12 million pensioners.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Paris-based thinktank, said last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/uk-state-pension-rich-oecd\" title=\"\">the answer for Britain was to means-test the basic pension</a>.</p> <p>An alternative would be to design an income tax system specifically for the country\u2019s 12 million pensioners; one that increases the tax burden for the third who have more than enough money to enjoy their retirement. Or, at least, charge the 1.1 million retirees who are still working national insurance.</p> <p>Unfortunately, all these proposals meet with the same cry from the boomers. \u201cWe must save to pay for our own care and support our children.\u201d So it\u2019s impossible to shift the dial in favour of all the young while the state refuses to look after the elderly in care, and build enough homes for those on low and middle incomes to bring down prices. Only then will wealthy boomers stop taking more out than they put in and hoarding it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Elections have long been won and lost on the state of the economy. So Theresa May\u2019s decision to call a snap poll just as UK growth appears to be slowing has raised eyebrows. But with the Brexit vote predicted to put more pressure on households as the year goes on, the prime minister may well believe this is as good as it gets for economic news. With less than six weeks to go to the election, a look at the economic backdrop reveals there is both good news and bad for the government. Good news Business activity continues to rise Defying the doomsayers, the predicted post-referendum slump in business activity simply has not happened. Companies are still spending and hiring. Employment is at a record high. Surveys suggest some companies are enjoying a boost from the weak pound as it makes their goods and services more competitive in overseas markets. Meanwhile, the global economy has shown signs of improvement, again helping exporters. But the flipside to the weak pound is higher import costs for businesses, leading food companies and others to complain of pressure on margins and to raise their prices. There are also fears that those reliant on consumer spending will suffer as higher living costs erode Britons\u2019 spending power. The deficit is coming down Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged to bring down borrowing and managed to deliver some good news on the deficit last week. Borrowing for the tax year ended in March was \u00a352bn, roughly in line with the \u00a351.7bn predicted by the government\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. That was a 28% drop from the previous year and the lowest gap since the eve of the financial crisis, helped by strong tax receipts as the economy continued to grow in the months following the Brexit vote. But details of the most recent public finance figures suggest the government faces tough challenges to bring down the deficit further. March figures pointed to a slowdown in receipts from income tax and from VAT as retail sales were hit by higher prices in the shops. Stock markets are near record highs The pound\u2019s heavy losses have been the stock market\u2019s big gain since the Brexit vote. When sterling weakens, it helps the many companies in the FTSE 100 index that report in dollars and those that export from the UK. So while the pound is down around 13% against the dollar since the referendum, the FTSE 100 is up around 14% over the same period. Optimism about Donald Trump\u2019s planned tax reforms and spending spree has also lifted stock markets around the globe, providing a further fillip to the FTSE 100, which set new record highs in March. That provides some feelgood soundbites for campaigning Conservatives. But ultimately, a share index populated by big international mining companies, pharmaceutical giants and banks tells you little about the UK economy. House prices are steady Among the dramatic predictions made for the UK ahead of last year\u2019s referendum, the International Monetary Fund warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a property market crash. In the event, house prices have been steady and are still rising in year-on-year terms. Recently, though, signs have emerged that the market is losing momentum. Nationwide\u2019s closely watched barometer of the market showed the average price of a home fell by 0.4% in April to \u00a3207,699, following a 0.3% drop in March. The annual rate of house price growth slowed to 2.6%, the weakest since June 2013. But that cooling-off is by no means bad news in a market where first-time property buyers have long felt shut out by high prices. Bad news The economy has slowed Economic growth beat expectations following the Brexit vote and the UK finished 2016 as one of the fastest growing advanced economies. However, growth has slowed sharply in the opening months of this year amid signs that rising inflation is hitting consumer spending, a key driver of the British economy. GDP expanded just 0.3% in the opening three months of 2017, down from growth of 0.7% the previous quarter. It was the weakest performance for a year and missed economists\u2019 forecasts for a more modest slowdown. Inflation is at its highest for three years and rising The pound\u2019s drop makes imports to the UK more expensive and that effect has combined with higher crude oil prices to push inflation to 2.3%. That is above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target and the highest since the autumn of 2013. After more than two years of falls, food prices are now rising again and consumers are starting to notice the increase in their day-to-day living costs. As a result, consumer confidence deteriorated in April, with households becoming more gloomy about the outlook for their personal finances as well as the wider economy, according to polls. Pay is falling in real terms Inflation is rising but pay growth appears to be heading in the other direction, with employers unwilling or unable to award big rises. That cocktail is bad news for household finances because it leaves workers worse off in real terms. On the latest official figures, pay fell in real terms in February, marking the first drop in living standards in two and a half years. Regular pay was 1.9% higher than a year earlier while inflation was 2.3%. Looking ahead, economists expect inflation to rise further this year while wage growth remains weak. That bodes ill for an economy so reliant on consumer spending. Consumers are borrowing more One of the puzzles for policymakers last year was the resilience of consumer spending in the face of rising inflation. Bank of England governor Mark Carney noted that households appeared to be \u201centirely looking through Brexit-related uncertainties\u201d but he suggested they were going on a borrowing binge in order to keep up spending levels. Since his words of warning, there has been more evidence that Britons are indeed increasingly turning to credit cards and personal loans. They are also in a more precarious position when it comes to saving for tougher times ahead. The saving ratio \u2013 which estimates the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income \u2013 hit a record low at the end of last year.",

    "webTitle": "Martin Sorrell and the sunset of the superstar chief executives", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For more than three decades, Sir Martin Sorrell has run WPP \u2013 the world-leading advertising group he built from scratch out of a small maker of wire baskets \u2013 with an iron grip. Since jacking in his job as finance chief at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to start his own business at the very un-dotcom age of 40, Sorrell has built Wire &amp; Plastic Products \u2013 the shell company he used as his vehicle for global domination, and which still makes metalware to this day \u2013 into a business with a stock market valuation of \u00a322bn. Investors have been rewarded handsomely: \u00a31,000 invested at WPP\u2019s inception in 1985 would be worth \u00a363,000 today. Sorrell has been rewarded too. Two years ago he took home more than \u00a370m, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, and over the last five years has pocketed \u00a3210m. For years, investors were placated by WPP\u2019s relentless growth, and questions about the control exerted by its founder were put to one side. \u201cLike Domino\u2019s, WPP continues to deliver,\u201d said the company\u2019s former chairman Philip Lader once, using fast food as an attempt to justify Sorrell\u2019s proprietorial management style and ballooning pay. The chief executive\u2019s big paydays have been seen as symptomatic of what critics call \u201cSorrellcentricity\u201d at WPP \u2013 the view that Sorrell is autocratic and dominates decision-making \u2013 which in turn has led investors to increasingly challenge the governance of the company. \u201cSir Martin identifies very closely with WPP as his personal creation,\u201d says Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory service Manifest. \u201cThe cult of the superstar chief executive does not create a healthy corporate culture. They\u2019re increasingly the only person we associate with the organisation, its successes or failures. And, in fact, with any of its business decisions at all.\u201d A change in attitude to corporate pay from the public and investors \u2013 and more recently Theresa May\u2019s warning that she would curb boardroom excess \u2013 has started to loosen Sorrell\u2019s once unquestioned control. A series of investor rebellions against his pay (the biggest being in 2012, during the \u201cshareholder spring\u201d, when 60% of investors rejected his annual pay package) has forced WPP\u2019s board to cut his remuneration dramatically. Last week, WPP revealed Sorrell was paid \u00a348m in 2016, the last year of the controversial \u201cLeap\u201d incentive scheme it has been forced to scrap. A new policy capping his annual pay at about \u00a319m had already been agreed. But continued unrest among shareholders led the company to announce it would reduce pay further to a maximum of just over \u00a313m. This would put him much more in line with his peers. John Wren, the long-serving chief executive of the world\u2019s second-biggest ad group, Omnicom, was paid $26m last year. Michael Roth, chief executive of rival IPG, was paid $18m. However, the \u00a313m cap won\u2019t come in until 2021, when Sorrell is 76. This raises the spectre of what WPP has called the \u201csuccession elephant\u201d, which has now superseded pay as the No 1 issue facing the company and its founder. \u201cDiscussions with WPP have been partly about pay, the quantum, and also very much about succession,\u201d says one major investor in WPP who does not wish to be named. \u201cPartly the reason Sorrell\u2019s pay has been so large is that the company has done very well. But he also got away with negotiating [big] pay packages because of the whole [unanswered] issue of succession.\u201d Roberto Quarta, who is a year into his job as WPP\u2019s new chairman, said last week that succession planning had become \u201ceven more focused and detailed over the last year\u201d. He explained there was an \u201cexceptional team of potential candidates\u201d from WPP\u2019s top management, as well as a \u201cconstantly refined list of external candidates\u201d. Claire Enders, of research firm Enders Analysis, said the perception of Sorrell\u2019s domination is a fallacy. \u201cMartin has a thousand great people across the world in the first tier,\u201d she says. \u201cYear in, year out, [the company] makes WPP a systemic large-scale success rather than the daily product of one man spinning.\u201d At 72, even with a new baby to deal with, Sorrell\u2019s health and indefatigable work ethic seem to make the issue of age irrelevant. Indeed, gerontocracies are common in medialand: Rupert Murdoch is 86, Barry Diller is 75, as is Sorrell\u2019s erstwhile adversary Maurice L\u00e9vy, who this summer will step down as chief executive of Publicis, the world\u2019s third-largest advertising company. IPG\u2019s Roth is 71, while Omnicom\u2019s Wren is the sprightliest of the bunch, at 65. Nevertheless, a new generation is on the horizon: L\u00e9vy\u2019s successor, Arthur Sadoun, is just 46, for example. One quirk of Sorrell\u2019s relationship with WPP is in his contract. Instead of the standard notice period of 12 months, it says he can terminate his service \u2013 or that the company can \u2013 \u201cat will\u201d. Sorrell may only own a few per cent of the company he founded \u2013 his stake and that of his family trust is currently worth \u00a3427m \u2013 but the idea of retirement couldn\u2019t be further from his mind. \u201cOnly when they shoot me,\u201d he has said.",

      "body": "<p>For more than three decades, Sir&#xa0;Martin Sorrell has run WPP \u2013 the world-leading advertising group he built from scratch out of a small maker of wire baskets \u2013 with an iron grip. Since jacking in his job as finance chief at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to start his own business at the very un-dotcom age of 40, Sorrell has built Wire &amp; Plastic Products \u2013 the shell company he used as his vehicle for global domination, and which still makes metalware to this day \u2013 into a business with a stock market valuation of \u00a322bn.</p> <p>Investors have been rewarded handsomely: \u00a31,000 invested at WPP\u2019s inception in 1985 would be worth \u00a363,000 today. Sorrell has been rewarded too. Two years ago he took home more than \u00a370m, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, and over the last five years has pocketed \u00a3210m.</p> <p>For years, investors were placated by WPP\u2019s relentless growth, and questions about the control exerted by its founder were put to one side. \u201cLike Domino\u2019s, WPP continues to deliver,\u201d said the company\u2019s former chairman Philip Lader once, using fast food as an attempt to justify Sorrell\u2019s proprietorial management style and ballooning pay.</p> <p>The chief executive\u2019s big paydays have been seen as symptomatic of what critics call \u201cSorrellcentricity\u201d at WPP \u2013 the view that Sorrell is autocratic and dominates decision-making \u2013 which in turn has led investors to increasingly challenge the governance of the company.</p> <p>\u201cSir Martin identifies very closely with WPP as his personal creation,\u201d says Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory service Manifest. \u201cThe cult of the superstar chief executive does not create a healthy corporate culture. They\u2019re increasingly the only person we associate with the organisation, its successes or failures. And, in fact, with any of its business decisions at all.\u201d</p> <p>A change in attitude to corporate pay from the public and investors \u2013 and more recently Theresa May\u2019s warning that she would curb boardroom excess \u2013 has started to loosen Sorrell\u2019s once unquestioned control. A series of investor rebellions against his pay (the biggest being in 2012, during the \u201cshareholder spring\u201d, when 60% of investors rejected his annual pay package) has forced WPP\u2019s board to cut his remuneration dramatically.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/28/sir-martin-sorrell-pay-uk-wpp\" title=\"\">WPP revealed Sorrell was paid \u00a348m in 2016</a>, the last year of the controversial \u201cLeap\u201d incentive scheme it has been forced to scrap. A new policy capping his annual pay at about \u00a319m had already been agreed. But continued unrest among shareholders led the company to announce it would reduce pay further to a maximum of just over \u00a313m.</p> <p>This would put him much more in line with his peers. John Wren, the long-serving chief executive of the world\u2019s second-biggest ad group, Omnicom, was paid $26m last year. Michael Roth, chief executive of rival IPG, was paid $18m.</p> <p>However, the \u00a313m cap won\u2019t come in until 2021, when Sorrell is 76. This raises the spectre of what WPP has called the \u201csuccession elephant\u201d, which has now superseded pay as the No 1 issue facing the company and its founder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6ae0bea8bd99a9caa084b37bd6a91ffc50b3032\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ae0bea8bd99a9caa084b37bd6a91ffc50b3032/0_4_2954_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maurice L\u00e9vy of Publicis, left, and John Wren of Omnicom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maurice L\u00e9vy of Publicis, left, and John Wren of Omnicom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Langlois/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDiscussions with WPP have been partly about pay, the quantum, and also very much about succession,\u201d says one major investor in WPP who does not wish to be named. \u201cPartly the reason Sorrell\u2019s pay has been so large is that the company has done very well. But he also got away with negotiating [big] pay packages because of the whole [unanswered] issue of succession.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/17/wpp-appoints-roberto-quarta-to-succeed-chairman-philip-lader\" title=\"\">Roberto Quarta</a>, who is a year into his job as WPP\u2019s new chairman, said last week that succession planning had become \u201ceven more focused and detailed over the last year\u201d. He explained there was an \u201cexceptional team of potential candidates\u201d from WPP\u2019s top management, as well as a \u201cconstantly refined list of external candidates\u201d.</p> <p>Claire Enders, of research firm Enders Analysis, said the perception of Sorrell\u2019s domination is a fallacy. \u201cMartin has a thousand great people across the world in the first tier,\u201d she says. \u201cYear in, year out, [the company] makes WPP a systemic large-scale success rather than the daily product of one man spinning.\u201d</p> <p>At 72, even with a new baby to deal with, Sorrell\u2019s health and indefatigable work ethic seem to make the issue of age irrelevant. Indeed, gerontocracies are common in medialand: Rupert Murdoch is 86, Barry Diller is 75, as is Sorrell\u2019s erstwhile adversary Maurice L\u00e9vy, who this summer will step down as chief executive of Publicis, the world\u2019s third-largest advertising company. IPG\u2019s Roth is 71, while Omnicom\u2019s Wren is the sprightliest of the bunch, at 65.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a new generation is on the horizon: L\u00e9vy\u2019s successor, Arthur Sadoun, is just 46, for example.</p> <p>One quirk of Sorrell\u2019s relationship with WPP is in his contract. Instead of the standard notice period of 12 months, it says he can terminate his service \u2013 or that the company can \u2013 \u201cat will\u201d.</p> <p>Sorrell may only own a few per cent of the company he founded \u2013 his stake and that of his family trust is currently worth \u00a3427m \u2013 but the idea of retirement couldn\u2019t be further from his mind. \u201cOnly when they shoot me,\u201d he has said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lunchtime customers at Whole Foods in Manhattan\u2019s Union Square had little trouble expressing the shortcomings that have led the once high-flying, organic-focused retailer to become linked with a takeover. \u201cI love the sushi, but I wouldn\u2019t shop here except maybe for a special ingredient,\u201d said Argentinian software designer Benjamin Vinas. \u201cPeople say Whole Foods is for pretentious people, and I can see why. It\u2019s too expensive. I don\u2019t have the budget.\u201d Vinas was not the only customer to express a similar point of view. Others said that for their groceries they went several blocks north and west to lower-cost rival Trader Joe\u2019s, where products may not be so exquisitely selected but are, in general, more uniformly discounted. Maria Johnson, a postgraduate student, said Whole Foods\u2019 pricing, with some items marked competitively and other expensive, was inconvenient. \u201cI only buy body lotion and lunch here. And maybe spices,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere are so many different price points you feel like you are missing out on the more fun, expensive things \u2013 and when you are shopping for the cheaper, more affordable things, you\u2019re reminded of the things you can\u2019t afford.\u201d But the views of Manhattan\u2019s grocery shoppers point to only part of the problem for Whole Foods, sometimes called Whole Paycheck, which has been facing a backlash from consumers. Founded in Austin, Texas, in 1980, Whole Foods Market, to give it its official name, has about 462 locations and a market value of almost $12bn. The chain helped make health food and organic food mainstream, and in its boom years shook up the food retail industry. Whole Foods had grand plans for a UK expansion too, opening its first outpost in Kensington in 2004 with plans for 40 more. But Whole Foods has stalled: like much of the retail sector, it faces economic headwinds including razor-thin margins, competition from other retailers offering organic food, and increasingly price-conscious consumers. In February, the company announced it would close nine stores: in Chicago, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, and Georgia, and two each in Colorado and California. The closures, which followed six straight quarters of sales declines, represented the first downsizing since 2008. Founder and chief executive John Mackey explained that the business had changed because \u201cthe more conventional, mainstream supermarkets have upped their game. The world is very different today than it was five years ago.\u201d One rival chain, Sprouts Farmers Market, was found to be on average 19% cheaper than Whole Foods. Other rivals, including Kroger, picked up Whole Foods customers. Last month, Barclays advised that Whole Foods had experienced a \u201cstaggering\u201d decline in foot traffic that it estimated at 3%, or roughly 14 million customers. Whole Foods has long been the butt of jokes for its prices \u2013 although it disputes it is more expensive than it rivals \u2013 and its bougie products. Comedian John Oliver is particularly fond of its asparagus water. The difficult transition from expensive behemoth to a more nimble grocery store is reflected in its share price, which has dropped by almost half since October 2013. Investors are increasingly petitioning the company to move faster with reforms. An acquisition would underscore the consolidation of the US food retail industry as the sector prepares to compete against online retailers including Amazon, stores like Walmart and discount chains such as Aldi. Earlier this week, the Financial Times reported that Cerberus Capital Management, the New York private equity firm that owns Albertsons and Safeway, had initiated talks with bankers about making a bid. Other potential suitors include Jana Partners, an activist investor group that has amassed a 9% stake. In a regulatory filing, Jana said it wanted Whole Foods to \u201cimprove its technology and operations to better compete with larger rivals, shake up its board, and explore how much potential bidders might be willing to pay\u201d. Jana has proposed nominees to the Whole Foods board, including Glenn Murphy, a former Gap chief executive, and former New York Times food journalist Mark Bittman, who has argued that the chain needs simplifying. Jana is run by 58-year-old yoga and health food devotee Barry Rosenstein. He has said he wants Whole Foods to learn from national chains while staying true to its mission. Whole Foods\u2019 own efforts at reform include the expansion of 365 smaller stores offering lower-priced products. The stores will stock about 7,000 items, far fewer than the 35,000 to 52,000 at a typical Whole Foods location. Outside Trader Joe\u2019s, Brooklyn homemaker Eva Lev said she rarely visits Whole Foods nowadays. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Jim Gaffigan joke \u2013 Whole Foods on Sunday is just a refugee camp for people with too much money.\u201d Lev added she prefers Trader Joe\u2019s \u201cbecause it seems like an everyman\u2019s place, and you can still get organic\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "From Standard Oil at the turn of the 20th century to IBM and General Motors in the 1970s and General Electric in the 1990s, the US has always produced behemoth corporations that bestride the world. But this is the era of the Fangs, the \u201cbig four\u201d of technology, and they are currently growing at breakneck speed. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google have been roaring away since the turn of this year. Their share prices have climbed so far, so fast, that together they are now worth an extraordinary $250bn more than just four months ago. To put that sum into perspective, compare it to the value of all the gold mined in the world in a year , which is worth about $115bn. Or look at it another way - $250bn is about the same as the annual GDP of countries such as Venezuela, Pakistan and Ireland. Together the four firms are now valued on Wall Street at more than $1.5tn, about the same as the Russian economy. The Fang acronym is not new - it was first coined four years ago by US finance expert and broadcaster Jim Cramer \u2013 but the rocket behind their share prices is now making it mainstream. In fact, it is now slightly out of date, because Google rebranded itself as Alphabet last year, so it should technically be \u201cFana\u201d. There is, however, one thing no one can argue with. Their share prices, boosted further by positive financial results this week, have delivered huge multibillion-dollar boosts to the personal fortunes of their founders, all of whom still run the companies they dreamed up. Amazon, which beat forecasts with first-quarter sales of $36bn, has increased in value by $80bn since the start of 2017 to $440bn, meaning the near-17% stake held by Jeff Bezos is now worth $13.5bn more than it was in January. His total wealth now stands at $74bn. Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, is now on the brink of toppling the legendary investor Warren Buffett to become the world\u2019s second-richest person after Bill Gates. Both men are spending their money fast, Gates on fighting malaria and other treatable diseases in the developing world, and Bezos on building his own spaceflight company, Blue Origin, with the aim of beating the Tesla boss Elon Musk to Mars. Facebook, which reports ist results next week, has grown in value by $92bn to $424bn this year. Its founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s fortune has increased alongside the share price by $13bn to around $60bn. He owns only about 14% of the quoted shares, but under an unusual voting structure he controls more than 50% of the company. Alphabet is the gorilla in this room of big beasts. It is now valued at $610bn, up $68bn since the end of December. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, each own around 7% each. Their combined stake is worth about $85bn, up $8.5bn since the start of year. The relative minnow is Netflix, which has climbed in value by $12.5bn since January to $66bn, or three times the value of Sky TV. Reed Hastings, its co-founder and current chief executive, has seen his 1.43% shareholding rise in value by $180m to $944m. Thomas Husson at the tech research group Forrestersays Netflix has far to go. \u201cNot only have they reached 100m subscribers, they have managed to create a digital relationship with their customers. They know their preferences and are good at acting on the insights they collect on their customers. They are growing fast and are very disruptive.\u201d What lies behind the astronomical increase in value of the Fangs? To a certain extent, they\u2019ve been buoyed by the same tide that raised US shares to record highs this year, the election of Donald Trump. The new president may threaten trade wars and real wars, and prompt unheard-of levels of domestic unrest, but to Wall Street investors, all that pales in comparison to a couple of policy proposals that have been on the cards since the day he won the Republican nomination - lower corporation taxes and a tax holiday on repatriated cash. The US has one of the highest levels of corporation tax in the world, up to 35% with some states charging more on top. For internationally competitive companies, that creates a strong motivation to not bring income earned overseas back to the US. The Fangs have huge international earnings. One proposed solution, favoured by the Republican party for decades and periodically enacted, is a repatriation tax holiday - a fixed period during which money brought onshore is taxed less. The last holiday in 2004 led to $362bn being brought back to the US at a reduced tax rate of 5.25%. Paradoxically, each tax holiday increases the need for the next, because companies start holding ever greater amounts of their tax offshore in the expectation that the next Republican government will announce a new one. In the expectation of just that, which would allow a flood of onshored income to boost dividend payouts and share buybacks, investors have been buying up stocks in companies with foreign holdings. But the Fangs also have their own unique benefits. In a tech industry with a globalised supply chain fighting anti-globalisation movements, where businesses are finding it tough to provide big improvements on devices from laptops to smartphones, and where the next big thing keeps failing to take off they sell nothing but binary code sent over the net. All four are subtly different, but firmly overlapping industries. Facebook and Google are primarily advertising companies. One sells things to you while you\u2019re looking for information, the other while you\u2019re chatting to friends. They\u2019re also both in the business of user-generated content, encouraging their customers to upload fun, shareable videos to YouTube and Facebook so they have something to put advertising against \u2013 and keep you coming back for more. In the content industry, the two also compete against Netflix and Amazon, which both produce web video far more directly, with millions invested in the creation of high-quality long-form drama and comedy. Amazon competes against Google in the shopping business, because more and more of us skip the middleman when we want to buy something. And then there are the enormously profitable back-ends. Amazon Web Services makes more profit selling cloud computing services to other companies than it does selling things to you or me, and Google Cloud makes almost as much money doing the same thing to its own startups. None of Fangs have reached the astronomical levels of profitability seen at Apple, which has mastered the art of building expensive technology and selling it for eye-watering levels of profit. Apple, however, also has a weakness. When it comes to its revenue, it has only one really huge product: the iPhone. The Fangs, by contrast, are diversified. They can sell their stuff wherever there is internet access, they don\u2019t have to worry about pesky supply chain issues and they\u2019re aiming for the top of the pile.",

      "body": "<p>From Standard Oil at the turn of the 20th century to IBM and General Motors in the 1970s and General Electric in the 1990s, the US has always produced behemoth corporations that bestride the world. But this is the era of the Fangs, the \u201cbig four\u201d of technology, and they are currently growing at breakneck speed.</p> <p>Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google have been roaring away since the turn of this year. Their share prices have climbed so far, so fast, that together they are now worth an extraordinary $250bn more than just four months ago.</p> <p>To put that sum into perspective, compare it to the value of all the gold mined in the world in a year , which is worth about $115bn. Or look at it another way - $250bn is about the same as the annual GDP of countries such as Venezuela, Pakistan and Ireland.</p> <p>Together the four firms are now valued on Wall Street at more than $1.5tn, about the same as the Russian economy.</p> <p>The Fang acronym is not new - it was first coined four years ago by US finance expert and broadcaster Jim Cramer \u2013 but the rocket behind their share prices is now making it mainstream. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"575440f4f833ff9b49696af094e60700e5b1111c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/575440f4f833ff9b49696af094e60700e5b1111c/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos inside a Blue Origin \u2018rocket\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Space race: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos inside a Blue Origin \u2018rocket\u2019.

There is, however, one thing no one can argue with. Their share prices, boosted further by positive financial results this week, have delivered huge multibillion-dollar boosts to the personal fortunes of their founders, all of whom still run the companies they dreamed up.</p> <p>Amazon, which beat forecasts with first-quarter sales of $36bn, has increased in value by $80bn since the start of 2017 to $440bn, meaning the near-17% stake held by Jeff Bezos is now worth $13.5bn more than it was in January. His total wealth now stands at $74bn.<br></p> <p>Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, is now on the brink of toppling the legendary investor Warren Buffett to become the world\u2019s second-richest person after Bill Gates. Both men are spending their money fast, Gates on fighting malaria and other treatable diseases in the developing world, and Bezos on building his own spaceflight company, Blue Origin, with the aim of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/09/blue-orgins-new-glenn-rocket/\">beating the Tesla boss Elon Musk to Mars</a>.</p> <p>Facebook, which reports ist results next week, has grown in value by $92bn to $424bn this year. Its founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s fortune has increased alongside the share price by $13bn to around $60bn. He owns only about 14% of the quoted shares, but under an unusual voting structure he controls more than 50% of the company.</p> <p>Alphabet is the gorilla in this room of big beasts. It is now valued at $610bn, up $68bn since the end of December. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, each own around 7% each. Their combined stake is worth about $85bn, up $8.5bn since the start of year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed9a6eea656cd606a0c9dfdd6b909aeb408153a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed9a6eea656cd606a0c9dfdd6b909aeb408153a5/0_248_2862_1717/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix app logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Netflix is seen as the smallest of the Fangs, but is growing fast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Goodman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The relative minnow is Netflix, which has climbed in value by $12.5bn since January to $66bn, or three times the value of Sky TV.

They are growing fast and are very disruptive.\u201d</p> <p>What lies behind the astronomical increase in value of the Fangs? To a certain extent, they\u2019ve been buoyed by the same tide that raised US shares to record highs this year, the election of Donald Trump. The new president may threaten trade wars and real wars, and prompt unheard-of levels of domestic unrest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/25/stock-markets-us-tech-donald-trump-tax-reform-emmanuel-macron-french-election\">but to Wall Street investors, all that pales in comparison to a couple of policy proposals that have been on the cards since the day he won the Republican nomination</a> - lower corporation taxes and a tax holiday on repatriated cash.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/26/trump-tax-proposal-corporate-tax-rate-15-percent\">The US has one of the highest levels of corporation tax in the world, up to 35% with some states charging more on top. </a>For internationally competitive companies, that creates a strong motivation to not bring income earned overseas back to the US.

      "bodyText": "Inside a cluster of unremarkable industrial units off the A40 in west London is the epicentre of the 2017 hummus crisis. The buildings belong to Bakkavor, the international food manufacturer behind the mass withdrawal of the product from British supermarket shelves after customers complained of a metallic taste. These units off the Hanger Lane gyratory system \u2013 among 30 facilities on 19 different UK sites \u2013 manufacture hummus and other dips on an industrial scale for supermarket giants including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose, the Co-op, Asda and Morrisons, who sell them under their own brands. The little-known Bakkavor \u2013 set up 30 years ago in Iceland by brothers \u00c1g\u00fast and L\u00fddur Gudmundsson \u2013 is the UK\u2019s leading provider of fresh prepared foods. Hummus is made on the Hanger Lane site, in a sectioned-off production area in the equivalent of the savoury dip nerve centre. The problem began after a batch of the product, made with imported chick peas, was found to have an uncharacteristic metallic tang. It had already been despatched in tubs, prompting Bakkavor to write to all its supermarket clients to warn of a problem with the manufacturing process. Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury\u2019s both cleared some lines from their shelves after what Sainsbury\u2019s described as \u201ctaste issues\u201d. Bakkavor admitted there was a strange taste, but stressed there was no food safety issue. A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeking confirmation that this withdrawal was done on quality rather than safety grounds, and the information we\u2019ve received so far shows there is no indication of a food safety concern. The FSA hadn\u2019t been notified about this withdrawal, but food businesses only need to make us aware of withdrawals if they are for food safety reasons.\u201d It has not been made clear what caused the metallic taste but in foods and beer it can be caused by chemical reactions affecting lipids (fats and oils). This would usually be the result of a combination of two types of reaction \u2013 hydrolysis and oxidisation \u2013 according to the book Advances in Meat, Poultry and Seafood Packaging, published by Woodhead Publishing. But the Scandinavian supermarket Sevan, which has also removed hummus from its shelves in recent weeks due to a mystery taste, put forward a different theory. The chain told Food Quality News it believed the unusual flavour came from chickpeas imported from Canada. Whatever the reason for the metallic tang, the UK shortages have had a knock-on effect for other retailers, as disappointed shoppers flocked to buy up their stock. Stocks have since been replenished and supermarkets say it is business as usual on the hummus front. But the sudden shortage has led to scrutiny of the the low-key and inevitably secretive world of mass food production, which takes place daily in similar buildings across the UK. Supermarkets routinely use the same suppliers to make similar products, although recipes are kept secret and all equipment is deep-cleaned between each rival production run. Derbyshire-based Matthew Walker, for example, turns out 26m Christmas puddings a year for all the major supermarkets and brands \u2013 from German discounters such as Lidl and Aldi through to Harrods and Waitrose. Similarly Mr Kipling \u2013 part of the Premier Foods group \u2013 makes mince pies and other cakes not only for its own-brand label but also for the UK\u2019s major supermarkets and retailers. Talk of a crisis emerged amid Britons\u2019 apparently insatiable appetite for hummus. A survey in 2013 marked Britain as the hummus capital of Europe, with 41% of people having pots in the fridge \u2013 almost twice as many as in any other country. A far-sighted Waitrose was the first British supermarket to stock hummus in the 1980s, with others following in the next decade. Chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi, Claudia Roden and the Lebanese chef and author Anissa Helou have done much to popularise Middle Eastern foods in recent years, with shoppers now viewing hummus as a grocery staple. Fast-expanding supermarket ranges now include everything from reduced fat pastes to new-style versions made with beetroot or edamame beans. \u201cIt\u2019s good that hummus has become so popular in the UK, although in the Middle East it\u2019s not a dip eaten from a tub but a meal \u2013 and people often don\u2019t know how a really good one tastes,\u201d Ottolenghi told the Guardian. \u201cYou can now buy hummus at various levels and you can also make it yourself, which is what I recommend.\u201d Nick Saltmarsh, founder of Hodmedod, which works closely with British farmers to produce homegrown grains and pulses, including fava beans, haricot beans and quinoa, said the situation \u201chighlights, very sadly, the obscurity of our food system in the UK \u2013 so many people don\u2019t know where our food comes from, never mind what\u2019s in it and how it\u2019s made\u201d. Saltmarsh\u2019s Suffolk-based company is currently working with the condiment firm Charlie &amp; Ivy\u2019s to launch a new fava bean hummus (using UK rapeseed rather than olive oil) at a food festival at the end of May. His UK-grown products have the backing of top chefs such as Ottolenghi, Mark Hix and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. \u201cHummus is one of our most popular dips,\u201d says Joanna Black, hummus buyer at M&amp;S. \u201cAs the trend for eastern Mediterranean-style foods and eating has grown, so has the demand for hummus. It\u2019s no longer seen as an exotic food, but a more everyday item that customers are very familiar with.\u201d But if there is one lesson from the shortlived hummus furore, it is to diversify your supply chain. Pret a Manger \u2013 now enjoying massive sales of hummus as a result of its new vegetarian and vegan menus \u2013 uses a different supplier and was completely unaffected. This article was amended on 29 and 30 April 2017 to remove incorrect information about tahini and clarify a reference to lipids, both of which were added in error during the editing process.",

Fast-expanding supermarket ranges now include everything from reduced fat pastes to new-style versions made with beetroot or edamame beans. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that hummus has become so popular in the UK, although in the Middle East it\u2019s not a dip eaten from a tub but a meal \u2013 and people often don\u2019t know how a really good one tastes,\u201d Ottolenghi told the Guardian. \u201cYou can now buy hummus at various levels and you can also make it yourself, which is what I recommend.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/26/nigel-slater-hazelnut-dukkah-and-roast-beetroot-garlic-hummus-recipes\">Nigel Slater\u2019s hazelnut dukkah and beetroot garlic hummus recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nick Saltmarsh, founder of <a href=\"https://hodmedods.co.uk\">Hodmedod</a>, which works closely with British farmers to produce homegrown grains and pulses, including fava beans, haricot beans and quinoa, said the situation \u201chighlights, very sadly, the obscurity of our food system in the UK \u2013 so many people don\u2019t know where our food comes from, never mind what\u2019s in it and how it\u2019s made\u201d. Saltmarsh\u2019s Suffolk-based company is currently working with the condiment firm <a href=\"http:// https://www.charlieandivys.co.uk\">Charlie &amp; Ivy\u2019s </a>to launch a new fava bean hummus (using UK rapeseed rather than olive oil) at a food festival at the end of May. His UK-grown products have the backing of top chefs such as Ottolenghi, Mark Hix and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. <br></p> <p>\u201cHummus is one of our most popular dips,\u201d says Joanna Black, hummus buyer at M&amp;S. \u201cAs the trend for eastern Mediterranean-style foods and eating has grown, so has the demand for hummus. It\u2019s no longer seen as an exotic food, but a more everyday item that customers are very familiar with.\u201d </p> <p>But if there is one lesson from the shortlived hummus furore, it is to diversify your supply chain. Pret a Manger \u2013 now enjoying massive sales of hummus as a result of its new vegetarian and vegan menus \u2013 uses a different supplier and was completely unaffected.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 29 and 30 April 2017 to remove incorrect information about tahini and clarify a reference to lipids, both of which were added in error during the editing process.</li> </ul>",
