      "bodyText": "More than 200,000 jobs could be created as the economy shifts to reusing materials traditionally discarded by businesses and households, according to a study by a leading green charity. Green Alliance said the jobs would be created by a new breed of companies that embrace recycling and servicing goods to prolong their lifespan. The move could stimulate jobs in areas of high unemployment that specialise in services exported to the rest of the country, the report argued. Firms spearheading ways to share services, such as car clubs, could also spur a growth in low and semi-skilled jobs.

Written with recycling charity Wrap, the report says by 2030 there would be 205,000 extra jobs and a 54,000 drop in unemployment. Critics of similar reports have argued that tougher regulations governing the re-usability and ease of recycling staple goods will mean they cost more and put them out of reach of poorer households. But the report argues that while products might cost a little more initially, low cost servicing will allow products to last longer and be cheaper over the longer term. Vacuum cleaner maker Dyson and toaster firm Dualit are renowned for offering servicing and parts to prolong the life of their products.

      "bodyText": "Fresh evidence of the impact of the plunging oil price emerged on Tuesday when business leaders in Russia and other energy-producing nations said it had knocked their confidence in the outlook for the world economy. After being the most upbeat executives at last year\u2019s meeting of the World Economic Forum, the plunge in the value of the rouble caused by the collapsing cost of crude has badly affected the mood of Russian bosses polled by PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC said their annual survey of business leaders showed a less bullish mood than a year ago and, published on the eve of the start of the four day gathering in the Swiss mountains, coincided with a move by the International Monetary Fund to downgrade its forecasts for of world growth. The Washington-based IMF said the boost from lower oil prices is being outweighed by a host of negative factors and it now expects global growth to edge up only slightly from 3.3% last year to 3.5% this year. That is down from a 3.8% forecast for 2015 in its World Economic Outlook published in October. It forecasts growth picking up only slightly next year and cut its 2016 forecasts from 4% to 3.7%. PwC surveyed 1,300 business leaders and found they were less optimistic that they were a year ago. Last year 44% of chief executives surveyed thought global growth would improve but that has fallen to 37% for 2015. Dennis Nally, chairman of PwC said: \u201cCEO confidence is down notably in oil-producing nations around the world as a result of plummeting crude oil prices. Russia CEOs, for example, were the most confident in last year\u2019s survey, but are the least confident this year. Confidence also slipped among CEOs in the Middle East, Venezuela, and Nigeria \u201c More than twice as many of the company bosses as last year thought global economic growth will decline, more than twice as many as a year ago. The survey was conducted at the end of a year in which Chinese growth had slowed and the eurozone stagnated, raising expectations that Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank will try to bolster the eurozone by starting QE on Thursday. Lower oil prices prompted the IMF to cut its outlook for big oil exporters, including Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. But it says the fall in the oil price, which for Brent crude is now below $50 a barrel, also presents opportunities to reform energy subsidies and taxes in both oil exporters and importers. Olivier Blanchard, IMF director of research, said: \u201cNew factors supporting growth \u2013 lower oil prices, but also depreciation of euro and yen \u2013 are more than offset by persistent negative forces, including the lingering legacies of the crisis and lower potential growth in many countries\u201d. \u201cThis makes for a complicated mosaic ... good news for oil importers, bad news for oil exporters. Good news for commodity importers, bad news for exporters. Continuing struggles for the countries which show scars of the crisis, and not so for others. Good news for countries more linked to the euro and the yen, bad news for those more linked to the dollar,\u201d Blanchard said. The IMF left its UK forecasts largely the same, continuing to project growth of 2.7% this year. Chancellor George Osborne said: \u201cToday\u2019s IMF forecast shows that Britain is pulling ahead, while the global economy is being downgraded. There\u2019s confirmation that we grew faster than any other major economy last year, and we\u2019re set to grow faster this year. But there are risks out there in the global economy and it\u2019s a timely reminder that we\u2019ve got to go on working through our long-term economic plan if we want to stay ahead.\u201d Britain is expected to lose its place as the fastest-growing major economy to the US this year, with UK growth forecast at 2.7% and the US at 3.6%. The bosses surveyed in the UK by PwC were more optimistic than their EU counterparts. But Ian Powell, UK chairman and senior partner at PwC, said that \u201cthe high levels of optimism we saw last year have been tempered by concerns about access to key skills, disruptive trends and geopolitical uncertainty\u201d. The PwC survey found that chief executives were targeting the US as their most important market for growth over the next 12 months, placing it ahead of China for the first time since the question was first included in the survey five years ago. Some 38% of chief executives said the US was among their top-three overseas growth markets, compared with 34% for China, 19% for Germany, 11% for the UK and 10% for Brazil. The US was the only major economy where the IMF had raised growth forecasts for the next two years. It saw a boost from lower oil prices and strong domestic demand helping the US economy to grow 3.6% this year, up markedly from a 3.1% forecast made in October. For the eurozone, the IMF expected a drag from weaker investment prospects, particularly thanks to a knock-on effect on exporters from an emerging markets slowdown. The IMF predicted eurozone growth of 1.2% this year, down from 1.3% in October. It has also cut its 2016 forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%.",

      "bodyText": "The plunging oil price has knocked the confidence of business leaders in Russia and other energy producing nations, according to a survey of top bosses published on Tuesday to coincide with the start of the Davos meeting of the World Economic Forum. Larry Elliott and Jill Treanor write from Davos: The survey found that company bosses are less optimistic than they were a year ago. Last year 44% of chief executives surveyed by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers thought global growth would improve but that has fallen to 37% for 2015. Dennis Nally, chairman of PwC said: \u201cCEO confidence is down notably in oil-producing nations around the world as a result of plummeting crude oil prices.

The survey was conduced after a year in which Chinese growth had slowed and the eurozone stagnated, raising expectations that Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, will try to bolster the eurozone by launching a quantitative easing programme on Thursday. Bosses surveyed in the UK are more optimistic than their EU counterparts, more than 60% of UK CEOs believing there are more growth opportunities for their company today than three years ago - more than any of their European peers. But Ian Powell, UK chairman and senior partner at PwC, said that \u201cthe high levels of optimism we saw last year have been tempered by concerns about access to key skills, disruptive trends and geopolitical uncertainty\u201d. The full story is here: Davos 2015: sliding oil makes chief executives less upbeat than last year On that note it\u2019s time to shut up shop for the evening. The team in Davos will re-open the blog in the case of any major events, but otherwise we\u2019ll be back tomorrow as usual. Thanks for all your comments, and see you soon. Despite the IMF cutting its global forecasts, shares moved higher again as Chinese GDP came in better than expected, albeit at 7.4%, lower than the government\u2019s 7.5% target. And of course, investors are still betting on quantitative easing from the European Central Bank on Thursday. Even an opening fall on Wall Street, hit by declines in energy shares as oil dipped again and disappointing results from Morgan Stanley and Johnson &amp; Johnson, failed to dampen the mood. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.57 points or 0.52% at 6620.10 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.14% to 10,257.13 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.16% at 4446.02 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.91% to 19,658.66 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.24% higher at 10,283.9 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 120 points or 0.7%. My colleague Graeme Wearden has arrived in Davos and here are some early snapshots: US housebuilder sentiment dipped slightly in January but still remains strong, according to the latest industry survey. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index fell to 57 from 58 in December (itself revised up from 57). Analysts had been expecting a reading of 58. But the index has not been below 50 since June last year, and NAHB chairman Kevin Kelly said: After seven months above the key 50 benchmark, builder sentiment is reflecting the gradual improvement that is occurring in many markets throughout the nation. Following Monday\u2019s market closure for Martin Luther King day, investors are taking some profits in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 59 points or 0.33%, although it has recovered from larger falls earlier after the housebuilding figures. Energy shares came under pressure as oil slipped again in the wake of the IMF\u2019s cut in its global growth forecasts. Update from the Bank for International Settlements: lending to Russia by overseas banks fell by $11bn in the third quarter of 2014. That was contrary to the broader trend, with cross-border lending overall up by $493bn, boosting the annual growth rate to 5% from 1% in the second quarter. The increase was concentrated in Japanese yen and US dollars, BIS said. The TUC has a few frank words for the global thinkers gathering in Davos for the World Economic Forum this week. The message is that the delegate list should be more representative of the issues being discussed, and not just an elite talking shop. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary, gets the point across: Just one per cent of the global population owns half the world\u2019s wealth, so we need some voices at Davos to speak up for the other 99 per cent. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here as part of a delegation of international trade union leaders. If Davos is a closed shop for the wealthy and powerful elites who caused today\u2019s global inequality, it won\u2019t come up with the answers needed for a more fair and prosperous future for all the world\u2019s workers and their families. We need to get living wages and the protection of public services onto the agenda. And we need the business leaders attending to commit to cleaning up supply chains, paying their taxes and investing in decent jobs instead of the casino capitalism that caused the crash. The scale and nature of the European Central Bank\u2019s hotly anticipated foray into quantitative easing on Thursday continues to occupy economists\u2019 minds. Franck Dixmier of Allianz Global Investors says action needs to be bold. The stakes are extremely high in the run-up to the ECB\u2019s QE announcement on Thursday and [ECB President] Mario Draghi would do well to adopt a bold, yet simple plan of attack to stave off a prolonged period of deflation and boost economic prospects in the Eurozone. As the ECB finalizes plans for firing the last major weapon in its monetary policy arsenal, markets are hoping for a QE programme of at least EUR 500 billion and anything less will be perceived as a huge disappointment. Eligible assets will certainly include government bonds, but the addition of corporate investment grade securities would be a welcome surprise for investors, which is not currently priced into the market. The worst mistake the ECB could make, in my view, would be to attach too many conditions and caveats to pacify the QE sceptics. Such an approach would make QE difficult to execute and obscure its full implications and consequences for investors. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, asks whether it will be a case of \u201ctoo little too late\u201d, here. A taster below: For Mario Draghi, Thursday is the day the talking stops. It is two and a half years since the president of the European Central Bank said he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to safeguard the future of the euro. Financial markets now want him to deliver on his pledge. All the hurdles - economic, political and legal - have allegedly been cleared. The ECB will announce a programme of sovereign bond purchases, its equivalent of the quantitative easing programmes that were announced by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England six years ago. Having ramped up expectations, there is now a danger that the long-awaited plan proves a damp squib. Markets want Draghi to put a figure on the size of his programme (preferably at least \u20ac1 trillion) and they want to know exactly how it will be operated. Given the length of time that has elapsed since Draghi\u2019s \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech, they will be unhappy with anything less. Copper is trading higher after China\u2019s growth figures were not as weak as many analysts had feared. The world\u2019s second largest economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, the weakest since 1990 and a touch below the government\u2019s official 7.5% forecast but not as low as the 7.2% growth predicted in a Reuters poll. Copper is considered a barometer for global economic demand and is closely linked to developments in China - its largest consumer. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was trading up 1% at $5,735 a tonne. Last week copper prices hit a five-and-a-half year low on the back of global growth fears. The business blog\u2019s very own Graeme Wearden is in Switzerland and is making his way to Davos. Other modes of transport are available: The UK will remain in the European Union, analysts and traders are convinced. Of the 500 people surveyed for Bloomberg\u2019s quarterly global poll, 71% believe the UK will be part of the EU for the foreseeable future. A further 15% expect the UK to break away within five years, and another 8% said the UK would exit within a decade. The Conservatives have promised a referendum on UK membership of the EU by the end of 2017 should they win the general election in May, increasing the chances of an exit. Back with George Osborne and his appearance at the Treasury committee: Morgan Stanley is the latest big US bank to report results, and they have come in below expectations, with fourth quarter revenues of $7.8bn and earnings per share of $0.47. Meanwhile chancellor George Osborne is currently being quizzed by the Treasury committee about more tax powers for Scotland. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is live blogging the sesssion here. In China-related news, Unilever has warned this morning that it does not expect market conditions to improve in 2015 because of a downturn in emerging markets and weakness in Europe. The consumer goods giant behind Marmite, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream and Persil washing powder, said sales were down 20% in China in the fourth quarter, as retailers ran down their stocks of personal care products. Overall, underlying sales rose 2.1% in the fourth quarter, disappointing City expectations of a 2.6% rise. Unilever shares are down 1.2% at \u00a326.97. Paul Polman, Unilever\u2019s chief executive: We do not plan on a significant improvement in market conditions in 2015. Against this background, we expect our full-year performance to be similar to 2014 with the first quarter being softer but growth improving during the year. Read our full story here. Some more reaction to the IMF\u2019s revised growth forecasts now, specifically on the UK. The shadow chancellor Ed Balls has (unsurprisingly) taken a different view on the forecasts to George Osborne, who was overwhelmingly positive this morning. Balls says: It\u2019s worrying that the IMF has downgraded its forecasts for the UK economy for last year and next year too. In contrast the IMF says the US will grow faster than us this year and next year and has seen its growth forecasts upgraded. This shows why the complacency of David Cameron and George Osborne is so misplaced. Claims that the economy is fixed will ring hollow to millions of working people who are on average \u00a31,600 a year worse off under this government. We need stronger and more balanced growth that delivers sustained rises in living standards for all, not just a few. That\u2019s what Labour\u2019s economic plan is all about. Meanwhile Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, had this to say on the forecasts: Today\u2019s forecast update from the IMF confirms expectations that the UK economy has grown faster than any other G7 country in 2014. It is also encouraging that along with the US we are one of only two G7 countries not to have seen our growth downgraded in 2015. However while this marks real progress we need to continue sticking to our plan to build the stronger economy and fairer society that we aspire to. Scottish Power\u2019s move to cut prices follows the decision by British Gas on Monday to cut prices by 5%, with effect from 27 February. Last week E.ON announced it was immediately cutting prices by 3.5%. Scottish Power - owned by the Spanish utility company Iberdrola - said its average annual gas bill on a standard tariff would fall \u00a333. In a statement, Neil Clitheroe, Scottish Power\u2019s head of retail and generation, said: Today\u2019s decision has been made to benefit our customers and keep our prices competitive. We will continue to keep our prices under review. Our pricing reflects all of the costs that contribute to a customer\u2019s bill. The wholesale price of energy accounts for half of a customer\u2019s gas bill, but non-energy costs such as transmission and distribution networks and environmental and social obligations remain unaffected by any wholesale energy price movements. On Monday, Ed Miliband described the 5% cut in gas prices by British Gas as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. His argument is that energy companies are not passing on enough of the 20% fall in wholesale gas prices. Energy companies counter the argument by saying bills are made up of various costs, and are not simply determined by wholesale prices. To demonstrate the point, Scottish Power has published a bar chart. For every \u00a3100 spent by a gas customer, the typical breakdown of costs is shown below. Breaking: Scottish Power has become the latest energy company to cut its household gas prices. Prices will be cut 4.8% from 20 February. More soon. As speculation about the outcome of Sunday\u2019s Greek election mounts, read the Guardian\u2019s datablog here for the latest facts and figures. The big fear among financial markets is that a victory for the radical left and anti-austerity party Syriza - currently ahead in the polls - will ultimately lead to a Greek exit from the eurozone. Confidence among Germany\u2019s analysts and investors jumped to an 11-month high in January, beating expectations. Low oil prices, a weak euro, and expectations that the ECB will announce quantitative easing on Thursday, boosted hopes that Europe\u2019s biggest economy will rebound after weakening in the second half of last year. The closely-watched ZEW survey of economic sentiment rose for a third month to 48.4 in January from 34.9 in December. It was the highest since February last year and beat economists\u2019 forecasts of a smaller increase to 40. Jennifer McKeown, a senior European economist at Capital Economics, said it was a sign that confidence was holding up well in Germany despite uncertainty over the Greece. Presumably any worries about the effect of the Greek crisis on the German economy were offset by expectations of ECB quantitative easing and hopes of a boost to exports from the weakening euro. This may suggest that German GDP growth, which stalled around the middle of 2014 and seems likely to have been very weak in Q4, will pick back up this year. But note that the ZEW survey has not been a particularly reliable indicator of actual activity in the past and if the Greek situation deteriorates in the aftermath of this week\u2019s election or ECB QE disappoints, investors may well take a dimmer view of Germany\u2019s prospects. For now, we expect German GDP to expand by a steady but unspectacular 1% this year and 1.5% next, which will do little to reduce the risk of a long bout of deflation in the euro-zone as a whole. Consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has received a slap on the wrist from the Financial Conduct Authority in the form of a \u00a3539,800 fine over share dealing by its senior executives. The FCA said its disclosure to the market of share dealing by two senior executives was late and incomplete as a result of inadequate monitoring. When the company became aware of the share deals, it should have informed the market by the end of the next business day but it failed to do so. Ukraine is confident that there will be a positive outcome from negotiations with the IMF over further financial aid, Reuters is reporting. Ukraine has been pushed to the financial brink as a result of the pro-Russian separatist war in the east and is facing huge debt repayments. It has asked the IMF to extend an existing programme to plug a $15bn (\u00a39.9bn) funding gap. The existing package is worth $17bn and has so far paid out $4.6bn in two tranches. The IMF team arrived in Kiev on 8 January for the latest round of talks which are expected to last until the end of the month. The Fund has said any additional money will depend on Kiev\u2019s ability to deliver long-promised reforms. Reuters is quoting Oleksander Pisaruk, the first deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s central bank. The talks are constructive. Co-operation with the IMF is fruitful. I feel optimism about the possible outcome. The European Central Bank has reported a rise in companies seeking a bank loan in the fourth quarter. Demand is also expected to rise in the first three months of 2015. In its latest quarterly survey of bank loans, the ECB said that a quarter of banks surveyed saw an increased in demand for home loans in the final quarter of 2014, with a fifth expecting another increase this quarter. A few extracts from the report: The heterogeneity across countries continued to reduce somewhat, with banks in Germany, France, the Netherlands and particularly in Spain reporting an increase in demand for loans to enterprises and Italian banks indicating unchanged demand. For housing loans, net loan demand was particularly positive in the Netherlands, Italy and Germany and to a lesser extent in Spain, while remaining unchanged in France down from a strong increase in the previous quarter. Brent crude oil prices were down on Tuesday morning, trading at just above $48 a barrel. Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist of data provider IHS, says plunging oil prices will transfer roughly $1.5 trillion (\u00a3990bn) in wealth from producers of oil to consumers of it. The Davos delegate says this will mean an additional 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points for world growth. Everyone right now is talking about the impact of the oil price plunge. While clear winners and losers are being created, the net effect will be positive as roughly $1.5 trillion in wealth is transferred from producers of oil to consumers of it. This will translate to an additional 0.3 to 0.5 percentage point to world growth. As a point of reference, the 67% drop in oil prices in 1985 and 1986 was followed by a boom. While three decades later the global environment is different, and a boom may not be in the offing, the big drop in oil prices will help growth. Despite multiple divergent trends, global growth is likely to accelerate a little in 2015. Falling oil prices and more stimuli from key central banks will boost global growth in 2015 to 3% from 2.7 percent in 2014 It\u2019s that time of year again when world leaders and the big names in business and economics put their heads together in the Swiss mountains to debate pressing issues of global significance. Many of the delegates are currently making their way to Davos, before the event officially opens later today. Here is a reminder of what is likely to be on the agenda. Guardian reporters will be bringing you all the news from Davos over the coming week. Follow @jilltreanor and @graemewearden for updates. European investors have shrugged off the IMF\u2019s weaker global outlook this morning, with all major indices trading higher. The news from China that growth was the slowest in 24 years in 2014 was not exactly positive, but markets are signalling relief: it could have been worse. FTSE 100: +0.4% at 6,609.63 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2 at 10,265.18 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5 at 4,415.51 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.5 at 10,211.4 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.5 at 19,586.22 Here is a table of the IMF\u2019s latest projections. Back on the IMF, the outlook for the UK was unchanged for 2015, with growth of 2.7% forecast. It nudged down the forecast for 2016 to 2.4% from 2.5%. The Washington-based Fund believes official figures will soon confirm that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy last year with growth of 2.6%. (The Office for National Statistics will publish its first estimate of fourth-quarter and full-year growth on 27 January.) The Chancellor George Osborne has given his verdict on the forecasts: Today\u2019s IMF forecast shows that Britain is pulling ahead, while the global economy is being downgraded. There\u2019s confirmation that we grew faster than any other major economy last year, and we\u2019re set to grow faster this year*. But there are risks out there in the global economy and it\u2019s a timely reminder that we\u2019ve got to go on working through our long term economic plan if we want to stay ahead. *It\u2019s worth pointing out here that UK growth is forecast to accelerate to 2.7% this year from 2.6% last year. But US growth is expected to outpace the UK this year at 3.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. The International Monetary Fund has become the latest heavyweight forecaster to downgrade its outlook for the global economy. In an update to coincide with the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos - which kicks off later today in the Swiss ski resort - the IMF predicted global growth would be 3.5% this year, and not 3.8% as previously expected. The Fund\u2019s growth forecasts for 2016 were also cut to 3.7% from 4%. It blamed the looming recession in Russia and slowdown in China for the gloomier outlook, warning the negative effects would outweigh the boost from lower oil prices. Read our full story here. Meanwhile China confirmed overnight what everyone feared - the economy grew at the slowest rate since 1990 in 2014. Growth of 7.4% was below the government\u2019s 7.5% target - the first time the official target has been missed for 16 years. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Ben Varadi, vice president of Spin Master, the Canadian toy company that owns Meccano, said the marketing would be aimed \u201cmore so at boys because the construction industry has tended to be more boy-orientated\u201d. However he added that \u201cany smart kid\u201d or \u201canybody who is into exploration, creativity, building and love of engineering\u201d - boy or girl - would want to play with the robot. A poster at the London Toy Fair, where a prototype model was unveiled, described the target market as \u201cboys 8+\u201d. At the trade fair, Spin Master was also promoting its \u2018Sew Cool\u2019 threadless sewing machines and chocolate makers, which the company is targeting at girls. Air Hogs, the company\u2019s air-propelled toy planes, and \u2018Monster Trucks\u2019 are aimed at boys. Varadi, who is also Spin Master\u2019s chief creative officer, disagreed with the idea that marketing was sending a signal to girls that engineering and construction toys were not for them. \u201cIt is like when you see laundry detergent commercials on the TV. They never show a man throwing his laundry in, and yet I buy detergent.\u201d \u201cToy companies make what they believe kids will be excited about buying, just like any company on earth. We follow historically what kids have told us or how kids are orientated.\u201d But he admitted the toy industry was \u201crobotic\u201d in its marketing because it believes that campaigns aimed at boys and girls would be confusing. \u201cWe tend to chase the 80% [boys buying Meccano] not the 20%, because sometimes when you try and incorporate the 10% or 20% it confuses the message.\u201d Jo Jowers at the Let Toys be Toys campaign said the decision to target boys was disappointing, if not a surprise. \u201cAll toys are for all children. It is just as likely a girl would get something out of it.\u201d She said some parents could be put off from buying the toy for their daughers if it appeared to be aimed at boys. \u201cIt seems a shame to say it is not for girls when something like Meccano is such an inspiring and creative toy.\u201d The company has not finalised its UK marketing campaign for the Meccanoid, which is due to hit the shops in July. The toy will cost $399 (\u00a3262) in the US, but a UK price has not been set. The robot comes with instructions to be built as a T-Rex, but can be turned into almost anything. The company hopes the polycarbonate kit and computing \u201cbrain\u201d, will fire children\u2019s imaginations, just as earlier Meccano sets of metal strips, nuts and bolts inspired British architects such as Richard Rogers and Norman Foster. Meccano was created by British inventor Frank Hornby in 1898, who wanted his sons to be able to build cranes like the ones they admired on the port of Liverpool. After more than two years of development, the latest toy is the great hope for Meccano, which almost went bankrupt in the 1990s and was taken over by Spin Master in 2013. Varadi said Meccano had \u201ctotally lost its way\u201d and lost ground to Lego, the Danish firm that became the world\u2019s biggest toy company after a string of lucrative film tie-ins that saw yellow-brick re-creations of Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings.",

      "body": "<p>A boost to the mining sector from better than expected Chinese growth figures pushed leading shares to their highest close this year, despite an opening fall on Wall Street.</p> <p>Mexican precious metals group <strong>Fresnillo</strong> was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, up 35p to 911p as gold and silver moved higher once more.</p> <p>With base metals like copper helped by news that Chinese GDP rose 7.4% last year - below the country\u2019s target of 7.5% but higher than analyst predictions - <strong>Glencore </strong>also regained some ground after recent losses. Its shares ended 9.75p higher at 257.45p, helped by a positive recommendation from HSBC, albeit the bank analysts cut their target price from 440p to 395p. They said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our target price cut follows publication of our latest commodity price assumptions. Nevertheless, with 64% upside to our target price and financial risks manageable, we remain overweight.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong> added 32p to 1121.5p while<strong> BHP Billiton</strong> rose 24.5p to 1392.5p. <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> recovered from early losses after weak copper production figures to close 29.5p higher at 2885.5p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished up 34.57 points at 6620.10, its best closing level since 29 December, as investors shrugged off the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts and anticipated the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank on Thursday.</p> <p>But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 150 points by the time London closed, in the first day of trading this week following Monday\u2019s Martin Luther King day. Another slide in the oil price hit energy shares, while there were disappointing results from Morgan Stanley and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p> <p>Back among the UK fallers,<strong> Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling</strong> lost 65p to \u00a310.57 as JP Morgan Cazenove moved to neutral from overweight, citing weak markets in Russia and Nigeria. There is also the uncertainty over the outcome of this week\u2019s Greek election.</p> <p><strong>Dixons Carphone</strong> continued its volatile run ahead of a Christmas trading update, falling 4.3p to 442.2p.</p> <p>Satellite broadcaster <strong>Sky</strong> slipped 2p to 926p on reports it could be interested in a link up with UK mobile operator O2, owned by Spain\u2019s Telefonica.</p> <p>Following news that BT was in talks to buy EE for a possible \u00a312.5bn, analysts have speculated Sky might act to gain access to a mobile operator. Now a Spanish newspaper is reporting that Sky has approached Telefonica about buying O2, although many analysts believe a tie-up is more likely than a purchase.</p> <p>Even so Liberum issued a sell note following the report:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spanish newspaper Cinco Dias is reporting that Sky has approached Telefonica over a potential purchase of UK mobile operator O2 (along with TalkTalk). If this is true, Sky has decided to commit itself to the \u201cquad-play\u201d route (TV, broadband, fixed telephony, mobile), which is not a proved concept in the UK market (although it has worked in, for example, France) and it would presumably mean some sort of capital raise (which would then allow Sky to maintain financial flexibility over the Premier League rights).</p> <p>From a strategic standpoint, we are not sure this would fix its problem in the UK, i.e. slowing growth, a more aggressive competitor in BT (with Virgin Media also becoming more aggressive) and that it does not own its fixed-line infrastructure, which its rivals do. Final point - if Sky does buy O2, the most likely knock-on effect is a Vodafone/Virgin Media (or Liberty Global) combination, as Vodafone would be left otherwise facing two rivals both offering a credible quad-play offer - the only way to counter that would be a Vodafone/Virgin Media tie-up.</p> </blockquote> <p>RBC Capital Markets said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BT\u2019s proposed acquisition of EE (over O2 UK) has triggered a potential second wave of UK consolidation, with press reports in recent days citing that Hutchison and potentially Sky and TalkTalk are looking at O2 UK. We see a Hutchison/O2 UK deal as a cleaner way out of the UK market for Telefonica and a likely route to higher cash proceeds which can be used for deleveraging. Any deal with TalkTalk, in our view, is likely to involve O2 retaining a large stake in O2 UK and long-term exposure to the UK market. Whilst, a deal with Sky, given Sky\u2019s relatively high leverage (currently 3 times) would also leave Telefonica with limited cash proceeds and a relatively large stake in Sky, assuming Sky isn\u2019t willing to increase overall leverage.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> meanwhile added 0.55p to 230p, while <strong>TalkTalk </strong>climbed 9.8p to 325p.<br></p> <p><strong>Balfour Beatty</strong> rose 1.4p to 207.5p on news it has appointed Philip Harrison of Hogg Robinson and formerly of VT Group as its new chief financial officer. The move is part of a turnaround plan at the troubled infrastructure group, which issued a string of profit warnings and recently rejected an offer from John Laing Infrastructure fund for its PFI assets. In a buy note, Liberum said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The appointment of a chief financial officer is an important step towards rebuilding Balfour Beatty\u2019s profitability.

      "bodyText": "A boost to the mining sector from better than expected Chinese growth figures pushed leading shares to their highest close this year, despite an opening fall on Wall Street. Mexican precious metals group Fresnillo was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, up 35p to 911p as gold and silver moved higher once more. With base metals like copper helped by news that Chinese GDP rose 7.4% last year - below the country\u2019s target of 7.5% but higher than analyst predictions - Glencore also regained some ground after recent losses. Its shares ended 9.75p higher at 257.45p, helped by a positive recommendation from HSBC, albeit the bank analysts cut their target price from 440p to 395p. They said: Our target price cut follows publication of our latest commodity price assumptions. Nevertheless, with 64% upside to our target price and financial risks manageable, we remain overweight. Anglo American added 32p to 1121.5p while BHP Billiton rose 24.5p to 1392.5p. Rio Tinto recovered from early losses after weak copper production figures to close 29.5p higher at 2885.5p. Overall the FTSE 100 finished up 34.57 points at 6620.10, its best closing level since 29 December, as investors shrugged off the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts and anticipated the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank on Thursday. But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 150 points by the time London closed, in the first day of trading this week following Monday\u2019s Martin Luther King day. Another slide in the oil price hit energy shares, while there were disappointing results from Morgan Stanley and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Back among the UK fallers, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling lost 65p to \u00a310.57 as JP Morgan Cazenove moved to neutral from overweight, citing weak markets in Russia and Nigeria. There is also the uncertainty over the outcome of this week\u2019s Greek election. Dixons Carphone continued its volatile run ahead of a Christmas trading update, falling 4.3p to 442.2p. Satellite broadcaster Sky slipped 2p to 926p on reports it could be interested in a link up with UK mobile operator O2, owned by Spain\u2019s Telefonica. Following news that BT was in talks to buy EE for a possible \u00a312.5bn, analysts have speculated Sky might act to gain access to a mobile operator. Now a Spanish newspaper is reporting that Sky has approached Telefonica about buying O2, although many analysts believe a tie-up is more likely than a purchase. Even so Liberum issued a sell note following the report: Spanish newspaper Cinco Dias is reporting that Sky has approached Telefonica over a potential purchase of UK mobile operator O2 (along with TalkTalk). If this is true, Sky has decided to commit itself to the \u201cquad-play\u201d route (TV, broadband, fixed telephony, mobile), which is not a proved concept in the UK market (although it has worked in, for example, France) and it would presumably mean some sort of capital raise (which would then allow Sky to maintain financial flexibility over the Premier League rights). From a strategic standpoint, we are not sure this would fix its problem in the UK, i.e. slowing growth, a more aggressive competitor in BT (with Virgin Media also becoming more aggressive) and that it does not own its fixed-line infrastructure, which its rivals do. Final point - if Sky does buy O2, the most likely knock-on effect is a Vodafone/Virgin Media (or Liberty Global) combination, as Vodafone would be left otherwise facing two rivals both offering a credible quad-play offer - the only way to counter that would be a Vodafone/Virgin Media tie-up. RBC Capital Markets said: BT\u2019s proposed acquisition of EE (over O2 UK) has triggered a potential second wave of UK consolidation, with press reports in recent days citing that Hutchison and potentially Sky and TalkTalk are looking at O2 UK. We see a Hutchison/O2 UK deal as a cleaner way out of the UK market for Telefonica and a likely route to higher cash proceeds which can be used for deleveraging. Any deal with TalkTalk, in our view, is likely to involve O2 retaining a large stake in O2 UK and long-term exposure to the UK market. Whilst, a deal with Sky, given Sky\u2019s relatively high leverage (currently 3 times) would also leave Telefonica with limited cash proceeds and a relatively large stake in Sky, assuming Sky isn\u2019t willing to increase overall leverage. Vodafone meanwhile added 0.55p to 230p, while TalkTalk climbed 9.8p to 325p. Balfour Beatty rose 1.4p to 207.5p on news it has appointed Philip Harrison of Hogg Robinson and formerly of VT Group as its new chief financial officer. The move is part of a turnaround plan at the troubled infrastructure group, which issued a string of profit warnings and recently rejected an offer from John Laing Infrastructure fund for its PFI assets. In a buy note, Liberum said: The appointment of a chief financial officer is an important step towards rebuilding Balfour Beatty\u2019s profitability. We expect the results of the KPMG contract review in the next couple of weeks: the market is already pricing in a substantial warning while the current market capitalisation is underpinned by the PFI business. Elsewhere, Amazon\u2019s decision to go into film production could be good news for Entertainment One, according to Peel Hunt. The company\u2019s recent purchase of 51% of Grey\u2019s Anatomy and Speed producer Mark Gordon Company was badly received by the market, but the broker believes the Amazon decision could help revive its fortunes: This move may spark some speculative interest in Entertainment One helped by the recent share price falls that have followed the investment in Mark Gordon (a deal that lacked the opportunity for shareholder scrutiny).

Building such a position (a risk to Entertainment One), as opposed to purchasing it, would take a material length of time which is a commodity that is in short supply in a fast-evolving global market place. Entertainment One\u2019s shares ended 3p higher at 282p. Velocys, a gas-to-liquids specialist, edged up 0.25p to 133.5p after Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich bought more than 1.5m shares to take his stake - owned through his Ervington Investments vehicle - to 14.3%. Finally Real Good Food dipped 0.75p to 36.25p after unveiling the acquisition for up to \u00a37.5m of cake decorating product specialist Rainbow Dust Colours.

      "bodyText": "The Obama administration approaches Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address with hopes for a robust housing market, with more mortgage lending and with healthy increases in home sales. Here\u2019s the first problem to overcome, particularly with the president\u2019s focus on the middle class: we have two housing markets, one for the rich and one for the rest. The only home sales growing are for million-dollar properties. Home purchases made entirely in cash are historically high. Simply building more homes and increasing the supply of houses won\u2019t bring down prices. The homes being built are bigger than ever, and increasingly designed for the luxury market. Consider this incredible statistic from the research analyst Redfin: through last April, sales of the McMansions of America \u2013 the top 1% of homes by price \u2013 rocketed up 21% compared to last year. But sales of the other 99% of homes were down 7.6%. It\u2019s not even clear that rising home prices \u2013 traditionally a way to measure a recovery \u2013 would be good for the middle class. Price increases harm the affordability of homes, particularly for first-time homebuyers, who have not returned to the market at their historical level. This is an important group: first-time homebuyers drive the entire market, allowing sellers to step up into bigger homes. Where\u2019s the middle-class housing recovery? The absence of middle-class, first-time homebuyers has been the biggest obstacle to a true housing recovery.

Either you get real increases in wages, or you start handing out riskier mortgages. Consequently, brokers put more homes up for sale in higher price ranges, because that\u2019s where the demand is.

Fannie and Freddie also recently set a threshold for how many loans they will purchase with \u201cmisrepresentations or data inaccuracies\u201d before they will force the originator to buy them back. This means lenders can now sell Fannie and Freddie a certain number of fraudulent loans \u2013 as long as they stay under the threshold.

And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/28/president-barack-obamas-state-union-address\">president mentioned manufacturing five times in his State of the Union address</a>, zeroing in on the high-tech sector.</p> <p>\u201cWe also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of hi-tech manufacturing jobs,\u201d he said.</p> <p> This year\u2019s State of the Union address is likely to signal the direction Obama plans to take in his last two years in office. That seems to be to aggressively promote US auto manufacturing. <br></p> <p>In a speech <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/07/remarks-president-resurgence-american-auto-industry\">he made January 7 at Ford\u2019s Michigan assembly plant</a>, Obama said manufacturing was leading the way in job creation in America, and called the auto industry the \u201cheartbeat of American manufacturing.\u201d</p> <p>The president <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/03/remarks-president-town-hall-manufacturing \">made similar remarks</a> in October at Millennium Steel, in Princeton, Indiana.</p> <p>\u201cAbout 10, 15 years ago, everybody said American manufacturing is going downhill, everything is moving to China or other countries,\u201d he said, adding that the sector had benefitted from increased investment into new technology and plants, and new training opportunities for workers. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve now seen is manufacturing driving economic growth in a way we haven\u2019t seen in about 20-25 years.\u201d</p> <p>A report released last summer <a href=\"http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/documents/manufacturingsincethegreatrecession2014-06-10final.pdf\">by the US Department of Commerce\u2019s economics and statistics administration</a> supports the president\u2019s claim.</p> <p>It says that, between February 2010 and May 2014, about 646,000 jobs were added to the manufacturing sector, and that the number of \u201cmanufacturing establishments\u201d had risen for the first time since 1999. The value of US manufactured goods exported in 2013 was $1.3trn.</p> <p>In the auto industry in particular, the change has been marked since its near collapse around the time Obama entered office. <br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet \">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reported that the number of jobs in the automotive sector has risen to nearly 900,000 since 2009. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of jobs in motor vehicle and parts manufacturing had dropped from more than 1.1m to just over 600,000. <br></p> <p>In fact, the automotive industry is a bright spot in manufacturing \u2013 a notable reversal from only a few years ago. In <a href=\"http://trade.gov/manufactureamerica/facts/tg_mana_003019.asp#P13_602\">2010</a>, the Commerce Department\u2019s international trade administration <a href=\"http://trade.gov/manufactureamerica/facts/tg_mana_003019.asp#P13_602 \">said </a>\u201cportion of US production attributable to manufacturing has steadily declined since 1965.\u201d </p> <p>The trend in US manufacturing is now upward. An ESA report optimistically points out that between 2009 and 2013, 75% of research and development spending, 52% of exports, and 43% of foreign direct investment have been generated by the manufacturing sector. <br></p> <p>Coal manufacturing was the largest contributor to that, racked up more than $370 bn in shipments and more than $70bn in exports. Other significant contributions to America\u2019s manufacturing portfolio during that period included chemicals, primary metals, machinery and food.</p> <p>It helps America\u2019s position that its largest rival, China, is slowing down, with manufacturing becoming more expensive there. According to <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-23/chinas-rising-wages-and-the-made-in-the-usa-revival\">a report from Bloomberg Businessweek in October</a>, wages in China\u2019s Yangtze delta had risen from 82 cents an hour in 2001 to about $5 per hour this year. Oil prices have also risen since 2001, from $20 to about $80 a barrel, making manufacturing in China that much less attractive. <br></p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-tiptoe-back-toward-made-in-the-u-s-a-1421206289\">recent Wall Street Journal article suggests</a> that in the US, stable wages, competitive energy prices and the desire to shorten supply chains is causing many American companies to consider putting \u201cMade in USA\u201d stickers on products.</p>",

(He did, however, use the word \u201cfreedom\u201d an average of 10 times per State of the Union, peaking at 21 in 2006.) President Obama has cut a different path. With General Motors and Chrysler dealing with bankruptcy \u2013 Ford escaped disgrace after then-CEO Alan Mulally prudently sold off the automaker\u2019s excess brands just before the recession hit \u2013 the auto industry got plenty of attention in 2009. After mentioning manufacturing in vague terms in 2011, Obama has, since his 2012 speech, been moreforthright. In 2012, he said the auto industry was back on its feet, calling for a \u201cblueprint for an economy that\u2019s built to last.\u201d \u201cNow, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing,\u201d he said. In 2013, the president said that bolstering manufacturing would become a priority. \u201cAfter shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three,\u201d he said. \u201cCaterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.\u201d Last year, the president mentioned manufacturing five times in his State of the Union address, zeroing in on the high-tech sector. \u201cWe also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of hi-tech manufacturing jobs,\u201d he said. This year\u2019s State of the Union address is likely to signal the direction Obama plans to take in his last two years in office. That seems to be to aggressively promote US auto manufacturing. In a speech he made January 7 at Ford\u2019s Michigan assembly plant, Obama said manufacturing was leading the way in job creation in America, and called the auto industry the \u201cheartbeat of American manufacturing.\u201d The president made similar remarks in October at Millennium Steel, in Princeton, Indiana. \u201cAbout 10, 15 years ago, everybody said American manufacturing is going downhill, everything is moving to China or other countries,\u201d he said, adding that the sector had benefitted from increased investment into new technology and plants, and new training opportunities for workers. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve now seen is manufacturing driving economic growth in a way we haven\u2019t seen in about 20-25 years.\u201d A report released last summer by the US Department of Commerce\u2019s economics and statistics administration supports the president\u2019s claim. It says that, between February 2010 and May 2014, about 646,000 jobs were added to the manufacturing sector, and that the number of \u201cmanufacturing establishments\u201d had risen for the first time since 1999. The value of US manufactured goods exported in 2013 was $1.3trn. In the auto industry in particular, the change has been marked since its near collapse around the time Obama entered office. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of jobs in the automotive sector has risen to nearly 900,000 since 2009. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of jobs in motor vehicle and parts manufacturing had dropped from more than 1.1m to just over 600,000. In fact, the automotive industry is a bright spot in manufacturing \u2013 a notable reversal from only a few years ago. In 2010, the Commerce Department\u2019s international trade administration said \u201cportion of US production attributable to manufacturing has steadily declined since 1965.\u201d The trend in US manufacturing is now upward. An ESA report optimistically points out that between 2009 and 2013, 75% of research and development spending, 52% of exports, and 43% of foreign direct investment have been generated by the manufacturing sector. Coal manufacturing was the largest contributor to that, racked up more than $370 bn in shipments and more than $70bn in exports. Other significant contributions to America\u2019s manufacturing portfolio during that period included chemicals, primary metals, machinery and food. It helps America\u2019s position that its largest rival, China, is slowing down, with manufacturing becoming more expensive there. According to a report from Bloomberg Businessweek in October, wages in China\u2019s Yangtze delta had risen from 82 cents an hour in 2001 to about $5 per hour this year. Oil prices have also risen since 2001, from $20 to about $80 a barrel, making manufacturing in China that much less attractive. A recent Wall Street Journal article suggests that in the US, stable wages, competitive energy prices and the desire to shorten supply chains is causing many American companies to consider putting \u201cMade in USA\u201d stickers on products.",

When the company published the statement officially on Tuesday morning, it showed operating profit down 7% in the final three months of 2014.

      "body": "<p>Co-operative Bank is to stop lending to companies involved in irresponsible gambling, payday lending and fracking, as well as those dodging corporate taxes, in a reaffirmation of its ethical credentials despite its controversial rescue by American hedge funds.</p> <p>In the fifth review of the bank\u2019s ethical policy since launching two decades ago, human rights again topped customers\u2019 concerns. But concern about international development and animal welfare slipped down the table, while more UK-focused issues moved up, along with worries about fracking and the environment. The bank\u2019s expanded ethical policy is based on responses from 74,000 customers and staff in what will be seen as a barometer of public opinion on key isues.</p> <p>Customers also want the bank to campaign more vigorously around social and economic issues, in a return to the type of action the bank took around landmines and cluster bombs in 2003.</p> <p>But the bank will not ban lending to all companies involved in gambling. Chief executive Niall Booker said the focus will be on companies that exploit vulnerable people, minors and addicts rather than those \u201cwho just want to have a flutter on the Grand National.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWhen it comes to companies that do not pay tax responsibly, there is going to be shades of grey.

      "bodyText": "Co-operative Bank is to stop lending to companies involved in irresponsible gambling, payday lending and fracking, as well as those dodging corporate taxes, in a reaffirmation of its ethical credentials despite its controversial rescue by American hedge funds. In the fifth review of the bank\u2019s ethical policy since launching two decades ago, human rights again topped customers\u2019 concerns. But concern about international development and animal welfare slipped down the table, while more UK-focused issues moved up, along with worries about fracking and the environment. The bank\u2019s expanded ethical policy is based on responses from 74,000 customers and staff in what will be seen as a barometer of public opinion on key isues. Customers also want the bank to campaign more vigorously around social and economic issues, in a return to the type of action the bank took around landmines and cluster bombs in 2003. But the bank will not ban lending to all companies involved in gambling. Chief executive Niall Booker said the focus will be on companies that exploit vulnerable people, minors and addicts rather than those \u201cwho just want to have a flutter on the Grand National.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen it comes to companies that do not pay tax responsibly, there is going to be shades of grey. We will be going through this on a case-by-case basis, looking at what is in the public domain and in a company\u2019s report and accounts.\u201d Booker said the bank has turned away business worth \u00a31.4bn since instituting its ethical policy in 1992, and that figure will grow as more companies are refused financing under the expanded policy. When it began surveying customers in June last year, questions were asked about fracking, mass surveillance and GM foods. But while fracking raises alarm among Co-operative Bank customers, GM foods were less of a concern and mass surveillance came in as a relatively low priority. The new policy follows deep concern about the bank\u2019s ability to describe itself as an ethical co-operative after the crisis in 2013 left the Co-operative Group of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest mutual \u2013 with a stake of just 20% in the bank it once owned outright. The bank has since largely withdrawn from lending to large companies, diminishing the influence of its ethical policy. But Booker said: \u201cWe have made it clear we are now in the SME space, but that still means companies we lend to have to go through our policy.\u201d In the poll, customers also made it clear that the bank\u2019s ethical policy should not just be about who it lends to, but also about behaving honestly and transparently with customers. Many loyal customers were disappointed when Co-operative Bank emerged as a major mis-seller of payment protection insurance. Unexpectedly high costs to compensate for PPI mis-selling were among a string of conduct issues that forced the bank to seek extra capital funding in March last year.

    "webTitle": "IMF cuts global economic growth forecasts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecasts for the global economy on the back of a slowdown in China, looming recession in Russia and continuing weakness in the eurozone. The Washington-based fund warns that the boost from lower oil prices is being outweighed by a host of negative factors and it now expects global growth to edge up only slightly from 3.3% last year to 3.5% this year. That is down from a 3.8% forecast for 2015 in its World Economic Outlook published in October. It forecasts growth picking up only slightly next year and cut its 2016 forecasts from 4% to 3.7%. The gloomier outlook comes as business people and world leaders gather in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos for this year\u2019s World Economic Forum meeting. The IMF has plenty for policymakers at the summit to consider, including pleas to boost growth with more infrastructure projects, keeping interest rates low to ward off deflation and making the most of cheaper oil to shake up energy subsidies. The US is the only major economy where the IMF has raised growth forecasts for the next two years. It sees a boost from lower oil prices and strong domestic demand helping the US economy to grow 3.6% this year, up markedly from a 3.1% forecast made in October. Worldwide, the net benefit of the \u201cplunge\u201d in oil prices, which have more than halved since last June, has been more than offset by adverse factors, the IMF said. It cites weaker prospects for China, Russia, the eurozone and Japan as well as a slowdown in some major oil exporters because of the sharp drop in crude prices. \u201cNew factors supporting growth \u2013 lower oil prices, but also depreciation of euro and yen \u2013 are more than offset by persistent negative forces, including the lingering legacies of the crisis and lower potential growth in many countries,\u201d says Olivier Blanchard, IMF director of research. \u201cThis makes for a complicated mosaic ... good news for oil importers, bad news for oil exporters. Good news for commodity importers, bad news for exporters. Continuing struggles for the countries which show scars of the crisis, and not so for others. Good news for countries more linked to the euro and the yen, bad news for those more linked to the dollar.\u201d The IMF left its UK forecasts largely the same, continuing to project growth of 2.7% this year. Chancellor George Osborne said: \u201cToday\u2019s IMF forecast shows that Britain is pulling ahead, while the global economy is being downgraded. There\u2019s confirmation that we grew faster than any other major economy last year, and we\u2019re set to grow faster this year. \u201cBut there are risks out there in the global economy and it\u2019s a timely reminder that we\u2019ve got to go on working through our long-term economic plan if we want to stay ahead.\u201d Britain is expected to lose its place as the fastest-growing major economy to the US this year, with UK growth forecast at 2.7% and the US at 3.6%. For the eurozone, the fund expects a drag from weaker investment prospects, particularly thanks to a knock-on effect on exporters from an emerging markets slowdown. That is predicted to offset support from lower oil prices, the recent euro depreciation, an easing in austerity programmes and more monetary policy support, which many economists expect to be unveiled this week after the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) latest meeting. The IMF, which has repeatedly urged the ECB to consider quantitative easing in the face of worryingly low inflation, again flags the threat of deflation in its latest update and appears to rebuke the slow reaction from policymakers. Highlighting the currency bloc\u2019s prospects among key risks to the outlook, the IMF report says: \u201cIn the euro area, inflation has declined further, and adverse shocks \u2013 domestic or external \u2013 could lead to persistently lower inflation or price declines, as monetary policy remains slow to respond.\u201d The fund predicts eurozone growth of 1.2% this year, down from 1.3% in October. It has also cut its 2016 forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%. Forecasts have also been cut for emerging and developing economies based on three factors: lower growth in China; a \u201cmuch weaker outlook in Russia\u201d; and pressure on oil exporters from lower oil prices. In China, growth is now expected to come in below 7% this year after 7.4% in 2014. The IMF cut its 2015 forecast to 6.8% from 7.1% and it cut its 2016 forecast to 6.3% from 6.8%. It warns the lower growth is already affecting the rest of Asia. Russia is now viewed as being in outright recession this year, as falling oil prices and sanctions imposed by western governments take their toll. The sharp downgrade in the IMF\u2019s outlook to a 3% contraction in 2015 from modest growth of 0.5% forecast back in October, follows official figures showing the Russian economy contracted for the first time in five years in November. Lower oil prices have prompted the fund to cut its outlook for big oil exporters, including Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. But it says the fall in the oil price, which for Brent crude is now below $50 per barrel, also presents opportunities to reform energy subsidies and taxes in both oil exporters and importers. \u201cIn oil importers, the saving from the removal of general energy subsidies should be used toward more targeted transfers, to lower budget deficits where relevant, and to increase public infrastructure if conditions are right,\u201d the IMF says in its update.",
