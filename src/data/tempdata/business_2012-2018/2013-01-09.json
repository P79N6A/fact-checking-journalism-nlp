      "bodyText": "Sainsbury's, Britain's third largest supermarket, has boasted it will emerge from the Christmas trading season as the \"clear winner\" even though its growth slowed during the festive selling frenzy. The company unveiled its 32nd consecutive quarter of underlying sales growth as it posted a 0.9% growth in sales for stores open more than a year, excluding fuel. However, there was evidence of a frugal Christmas spirit within the figures as the chain revealed that cheaper own-brand products had grown in popularity. The performance for the 14 weeks to 5 January also represented a dip on the previous quarter, which saw growth of 1.9%. The chief executive, Justin King, said: \"We are very content with 0.9%. When the reporting season is over we'll emerge clearly as the winner.\" Sainsbury's figures are far better than those of rival Morrisons, which was hit by its lack of a home delivery service and limited number of convenience stores, suffering a 2.5% drop in its festive sales. King said that Sainsbury's slowing growth was explained partly by tough comparisons with a strong Christmas last year. He added: \"Tesco had a very significant decline in 2011. It sounds like there is some positive response this year. For Morrisons it is the opposite.\" Figures from market researchers Kantar Worldpanel revealed that Sainsbury's was the only big player that managed to boost market share compared with the previous year, inching up by 0.1% to 17.1%. It is, however, still trailing Tesco, which dominates the field with 30.5% of the market. Despite King's bullish outlook, Sainsbury's admitted that its underlying sales growth slipped to 0.4% once the impact of store extensions was stripped out, while the figures were boosted by price inflation running at 3%. It indicates that Sainsbury's saw a decline in the volume of goods sold as shoppers stuck to frugal budgets because their disposable income remains under pressure. The supermarket said shoppers were also cutting their weekly spend by switching to its cheaper own-label products from more expensive international brands. King dismissed speculation he may be looking to move on after nine years leading the grocer, stating that he saw himself remaining at Sainsbury's \"for the long term\". He added: \"The week before Christmas was our strongest trading week ever, with customer transactions exceeding 27m. We saw a record-breaking \u00a316m of sales in one hour between 12pm and 1pm on Sunday 23 December and experienced our best ever Christmas Eve, at both our supermarket and convenience stores, with over \u00a3100m of sales.\" . Britain's major grocers are finding the going tough, despite their focus on essential goods, as cash-strapped shoppers spend less and switch to low-cost discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl or look for luxury at the likes of Waitrose. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said Sainsbury's had \"thrown down the gauntlet to Tesco\" ahead of the trading update from Britain's biggest retailer on Thursday. \"Record customer visitors in the lead-up to Christmas were accompanied by strong double-digit percentage growth in both the convenience and online channels, where the company is already well established,\" said Hunter. \"On the downside, Tesco's determination to bounce back is palpable \u2013 if yet unproven \u2013 whilst the company has suffered a slight downturn compared to the Olympics-led previous quarter. The quest for the cost-conscious consumer remains intense, although at the current time Sainsbury's is holding its own.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 index reached its highest level since before the 2008 banking crisis on Wednesday, boosted by renewed optimism about the global economy. After two days of mild declines the January stock market rally resumed with the FTSE 100 rising 45.02 points to 6098.6, having earlier hit a high of 6112. That marked its highest close since 22 May 2008, well before the collapse of Lehman Brothers helped fuel the worldwide financial crisis. Banks led the way higher, despite executives from UBS telling MPs that the institutions were too arrogant and needed to make sweeping changes in the wake of the Libor-fixing scandal. Ironically, another part of UBS was behind much of the rise in UK banking shares, after its analysts issued a positive note on the sector in the wake of last week's relaxation of capital requirements by the Basel committee, which regulates the global banking industry. Lloyds Banking Group was the leading FTSE 100 riser, up 2.51p to 53.37p as UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy, while Barclays was 7.55p better at 294.75p and Royal Bank of Scotland rose 12.9p to 349.9p. Investors shunned safe sectors and piled into riskier assets such as mining shares, after US aluminium giant Alcoa unveiled better-than-expected fourth quarter revenues and forecast growing demand for commodities in 2013. The positive start to the US reporting season helped give the Dow Jones Industrial Average index a lift in early trading, as did talk that former Citigroup executive Jack Lew was in line to become the new US Treasury secretary.

    "webTitle": "Jessops goes into administration, putting 2,000 jobs at risk", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Up to 2,000 jobs are at risk at the troubled high-street camera chain Jessops after it became the latest high-profile victim of the prolonged economic downturn and collapsed into administration on Wednesday. The administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers immediately attempted to find a buyer for the 192 stores but admitted that at least some would close, adding to a string of closures last year following the failure of high street names including Comet, JJB Sports, Game, Peacocks and Blacks Leisure. Jessops has been hit by changes in the way people buy cameras and the growing use of smartphones to take pictures. Shoppers with Jessops gift vouchers will not be able to spend them, according to the administrators, although that decision might be reviewed in future. Returned goods will also not be accepted. Rob Hunt, joint administrator and partner at PwC, said Jessops had called in the accountants after last-ditch talks on financial support for the business between directors, funders and key suppliers had ended in \"irreconcilable differences\". A decision on store closures is expected to be taken within a matter of days and Eddie Williams, the joint administrator, said the number would depend on support from suppliers. \"If we don't have their support the number of closures will be significantly higher,\" he said. PwC said Jessops had suffered as British shoppers remained cautious amid the economic troubles while the chain's core camera market was in decline. However, the accountant is hopeful of finding a buyer as it had already had expressions of interest and Jessops had \"a well-known brand, strong reputation for service and a significant national footprint\". But experts said PwC would struggle to find a buyer for the business and one of its few hopes was that a major camera supplier would back a management team to run a much smaller chain selling high-spec cameras which are not easily sold online. Jessops traces it roots back to a chemist's store opened in Leicester 130 years ago. In 1935 Frank Jessop transformed it into a photography shop, and in the early days was mainly involved in hiring and selling 16mm cine films. The company quickly grew under the leadership of Jessop's son, Alan Jessop, who transformed it into a cut-price retailer of photographic equipment. By the 1970s, it had outgrown its premises and moved to a new 20,000 sq ft site on Hinckley Road in Leicester, which was named as the largest photography store in the world by Guinness World Records. The shop later closed in 2008. A second store followed in the early 1980s in London and as personal cameras became more popular and affordable, the firm expanded to more than 50 shops. The firm ceased to be a family-run business in 1996 after Alan Jessop retired, and it was sold in a management buyout. In 2002, Dutch bank ABN Amro's venture capital arm bought Jessops for \u00a3116 million. But by the middle of the decade, the company began to struggle to compete when other high street and internet competitors entered the market. Jessops managed to avoid administration in 2009 in a deal with HSBC, which became its largest shareholder. The company has debts of \u00a380m, nearly \u00a330m of which is held by HSBC. Jessops is able to continue to trade while PwC seeks a buyer as HSBC extended funds, thought to be \u00a31.5m, to help pay employees' salaries for January. The bank now owns 47% after agreeing to write off \u00a334m of debt, with another 33% of the shares owned by the firm's pension fund and the remaining 20% held by an employee benefit trust. The 33% stake owned by the pension fund is effectly controlled by the government-based rescue scheme, the Pension Protection Fund, which took the shares in return for taking on the final salary pension scheme in 2009. The stake owned by PPF = which guarantees to pay 90% of accrued benefits to employees up to a \u00a329,000 ceiling, in 2009 - is now effectively worthless. The decision by HSBC to step in last time prompted the then chief executive, Trevor Moore, to take comfort. \"I don't think it gets much more secure than being 47% owned by HSBC. They are committed to a long-term plan for Jessops \u2013 it is not about a quick turnaround or spin-out,\" Moore said at the time. While the firm achieved sales of \u00a3236m in the year to December 2012 it has not managed to trade profitably in any year since HSBC took its stake and it reported a \u00a3909,000 loss in its last published accounts for the year to 1 January 2012. The group's woes were compounded last year when Moore quit to join HMV as its chief executive, while chairman, David Adams, also left. The company did not appoint a replacement for Moore, instead hiring Martyn Everett as chairman and promoting Neil Old to lead the business as chief operating officer. The British high street is increasingly feeling the pinch. In October, research conducted by PwC and the Local Data Company found retail chains were accelerating store closures with an average of 20 stores a day shutting in the first six months of 2012. A net total of 953 stores (openings minus closures) closed in the first six months of the year, compared with 174 in the whole of 2011, the report found.",

Returned goods will also not be accepted.</p> <p>Rob Hunt, joint administrator and partner at PwC, said Jessops had called in the accountants after last-ditch talks on financial support for the business between directors, funders and key suppliers had ended in \"irreconcilable differences\".</p> <p>A decision on store closures is expected to be taken within a matter of days and Eddie Williams, the joint administrator, said the number would depend on support from suppliers. \"If we don't have their support the number of closures will be significantly higher,\" he said.</p> <p>PwC said Jessops had suffered as British shoppers remained cautious amid the economic troubles while the chain's core camera market was in decline.</p> <p>However, the accountant is hopeful of finding a buyer as it had already had expressions of interest and Jessops had \"a well-known brand, strong reputation for service and a significant national footprint\".</p> <p>But experts said PwC would struggle to find a buyer for the business and one of its few hopes was that a major camera supplier would back a management team to run a much smaller chain selling high-spec cameras which are not easily sold online.</p> <p>Jessops traces it roots back to a chemist's store opened in Leicester 130 years ago. In 1935 Frank Jessop transformed it into a photography shop, and in the early days was mainly involved in hiring and selling 16mm cine films.</p> <p>The company quickly grew under the leadership of Jessop's son, Alan Jessop, who transformed it into a cut-price retailer of photographic equipment. By the 1970s, it had outgrown its premises and moved to a new 20,000 sq ft site on Hinckley Road in Leicester, which was named as the largest photography store in the world by Guinness World Records. The shop later closed in 2008.</p> <p>A second store followed in the early 1980s in London and as personal cameras became more popular and affordable, the firm expanded to more than 50 shops.</p> <p>The firm ceased to be a family-run business in 1996 after Alan Jessop retired, and it was sold in a management buyout. In 2002, Dutch bank ABN Amro's venture capital arm bought Jessops for \u00a3116 million.</p> <p>But by the middle of the decade, the company began to struggle to compete when other high street and internet competitors entered the market.</p> <p>Jessops managed to avoid administration in 2009 in a deal with HSBC, which became its largest shareholder. The company has debts of \u00a380m, nearly \u00a330m of which is held by HSBC. Jessops is able to continue to trade while PwC seeks a buyer as HSBC extended funds, thought to be \u00a31.5m, to help pay employees' salaries for January.</p> <p>The bank now owns 47% after agreeing to write off \u00a334m of debt, with another 33% of the shares owned by the firm's pension fund and the remaining 20% held by an employee benefit trust. The 33% stake owned by the pension fund is effectly controlled by the government-based rescue scheme, the Pension Protection Fund, which took the shares in return for taking on the final salary pension scheme in 2009. The stake owned by PPF = which guarantees to pay 90% of accrued benefits to employees up to a \u00a329,000 ceiling, in 2009 - is now effectively worthless.</p> <p>The decision by HSBC to step in last time prompted the then chief executive, Trevor Moore, to take comfort. \"I don't think it gets much more secure than being 47% owned by HSBC. They are committed to a long-term plan for Jessops \u2013 it is not about a quick turnaround or spin-out,\" Moore said at the time.</p> <p>While the firm achieved sales of \u00a3236m in the year to December 2012 it has not managed to trade profitably in any year since HSBC took its stake and it reported a \u00a3909,000 loss in its last published accounts for the year to 1 January 2012.</p> <p>The group's woes were compounded last year when Moore quit to join HMV as its chief executive, while chairman, David Adams, also left. The company did not appoint a replacement for Moore, instead hiring Martyn Everett as chairman and promoting Neil Old to lead the business as chief operating officer.</p> <p>The British high street is increasingly feeling the pinch. In October, research conducted by PwC and the Local Data Company found retail chains were accelerating store closures with an average of 20 stores a day shutting in the first six months of 2012. A net total of 953 stores (openings minus closures) closed in the first six months of the year, compared with 174 in the whole of 2011, the report found.</p>",

      "bodyText": "OK, time to wrap things up. Big day tomorrow, with the European Central Bank and the Bank of England both holding their monthly meetings. We're not expecting a rate cut, but Mario Draghi's comments at the ECB press conference will be fascinating (hopefully). Here's a particularly brisk closing summary \u2022 Cyprus's hopes of receiving a bailout are up in the air, with German politicians threatening to block an aid package. Angela Merkel said Cyprus must drop its opposition to state privatisations (see 1.38pm), while other MPs said the Bundestag would not approve a deal (see 2.26pm). \u2022 Ireland's chances of returning to the financial markets have risen. Analysts hailed a bond sale yesterday as a key development (see 8.39am), while another sale is due next week (see 11.59am) \u2022 Britain was warned against risking its future in the European Union. Irish PM Enda Kenny said the UK can't renegotiate the terms of EU membership (see 3.04pm), while a US official said America wanted a 'strong Europe, with Britain inside (see 6.14pm). \u2022 Elsewhere... Herman Van Rompuy claimed the worst of the eurozone crisis is behind us (see 2.53pm), while German industrial orders (11.15am) and UK trade data (10.02am) was disappointing, and the FTSE 100 hit its highest level since 2008 (see 3.24pm). Until tomorrow, goodnight.... In other news, the US has now weighed in over Britain's future in Europe, urging the UK government not to damage its relations in the EU. Philip Gordon, US assistant secretary for European affairs, told reporters, that: We have a growing relationship with the EU as an institution, which has an increasing voice in the world, and we want to see a strong British voice in that EU That is in America\u2019s interests. We welcome an outward-looking EU with Britain in it. So, more pressure on David Cameron not to flirt with a Brexit, following the Irish PM's comments today (see 3.04pm). And he's not even given his speech on Europe yet! Some late news out of Italy -- Mario Monti has been discussing the upcoming general election, and fired a few barbs at Silvio Berlusconi. Linkiesta's Fab Goria has the quotes: The looming crisis over the Cyprus bailout (see 1.38pm) is almost a fitting end to what will be a calamitous term in office for outgoing president Demetris Christofias, says our Athens correspondent Helena Smith. Helena writes: There is no love lost between Christofias and the EU but the German chancellor Angela Merkel's dark insinuations that there will be no money until the communist president leaves will end the leader's term in power on an even more sour note. Regular readers will recall that Christofias chose to end Cyprus\u2019 stint at the helm of the rotating EU presidency with a rousing speech on why the bloc wasn't working. More than ever, he said, the European Union was in urgent need of re-embracing its founding principle of \"solidarity.\" Ironically, it now seems that solidarity is the last thing EU partners are willing to show the leader who has repeatedly denounced the onerous terms and conditions attached to rescue funds from the EU, ECB and IMF. Helena adds: As we reported last month even Christofias' own children, Christos and Christina, who are members of their father\u2019s AKEL party, have been spotted participating in mass demonstrations against the gruelling austerity measures demanded by international creditors in return for financial support. Europe's financial markets closed higher, although the Footsie couldn't quite cling onto the 6100 mark. Here's the closing prices: FTSE 100: up 45 points at 6098, +0.75% German DAX: up 24 points at 7720, +0.3% French CAC: up 11 points at 3717, +0.31% Spanish IBEX: up 153 points at 8606. +1.8% FTSE MIB: up 375 points at 17326, + 2.2% As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets commented: Once again equity markets have put aside concerns about the bleak economic outlook Looking back at Cyprus, Malta's prime minister backed Angela Merkel over her insistence that any bailout must be tied to state asset sales. Lawrence Gonzi told this afternoon's press conference in Berlin that: Privatisations were one of the key elements that allowed Malta to move forwards. Gonzi also paid tribute to Angela Merkel, saying that her policies were 'right in curbing the crisis'. The FTSE 100 just burst through the 6100 point mark to hit its highest level since May 2008, as stock markets on both side of the Atlantic rally. FTSE 100: up 58 points at 6112, +0.97% German DAX: up 26 points at 7722, +0.34% French CAC: up 11 points at 3714, +0.32% Dow Jones Industrial Average: up 77 points at 13406, +0.58% Decent financial results from aluminum producer Alcoa, marking the start of this reporting season, are one factor. Another reason may be the news that Barack Obama is poised to nominate Jack Lew as his new Treasury secretary. Lew is the current White House chief of staff, and a former executive at Citigroup. Lew's time at Citi is potentially controversial, as he ran a proprietary trading arm (ie, using Citi's own funds not its clients) which bet on the US housing market collapsing. Trader and blogger iFinansakrobat flags up the details here: Meet the hedge fund manager that could be the next Treasury Secretary of the US. Lew could be popular pick with the City (which isn't necessarily a good thing for everyone else...) Enda Kenny also confirmed Dublin's opposition to Britain's plan to renegotiate a deal with the EU, saying there was no chance of reopening treaties at this time. Herman Van Rompuy also weighed in, saying he hoped the UK would remain an \"active, full and leading\" member of the EU. And with the 40th anniversary of Britain and the Republic of Ireland joining the single market imminent, Van Rompuy joked that \"life begins at 40\". In Dublin, European Council president Herman van Rompuy is holding a press conference with the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, to mark the start of Ireland's six-month presidency of the EU. Van Rompuy began by declaring that 2012 had been \"a turning point\" in the crisis, and that the worst of the turmoil was behind Europe. Van Rompuy added that the motto of the Irish presidency was \"stability, jobs and growth\" - concepts that \"we are all working for\". On the details... Van Rompuy said he hoped to get a deal on the EU budget in February, and was optimistic about his chances. You may remember that an EU summit broke up without any agreement last November). Enda Kenny said his priority was to get a better deal for Ireland over the cost of its 2010 bank rescue (see 9.38am for details). Van Rompuy was optimistic (although he's not actually involved), as Tony Connelly of RTE News reports: More to follow... One of Angela Merkel's coalition partners has also expressed opposition to a Cyprus bailout. Rainer Br\u00fcderle of the Free Democrats (FDP) party told the Bild newspaper that many German MPs are unwilling to support an aid package. Br\u00fcderle explained that there are concerns that a deal would effectively benefit Russian oligarchs who have large deposits in Cypriot banks. Br\u00fcderle said: There are many question marks regarding Cyprus. On the basis of what we know so far I do not see a majority [of MPs voting] for financial aid, If the impression exists that German taxpayers are to be liable for dirty money, the aid would not be manageable or acceptable. With Merkel also taking a tough stance (see 1.38pm), it's clear that Cyprus's bailout - which has been under discussion for months - is some way from completion. Angela Merkel has just given a clear signal that Cyprus will not get its bailout until it drops its opposition to wide-ranging economic reforms. During a press conference in Berlin, the German chancellor insisted the aid deal would not be completed without Nicosia agreeing to a programme including privatising some state-controlled companies. Merkel said (via Reuters): We agree it is important that the troika should talk with Cyprus and that there can be no special conditions for Cyprus because we have common rules in Europe We are far from the end of the talks. The comments follow reports (see 8.54am) that the Cypriot loan deal will be delayed until communist President Dimitris Christofias has left office, in February (suggesting a deal might not come until March). If true, expect more reports about Cyprus running short of cash. Last month, government officials denied claims that the country was struggling to fund wage payments to civil servants. In the House of Commons, David Cameron has reiterated that he will call for a change in Britain's relationship with Europe, in his much-anticipated speech on Europe due this month. The prime minister told MPs that: There are changes that would be good for the EU and good for Britain. As flagged up yesterday, Ireland is concerned about Britain's desire for a new deal with Europe, calling it a bigger risk than a Greek euro-exit. And as Europe editor Ian Traynor reported last night, there is concern and confusion in Brussels over Cameron's plans: My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering prime minister's questions, and other political events, in his liveblog: PMQs and release of the coalition's pledge audit: Politics live blog Encouraging signs for Italy -- its two-year bonds have strengthened to their highest level in 27 months. Ireland's debt management agency has declared that it will \"step up its re-engagement with the market during 2013\", following yesterday's successful \u20ac2.5bn bond sale (see opening post). John Corrigan, head of the National Treasury Management Agency, said in a statement that Ireland is pressing on with plans to exit its bailout this year, starting with a sale of short-term bonds on 17 January. Corrigan sounds determined to capitalise on the success of yesterday's sale, which will help Ireland to meet an \u20ac11.9bn bond redemption in January 2014. Achieving a quarter of our funding plan for 2013 with yesterday\u2019s bond sale is a very encouraging start to the year. The progressive reduction of the January 2014 \u201cfunding cliff\u201d has been viewed positively by the investment community and, allied to the fact that it demonstrates that we can raise funds in the market, has been a contributory factor to the fall in Irish bond yields. The full statement is online here. German industrial output, the big economic news of the day, has just been published - and it's not as strong as economists had expected. Industrial output in the eurozone's largest economy inched up by 0.2%, with increased demand for equipment, or capital goods (+1.4%) making up for a drop in orders for consumer goods (-2.2%). Analysts had expected a 1% month-on-month increase. On an annual basis, German industrial output in October and November was 3% lower than a year ago - showing the impact of the crisis. Disappointing economic news from Greece - industrial production fell by 2.9% in November, compared to the previous year. That's a reversal from October, when there was an encouraging 3.5% year-on-year rise. November's fall was driven by a 13% drop in electricity production. UK trade data for November was just released, and paints a mixed picture of the state of the UK economy. Britain's deficit in goods trade with the rest of the world narrowed (to \u00a39.16bn, from nearly \u00a39.5bn in October), but not as much as forecast. Exports to the EU rose (by \u00a31.1bn) but those to the rest of the world fell slightly \u2013 which doesn't suggest the UK economy is rebalancing away from Europe. Chuck in Britain's surplus in services, and the total trade gap comes in at -\u00a33.466bn - an improvement on October's -\u00a33.729n. Over the last year, though, it has fluctuated with little clear improvement. City analysts aren't too impressed. Here's some early reaction: Over in Dublin, Irish ministers have been criticising Brussels for the way that the country's bailout was handled. Communications minister Pat Rabbitte told reporters that the deal was unfair (Ireland issued \"promissory notes\", which must be repaid at high interest rates for the next decade). He accused the European Central Bank of \"imposing\" unfairly tough conditions on Ireland, even though the country was arguably 'taking one for the team' by taking its toxic bank debts onto the public books. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports: Last week, Rabbitte was in hot water after seeming to say that Ireland should just refuse to repay the promissory notes (this year's bill is due in March). Yesterday's eurozone unemployment data makes the front page of City AM, the London financial newspaper: Cyprus's bailout is in trouble, according to two German newspapers this morning. Handelsblatt is reporting that eurozone finance ministers are refusing to sign off the deal until elections have taken place next month, at which point the communist president, Demetris Christofias, will have departed. One source told Handelsblatt: The incumbent Christofias categorically rejects the sale of state companies. Without privatisation revenues the country cannot be reformed. Negotiations over Cyprus's aid package, which could total \u20ac17.5bn, have been grinding on for months. Christofias's reluctance to agree to deep economic reforms are one hurdle. Another, though, is the fact that much of the money will be used to recapitalise Cypriot banks - who are heavy with funds from Russia. Germany is concerned that much of the money comes from criminal sources. Germany's Social Democratic party now says it cannot support a Cyprus rescue deal until this is addressed. SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel told Sueddeutsche Zeitung that: As matters stand, I cannot imagine that German taxpayers save Cypriot banks whose business model is based on facilitating tax evasion. We should get more news from Ireland today, as a journalists' trip to mark the beginning of its EU presidency is continuing. It sounds as if those attending enjoyed a lively evening.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events across the world economy. Ireland is in focus this morning, after holding a rather successful debt action yesterday. The Dublin government raised \u20ac2.5bn \u2013 a quarter of its total requirements for 2013 \u2013 with no shortage of willing buyers (total bids for the five-year bonds came to \u20ac7bn). The interest rate on the sale (an average yield of just 3.32%), was also encouraging. Ireland, often dubbed the \"poster-child\" for austerity, may well be on track to exit its IMF-EU bailout this year, analysts believe. As Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research puts it: Arguably it was one of the most oversubscribed and successful deals since the Greek ones in 2010\u2026 And Owen Callan of Danske Bank, who helped conduct the sale, said it \"bodes well for the future\", adding: It shows that investors very much believe in the Irish recovery story. Europe could certainly use some good news, following yesterday's bleak unemployment data (the eurozone jobless rate hit 11.8%). Ireland, though, remains dogged by the legacy of its banking crisis - the \"promissory notes\" issued to fund the nationalisation of Anglo Irish bank remain desperately costly. Dublin really needs to renegotiate a better deal out of Brussels - arguably while it has the six-month EU presidency. As analyst Louise Cooper of CooperCity explains: It is estimated that [Irish] debt to GDP will be over 120% this year, above the IMF's optimistic sustainable level. After so much work to regain its financial reputation, Ireland is unlikely to want to default on its financial promises like Greece. Enda Kenny is instead arguing for part mutualisation - for the European Union to take on repayment of the debt specifically created in saving the Irish banking industry. This is a pretty big step for Europe. However after the big Irish bond rally, markets are assuming that some kind of deal will be done - that the politicians will eventually come to the rescue. One to watch, as they say. As usual, I'll be tracking the latest developments in the euro crisis and beyond through the day.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/09/sainsburys-tesco-strong-christmas-sales\" title=\"\">A record-breaking Christmas</a>? That was Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King's boast this morning and, if your taste is old-fashioned measures of sales, it's accurate. There was a modest gain in market share and like-for-like sales rose by 0.9% excluding fuel. But it's hardly a moment to crack open the champagne, or even the prosecco. On most measures, Sainsbury's is merely demonstrating the struggle in supermarket-land to generate meaningful growth.</p> <p>Take that 0.9% like-for-like sales figure. It includes extensions to stores, which is really a distortion of the \"like-for-like\" principle. Ignoring the extension effect, Sainsbury's like-for-like sales growth is more like 0.4%. Then remember that the numbers include price inflation, currently running at just under 3% at Sainsbury's. So, in terms of the volume of goods shifted, the group looks to be down by about 2.5% on a comparable basis if one ignores the \"mix\" effect of punters trading down to cheaper products.</p> <p>And, since more of Sainsbury's business is now conducted via home delivery and in convenience stores, the fall in like-for-like volumes in traditional supermarkets, or the core estate, is estimated by Investec's analyst Dave McCarthy to be 3%-5%. That's uncomfortable since online shopping, at delivery charges of only a fiver, is clearly less profitable than trade conducted in supermarkets.</p> <p>Time for head the hills? Not quite since it would be silly either to overstate the effect of online shopping or pretend that it doesn't exist. About 90% of Sainsbury's custom is still in its old-style supermarkets.

      "bodyText": "A record-breaking Christmas? That was Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King's boast this morning and, if your taste is old-fashioned measures of sales, it's accurate. There was a modest gain in market share and like-for-like sales rose by 0.9% excluding fuel. But it's hardly a moment to crack open the champagne, or even the prosecco. On most measures, Sainsbury's is merely demonstrating the struggle in supermarket-land to generate meaningful growth. Take that 0.9% like-for-like sales figure. It includes extensions to stores, which is really a distortion of the \"like-for-like\" principle. Ignoring the extension effect, Sainsbury's like-for-like sales growth is more like 0.4%. Then remember that the numbers include price inflation, currently running at just under 3% at Sainsbury's. So, in terms of the volume of goods shifted, the group looks to be down by about 2.5% on a comparable basis if one ignores the \"mix\" effect of punters trading down to cheaper products. And, since more of Sainsbury's business is now conducted via home delivery and in convenience stores, the fall in like-for-like volumes in traditional supermarkets, or the core estate, is estimated by Investec's analyst Dave McCarthy to be 3%-5%. That's uncomfortable since online shopping, at delivery charges of only a fiver, is clearly less profitable than trade conducted in supermarkets. Time for head the hills? Not quite since it would be silly either to overstate the effect of online shopping or pretend that it doesn't exist. About 90% of Sainsbury's custom is still in its old-style supermarkets. And Sainsbury's clearly has to play the online game since there is demand for it; you'd rather be in its shoes than those of Morrisons, now confronting the consequences of its decade-old aversion to the web. Sainsbury's can also deploy a few self-help tactics. It removes about \u00a3100m of costs a year and is successfully pushing shoppers towards own-label goods, including champagne at Christmas.

      "bodyText": "Pub companies have come under pressure following the UK government's plans to address what it sees as unfair practices in the industry. Vince Cable unveiled new rules for the beer tie, which forces tenanted pubs to buy their supplies from the companies who run their leases, as well as other proposals to help landlords. The news has sent Enterprise Inns down 3.35p to 99.75p, while Punch Taverns has fallen 0.5p at 11p. Meanwhile Punch has put 65 pubs up sale as part of its long term disposal programme. It wants to sell around 400 non-core premises this year, as it moves to cut its \u00a32.1bn debt. Elsewhere Restaurant Group, owner of the Garfunkel's and Frankie &amp; Benny's chains, reported a strong finish to the year, with like for like sales up 4.5% for the year.
