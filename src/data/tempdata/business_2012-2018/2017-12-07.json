      "bodyText": "Time to recap: It\u2019s been another riproaring day for bitcoin, as the cryprocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Starting the day at $13,600, bitcoin smashed through $14,000 for the first time ever in early European trading. By 9am in New York, it was surging through $15,000. In increasing frenzied trading, bitcoin then hit $19,000 on the coindesk exchange (although Reuters never clocked it above $15,995). It then subsided, as bitcoin exchanges admitted they were struggling to keep up with the huge trading volumes. At today\u2019s prices, the total value of every bitcoin in the world is roughly equal to the market capitalisation of credit card firm Visa. The surge came despite fresh warnings that bitcoin could be a bubble. Sir Howard Davies, chair of Royal Bank of Scotland, said top central banks should cite Dante\u2019s famous warning from the gates of hell - \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019. In the last 12 months, bitcoin has now gained around 2,000%. It\u2019s gone from $11,000 to over $15,000 this week alone, amid signs that retail investors are piling in. Bitcoin is due to enter the mainstream next week, when clearing houses begin offering futures trading. But, several US banks are reluctant to take part, according to the Wall Street Journal. Analysts are split over whether futures trading will bring some calm to bitcoin. It could push the price down, as investors will be able to bet on a crash. But if money keeps pouring in, the price could head higher.... But investors were also reminded of the dangers of cybercrime, as a bitcoin wallet firm revealed it had been hacked. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Wall Street has just closed for the day, with small gains on the main indices. The Dow gained 70 points, or 0.3% - a performance matched by the S&amp;P 500. The tech-focused Nasdaq rose by 0.5%, partly thanks to Alphabet (Google) and Facebook. Mark Hamrick,Washington bureau chief for Bankrate.com, reports that some investors aren\u2019t happy about missing out on bitcoin: Two major US banks have decided not to offer bitcoin futures trading when it launches this weekend. That follows concerns (covered in this blog earlier today) that the systems aren\u2019t robust enough. That\u2019s according to the Wall Street Journal, which reports: Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Inc. are telling customers that they won\u2019t offer them access to the first bitcoin futures market when it goes live on Sunday, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the largest U.S. futures broker, will offer access but only for certain customers, a person familiar with the situation said. ABN Amro Group will be handling trades for \u201ca small selected group of professional clients,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Dutch bank said in an e-mail. Morgan Stanley and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA are still evaluating their approach to bitcoin futures, other people said Thursday. CNN\u2019s Seth Fiegerman joined the bitcoin party last week, when he invested $100 in the digital currency. He\u2019s now written a handy explainer - here\u2019s a flavour: Bitcoin exchanges have a checkered history. Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack. Today, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms. Square (SQ), the payments service, is also rolling out a bitcoin product. There are also bitcoin ATMs in scattered bodegas and convenience stores around the country, through companies like Coinsource. The ATMs let you exchange bitcoin for cash, or vice versa by scanning a QR code from the digital wallet application on your phone. With Coinbase, you must first give the app permission to connect to your bank account. As with other stock trading applications, you pay a small fee for each transaction, buying and selling. But the transaction can take significantly longer. My original $100 bitcoin purchase won\u2019t officially be completed on Coinbase until Friday, more than a week after the transaction. The price I bought it at remains the same, but I won\u2019t be able to sell at the earliest until Friday. If the price plummets before then, I\u2019m out of luck. However, Mrs Fiegerman isn\u2019t impressed (and this is after the price went up!) City investor Justin Urquhart Stewart reports that his cabbie is interested in bitcoin.... Borrowing money to buy into a rising asset... that\u2019s one of the classic signs of a bubble, associated with the dreaded Minsky Moment (when prices suddenly collapse as speculators can\u2019t service their loans) Right now, bitcoin is trading at $15,300, according to the \u2018spot price\u2019 on my Reuters terminal. That\u2019s a gain of 12% today, and up over 40% since the start of the week Earlier it jumped to the brink of $16,000 (Reuters\u2019 data shows) but was seen rather higher on some other exchanges. Some bitcoin exchanges are struggling to handle the interest today, it seems. Coinbase, the largest US bitcoin, blamed \u2018record high traffic\u2019 for technical problems: Bitcoin wallet provider Trezor had a similar story: This may not reassure critics who wonder how the bitcoin ecosystem will cope with the next price correction..... Ian Guider of Ireland\u2019s Sunday Business Post spies a bubble... Speaking of volatile trading, bitcoin prices on the coinbase exchange just rocketed towards $20,000. But it swiftly slumped back to less stratospheric levels. What wild times! The bitcoin price has been particularly volatile today, as it struck a series of new highs: It won\u2019t be easy to run a future market in such a volatile asset..... Economics professor Justin Wolfers has put his finger on the problem with bitcoin pricing - it\u2019s hard to bet against it today. The launch of bitcoin futures markets on Sunday night will be an important moment, says Neil Wilson of City firm ETX. But he doesn\u2019t agree that letting traders bet against bitcoin necessarily means its price will fall. Wilson explains: At least with regulated futures the market ought to behave more normally than it has done \u2013 notwithstanding some pretty major spasms in the market that are likely on Sunday night and Monday morning as the contracts launch - and this would be net bearish for Bitcoin overall as it will allow proper shorting and hedging strategies. At present the only way to short is to sell your bitcoin and exit the market, a bias that favours bulls. The ability to go short creates a new dynamic in the market and may result in a significant shock to prices. The problem is anyone shorting against this headwind of rapidly rising prices needs to be able to sweat out huge potential upside. As plenty before have noted, Bitcoin might keep rising longer than shorts can stay solvent.\u201d If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on Bitcoin\u2019s rally, and the concerns building about it..... Bitcoin has been likened to Dante\u2019s Inferno by the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland. As the digital currency surged above $15,000 on Thursday, Sir Howard Davies suggested it should carry a similarly apocalyptic warning for investors. Davies, a former head of the UK\u2019s top financial watchdog, called on the Bank of England and other authorities around the world to launch a coordinated warning against the digital currency. Bitcoin has increased in value by $3,500 in the space of a week, after surging more than 900% this year. It was trading at $15,300 at lunchtime on Thursday. \u201cPut up the sign from Dante\u2019s Inferno \u2013 \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019 \u2013 I think that\u2019s probably what\u2019s needed,\u201d he said speaking on Bloomberg TV, adding that the cryptocurrency appeared to be a \u201cfrothy investment bubble\u201d. Davies argued for Threadneedle Street to take action at the same time as the US Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the European Central Bank. \u201cCentral banks are very anxious about it [bitcoin],\u201d he said.... More here: Analyst Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that bitcoin usage isn\u2019t keeping pace with its price: A majority of City investors think that bitcoin is an unsustainable bubble. That\u2019s according to a survey of institutional investors, conducted by Natixis Investment Managers, which found: Institutional investors may believe bubbles have formed in both the bond (42%) and stock (30%) markets, but concerns for these traditional assets pale in comparison to the 64% who say there\u2019s a bubble in Bitcoins. Over on FT Alphaville, Izabella Kaminska has a fascinating theory to explain bitcoin\u2019s rise. In short, it\u2019s that certain investors have piled into bitcoin, driving its price every higher, because they plan to \u2018short\u2019 it next week. Shorting becomes a serious option once the CME clearing house launches its derivatives contracts next week. So if you\u2019ve invested the time and money to stock up on bitcoin this year, you could make immense profits if you short the cryptocurrency next week. She explains: Without the certainty of a properly regulated marketplace defending the futures side of the equation, a payoff cannot be guaranteed. It\u2019s why the arbitrage exists in the first place: the trade cannot be exercised elsewhere in the bitcoin ecosystem because the risk of counterparty default at the first sign of distress is far too great. You\u2019d win the trade, but you\u2019d probably lose the payout. If a regulated futures market takes that risk away, however, the trade becomes a no-brainer if not a mastermind opportunity. Which is arguably where we are now. This chart shows how the plan would play out: But.... such a plan could still go wrong. For example: The futures launch is suspended unexpectedly, perhaps due to regulatory concerns or industry pushback? The anticipated futures demand never arrives because the margin costs of holding open long positions proves to be too great and/or liquidity is so shoddy nobody can trade effectively. The cash settled return on the futures leg, won\u2019t necessarily be matched by the price achieved on the physical liquidation. More here: The smartest bitcoin trade in town? Wowzers! Bitcoin has now surged to $16,000 on one exchange: That means it\u2019s gained more than $3,000 since yesterday morning. In any bubble, there\u2019s a moment when new investors are lured in by reports of hefty profits, helping to drive the price higher and higher. Is that where we are now with bitcoin? And how much higher will it go? Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA predict a correction is looming.... The cryptocurrency has undoubtedly come on leaps and bounds this year but it\u2019s difficult to see anything move as Bitcoin has and not fear a devastating bubble bursting. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that Bitcoin has been making headlines over the last week or so, during which time it\u2019s risen another $5,000, or 50%. If speculation is playing as big a role in the latest moves as some expect, then very interesting times may lie ahead. Although as is always the case, this could rise a lot more before the bubble bursts. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: So, where are all these people who have made fortunes out of bitcoin? The Daily Telegraph have found one - and he\u2019s still just a teenager. They say: Eddy Zillan was 16 when he began investing in bitcoin, just two years later, the youthful investor estimates he has \u201cmade close to a million\u201d from trading in various cryptocurrency. The perspicacious Ohio teenager was an early adopter of the bubble and bust digital currency, investing in 2015 when bitcoin\u2019s price was as low as $214 following a prolonged bear market. \u201cI started off with $1,000 to play around with out of my savings,\u201d he told The Telegraph. \u201cI then acquired another $5,000 through my bar mitzvah money (in 2012). \u201cI then invested another $6,000 through money I earned and saved from working summer jobs.\u201d... Here\u2019s a useful non-technical explanation of bitcoin: Anyone who bought bitcoin two weeks ago (when it was trading at $8,000) has almost doubled their money. They won\u2019t give you that at your local bank! But, of course, that\u2019s exactly why some experts fear that a speculative bubble is building. Bitcoin buyers aren\u2019t heeding Sir Howard Davies\u2019s warning. The cryptocurrency just hit a new alltime high, at $15,200, as American traders arrive at their desks. Just in: The US jobs market remained strong last week. Just 236,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit during the seven days to 2nd December. That\u2019s down from 238,000 the previous week, and the third weekly decline in a row. Yann Quelenn of Swissbank believes bitcoin will keep climbing this month, perhaps even hitting $20,000 -- before suffering an abrupt reversal. Quelenn writes: Sheer greed is driving the cryptocurrency higher, perhaps to $20,000 per coin by Christmas. This would put Bitcoin\u2019s market cap above $300bn, one third that of Apple! Bitcoin is unique in history, true, but a correction will likely be very tough. Two Chicago exchanges, the CBOE and the CME, will soon launch trading of cryptocurrency futures. This signals an impending stampede of institutional investors \u2013 many speculators, some hedgers. Just watch the fireworks fly. Sir Howard Davies\u2019s hint that bitcoin is a hellish investment for the unwary is somewhat ironic, given the track record of the bank he chairs. Royal Bank of Scotland has been controlled by the UK taxpayer for nearly a decade, having been bailed out after nearly collapsing after the failure of Lehman Brothers. It has made a steady stream of losses ever since, and the British government is now planning to crystallise a \u00a326m loss when it sells its RBS shares over the next few years. Davies can\u2019t be blame for RBS\u2019s plight, as he only joined in 2015. But the legacy of the financial crisis is exactly why some people believe cryptocurrencies make a lots of sense. Workers at GE Power have just had a very nasty shock. The US company is axing 12,000 jobs across the globe in a cost-cutting drive. The move includes 1,100 workers at its UK operations, mainly in Stafford and Rugby. GE blamed falling demand for fossil fuel power plants, saying: \u201cTraditional power markets including gas and coal have softened\u201d. Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo!, is more optimistic about bitcoin\u2019s future. Yang reckons digital currencies can be a force for good in the long term. The key it to treat bitcoin as an actual currency, not an asset whose price has been driven up by speculation. As Yang put it to CNBC: \u201cBitcoin as a digital currency is not quite there yet. Personally, I am a believer in how digital currency can play a role in our society\u2026 but for now, it seems like it\u2019s more driven by the hype of investing and getting a return rather than using it as a transaction currency. The FT points out that Bitcoin has hit $15,000 on some crypto-exchanges. Look at that spread of prices, though! No wonder the US banks have concerns about bitcoin derivatives contracts hitting the markets...... Sir Howard Davies, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, has issued a dire warning against investing in bitcoin. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, as bitcoin headed towards $15,000, Davies warned that the digital currency looked like a \u201cfrothy investment bubble\u201d. He\u2019s concerned that bitcoin doesn\u2019t really fall under any one regulator\u2019s remit, meaning the adults in the room aren\u2019t warning of the risks. Davies says it\u2019s hard to see any \u2018rational reason\u2019 for bitcoin\u2019s recent surge: All the authorities can do is put up the sign from Dante\u2019s Inferno - \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019. That\u2019s what\u2019s needed, and it need to done by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank at the same time. So why aren\u2019t the world\u2019s top central bankers acting? Davies suspects they\u2019re worried about being seen as luddites if they criticise digital currencies, adding: The market is telling us something about the need for new faster payments systems. [But] I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s bitcoin in the long run. But should bitcoin actually be outlawed, as economist Joseph Stiglitz argues? No, replies Davies - if you ban bitcoin, other variants will simply take its place. Here\u2019s our story about the problems at NiceHash: The pound\u2019s volatility has hit its highest level in almost six months, as Brexit headines shunt sterling around: The old mantra Caveat Emptor goes without saying where bitcoin is concerned. Not only is its value uncertain (\u2018higher than yesterday\u2019 won\u2019t be true forever), but you run the risk of losing your bitcoins to a cybercriminal. Overnight, Slovenian-based bitcoin miner NiceHash says it is investigating a security breach and the possible theft of tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoins. It\u2019s a blow to bitcoin miners who had contributed their computing power to mine bitcoins through NiceHash. Users reckon that NiceHash\u2019s bitcoin wallet had held around 4,736.42 bitcoins \u2014 equivalent to over $66m at current prices. Here\u2019s the official statement: More reaction to Bitcoin\u2019s latest spike: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says Bitcoin\u2019s rise looks unstoppable -- but the launch of those bitcoin futures could change things. Bitcoin bulls have driven the virtual currency beyond $14,500 for the first time. The bitcoin has jumped 20% over the last 24 hours with buyers of the virtual currency now eyeing up $20,000. Given the fact that both the CBOE and the CME exchanges will begin offering bitcoin futures this month, perhaps the prediction of $20,000 is not that far off? However, the start of futures trading also means the start of short trades on the bitcoin, which could increase volatility further. Now this is interesting. The Financial Times is reporting that some of the world\u2019s largest banks are resisting the imminent launch of bitcoin futures. Futures trading will allow people to trade the digital currency without actually owning it. It\u2019s means to open bitcoin up to a wider range of investors. However, given bitcoin\u2019s volatility, some industry figures fear that the clearing houses that underpins the markets could suffer massive losses if the cryptocurrency were to crash. The FT says: The world\u2019s largest banks are pushing back on the introduction of bitcoin futures, raising concerns with US regulators that the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared. Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset but only via a regulated market. However, the planned launch in the next 10 days of futures contracts by the Chicago exchanges CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, given a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week, has prompted a backlash among the major brokers who backstop trading across the industry. The Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group, plans to send a letter to the CFTC that will be published on Thursday. In a draft seen by the FT, the FIA writes that the rapid introduction of bitcoin futures \u201cdid not allow for proper public transparency and input\u201d. Newsflash: UK house prices kept rising last month, according to the latest data from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices rose by 0.5% during November, leaving them 3.9% higher than a year ago. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital, says the Bank of England\u2019s (well-flagged) interest rate hike last month hasn\u2019t spooked buyers: \u201cThe improved performance of the market in the latest quarter suggests the first interest rate rise in a decade may have ignited demand. \u201cOn this evidence, the November rate rise has brought prospective buyers out into the open rather than sent them underground. \u201cMany buyers may have come to the conclusion that it is better to move now while mortgage rates are still low than further down the line when they could be less competitive. Currency traders may need to don their tin hats in the coming days, as the Brexit negotiations intensify. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, predicts plenty of volatility: \u201cEurope is the only show in town right now, and ongoing speculation around a solution to the Irish border issue has further dampened enthusiasm for sterling. A deal must be done by close of play Friday if Brexit talks are to move onto trade after next week\u2019s summit. Reality is, deadlines will likely get extended, whisper from Brussels will raise and dash expectations, and we may or may not get anything at the end of it. Prepare for a volatile couple of days on the currency markets. Merger news: GVC, the gambling giant behind Foxy Bingo and PartyCasino, is in talks over a \u00a33.9bn takeover of Ladbrokes. Shares in both companies have jumped in early trading (Ladbrokes surged by over 25%). If successful, it would create one of the world\u2019s largest betting firms. Ladbrokes could welcome a takeover, given the mounting criticism over its fixed-odds betting terminals (savaged as being \u2018crack cocaine\u2019 of gambling). The final value of the deal will partly depend on the government\u2019s clampdown on FOBT, which could take a chunk out of Ladbrokes profits. Geopolitical issues are high on the market\u2019s agenda today, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services: Politics will again be to the fore as UK government attempts to find some compromise on the hypersensitive issue of the Irish border, while the fall-out from Trump\u2019s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital threatens to escalate already enormous tensions across the Middle East, and quite obviously contradicts UN resolution 478. Last night\u2019s price surge was remarkable, even by bitcoin\u2019s recent standards: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under pressure this morning as traders worry that Britain may not get a Brexit breakthrough before Christmas. Sterling dipped overnight to $1.337 against the US dollar, with no immediate sign of an end to the deadlock over the Irish border question. That\u2019s almost two cents lower than Monday, when optimism of a deal was rising. It\u2019s also a little weaker against the euro, at \u20ac1.133. Tensions mounted after Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said the UK must agree the text on a potential deal by Friday night. Otherwise, the two sides can\u2019t shift onto taking about that precious trade deal. Time is running short, as analysts at FxPro warn this morning.... If talks do not move on to the next stage of discussions in December then the terms of a transition period will likely be pushed back until the next European council summit of leaders in March, by which time many businesses in the UK will have had to make decisions over their location and investments in the country. So, the City is looking to Westminster for some serious progress between the UK government, the DUP (it\u2019s Northern Irish partners) and Dublin. But if each side sticks to its principles, this will be tough - so sterling could have a choppy ride. Bitcoin, meanwhile, continues to soar at an ever faster rate. The digital currency battered its way through the $14,000 mark overnight, having hit $12,000 yesterday. More consumers are jumping into bitcoin - presumably having heard stories of its rapid ascent. Institutional investors are also taking more interest, as they\u2019ll soon be able to buy and sell bitcoin derivative contracts. It will intensify the argument between those who think bitcoin is a monetary paradigm shift, and those who see a dangerous bubble. Par example: We\u2019ll also be watching out for new UK house price figures, updated eurozone growth stats and the weekly US unemployment report: The agenda 8.30am GMT: Halifax UK house price survey for November 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP statistics for Q3 2016 (second estimate) 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless claims 4pm GMT: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi speaks at a press conference held by the Bank for International Settlement.",

It\u2019s why the arbitrage exists in the first place: the trade cannot be exercised elsewhere in the bitcoin ecosystem because the risk of counterparty default at the first sign of distress is far too great. You\u2019d win the trade, but you\u2019d probably lose the payout.</p> <p>If a regulated futures market takes that risk away, however, the trade becomes a no-brainer if not a mastermind opportunity.</p> <p>Which is arguably where we are now.</p> </blockquote> <p>This chart shows how the plan would play out:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"709b034ce2b976baf195b755ceeed3b9cabf9a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/709b034ce2b976baf195b755ceeed3b9cabf9a34/0_0_591_393/500.png\" alt=\"The bitcoin price\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bitcoin price</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alphaville</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But.... such a plan could still go wrong.

      "bodyText": "More than 800 senior Asda shopfloor workers are facing a pay cut or redundancy in the new year after the supermarket chain embarked on another cost-cutting exercise. Store staff have been briefed this week on a proposal that could mean 842 section leaders being removed from its store management teams. Thousands of other workers will also be affected by a wider move to cut the number of hours spent on stacking and tidying shelves at 600 supermarkets. In a document given to staff, and seen by the Guardian, the retailer said it needed to cut costs so it could \u201cclose the price gap\u201d with rivals Aldi and Lidl. It said: \u201cWe need to continuously review our operating model. \u2026 being the cheapest of the big four is no longer a viable business model. We need to be able to look at ways to reduce our operating costs in order to close the price gap.\u201d The document reveals that about half of Asda\u2019s 153 smallest supermarkets are loss-making. It says the US-owned grocer needs to find ways of working which are \u201cfit for the future and ensure the longevity of the format\u201d. A consultation process has now begun. If the plan is pushed through in 2018 the section leaders, who work in both the fresh and packaged food aisles, will lose the higher hourly pay rate associated with the job and \u201cmanagement contribution\u201d hours. The document then explains: \u201cWe would explore redeployment opportunities, and only as a last resort, we would look at the possibility of redundancy with affected colleagues.\u201d The rise of Aldi and Lidl has forced the mainstream chains to restructure their large store networks. Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have also embarked on significant cost-cutting programmes this year. The German chains Aldi and Lidl are continuing to grow rapidly, with Aldi overtaking both the Co-op and Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s fifth largest supermarket chain. Lidl passed Waitrose in August to become the seventh largest. In October, Asda, whose US parent Walmart is the world\u2019s largest company by sales, announced that its chief executive, Sean Clarke, would be replaced by his deputy, Roger Burnley, in January. Clarke, a Walmart veteran of 21 years, was parachuted into the role last summer to lead a turnaround of Asda. The shopfloor shake-up is the latest in a series of staffing changes pushed through since Clarke took charge. In August, Asda cut hundreds of jobs in 18 underperforming stores and asked staff in another 59 to work more flexibly. The following month nearly 300 jobs went at its Leeds head office where another round of redundancies took place in its human resources department this week. One Asda store worker said colleagues were upset and stressed about the timing of the announcement and were now fearful of overspending this Christmas. In a statement Asda said: \u201cThese proposed changes are about making sure we\u2019re doing the best job for our customers in the most efficient way possible. Whilst these are only proposals, we know talking about change is unsettling which is why we\u2019re working with our colleagues to get their views before any final decisions are made early next year.\u201d The document also sets out plans to make big cuts to each store\u2019s budget for hours spent refilling and tidying shelves. The new Asda mantra for employees stacking shelves: \u201cCan you see it and reach it? Yes? Leave it. No? Shopkeep it.\u201d This reflects a focus on filling gaps on shelves rather that checking every product is in stock. Bryan Roberts, retail analyst at TCC Global, said: \u201cA lot of retailers have tried to remove section leaders but quality, particularly in produce, can suffer. You run the risk that what you save in headcount you lose in credibility. But being in stock is more important to shoppers than stores looking pretty - if it looks bombed out that\u2019s different, they probably expect more finesse from the big four [than a discounter].\u201d",

      "bodyText": "First-time buyers could pay nearly 50% more than existing home owners for their property because typically they are spreading their mortgage repayments for longer periods of over 35 years. According to analysis by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which has scrutinised 10 years of mortgage data, taking out a \u00a3200,000 home loan for 35 years rather than 25 years at a 3% interest rate requires \u00a338,723 more (46%) in interest payments. First-time buyers are older on average than they were decade ago as they have been forced to wait longer to get on the housing ladder because of rising house prices and low income growth, the FCA found. \u201cWhile increasing the mortgage term can make monthly repayments more affordable, ultimately the borrower is likely to repay a greater amount of cumulative interest over the life of the mortgage,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cLengthening the mortgage term also means that the borrower will be older by the time the loan matures.\u201d For loans granted in 2016, 22% of first-time buyers will be over 65 when they finally repay their mortgage. First-time buyers are not the only ones borrowing over longer periods. The FCA said the most common mortgage term has traditionally been 25 years and that in 2007 longer borrowing periods represented 17% of all loans. By 2016 this had increased to 39% and half of these were for more than 30 years. However, the change is more pronounced for those buying for the first time: in 2016, 62% of first-time buyers had loans longer than 25 years and 34% longer than 30 years. The FCA found that first-time buyers have been the strongest source of growth for lenders since the 2008 crisis. While the average age for a first-time buyer has risen to 31 from 30, those 25 and younger are less likely to be buying their first home than they were in 2007. Then, this age group accounted for 30% of first-time buyers but by 2016 the figure was 22%. In London, just 10% of first-time buyers are younger than 25 \u2013 down from 17% a decade ago \u2013 and on average borrow \u00a3289,000 compared with \u00a3208,000 in 20o7. North-east England and Humber have the highest proportion of first-time buyers under 25, at 29%. First-time buyers borrow \u00a3108,000 and \u00a3116,000 on average respectively in the two regions, compared with \u00a399,000 and \u00a3104,000 in 2007. In Northern Ireland the size of average first-time buyer mortgages has fallen by 28% to \u00a397,000 because of the decline in property prices since the financial crisis. The 26 to 30 age group makes up the greatest proportion of first-time buyers \u2013 34% \u2013 but the proportion of those aged between 31 and 35 has risen from 17% in 2007 to 22% in 2016. The FCA found that one of the most notable changes over the period was the fall in mortgages worth 90% or more of the value of a property. In 2008 this high loan-to-value lending amounted to 14% of the market, but fell to 1% by 2011 as lenders restricted home loans in reaction to the crisis. The help-to-buy programme, introduced in 2014, helped increase this proportion again to 9%. Interest-only mortgages \u2013 32% of all new loans in 2007 \u2013 have also become less popular and in 2016 made up 4% of new lending. However, 21% of outstanding mortgages are still interest-only and the FCA is reviewing how borrowers are being treated by their lender as the maturity on their mortgage approaches.",

      "bodyText": "The older generations are the new entrepreneurs, creating employment and driving national productivity, according to research by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). Entrepreneurs aged over 50 employed more people than start-ups run by younger individuals for the first time in 2016, the research found. The trend is likely to continue: the number of over-50s in work is rapidly increasing and those aged over 50 are expected to dominate the self-employed workforce in the UK by 2024. On current trends, this gap will widen over time. \u201cWith low productivity continuing to affect many areas of the economy, the message from our research is clear: rather than being a drain on the economy, the over-50s are becoming increasingly important drivers of the UK\u2019s economic growth,\u201d said Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, which commissioned the research. \u201cThis age group is setting up and running their own businesses at a faster rate than any other age group, directly employing nearly 10 million people, 2 million more than the under-50s. This gap is only set to widen,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we are to rebalance our economy, it is essential that we find more ways to support their economic ambitions.\u201d The data suggests that an increasing number of 50- to 64-year-olds choose not to retire and instead stay active in the labour market, with the rate of employment rising between 2012 and 2016 from around 65% to 71%. CEBR projections show that the number of employed 50- to 64-year-olds will exceed 9 million before the end of 2018. By 2021 there will be 10 million in work. Simon Heyworth, 66, established his reputation in sound mastering at Virgin, then a relatively new music label. He worked as co-producer of Mike Oldfield\u2019s Tubular Bells and has worked with music legends including Brian Eno, King Crimson, Imogen Heap, Marillion, Nick Drake and Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle. In the summer of 2002 \u2013 aged 51 \u2013 Heyworth set up his own audio mastering studio in Devon: Super Audio Mastering. \u201cI have never thought of retiring \u2013 I can\u2019t afford it \u2013 and so when London got too expensive and we moved to Devon, I set up a new business here without giving a second thought to my age,\u201d he said. \u201cThe benefit of starting one\u2019s own business later in life is that you bring a wealth of experience and knowledge with you that takes years to build up,\u201d he added. There are a number of reasons why older people turn to self-employment. Older workers can be edged out of employment and find it hard to find new work. Alternatively, older people in employment might feel they have accrued enough expertise to realise a long-held ambition of starting their own business. But Kay Daniel Neufeld, senior economist at CEBR and author of the report, said the growing reliance on older generations to drive prosperity could cause concerns among policymakers looking to incentivise younger prospective business leaders to grow their own ventures. \u201cSelf-employment among the over-50s has risen much more quickly than it has for younger cohorts, driven by demographic factors such as the rising average age of UK workers, as well as structural changes in the labour market,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Bitcoin has been likened to Dante\u2019s Inferno by the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland. As the digital currency surged towards $16,000, Sir Howard Davies suggested it should carry a similarly apocalyptic warning for investors. Davies, a former head of the UK\u2019s top financial watchdog, called on the Bank of England and other authorities around the world to launch a coordinated warning against the digital currency. Bitcoin has increased in value by $4,500 in the space of a week, after surging more than 900% this year. It was trading at $15,800 late afternoon on Thursday. \u201cPut up the sign from Dante\u2019s Inferno \u2013 \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019 \u2013 I think that\u2019s probably what\u2019s needed,\u201d he said speaking on Bloomberg TV, adding that the cryptocurrency appeared to be a \u201cfrothy investment bubble\u201d. Davies argued for Threadneedle Street to take action at the same time as the US Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the European Central Bank. \u201cCentral banks are very anxious about it [bitcoin],\u201d he said. The call from Davies follows warnings from other senior figures in the world of finance, including the heads of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, as well as the Nobel-prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz \u2013 who has argued that the currency should be outlawed. Davies also warned major US exchanges against launching trading in bitcoin, just as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange prepares to offer banks and hedge funds the ability to buy and sell derivatives based on the cryptocurrency. Some analysts believe this has the potential to further inflate the price, although it could also lead bitcoin to fall owing to short-selling of the currency. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure that they know enough about what [bitcoin] is,\u201d he said, adding that it would be \u201ca very risky move in reputational terms\u201d for major financial firms to start offering trading in bitcoin. The Financial Times reported on Thursday that some Wall Street banks were pushing back against the launch of bitcoin into the mainstream financial system, warning in a letter to US regulators that the system was ill-prepared. Economists have compared bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise with past bubbles, such as the tulip mania of the 17th century and the dotcom bubble that began in the late 90s with the Nasdaq index in New York and burst in 2000. The Guardian recently found little evidence of a wider move for the adoption of the digital currency among shops in the technology hub around Old Street in east London. The former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan \u2013 who coined the phrase \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d when describing overpriced assets during the dotcom bubble \u2013 said on CNBC this week that bitcoin was \u201cnot a rational currency\u201d. The Bank of England has made incremental warnings against bitcoin, although Davies said central bankers appeared \u201cnervous about not wanting to be seen to be luddites, saying all of these innovations are bad things\u201d. Sir Jon Cunliffe, the deputy governor responsible for financial stability, gave brief warnings while speaking to the BBC last week. He said consumers should \u201cdo their homework, and think carefully\u201d before buying the currency. Bitcoin is not regulated by the Bank or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which has, however, warned investors in initial coin offerings \u2013 sales of digital coins or tokens such as bitcoin used by startups as an alternative to raising money by issuing shares \u2013 that they can lose all of their money. The UK and other EU governments are taking steps to introduce greater controls, with the Treasury planning to bring cryptocurrencies into line with anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financial rules. Still, there have been no public suggestions about giving the FCA or the Bank powers to regulate the new currencies. Davies\u2019s warning is likely to raise some eyebrows among bitcoin\u2019s supporters, who view the cryptocurrency as a way of escaping the traditional financial system. RBS was bailed out by British taxpayers at a cost of \u00a345.5bn after coming unstuck trading risky derivatives and mortgage-backed securities. It remains majority-owned by the government almost a decade later. But closer scrutiny by financial watchdogs could damage the appeal of bitcoin as a currency free of banks, regulators and governments. Analysts at Saxobank estimate it could peak above $60,000 next year, giving the digital currency a total worth of more than $1tn, before crashing to $1,000 by 2019 as regulators introduce greater controls.",

      "bodyText": "Fears that China risks being the cause of a fresh global financial crisis have been highlighted by the International Monetary Fund in a hard-hitting warning about the growing debt-dependency of the world\u2019s second biggest economy. The IMF\u2019s health check of China\u2019s financial system found that credit was high by international levels, that personal debt had increased in the past five years, and that the pressure to maintain the country\u2019s rapid growth had bred an unwillingness to let struggling firms fail. While praising China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, for his commitment to improving financial security, the IMF said reforms by Beijing in recent years had not gone far enough. \u201cThe system\u2019s increasing complexity has sown financial stability risks,\u201d the IMF\u2019s assessment said. \u201cCredit growth has outpaced GDP growth, leading to a large credit overhang. The credit-to-GDP ratio is now about 25% above the long-term trend, very high by international standards and consistent with a high probability of financial distress. \u201cAs a result, corporate debt has reached 165% of GDP, and household debt, while still low, has risen by 15 percentage points of GDP over the past five years and is increasingly linked to asset-price speculation. The buildup of credit in traditional sectors has gone hand-in-hand with a slowdown of productivity growth and pressures on asset quality.\u201d The report said China should put less emphasis on targets for growth, which led to excessive credit expansion and higher levels of debt at local level; that it should beef up financial supervision and put increased emphasis on spotting risks ahead; and that it should gradually increase the amount of capital targeted banks should hold. China was one of the prime engines of world growth when countries in the developed west were struggling during and after the financial crisis of 2008-09, but the expansion relied heavily on higher public spending and easy credit. Xi is trying to move China to a different model where growth is slower but more sustainable. The IMF supported this approach, noting that tensions had emerged in various areas of the Chinese financial system. There had been a commitment to supporting growth and jobs, coupled with pressures to keep non-viable firms open. The credit needed to stimulate higher growth had \u201cled to a substantial credit expansion resulting in high corporate debt and household indebtedness rising at a fast pace, albeit from a low base\u201d. The IMF also noted developments in the Chinese financial system similar to those in the US in the years before the financial crisis of a decade ago. Supervision of banks had been tightened up but demand for high-yield investment products had led to attempts to escape regulations though increasingly complex investment vehicles. \u201cRisky lending has thus moved away from banks toward the less well-supervised parts of the financial system,\u201d the IMF said. It added that risk-taking was encouraged by a reluctance among financial institutions to allow individual investors to take losses, an expectation that Beijing would bail out state-owned enterprises and local government financing vehicles, and efforts to stabilise financial markets in volatile times. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
