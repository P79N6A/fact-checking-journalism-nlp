      "bodyText": "Warren Buffett on Saturday reported a record quarterly and annual profit for his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, thanks in part to a $29.1bn boost \u201cdelivered\u201d by the Republican tax cut. In his annual letter to shareholders, the billionaire investor wrote: \u201cBerkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2017 was $65.3bn.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201c2017 was far from standard: a large portion of our gain did not come from anything we accomplished at Berkshire. \u201cThe $65bn gain is nonetheless real \u2013 rest assured of that. But only $36bn came from Berkshire\u2019s operations. The remaining $29bn was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the US tax code.\u201d Buffett also lamented his inability to find big companies to buy, and said his goal was to make \u201cone or more huge acquisitions\u201d of non-insurance businesses to bolster results. Finding things to buy at a \u201csensible purchase price\u201d had become a challenge, he wrote, and a major reason Berkshire was awash with $116bn of low-yielding cash and government bonds. Buffett blamed a \u201cpurchasing frenzy\u201d binge by deal-hungry chief executives employing cheap debt. Berkshire typically pays all cash for acquisitions. \u201cOur smiles will broaden when we have redeployed Berkshire\u2019s excess funds into more productive assets,\u201d Buffett wrote. \u201cBerkshire\u2019s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions.\u201c It has been more than two years since Berkshire made a major purchase, the $32.1bn takeover of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts. Last month, Buffett gave greater oversight of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses such as the BNSF railroad, Precision Castparts and Dairy Queen ice cream to the energy executive Gregory Abel, while the insurance specialist Ajit Jain added supervision of insurance operations such as the Geico auto insurer. Both are considered candidates to eventually replace Buffett, 87, as Berkshire\u2019s chief executive. Many investors consider Abel, a decade younger than Jain, the frontrunner. Fourth-quarter net income increased roughly fivefold to $32.55bn, or $19,790 per class A share, from $6.29bn, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier, while annual profit rose 87% to $44.94bn. Those increases, however, masked declines in operating profit, which Buffett considers a better gauge of overall performance, and which fell 18% to $14.46bn. A major reason for that decline was a $2.22bn loss from insurance underwriting, Berkshire\u2019s first full-year deficit since 2002, hurt by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and wildfires in California. However, Buffett said \u201cno company comes close\u201d to his conglomerate in its ability to financially withstand even a mega-catastrophe causing $400bn of insurance losses. Buffett said the odds of a giant hurricane, earthquake or other conflagration inflicting unprecedented, catastrophic damage in any year is just 2%, but that in such an event Berkshire would lose only about $12bn, a sum more than offset by annual profits from its non-insurance businesses. The lower tax rate also contributed to a 23% full-year boost in Berkshire\u2019s book value, which measures assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good indicator of Berkshire\u2019s net worth, to $211,750 per class A share. Insurance float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, which gives Buffett more money to invest, was about $114bn at year end.",

      "bodyText": "Dua Lipa\u2019s double victory at last week\u2019s Brit awards was a triumph for a young artist who initially struggled to break into the big time \u2013 but it is also a vindication of a creative arts education. At a time of rising education costs, debates over declining skills levels and funding cutbacks, the value of schooling and degrees in arts subjects is facing renewed scrutiny. Last month, it emerged that the British and Irish Modern Music Institute, a rock music college that offers degrees in music production and songwriting, had received \u00a324.4m in tuition fees last year, compared with \u00a318m for the globally renowned London School of Economics. It leaves the question of how many of those loans will be paid back, given the arduous path to career success in the music industry. Indeed, the government launched a review last week of university tuition fees, including consideration of whether to vary the cost of certain subjects based on whether they were more or less \u201ceconomically valuable\u201d. At least Lipa, who won best female solo artist and breakthrough artist last week, is an example of the financial benefits of arts teaching. The 22-year-old, who was the most streamed female artist in the UK last year, took classes at the Sylvia Young Theatre School and credits a teacher at the London institution with giving her the confidence to be a singer. Three of Lipa\u2019s fellow nominees for female artist \u2013 Kate Tempest, Paloma Faith and Rita Ora \u2013 all had creative or performing arts educations too. Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians, cites a government report stating that the creative industries as a whole \u2013 including music and arts \u2013 are worth about \u00a392bn a year to the UK. \u201cMusic is central to our cultural life, a key driver of economic growth, creates jobs, and has a positive impact on children\u2019s cognitive development and emotional wellbeing,\u201d she added. At the music department at City University in London, the mood among students is positive, despite all that debt hanging over their heads. This is a course driven by love of the subject more than by a cold calculation of earnings longevity. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to pay all that money, you may as well enjoy what you do,\u201d says 18-year-old James Blane, who faces a \u00a350,000 debt at the end of his music and technology degree. However, statistics show that Blane\u2019s enthusiasm is not shared by his peers. The university and college admissions body, Ucas, has recorded a fall in the number of creative arts applicants over the past three years, as tuition fees of \u00a39,250 a year sharpen the focus on employability and put off some from poorer backgrounds. Creative arts graduates face the prospect of the lowest median salaries of any subject, at about \u00a320,000, compared with more than \u00a345,000 for those in medicine and dentistry. With the student loan repayment threshold now rising to an income of \u00a325,000, many may never repay their loans. Against this backdrop, musicians and creative industry leaders, including the director of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, are increasingly concerned that arts education is being stifled under the Conservatives, at the expense of the fabric of society and the economy in the long run. Few graduates get to work directly in music, although companies in other sectors benefit from analytical and \u201csoft\u201d (social) skills they learn as part of their courses. As few as 140,000 people are directly employed in the music industry \u2013 less than 1% of the overall workforce, and a fraction of the 2 million in the financial services sector. Within that \u00a392bn creative arts windfall, the music industry generates about \u00a34.4bn a year, making it a tiny corner of Britain\u2019s \u00a31.9 trillion economy. But, as the Brit awards show, its benefits ripple well beyond quantifiable economic output and give Britain soft economic power on the world stage. British recorded music exports are at their highest levels this century, driven by artists such as Adele and Coldplay. Meanwhile, the UK is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of recorded music after the US \u2013 with as many as one in eight of all albums purchased around the globe in 2016 by a UK artist. City University\u2019s culture professor, Andy Pratt, says culture can drive consumption, which is worth billions to the economy. \u201cLike with any education, if you\u2019re only concerned with the immediate payoff then you may as well give up tomorrow,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to end up forcing everyone to be a lawyer or a doctor. There\u2019s always a future for creativity, which creates an awful lot of jobs and taxes.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2018 to correctly name the National Theatre director as Rufus Norris, from Rufus Jones as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "At lunchtime on Friday, George Cheah, or George Junior as he is known, doesn\u2019t really have the time to talk. \u201cHonestly we are so busy, it\u2019s gone absolutely mad. People have gone chicken crazy,\u201d he says over the phone, while people shout orders in the background. Cheah\u2019s family-run fried chicken joint, Chicken George in Luton, won best takeaway at the British Takeaway Awards in 2016 so they are never short of custom, but since the great fried chicken crisis of 2018 began more than a week ago they have been inundated. \u201cI reckon our business has doubled in the past week,\u201d said Cheah. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really, really busy, like packed. With KFC being shut, lots of people are tagging us on social media saying they\u2019d rather have a George anyway.\u201d Chicken George is not the only takeaway straining under the demand for fried chicken as customers attempt to get their fix following the closure of most of KFC\u2019s UK outlets earlier this week. The hashtag #KFCCrisis trended on Twitter, and no fewer than three police forces issued statements asking the public not to contact them about the closures. Police in Tower Hamlets issued a terse tweet: KFC was brief and somewhat sheepish in the statement posted in its shops, saying there had been \u201ca few hiccups with the delivery today\u201d. The crisis soon spread, however, leading the company to point the finger at its new logistics partners. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought a new delivery partner on board, but they\u2019ve had a couple of teething problems,\u201d it said in a statement. There were reports of desperate managers attempting to bulk-buy chicken from supermarkets, and of frustrated attempts to give away surplus chicken in a storage depot that the local council confirmed had not been registered. So where did it all go wrong? The \u201cnew delivery partner\u201d, otherwise known as the behemoth DHL, took over the KFC logistics contract on Valentine\u2019s Day, alongside Quick Service Logistics (QSL), which has supplied KFC in Europe since 2011. Problems began almost immediately. By 16 February, KFC had started to shut down locations after managers complained of delays to deliveries and by 18 February only 266 of 900 restaurants in the UK were open. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything go down so quickly, it\u2019s been absolutely shocking,\u201d said Dr Jonathan Owens, an expert in operations management and the supply chain at the University of Salford business school. \u201cI think they\u2019ve been caught out by the speed and the limited amount of space there is for error with such a highly perishable product.\u201d The logistics of fresh chicken are fiercely regimented, according to Owens. From egg to slaughter is around 35 days, with most chickens gassed, plucked, cut up into saleable pieces and distributed to temperature-controlled warehouses before being sent in refrigerated lorries to outlets. KFC sells around 676m pieces of chicken a year and buys 450,000 birds a week in the UK. An unspecified number are imported from other European countries, Brazil and Thailand, according to its website. Much of the speculation for the cause of the disruption has centred on the fact that DHL has one centralised warehouse, in contrast to the previous contractor, Bidvest, a specialised food distributor that operated from six. Malory Davies, the editor of Logistics Manager, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a bad choice to have one location, but the scale is the challenge. If you are serving 900 sites from one warehouse it\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cYou would think if you team with a company you have worked with for years in Europe and pair it with the biggest logistics operator in the world it would be a safe bet. We are all agog to see what has actually gone wrong.\u201d For the moment, DHL remains tight-lipped about the fiasco. It apologised for the \u201cunforeseen interruption\u201d and said: \u201cWhilst we are not the only party responsible for the supply chain to KFC, we do apologise for the inconvenience and disappointment caused to KFC and their customers by this incident.\u201d Richard Wilding , a professor of supply change management at the Cranfield School of Management, said the disruption revealed the extent to which companies have become compartmentalised. Henry Ford may have raised the cows used to produce the leather on his vehicles\u2019 seats, but modern companies are more like football teams, with specialised players in individual roles. \u201cCompanies are no longer in competition with other companies. It\u2019s the supply chains that are directly competing,\u201d he says. KFC said 800 or 900 stores were open as of Saturday, and while neither KFC, DHL or QSL have given any indication of the financial damage the last week has caused, it\u2019s likely to be significant. \u201cResearch suggests you get a big impact about 60 days after the event, and the drop in shareholder value can be in the region of 20%,\u201d Wilding said. Experts disagree on the reasons for the chicken shortage, but most agree that the damage done will be significant, if not evenly distributed among the companies involved. KFC\u2019s marketing team has been praised for its careful handling of the crisis, particularly the judicious use of humour in tweets, and a full-page newspaper advertisement on Friday rearranged the letters on a chicken bucket from KFC to FCK. When rivals Burger King offered a disappointed KFC fan free food for a year, the company tweeted: \u201cPutting all your chips on the table \u2026 bold move BK. When our chips arrive we will match your stakes and too put all our chips on the table. Until then we have limited chips.\u201d In increasing the demand for Colonel Sanders\u2019 secret recipe, there was a strong chance that KFC \u2013 if not DHL or QSL \u2013 could actually benefit from the crisis, according to the media commentator Mark Borkowski. \u201cScarcity creates demand. It\u2019s reminded people about KFC, even those who haven\u2019t had one for years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they get everything back running again, you can expect a stampede.\u201d",
