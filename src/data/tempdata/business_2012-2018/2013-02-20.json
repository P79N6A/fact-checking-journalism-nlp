      "bodyText": "Axminster Carpets, the 250-year-old Devon company that made the coronation carpet for George VI in 1937, is on the brink of collapse. About 400 workers could lose their jobs as the company, awarded a royal warrant last year, becomes the latest victim of Britain's crumbling manufacturing industry. The family-run business, which made its first carpets in 1755 for King George III and covered floors at Chatsworth House and Brighton Pavilion, said rescue options were being explored but it was preparing to call in administrators.

    "webTitle": "Blow for George Osborne as 4G auction comes up \u00a31.2bn short of expectations", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The 4G auction has ended in a humiliation for George Osborne, pulling in \u00a31.2bn less than expected for the Treasury. But it is a boon for smartphone users, leaving mobile networks with the spare change to finance a rapid roll-out of superfast wireless internet. The biggest ever sale of British airwaves raised \u00a32.34bn for the public purse, less than the \u00a33.5bn the chancellor was counting on to keep government borrowing in check, and below the \u00a34bn analysts had estimated based on prices fetched in recent European 4G auctions. UK mobile networks will pay just 10% of the \u00a322.5bn handed over in the 3G spectrum 13 years ago. Caught up in the 2000 dotcom boom, the industry spent so much on licences that year that it was years before they could afford to build their networks across the country. Some, including Vodafone, are still writing off the cost. \"UK mobile operators paid much less than anticipated and every penny they saved on the auction will be gained by UK consumers in terms of better services,\" said Dario Talmesio, analyst at Informa. While 3G remained largely unused until Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, there is now pent-up demand for internet access on smartphones, and 4G promises speeds equal to the average home broadband service. Osborne's autumn statement, which forecast the deficit for this financial year, controversially included receipts for the yet to be held spectrum sale, allowing him to wrongfoot the opposition and claim that government borrowing would not rise compared with last year. Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the debacle showed \"how foolish and short-termist\" the chancellor had been to bank the cash before it had been raised, adding: \"His trickery has now badly backfired.\" The Treasury said raising \u00a31.2bn less than expected was not material when compared with the \u00a31.3tn of spending and tax receipts flowing through the Treasury this year. The Treasury's loss will be the consumer's gain. The telecoms watchdog Ofcom, which organised the auction, believes 4G could bring a \u00a320bn boost to the economy over the next decade, as new shopping, entertainment and service businesses establish themselves on the small screen. One operator, O2, will be required to build out coverage to 98% of the population indoors by 2017. In a surprise result that could redraw the balance of power and spur competition between the UK's four mobile phone networks, each has come away with a slice of the most valuable airwaves in the lower frequency bands needed to provide coverage beyond towns and cities and into rural areas. Out of seven bidders, the fifth and final winner was BT, which does not intend to launch a mobile phone network but will use its spectrum for 4G connections in fixed locations such as homes and public Wi-Fi hotspots, and possibly to extend its rural broadband network. \"True success will be delivery of a 4G network in the countryside sooner rather than later,\" the Countryside Alliance said. \"We now look to the mobile operators to deliver a service that ensures rural communities will no longer be left behind in this digital age.\" A number of factors combined to suppress the prices paid by networks. Bidding on the lower frequency spectrum was less fierce than expected, with the largest operator, Everything Everywhere, settling for the smallest possible slice, having launched the UK's first 4G service in November using spectrum it already owned. After five years of legal wrangling between operators and regulators, the UK was one of the last European nations to sell 4G airwaves. With countries such as Sweden and Germany offering services for a couple of years, networks have learned that 4G is not a licence to print money. \"The lesson from Europe is although 4G comes to market as a distinct service with premium prices attached to it, when competition arrives that premium erodes quite quickly,\" said IDC analyst John Delaney. Ofcom was selling spectrum in two bands: the lower frequency 800 megahertz, and the higher frequency 2600 megahertz. Lower frequency signals travel around 10 times further, so require fewer masts. They are better for rural coverage and at penetrating inside buildings \u2013 so fetching higher prices at auction. But 2600 is useful for cities, where smartphone usage is heaviest. EE, Vodafone and O2 had been expected to carve up all the 800 spectrum between them, with the UK's smallest and least profitable operator Three left out in the cold. Vodafone and O2 each bought as much as they were allowed to under the rules, but EE came away with the minimum, leaving 3 to secure a slice, and at the low reserve price of \u00a3225,000. Vodafone spent the most, shelling out \u00a3791m for a wide range of bands. Meanwhile O2 and Three emerged from the auction with no 2600 spectrum, while EE secured a surprisingly large amount of the higher frequency band. The imbalances increase the likelihood that networks, which already share masts, could trade spectrum or share it in joint ventures after the auction. Ofcom has said it would be open to proposals for trading and sharing spectrum. \"This is a positive outcome for competition in the UK, which will lead to faster and more widespread mobile broadband, and substantial benefits for consumers and businesses across the country,\" said the Ofcom chief executive, Ed Richards. \"We are confident the UK will be among the most competitive markets in the world for 4G services.\"",

    "webTitle": "RWE boss warns over nuclear plant subsidies", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "RWE npower, one of the big six power suppliers, has warned ministers not to seal a long-term subsidy deal with the nuclear industry behind the backs of consumers and saddle them with \"unnecessarily high bills\" for the next 40 years. The warning from Paul Massara, RWE UK's new chief executive, comes as the Guardian can reveal that up to 15 private sector executives with links to the atomic sector have been seconded to government departments or other public sector roles. \"We are very concerned that decisions currently being taken around guaranteed revenue from new nuclear power stations in return for their delivery could force the next three generations of British consumers to pay an unexpected and perhaps unnecessarily high bill for the next 40 years, especially given the track record of delivery of nuclear power stations,\" said Massara. \"There must be an open and honest conversation about the future direction of energy bills. Customers must be given the best information to be able to make informed decisions, take control of their bills and reduce their energy waste.\" RWE, along with another big six supplier, E.ON, recently sold its interest in the Horizon project to build nuclear power plants in Britain at Wylfa in north Wales and Oldbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire. The German-owned company has spent more than \u00a33bn in the last three years building gas and wind power installations as it prepares to close old coal-fired plants. Massara said he understood the warning this week about a looming power crunch from Alistair Buchanan, the head of Ofgem, the energy regulator, but said all technologies should be encouraged to ensure the UK's future energy supply is not only clean and secure but also affordable. \"We believe UK customers should not be made to write a blank cheque to pay for new power stations,\" he added. A Freedom of Information request undertaken by the campaign group, NuclearSpin.org, showed at least 15 people working for the nuclear energy industry or its consultants have been seconded to areas responsible for policy or regulation, some being paid for by the taxpayer. EDF Energy, which has asked ministers to consider a 40-year subsidy scheme for its proposed UK plants, has seconded two staff to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) at the Health and Safety Executive. One is interim programme manager for the ONR's programme at the Sellafield plant in Cumbria and is paid for by EDF. The other is a technical assistant on the Decommissioning Fuel and Waste Programme. Rolls-Royce, which describes itself as \"part of the UK's nuclear industry for the past 50 years\", is providing the head of new nuclear capabilities and removing barriers at the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Sophie Macfarlane-Smith is responsible for \"enhancing the capability\" of the UK's \"new nuclear supply chain and skills\". Engineering consultant Atkins Ltd is providing a policy adviser for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills' commercial nuclear policy team and Babcock, which describes itself as \"the UK's largest specialist nuclear support services organisation\" has seconded two staff to the ONR. A DECC spokesperson said secondees brought with them knowledge and experience which are vital to helping the department do its job effectively. \"DECC ensures that any secondee is bound by the professional Code of Practice relevant to their industry ...

In fact the full cost of secondments to the ONR is charged to the nuclear industry. The ONR has also asked us to clarify that it has safeguards in place to ensure there is no conflict of interest; no secondee works on matters directly related to their parent organisation.",

      "bodyText": "Since the year 2000, Britain's labour market has been through three distinct phases. The first half-decade of the new century was the purple patch in which unemployment came down and real wages went up. In phase two it all went sour. Between 2007 and 2010, unemployment rose by one million on the internationally used labour force survey measure and by 600,000 on the narrower claimant count measure. The annual growth in average earnings fell from the 4%-plus level common in the pre-crisis years to just over 1%, and spending power \u2013 despite a parallel fall in inflation \u2013 was hit. The third phase has in some ways been the most interesting, and certainly the most difficult to explain. The workforce has expanded and unemployment has come down even though recovery from the recession has been the slowest on record. But rising employment has not been matched by the ability of workers to secure more generous pay awards. Indeed, average earnings growth is running at 1.3% excluding bonuses, well below the inflation rate of 2.7%. The two trends \u2013 more jobs and falling real incomes \u2013 are linked. In part employment is rising because the government is trying to get people off benefits and back into work. But a bigger factor has been the willingness of workers to accept a drop in real wages in order to stay in their jobs. The downside of rising employment and stagnant output is a poor productivity performance, since the UK is employing more people to produce the same amount of goods and services. This is not ideal, but it should be recognised as less bad than the alternative \u2013 longer dole queues. In the past, a two-year period of zero output growth would have seen unemployment rising, not falling, and back to the 3 million-plus levels of the early 1980s and 1990s.",

      "body": "<p>Since the year 2000, Britain's labour market has been through three distinct phases. The first half-decade of the new century was the purple patch in which unemployment came down and real wages went up. In phase two it all went sour. Between 2007 and 2010, unemployment rose by one million on the internationally used labour force survey measure and by 600,000 on the narrower claimant count measure. The annual growth in average earnings fell from the 4%-plus level common in the pre-crisis years to just over 1%, and spending power \u2013 despite a parallel fall in inflation \u2013 was hit.</p> <p>The third phase has in some ways been the most interesting, and certainly the most difficult to explain. The workforce has expanded and unemployment has come down even though recovery from the recession has been the slowest on record. But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/20/jobs-record-attained-29-million\" title=\"\">rising employment has not been matched by the ability of workers to secure more generous pay awards</a>. Indeed, average earnings growth is running at 1.3% excluding bonuses, well below the inflation rate of 2.7%.</p> <p>The two trends \u2013 more jobs and falling real incomes \u2013 are linked. In part employment is rising because the government is trying to get people off benefits and back into work. But a bigger factor has been the willingness of workers to accept a drop in real wages in order to stay in their jobs.</p> <p>The downside of rising employment and stagnant output is a poor productivity performance, since the UK is employing more people to produce the same amount of goods and services.</p> <p>This is not ideal, but it should be recognised as less bad than the alternative \u2013 longer dole queues. In the past, a two-year period of zero output growth would have seen unemployment rising, not falling, and back to the 3 million-plus levels of the early 1980s and 1990s.</p>",

The builders merchants, which also owns the Tile Giant and Toolstation brands, reported a 5.1% fall in underlying sales in the first seven weeks of the year after snow and heavy rains put a dampener on building projects. Analysts said a 7.6% fall in underlying sales in the first seven weeks of 2013 at Travis Perkins' consumer division, which includes the Wickes chain, did not bode well for Kingfisher, the owner of B&amp;Q which is on Thursday expected to report a fall in underlying sales during its fourth quarter. Geoff Cooper, chief executive, said: \"There were problems in January because of the poor weather compared to last year but it's not really representative of the market. For the first time in a long time we can see positive signs that suggest a recovery that is going to be steady.\" He said sales of kitchens and bathrooms had held up as mortgage approvals and housing transactions had improved, but sales of its core building products had been hit by the weather. Travis Perkins saw a 1.4% rise in group revenue in the year to December and a 4.3% rise in operating profit to \u00a3327m despite a subdued housing market in 2012. Cooper is expecting the home improvement market to recover in the second half of 2013 but to fall back by between 1% and 2% for the year as a whole putting more pressure on independent builders merchants and DIY stores.

      "body": "<p>As leading shares reached yet another five year high, <strong>Unilever</strong> was among the biggest risers.</p> <p>Its shares added 41p to \u00a326.52 after a buy note from Investec, which raised its price target from \u00a328 to \u00a329. Analyst Martin Deboo said the outlook for the Marmite to Persil and Dove group to was positive, despite the competitive threat from Procter &amp; Gamble, with the recent takeover of Heinz providing support for consumer companies. He said:</p> <blockquote> Unilever was the full year and fourth quarter growth champion in the megacap peer group and carries strong top line momentum into 2013. We continue to see potential for margins to surprise positively in the coming year, given second half pricing power, rising gross margins and what we expect to be a more stable commodity environment. Meanwhile the take-out of Heinz supports our bullish thesis on valuation. If Warren Buffett can be seduced by (mature market) Heinz at 15 times [earnings], then we remain compelled by Unilever at under 12 times. <br> We continue to see any resurgence of P&amp;G as the key challenge to our buy case on Unilever....We are not complacent about P&amp;G. However we think that the extent of the threat can be overstated. We think that 'hot' competition with P&amp;G extends to only around 25% of Unilever's sales.  P&amp;G will remain in transition for a while yet. Organisational 'turnaround' cycles in our experience are measured in years, not months, and are usually resolved with a change of leadership. Unilever was most recently in transition from 2004 to 2008 as Patrick Cescau took over from Niall Fitzgerald. P&amp;G was in the same position in 1998 to 2001 as Durk Jager transitioned to AG Lafley. This time around, P&amp;G's top line performance really started to dip in the third calendar quarter of 2010. So roughly two and half years ago, during which time top line and market share performance has languished and incumbent chief executive Bob MacDonald's leadership continues to be questioned. </blockquote> <p>Overall the leading index finished 16.30 points higher at 6395.37, helped by the minutes of the Bank of England's latest meeting, which suggested further stimulus measures to boost the UK economy could be on the way.</p> <p>But after passing the 6400 barrier, it later fell back following a weaker start on Wall Street.</p> <p><strong>Rexam</strong>, the beverage can maker, rose to the top of the pile, up 22.2p to 498.9p after underlying profits rose 1% to \u00a3418m, excluding its personal care business which was sold in July.</p> <p>A falling pound following the Bank's minutes helped lift shares in exporters like <strong>Melrose</strong>, up 8.6p to 251.3p, and <strong>Rolls-Royce</strong>, 19p better at \u00a310.62.</p> <p>But a shock cut in its dividend sent shares in <strong>RSA Insurance</strong> tumbling by more than 14%, making it the biggest loser by far in the FTSE 100 and wiping \u00a3700m off its market value.</p> <p>Investors hoping for a regular income from RSA found their final dividend slashed by a third to 3.9p , with the insurer warning of a similar percentage cut in the 2013 half year dividend. The insurer, down 19.3p at 117p, blamed weak investment returns in \"a low bond yield environment\".</p> <p>News of the dividend cut unsettled the whole sector, with <strong>Aviva</strong> shares down 15.2p to 354p.</p> <p>A fall in half year earnings from $9.9bn to $5.6bn and news of the departure of chief executive Marius Kloppers left <strong>BHP Billiton </strong>52.5p lower at 2183.5p while rival <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> slipped 67p to 3646.5p.</p> <p>Precious metals came under renewed pressure on talk out of New York that a sizeable commodity fund was in trouble and liquidating positions.

      "bodyText": "As leading shares reached yet another five year high, Unilever was among the biggest risers. Its shares added 41p to \u00a326.52 after a buy note from Investec, which raised its price target from \u00a328 to \u00a329. Analyst Martin Deboo said the outlook for the Marmite to Persil and Dove group to was positive, despite the competitive threat from Procter &amp; Gamble, with the recent takeover of Heinz providing support for consumer companies. He said: Unilever was the full year and fourth quarter growth champion in the megacap peer group and carries strong top line momentum into 2013. We continue to see potential for margins to surprise positively in the coming year, given second half pricing power, rising gross margins and what we expect to be a more stable commodity environment. Meanwhile the take-out of Heinz supports our bullish thesis on valuation. If Warren Buffett can be seduced by (mature market) Heinz at 15 times [earnings], then we remain compelled by Unilever at under 12 times. We continue to see any resurgence of P&amp;G as the key challenge to our buy case on Unilever....We are not complacent about P&amp;G. However we think that the extent of the threat can be overstated. We think that 'hot' competition with P&amp;G extends to only around 25% of Unilever's sales. P&amp;G will remain in transition for a while yet. Organisational 'turnaround' cycles in our experience are measured in years, not months, and are usually resolved with a change of leadership. Unilever was most recently in transition from 2004 to 2008 as Patrick Cescau took over from Niall Fitzgerald. P&amp;G was in the same position in 1998 to 2001 as Durk Jager transitioned to AG Lafley. This time around, P&amp;G's top line performance really started to dip in the third calendar quarter of 2010. So roughly two and half years ago, during which time top line and market share performance has languished and incumbent chief executive Bob MacDonald's leadership continues to be questioned. Overall the leading index finished 16.30 points higher at 6395.37, helped by the minutes of the Bank of England's latest meeting, which suggested further stimulus measures to boost the UK economy could be on the way. But after passing the 6400 barrier, it later fell back following a weaker start on Wall Street. Rexam, the beverage can maker, rose to the top of the pile, up 22.2p to 498.9p after underlying profits rose 1% to \u00a3418m, excluding its personal care business which was sold in July. A falling pound following the Bank's minutes helped lift shares in exporters like Melrose, up 8.6p to 251.3p, and Rolls-Royce, 19p better at \u00a310.62. But a shock cut in its dividend sent shares in RSA Insurance tumbling by more than 14%, making it the biggest loser by far in the FTSE 100 and wiping \u00a3700m off its market value. Investors hoping for a regular income from RSA found their final dividend slashed by a third to 3.9p , with the insurer warning of a similar percentage cut in the 2013 half year dividend. The insurer, down 19.3p at 117p, blamed weak investment returns in \"a low bond yield environment\". News of the dividend cut unsettled the whole sector, with Aviva shares down 15.2p to 354p. A fall in half year earnings from $9.9bn to $5.6bn and news of the departure of chief executive Marius Kloppers left BHP Billiton 52.5p lower at 2183.5p while rival Rio Tinto slipped 67p to 3646.5p. Precious metals came under renewed pressure on talk out of New York that a sizeable commodity fund was in trouble and liquidating positions. Gold dropped $23 an ounce to $1581 while silver slid nearly $1 to $28.65. The rise in the leading index came despite a number of major companies going ex-dividend. These included GlaxoSmithKline, steady at \u00a314.86 and Barclays, down 5.05p at 319.95p, The bank was also unsettled by Goldman Sachs moving its recommendation from buy to neutral. Among the mid-caps, Rightmove added 8p to \u00a317.59 after a buy note from Panmure Gordon. In the wake of news that estate agency group Countrywide plans a \u00a3650m flotation, Panmure analyst Alex DeGroote said: Countrywide was the original Rightmove 'incubator', and remains one of Rightmove's largest estate agency clients. [Its] IPO is a clear positive lead indictor for Rightmove [with a] market recovery now in prospect.

That was clear enough from the minutes of the February meeting of Threadneedle Street's nine-strong monetary policy committee at which the governor was one of a minority of three voting for more stimulus. What's also plain is that in the absence of a rapid pick-up in Britain's growth prospects more will be done to end the torpor of the past two years. The economy is a long way from achieving what King's successor, Mark Carney, calls \"escape velocity\". The fear that 2013 will be yet another year of sub-par economic performance permeated the minutes. Indeed, the only thing that could have made them more \"dove-ish\" would have been a vote in favour of doing more to boost output. Two years ago, when rising commodity prices were pushing up inflation, several MPC members considered putting up interest rates. No such action is contemplated today, even though inflation has been above target for the past four years and will remain in excess of 2% for at least the next two. In addition to adopting a \"flexible\" approach to hitting the inflation target, the MPC spent the February meeting discussing all the various stimulus options. It thought about cutting its main interest rate from 0.5% and reducing the remuneration commercial banks receive on their deposits at the Bank, before rejecting both ideas. It also discussed broadening the quantitative easing programme to include not just government gilts but other assets, an idea which has much to commend it since it would allow the high street banks to get rid of some of the toxic waste polluting their balance sheets and pave the way for an increase in business lending. But the MPC's argument has always been that if it buys up commercial loans such as mortgages, taxpayers' money would be at risk. As a result, any such a move would require backing from the Treasury. If the Bank is to do anything unilaterally in the coming months it will be more QE coupled with a concerted attempt to boost exports by talking down the value of the pound. The minutes show that all MPC members believe QE would work to a greater or lesser degree, but that some are currently more sanguine about the outlook for inflation than others. As far as the level of sterling is concerned, the minutes spoke for themselves. The pound dropped like a stone after their release. History suggests that more QE may not be delayed long. As Michael Saunders of Citibank pointed out, it is not unknown for the governor to be on the losing side of an MPC vote. In June 2007, King wanted an increase in the main interest rate but the MPC voted against a change. In June last year, the governor was one of three plumping for more QE.

      "bodyText": "Ireland is 60% to 70% towards exiting the EU/IMF bailout, the country's finance minister has said. My colleague Shane Hickey reports: Michael Noonan said a year of turmoil in the eurozone has now settled down with the result that large outside investors were prepared to return to normal business after a period of fear. Speaking during a two day visit to London, he said Ireland was confident it would beat its budget deficit target this year. He said the sale this week of the insurer Irish Life, which was rescued by the state, to Canadian life insurer Great West Lifeco was an illustration of how calm had been restored in the eurozone following upheaval last year with events in Greece. \u201cThe interesting thing is just 12 months ago, the same company was on the edge of closing a deal with the Irish government and problems began to become widespread in Europe and particularly situations in Greece became critical,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cThey backed off not because of anything to do with the Irish economy but because of the risk factor involved as they saw it in investing in anything to do with the eurozone and now, 12 months later, they are back. But whereas last year it was \u20ac1.1bn, they are are prepared to pay \u20ac1.3bn and a slight bonus on dividends and I think that tells you something about the Irish economy. \u201cIt also tells you something about the context of the Irish economy in Europe. Things have settled down now in the eurozone and there is an expectation of stability continuing and outside private investors are prepared to invest again.\u201d He told an audience of Irish business people he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d Ireland could get off EU and IMF support on schedule at the end of the year. \"We're getting there but we need further arrangements on the sustainability of the debt and we're negotiating those. We're reasonably confident that we will put those arrangements in place and exit the programme,\u201d he said. And with that it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back again tomorrow. Cyprus should get an international bailout by the end of March, a senior eurozone official has told Reuters. Thomas Wieser, head of the eurogroup working group, said that while no details of any bailout had been decided yet, he believed Cyprus' debt could be made sustainable without a sovereign debt restructuring or bank depositors taking losses. The country, hit by its exposure to Greece, needs a bailout of around \u20ac17bn. Earlier S&amp;P warned it saw a growing risk of the country defaulting. European markets have closed, and while the FTSE 100 has been boosted by hopes of further QE to lift the economy, elsewhere the picture is less positive. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 0.26% higher at 6395.37, yet another 5 year peak \u2022 Germany's Dax dipped 0.3% \u2022 France's Cac closed down 0.69% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 0.82% \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 0.76% \u2022 Despite the strikes, the Athens market added 0.12% \u2022 And away from Europe, in early trading the Dow Jones is down 0.16% Portugal, though, has warned that it may miss its own deficit reduction targets. Finance minster Vitor Gaspar warned MPs that the country could shrink by another 2% during 2013, not the 1% previously predicted by the government (economist were already gloomier). That means Lisbon would struggle to cut its deficit to 4.5% of GDP, from 5% in 2012. Gaspar suggested that Portugal might need another year's grace before getting its deficit below the 3% target set by the EU: It is reasonable to think that the European Commission can, at the right time, propose to the [European Union] to prolong by one year the time given to Portugal to correct its excessive budget deficit. Plenty of other interesting developments in the eurozone today. Spain's prime minister has predicted that the country's deficit for 2012 will come in below 7% of GDP. That doesn't mean it will necessarily hit the target of 6.3%, but is a sharp improvement on 2011's 9.4%. Mariano Rajoy made the comments during his State of the Nation address in parliament, where he also announced new measures to encourage firms to hire young people. Rajoy also defended his record: The first objective of this government is to turn around this situation... The reality is terribly hard, no green shoots or passing clouds or early spring... To those who are asking for relaxation, not a minute of relaxation or calmness. This has just started. The road to creating jobs is a long one. Here's a second video clip from Athens - showing people taking part in the anti-austerity protests: There's also an interview with Aleka Paparika, general secretary of the Communist Party of Greece, who explains why today's general strike and protests took place: The workers are suffering and they have only one choice, no other, and that is to resist as long as possible. British readers feeling the financial pinch should check out this graph tracking average earnings against inflation. It illustrates how pay packets have failed to keep pace with the cost of living since the financial crisis began. It's a clear explanation of why the UK economy is struggling, explains our economics editor Larry Elliott: The graph plots the growth rates in both wages and consumer prices and shows just how prolonged and intense the squeeze has been on living standards since the financial crisis began in 2007. In the first years of the 21st Century, wages always rose more quickly than prices, which meant consumer spending power increased year after year. Since 2007, there has not been one period when this has been the case, although for a time in 2008 and 2009 wages and prices were growing at the same rate. The gap widened in 2010-11 as commodity prices pushed up inflation and wages remained depressed, but narrowed in 2012 as inflation came down. In the past few months, however, the gap has widened again. The graph comes from today's unemployment data (see 10.50am). You can see the full report here (pdf). Here's Reuters' latest take on the Athens protests: Tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets of Athens on Wednesday as part of a nationwide strike against austerity that confined ferries to ports, shut schools and left hospitals with only emergency staff. Beating drums, blowing whistles and chanting \"Robbers, robbers!\" more than 60,000 people angry at wage cuts and tax rises marched to parliament in the biggest protest for months over austerity policies required by international lenders. In the capital, riot police fired tear gas at hooded youths hurling rocks and bottles during a demonstration, mostly of students and pensioners, which ended peacefully. The two biggest labour unions brought much of crisis-hit Greece to a standstill with a 24-hour protest strike against policies which they say deepen the hardship of people struggling through the country's worst peacetime downturn. Representing 2.5 million workers, the unions have gone on strike repeatedly since a debt crisis erupted in late 2009, testing the government's will to impose the painful conditions of an international bailout in the face of growing public anger. \"Today's strike is a new effort to get rid of the bailout deal and those who take advantage of the people and bring only misery,\" said Ilias Iliopoulos, secretary general of the ADEDY public sector union, which organised the walkout along with private sector union GSEE. \"A social explosion is very near,\" he told Reuters from a rally in a central Athens square as police helicopters clattered overhead. The protests in Greece appear to be over, although the general strike will continue for the rest of the day. Estimates of the number of people protesting in Athens vary from 60,000 to 100,000. Here's Theodora Oikonomides's latest round-up from the scene: Protests: in Athens (~70,000 people?) and Thessaloniki (~7,000 people?), plus Heraklion, Rethymno and Chania (Crete), Kalamata, Corinth and the Rio-Antirrio bridge near Patras (Peloponnese), Volos, Larissa and Karditsa (Central Greece), Preveza and Ioannina (NW Greece), Alexandroupolis and Komotini (Thrace), Drama (northern Greece), Mytilene (Lesbos, N. Aegean), Zakynthos (Ionian islands). Minor clashes reported in the Exarchia neighbourhood in downtown Athens. High participation of farmers who joined the demos with their tractors and who blocked traffic on the Athens-Thessaloniki highway at the Nikaia interexchange, where they have been staging a symbolic sit-in for 2 weeks. Water cannons were also on the streets of Athens today: Two more photos from Athens of clashes between a group of masked protestors and riot police. Should make clear that these appear to be an isolated incident, with most of today's marches passing off peacefully: That old image of Angela Merkel dressed in Nazi garb also got a run-out, on a poster held by a man with a noose around his neck: Back to Bulgaria.... where opposition politicians are demanding early general elections following the prime minister's resignation (see 8.42am onwards). Sergei Stanishev, head of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, insisted that the country couldn't wait for the poll scheduled for July: We need early elections because no government formed by this parliament can lead normal policy. Prime minister Boiko Borisov has stated that his party, which holds the most seats in parliament, will not take part in any talks to form a new coalition. That suggests that July's vote will be brought forward. Borisov's decision to quit after another night of occasionally bloody anti-austerity protests has been welcomed. As student Borislav Hadzhiev put it to Reuters: He made my day The truth is that we're living in an extremely poor country. Reuters confirms that there have been scuffles in Athens, and that police used teargas. From the terminal: Greek police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators in Athens on Wednesday as thousands of striking workers marched to parliament to protest austerity measures. Reuters reporters saw riot police fire a few rounds of teargas during minor scuffles with hooded youths hurling rocks and bottles. It appears that some clashes in Athens took place in the Exarchia area (a downtown part of the capital) - here's a photo from the scene of a rubbish bin upended and ablaze: One important development in Greece today is that many farmers are taking part in the protests. Theodora Oikonomides explains this is very significant as they are traditionally loyal supporters of New Democracy, the largest party in the Greek coalition government. Photos from Greece confirm large numbers of tractors at today's demos: Some demonstrators in Athens were wearing stickers asking riot police not to attack them. The slogan reads: Don't hit me. I'm demonstrating peacefully, it's my right Hearing of clashes between protesters and riot police in Athens, with those at the scene reporting flash grenades and teargas. More to follow! This video clip shows a protestor waving a home-made guillotine at riot police: Financial journalist Kostas Kallergis provides these photos of protesters face-to-face with riot police in Athens: Our videoclip from Athens shows how today's general strike has closed train stations and banks. Vox pop Interviews with people on the streets of Athens shows contrasting views \u2013 one man reckons the strike will achieve nothing as Greece must stick to its reform plans, while another argues that the \"incompetent people\" running the Greek government should quit. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's has warned that there's a growing danger of Cyprus defaulting on its debts. S&amp;P said the risk of a Cypriot sovereign default was \"material and rising\", as the country prepares to vote for its next president this weekend. With the country's financial aid package still to be agreed, S&amp;P cautioned investors that Cyprus could soon be downgraded from CCC+ (just three notches above default). This would happen if bailout talks fail, or if the next government cannot implement the financial reforms demanded by lenders. S&amp;P's head of EMEA sovereign ratings Moritz Kraemer said in a report: We see at least a one-in-three chance that we could lower the Cyprus sovereign ratings again in 2013, for example if official financial assistance from the ESM and/or IMF is not forthcoming, leaving the Cypriot authorities few choices apart from to restructure its financial obligations. We could also lower the ratings if we believe the (Cypriot) authorities are not able to fulfill the conditions that would be attached to an official assistance programme. Latest photos from Athens show that the PAME communist union demonstration was well-attended, with thousands of people marching into Syntagma Square: And here's a video clip of the PAME union march (click here if you can't see it below) With the Greek protests well underway, Theodora Oikonomides (who blogs and tweets as Irate Greek), kindly rounds up the details: 1. Athens: the communist affiliated union PAME has already marched to Syntagma square, while other unions (General Confederation of Workers GSEE, civil servants ADEDY) are still gathering near the National Museum to march through downtown. 2. Thessaloniki: All unions have started marching. 3. Provinces: marches reported by the #rbnews (see below) community in Heraklion and Chania (Crete), Kalamata and Corinth (Peloponnese), Larissa and Karditsa (central Greece), Preveza (western Greece), Alexandroupolis (Thrace). Likely that more locations will be reported throughout the day. 4. Extremely heavy police presence in downtown Athens, ID checks reported as far away as Aghia Paraskevi (10km from downtown). 5. Particularly noteworthy is the active presence of farmers in all demonstrations. They joined the PAME protest in Athens with tractors. In Karditsa and Larissa, protesters intend to join a roadblock set up by farmers on the Nikaia highway interexchange more than 10 days ago. #RBnews is shorthand for Radio Bubble, a citizen journalism initiative tracking the situation in Greece. A quick word on Britain's unemployment data, released this morning. It was the usual mixed picture -- the number of people out of work came in at 2.501 million, putting the jobless rate at 7.8% (up from last month's 7.7%). But there was a 12,500 drop in the number claiming jobseekers allowance, and the number of people in employment hit a new record high of 29.730 million. However, wage growth slowed to 1.4% per annum, meaning pay continued to lag inflation. More here. In the financial markets, the FTSE 100 has scurried over the 6,400 point mark to a new five-year high (my colleague Nick Fletcher has more details here) Traders are encouraged by the thought of yet more electronic money-printing from the Bank of England, and ignoring the underlying cause. FTSE 100: up 31 points at 6410, + 0.5% German DAX: up 10 points at 7763, + 0.14% French CAC: down 8 points at 3726, -0.24% Italian FTSE MIB: down 13 points at 16651, - 0.08% Spanish IBEX: down 15 points at 8230, - 0.2% The nagging question in the City, though, is how long can this rally last? A correction, or worse, feels inevitable at some stage... Protesters in the town of Kalamata in southern Greece raided their underwear drawers (or someone else's washing line!) to spell out their anti-austerity message: Today's strike in Greece is just a taste of the protests that will hit the country through this year, predicts Martin Koehring, Greece analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Koehring says that the strike shows \"the growing gap\" between the plight of ordinary Greeks and the demands of international creditors, and points out that another aid tranche is due next month..... The people of Greece are understandably disappointed that their situation is not improving despite the country continuing to receive bail-out loans since December last year. Indeed, the unemployment rate has soared to 27%, with youth unemployment at more than 61%. Meanwhile, the country's lenders are adamant that the government should shore up expenditure reduction through cuts in the public payroll. The headcount is supposed to be reduced by 150,000 by 2015 with 70,000 yet to leave. Production of a definitive quarterly schedule is the main \u2018prior action\u2019 for release of the March \u20ac2.8bn bail-out tranche. The government is thus caught between a rock and a hard place, trying to balance the demands of its domestic and foreign audiences. We expect political risk (social unrest and the instability of the fragile three-party government coalition) to remain a major focal point in Greece this year. Long-distance and suburban railway services in Greece are cancelled today by the strike: Athens metro and bus services are meant to be running as normal, although several central stations (including Syntagma) are being closed for a few hours on police orders. Back to Greece, where the anti-austerity general strike is well underway. A police helicopter has been circling over the centre of Athens this morning, and people on the ground report a strong police presence as union marches get underway. No reports of any clashes at this stage., but the protests appear well-supported: The news of a split at the heart of the Bank of England has sparked plenty of comment in the City. Here's some instant reaction: Crumbs - the Bank of England's monetary policy committee was split 6-3 on whether to leave Britain's quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn, or pump another \u00a325bn of new electronic money into the economy. And excitingly, Sir Mervyn King was one of the three doves who were outvoted. He, Paul Fisher and David Miles pushed for more QE, but were outvoted. The news has hit sterling, knocking 0.8 of a cent off the pound to $1.535 against the US dollar. That's a new eight-month low. The minutes of the meeting, just released, are online here. Bulgaria was due to hold a general election in July -- it's not clear yet whether this will be brought forward following Boiko Borisov's resignation. Either way, Bulgaria joins the growing list of EU countries where the government has been brought down by the financial crisis (including Italy and Greece in November 2011 and the Netherlands in April 2012*). * - Although Mark Rutte retained power after last autumn's Dutch general election Here are photos of the anti-austerity protests in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, last night which helped force the prime minister to resign this morning (see 8.42am): Breaking news from Bulgaria -- the government has resigned following weeks of protest against its austerity programme. Prime minister Boiko Borisov announced the dramatic development in parliament this morning, following violent clashes between police and demonstrators last night which resulted in 25 people being taken to hospital. Borisov told MPs: I will not participate in a government under which police are beating people. That was the latest in a series of large protests against the country's tough fiscal policies, which have led to high unemployment and slowing growth. Bulgarians are also furious over steep energy prices, which many people say are simply unaffordable. Borisov fired his unpopular finance minister, Simeon Djankov, on Monday, but that wasn't enough to calm the storm in Bulgaria. Djankov's policies had cut Bulgaria's deficit and helped keep the country's currency pegged to the euro (which it plans to join one day). But the population found the cost too high to bear, and it appears that last night's violence pushed Borisov into resigning. Demonstrations in Athens will begin shortly, as workers march to Syntagma Square - the scene of so many protests, and clashes, since the financial crisis began. The PAME union will begin its protest at 10.30am local time (8.30am GMT), with other groups starting 30 minutes later., and all converging on Syntagma. The ever-useful Living in Greece has rounded up the details (more here): \u2022 9:00: Farmers\u2019 market vendors to protest in Kaniggos Square. \u2014 Naftemporiki (in Greek) \u2022 10:00: Electric company union workers to rally outisde DEH offices. \u2014 Eleftherotypia (in Greek) \u2022 10:30: Health workers will gather outside the Ministry of Labor. \u2014 Naftemporiki (in Greek) \u202210:30: Seafarers and dock workers will gather at Karaiskaiki Square in Piraeus. \u2014 Naftemporiki (in Greek) \u2022 10:30: PAME to start rally at Omonia Square and converge with union protest in Syntagma. \u2014 PAME Press Release (in Greek). \u2022 11:00: Union rally to start at Pedion tou Areos and move to Syntagma Square. \u2014 To Vima (in Greek) Greek university lecturer Spyros Gkelis helpfully tweets a list of employees taking part in today's general strike: Good morning, and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events across the global economy. The first major anti-austerity protest of 2013 is underway in Greece, as workers across the country hold a general strike. Big demonstrations are expected in Athens, as the people once again express their anger against the spending cuts, tax rises, and other measures being implemented in return for its aid package. The strike has been called by Greece's two main unions \u2013 GSEE (private sector) and ADEDY (public sector). The communist PAME union is also supporting the action. Schools, hospitals, municipal services and transport links are \u2013 as usual \u2013 all expected to be disrupted, while many offices are also likely to be hit. GSEE said the nationwide strike was: Our answer to the dead-end policies that have squeezed the life out of workers, impoverished society and plunged the economy into recession and crisis. Our struggle will continue for as long as these policies are implemented. The strike puts more pressure on Antonis Samaras's government, days before its international lenders send officials back to Athens to assess the country's progress. We'll be tracking the action in Greece across the day. Also coming up.... the latest UK unemployment data, and the minutes from the Bank of England's monthly meeting, both at 9.30am GMT. They should give insight into the state of the British economy.",

This would happen if bailout talks fail, or if the next government cannot implement the financial reforms demanded by lenders.</p> <p>S&amp;P's head of EMEA sovereign ratings Moritz Kraemer said in a report:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We see at least a one-in-three chance that we could lower the Cyprus sovereign ratings again in 2013, for example if official financial assistance from the ESM and/or IMF is not forthcoming, leaving the Cypriot authorities few choices apart from to restructure its financial obligations.</p> <p>We could also lower the ratings if we believe the (Cypriot) authorities are not able to fulfill the conditions that would be attached to an official assistance programme.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-046a3eec-d5e5-406c-b8c2-ab325bb1f641\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/20/1361360930823/3702b124-611c-44fb-9c56-6a4a9a8f619b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Right-wing opposition leader and presidential candidate Nicos Anastasiades  speaks to the media during a press conference at his campaign in capital Nicosia, Cyprus, Sunday, Feb. 17, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyprus's rightwing opposition leader Nicos Anastasiades, who is the favourite to win this weekend's presidential runoff vote.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has been left with egg on his face as a result of the 4G auction. What looked like one heck of a wheeze for the chancellor at the time of his autumn statement does not look nearly so clever now that the sell-off has garnered much less than expected. A short-term political stunt designed to wrong-foot Ed Balls, his Labour shadow, has backfired. Here's what happened. In 2000 when the Labour government sold off the 3G licences, the dotcom boom was in full swing and the mobile phone companies assumed that they would make a mint from owning a chunk of the airwaves. They paid a whopping \u00a322.5bn for the licences, which the then chancellor Gordon Brown used to pay off a slice of the national debt. There have been two big developments since. The first is the changed economic climate. Britain's economy has been flat-lining for the past two years and in the broader global economy any recovery from the recession of 2008-09 has been dogged by setbacks. The second factor is that mobile companies quickly realised they were not the real beneficiaries of expanding the bandwidth: instead firms such as Google and Apple were the real winners. Nobody in Whitehall seriously expected the mobile companies to pay \u00a322.5bn a second time, but it was still hoped that the auction would raise \u00a33.5bn. This was a tidy enough sum, but not actually in the bag. By pretending it was, however, Osborne was able to say in his autumn statement that net public borrowing would fall in this financial year. After a poor run of financial data this had looked highly improbable, but by banking the \u00a33.5bn in advance Osborne could say deficit reduction was still on track. Without the proceeds from 4G, he could not have made this claim \u2013 a fact he omitted to mention in his speech. Balls was, indeed, wrong-footed. He was completely thrown by Osborne's sleight of hand, much to the merriment of coalition MPs. But the fact that the auction raised only \u00a32.3bn now makes it touch and go whether the borrowing forecasts made in the autumn statement will be met, even using the chancellor's questionable accounting methods. There is a silver lining to this cloud. The roll-out of mobile broadband after the sale of the 3G licences was slower than it ought to have been because the mobile companies had paid over the odds and were therefore short of funds to invest. That should not be the case this time: the benefits of expanding bandwidth should be felt much more quickly, with beneficial effects to the economy. Osborne could still be spared the embarrassment of having to admit that borrowing will, after all, go up this year, but only if Thursday's deficit data shows that tax receipts in January \u2013 normally a bumper month for the exchequer due to the payment of self-assessed income tax \u2013 were surprisingly strong. These will be the last set of public finance figures before next month's budget and, as things stand, the chancellor will have to again use smoke and mirrors in order to pretend things are better than they are. He is left diminished by this affair.",

They paid a whopping \u00a322.5bn for the licences, which the then chancellor Gordon Brown used to pay off a slice of the national debt.</p> <p>There have been two big developments since. The first is the changed economic climate. Britain's economy has been flat-lining for the past two years and in the broader global economy any recovery from the recession of 2008-09 has been dogged by setbacks. The second factor is that mobile companies quickly realised they were not the real beneficiaries of expanding the bandwidth: instead firms such as Google and Apple were the real winners.</p> <p>Nobody in Whitehall seriously expected the mobile companies to pay \u00a322.5bn a second time, but it was still hoped that the auction would raise \u00a33.5bn. This was a tidy enough sum, but not actually in the bag. By pretending it was, however, Osborne was able to say in his autumn statement that net public borrowing would fall in this financial year.</p> <p>After a poor run of financial data this had looked highly improbable, but by banking the \u00a33.5bn in advance Osborne could say deficit reduction was still on track. Without the proceeds from 4G, he could not have made this claim \u2013 a fact he omitted to mention in his speech.</p> <p>Balls was, indeed, wrong-footed. He was completely thrown by Osborne's sleight of hand, much to the merriment of coalition MPs. But the fact that the auction raised only \u00a32.3bn now makes it touch and go whether the borrowing forecasts made in the autumn statement will be met, even using the chancellor's questionable accounting methods.</p> <p>There is a silver lining to this cloud. The roll-out of mobile broadband after the sale of the 3G licences was slower than it ought to have been because the mobile companies had paid over the odds and were therefore short of funds to invest. That should not be the case this time: the benefits of expanding bandwidth should be felt much more quickly, with beneficial effects to the economy.</p> <p>Osborne could still be spared the embarrassment of having to admit that borrowing will, after all, go up this year, but only if Thursday's deficit data shows that tax receipts in January \u2013 normally a bumper month for the exchequer due to the payment of self-assessed income tax \u2013 were surprisingly strong. These will be the last set of public finance figures before next month's budget and, as things stand, the chancellor will have to again use smoke and mirrors in order to pretend things are better than they are. He is left diminished by this affair.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The City was bracing itself for fresh stimulus from the Bank of England on Wednesday night after it emerged that the outgoing governor Sir Mervyn King is pressing for additional electronic money creation to boost growth. Sterling fell sharply on the foreign exchanges following the release of the minutes of the February meeting of the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) which showed King joining two other policy makers \u2013 David Miles and Paul Fisher \u2013 in voting for an extra \u00a325bn in quantitative easing (QE). The governor lost the vote on the nine-strong committee by six votes to three but financial markets were taken aback by evidence that the MPC had a full-blown debate about what it could do to next to help the UK's weak economy. The City had expected only Miles to vote in favour of increasing the QE programme to \u00a3400bn and the minutes triggered a fall in sterling; it ended the day at its lowest level in 17 months when measured against a basket of world currencies. The pound lost more than more than a cent against the dollar to close at just below $1.53, while the euro rose to 87.645 pence, its highest level for more than a year. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, attacked George Osborne by seizing on a section of the minutes that warned that the Bank could not transform the outlook for growth on its own and that \"other authorities\" might need to use \"targeted interventions to boost demand the supply capacity of the economy.\" Balls said: \"The Bank of England is losing patience with this chancellor. With interest rates at record lows and billions of quantitative easing already tried, there is only so much more the Bank of England can do through monetary policy. \"George Osborne must finally heed the warnings and realise that his fiscal policies, which have crushed growth and confidence in our economy, must now change before more long-term damage is done.\" The minutes show that King, Miles and Fisher argued further action to stimulate activity was needed to prevent \"potentially lasting destruction of productive capacity and increases in unemployment\". Although inflation is expected to be above the government's 2% target for the next two years, the three dissenting voices on the committee said they did not think additional QE would lead to further upward pressure on the cost of living. Those opposing further QE said the Bank had already given a \"substantial\" stimulus to the economy and expressed concern that QE was becoming less effective. With inflation already above target, there was a risk further asset purchases would send the wrong signal to the public.",

Management has clearly decided to re-base the dividend as, on our estimates, it could grow the dividend modestly but had little spare cash to invest in the business. Prudence rather than a large loss seems to have driven the cut. </blockquote> <p>Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon moved from hold to sell and cut his target price from 130p to 120p. He said:</p> <blockquote> RSA has removed a key prop in its valuation case by cutting the final dividend by 33% and rebasing 2013 by a similar amount. We are now forecasting 2013 dividend at 6.1p per share from 9.62p per share previously. <br> According to RSA the background to the cut which was not flagged was due to the impact of lower bond yields which have lowered earnings by around\u00a3200m. According to RSA the pay-out ratio was approaching 95% and this gave little scope to grow the business even if earnings would recover as we anticipated.  Given that 12 months ago RSA flagged that the rate of dividend growth was to reduce from around 6% to around 2%-2.5% we view the cut as very disappointing given that nothing has materially changed over the last 12 months. </blockquote> <p>However Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital kept his buy recommendation:</p> <blockquote> Once the dust settles we urge investors to revisit the shares and indeed we would view such weakness as a buying opportunity due to the prospects for the group outside the UK and the expectations for good return on equity delivery in the coming years. <br> </blockquote> <p>News of the dividend cut has unsettled the whole sector, with <strong>Aviva</strong> shares down 11.8p at 357.4p.</p> <p>And it has helped push the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> marginally into the red, down 1.91 points to 6377.16 after its recent rally to new five year highs.</p> <p><strong>Rexam</strong>, the beverage can maker, has risen to the top of the pile, up 22.2p to 498.9p after underlying profits rose 1% to \u00a3418m, excluding its personal care business which was sold in July.</p>",

Prudence rather than a large loss seems to have driven the cut. Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon moved from hold to sell and cut his target price from 130p to 120p. He said: RSA has removed a key prop in its valuation case by cutting the final dividend by 33% and rebasing 2013 by a similar amount. We are now forecasting 2013 dividend at 6.1p per share from 9.62p per share previously. According to RSA the background to the cut which was not flagged was due to the impact of lower bond yields which have lowered earnings by around\u00a3200m. According to RSA the pay-out ratio was approaching 95% and this gave little scope to grow the business even if earnings would recover as we anticipated. Given that 12 months ago RSA flagged that the rate of dividend growth was to reduce from around 6% to around 2%-2.5% we view the cut as very disappointing given that nothing has materially changed over the last 12 months. However Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital kept his buy recommendation: Once the dust settles we urge investors to revisit the shares and indeed we would view such weakness as a buying opportunity due to the prospects for the group outside the UK and the expectations for good return on equity delivery in the coming years. News of the dividend cut has unsettled the whole sector, with Aviva shares down 11.8p at 357.4p. And it has helped push the FTSE 100 marginally into the red, down 1.91 points to 6377.16 after its recent rally to new five year highs. Rexam, the beverage can maker, has risen to the top of the pile, up 22.2p to 498.9p after underlying profits rose 1% to \u00a3418m, excluding its personal care business which was sold in July.",

In a surprise result that could redraw the power balance between the UK's four mobile phone networks, each has come away with a slice of the most valuable airwaves in the lower frequency bands needed to provide coverage beyond towns and cities and into rural areas.
