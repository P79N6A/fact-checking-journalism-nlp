      "bodyText": "When the world's second richest person has a brainwave he believes could make everyone better off, the world listens. Earlier this week Carlos Slim, a Mexican telecoms billionaire worth $72bn (\u00a342bn), called for a global three-day working week. The upside is twice as much leisure time; the downside is longer days and workers carrying on into their 70s. It is a work-hard, play-hard ethic that many of the world's billionaires might subscribe to, but it would be a huge change for most workers and their employers. Yet there are shifts going on in the UK labour market that show Slim might be on to something \u2013 such as more flexible working and more part-timers. Unions might be wary, but technology, increases in life expectancy, and cost pressures from commuting and soaring house prices are all encouraging a more flexible approach to work. We asked experts to tell us whether Slim's vision for a three-day working week could work \u2013 and what its impact would be. David Kern Chief economist, BCC It's a very interesting idea. In many professions it would be possible \u2013 in creative businesses, among consultants and accountants for example. But it could be damaging in those areas where you have a lot of people working with the public, for example local authorities and the civil service. Some workers would be happier and more productive, but for others, working 11 hours a day would not appeal. A working week of 33 hours would be a major decline in the number of hours worked, creating a big hole, and I don't think productivity would increase enough to compensate. It's too extreme to jump from the current situation to a three-day working week. It is worth exploring how people's working time might be reorganised, but small businesses would find it very difficult to organise themselves in such a way. Sir Ian Cheshire Chief executive, Kingfisher The idea of a three-day week is in principle interesting as part of a wider trend in the workplace to much more flexible patterns of working to suit lifestyles, older workers, multiple job holders and career re-entry. Companies should look at this as a way of tapping into talent pools that they can't attract with old-style five-day weeks, and technology has facilitated this massively. The only issue for businesses like ours will be maintaining teamwork and consistent customer service when teams are not always together, but leadership businesses that adapt to this new reality will get the best talent. Paul Sellers Policy officer, TUC It chimes with what people want in the UK \u2013 not necessarily a three-day week but more flexibility in where and when they work. While there are many people underemployed, some people are overemployed and would prefer to work fewer hours. For us, the big question is what do people want, and the idea that we'd all go to a three-day week is perhaps not what most people would want. Working anything more than 12 hours a day on a regular basis is getting into unhealthy territory. For some people it would mean moving to a shift pattern which could have a social impact, cutting people off from their circle, including family. Mike Emmott Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development Carlos Slim is right that people should carry on working into their 70s. It can be a positive development for many people, especially if they are interested in their work and want to maintain their work-related social life. Long days are not necessarily bad. It depends on the scheduling and how people work, like when they take breaks and the support they receive. There are already lots of people working five days [worth of hours] in only four [days]. It saves travelling every day. There is the risk that people will work three long days but still monitor their emails and smartphones on the other days, stretching their working week. Philip Booth Institute of Economic Affairs Work patterns are incredibly varied compared with 30 years ago. Ultimately, such things are an outcome of the diverse and subjective preferences of employees and of the benefits to employers of different approaches to organising work. If employees would prefer to work 12 hours a day for three days rather than seven hours for five days, employers would offer that option. If it doesn't affect productivity they would get better employees for a given level of wages. But it is not clear why employees should want their leisure in bigger chunks. It sounds like a childcare nightmare. Many of the 4.5 million self-employed can already decide how to organise their time. For the rest, let's leave it to employers and employees to sort it out. John Philpott thejobseconomist.org Carlos Slim obviously thinks a slim working week suits his businesses, but not everyone will agree. Lots of people are already working overtime for free, and this could make that situation worse. If an employee can reorder their work and cram their productivity into three days then it would be fine, but if they can't their wages would go down and they would be effectively paying for the extra leisure time. It could suit a professional or a researcher who can get their job done over 12 hours without additional pressures, but in blue-collar jobs extending the day may not be feasible. And a worker who deals with customers all day is going to be exhausted by the end of their shift.",

Can the company find a way back into one of the world's fastest developing healthcare markets? And what will be the implications of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the drug maker's sales practices around the world?

With the situation as it is, it was probably difficult for him to say much.

This statement was designed to allay fears about the SFO inquiry. But shareholders will be wary. A company as large as GSK and with operations in so many countries where corruption is endemic will find it difficult to stay clean, no matter how hard it tries. As Witty said: \"In a company of our size operating in almost every country in the world there's always a small potential for some people to step outside procedure.\" According to the last Transparency International corruption perceptions index, which ranks countries according how corrupt people believe public organisations to be, many of GSK's markets are far more corrupt than China.

The final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 2.81 points higher at 6798.15 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.2% to 9753.56 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.16% at 4376.32 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB dipped 0.2% to 20,831.26 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.1% ahead at 10,659.1 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 24 points or 0.14% after the IMF cut its growth forecasts. On that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back tomorrow. The International Monetary Fund has cut its US growth forecast for 2014 from the 2% it expected in June to 1.7%. The reduction was due to lower than expected growth in the first quarter, mainly weather related. US GDP contracted at a 2.0% annual rate in the first three months of the year. But the IMF said the pace should pick up to 3% to 3.5% for the rest of the year, and stay at 3% next year and in 2016. After the Spanish central bank earlier revised up its economic forecasts, Spanish 10 year bond yields have hit a low of 2.543%. Consumer confidence in the eurozone fell sharply in July, according to the latest figures from the European Commission, hitting its worst level since April. An early estimate for the month showed confidence fell to -8.4 compared to a June figure that was revised marginally down from -7.4 to -7.5. This is worse than the forecast -7.5. In the European Union as a whole, confidence fell from -4.3 in June to -5.5. On a lighter note.... Tesco has been forced to remove a photo of its next chief financial officer from its website after Marks &amp; Spencer complained. M&amp;S pointed out that Alan Stewart (dispatched on gardening leave after being poached by Tesco), still works for them. To recap.... Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that a dangerous housing bubble could develop if UK interest rates remain at record lows for too long. Carney also told an audience in Glasgow that rates \"will need to start to rise\" when the economy normalises, but insisted that he doesn't know when the first hike will come. Earlier, the minutes of the BoE's last monetary policy committee showed that policymakers may be inching towards raising rates. But the MPC is also concerned that wage growth has been \"strikingly weak\", suggesting there may be more slack to be mopped up before the time comes to tighten monetary policy . Some economists reckon the first rate rise will come in November, with the 9-0 consensus probably being shattered next month. John Bulford, economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, reckons August will be a big month for the BoE. \u201cThe MPC has reached a cross roads, and next month\u2019s inflation report should give us a much clearer picture of the road the MPC will go down. In contrast to the previous inflation report, which signalled that interest rates would remain on hold for some time, the inflation report in August will be a lot more balanced in its conclusions. The Bank\u2019s estimate of slack will almost certainly have narrowed, although this will be accompanied with a greater degree of uncertainty. Overall, this should result in a more hawkish steer. In other news.... The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development says it will not approve new investments in Russia Lithuania has been given the final approval to join the eurozone Spain's central bank has predicted stronger growth in 2014 and 2015 than expected But there's no improvement in French industrial confidence The flow of loans into Russia from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have been turned off, in the latest twist over the Ukraine crisis. The EBRD has announced that it will not make any new investments in Russia \"for the time being\", following the sanctions announced by the EU last week. Almost one in five EBRD loans this year have gone to Russia -- and the bank has no plans to pull out altogether. It says: The Bank will continue to manage its portfolio of existing projects and client relationships in Russia. The Bank will also continue to maintain its physical presence there. Mark Carney is now fielding questions from members of the public in Glasgow, having given his speech (coverage starts here) He's explaining that he doesn't know when rates will rise, but believes the new normal will be \"materially less\" than in the past. Carney also cautioned that the UK economy is still going through \"extraordinary times\". It's official - Lithuania will become the newest member of the eurozone on January 2015. European ministers have just given their approval in Brussels. Governor Carney is looking terribly suave in Glasgow: The Bank of England would be risking a dangerous housing bubble and a return to recession if it left interest rates at an all-time low for too long, its governor said. Mark Carney said rising housing prices could result in households taking on more mortgage debt to afford a new home, limiting their ability to spend money on other things are dragging the economy back into contraction. \u201cThe Bank is well aware that a prolonged period of historically low interest rates could encourage other risks to develop. In the UK, the biggest risks are associated with the housing market,\u201d he said, speaking in Glasgow at the Commonwealth Games business conference. He added: \u201cHistory shows that the British people do everything they can to pay their mortgages. That means cutting back deeply on expenditures when the unexpected happens. If a lot of people are highly indebted, that could tip the economy into recession.\u201d Carney said that while the Bank\u2019s job was not to control house prices, it was concerned about the impact rising household debt would have on the wider economy. For this reason, it had intervened last month to limit the volume of high loan to income mortgages that lenders would be permitted to approve. It has also introduced tougher mortgage rules to ensure that borrowers could withstand a rise in interest rates. The governor said that although GDP was back at pre-crisis levels, the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee would not raise rates rates until real wages rising consistently. Bank rate has been held at 0.5% since March 2009 (and we learned this morning that the MPC voted 9-0 to leave them unchanged this month) \u201cThe UK economy is starting to head back to normal. The economy is finally producing as much as it did on the eve of the crisis in 2008, and inflation is back near its 2% target. \u201cA key judgment for the [Bank\u2019s rate-setting] Monetary Policy Committee is when and to what extent these developments will translate into real wage growth, and in turn that wage growth into price pressures.\u201d Carney repeated the MPC\u2019s message that once rates did start to rise from an all-time low of 0.5%, increases would be \u201cgradual and limited\u201d because risks to the economy would take \u201csome time to die down\u201d. He said that businesses he had visited understood that any rises would be gradual, encouraging them to hire and invest with an eye on the medium term. Mark Carney's speech is online here. Important point -- Mark Carney is talking about how interest rates \"will\" need to start rising as the economy improves. Here's the key section from his speech in Glasgow. As the economy normalises, Bank Rate will need to start to rise in order to achieve the inflation target. But the MPC has no pre-set course and the timing of any increases in interest rates will be determined by the data. Chris Giles of the FT reckons it's a significant change: Over in Glasgow, Mark Carney is starting to give his speech to the Commonwealth Games Business Conference. Here are the newswire snaps: BANK OF ENGLAND'S CARNEY - NO PRE-SET COURSE FOR RATE HIKES, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY DATA BOE BALANCING INFLATION IMPLICATIONS FROM \"SUSTAINED ECONOMIC MOMENTUM\" VS CONFLICTING SIGNALS OF LABOUR MARKET SLACK -CARNEY WAGES SUGGEST MORE SUPPLY IN LABOUR MARKET THAN BOE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT -CARNEY SPARE CAPACITY BEING USED UP \"A BIT MORE QUICKLY THAN WE HAD EXPECTED\" -CARNEY BOE GIVING CLEAR GUIDANCE THAT RATE RISES, WHEN THEY BEGIN, TO BE GRADUAL AND LIMITED -CARNEY APPRECIATION OF STERLING OVER PAST YEAR IS ONE OF HEADWINDS FACING UK ECONOMY -CARNEY The speech is titled \"Winning the economic marathon\" (nice to see an athletics reference rather than one of Mervyn King's football or cricketing metaphores) Glaxo is holding a conference call with journalists now to explain its (rather underwhelming) results. My colleague Julia Kollewe is tweeting the key points. (that's a reference to the allegations of bribery in China that have rocked GSK) This isn't the first time Glaxo has disappointed the markets over sales growth prospects, points out the WSJ's Helen Thomas: Shares in GlaxoSmithKline have just dropped 3% after the company's latest financial results hit the wires. And they don't look great results, at first glance anyway. Revenues are down 3% in the first half of the year, with its consumer healthcare division reporting a 4% drop in sales. GSK also reported a \"strong performance\" in emerging markets where sales jumped 11%. But its core earnings figure has missed expectations (at 19.1p per share, versus predictions of 21.3p per share). Just in.... the European Commission has reported that the overall eurozone government deficit widened slightly in the first three months of 2024. According to the EC, the seasonally adjusted general government deficit to GDP ratio stood at 2.7% in the euro area, \"nearly stable\" compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, when it was 2.6%. More details here Lithuania is due to get the final green light to join the euro today, at the EU foreign ministers meeting. Finance minister Rimantas Sadzius has already been touting the benefits, at a time of geopolitical uncertainty. A reminder that Mark Carney will be speaking in Glasgow this lunchtime, at the Commonwealth Games Business Conference. David Cameron will also be there -- our politics liveblog is on the case.... Takings at Britain's retailers have jumped this month, and shop managers are more optimistic about the prospects for August as well. The CBI's monthly survey \"distributive trades survey\". just released, beat forecasts with a balance of +21, up from +4 in June. That means many more shops are seeing higher sales this month. Sales expectations for August also rallied, to +36. That chimes with the idea that consumer spending is still driving the recovery. Bang on cue, here's Berenberg's Rob Wood explaining that wage growth holds the key to when UK interest rates will rise: It is unlikely a majority [on the MP] would favour a hike unless pay growth perks up over the next four months. Given the strength of some surveys, we expect that to happen by November. Of course, it is not a nailed on certainty. The Institute of Directors wants the Bank of England to crack on and start raising interest rates soon, get them back to between 3% and 4% by 2016. Here's their chief economist, James Sproule: \u201cWe remain concerned that there is insufficient appreciation that we are experiencing extraordinary monetary policy, and it should not be assumed that such extraordinary policy can continue. \u201cLooking ahead two years, we would like to be reaching a point where monetary policy could again be effective, which means interest rates in the range of 3-4%. The economic recovery is strong enough that the time has come to be making progress towards that medium term goal. Only once monetary policy has been normalised, interest rates can be an effective policy tool.\" Perhaps the IoD should ponder the Bank's concern about weak wages. A few inflation-busting pay rises from British firms would help fix the problem.... James Knightley of ING reckons the Bank of England \"continues to inch towards hiking rates\", and will probably act in four months time. He says: These minutes suggest that the debate on rate hikes is starting to open up, especially with the concluding line stating that while the MPC \u201cagreed that no increase was warranted at this meeting\u2026 for some members the decision had become more balanced in the past few months than earlier in the year\u201d. The 9-0 consensus could split in August, Knightley adds, when the Bank publishes its new set of economic forecasts. Martin Weale, who voted for a rate rise in the January-July 2011 period, would be amongst the favourites to do so, but we have to remember there has been quite a lot of churn on the committee in recent months so there could be others. And ING reckons the first rate hike will come in November, followed by \"very slow and steady additional tightening of perhaps 25bp per quarter thereafter\". It looks \"pretty balanced as to whether the first interest rate hike will come late this year or early in 2015\", says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. Reaction is coming in... Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, says the minutes left the markets \"a little disappointed\". Some traders had expected more hawkish signals. The pound is now down 0.3 of a cent at $1.7033. The Bank minutes take 11 lines to outline the argument for raising interest rates, and under nine lines to explain why not. It could mean the minute-writers have refined the art of explaining why rates should remain unchanged; after more than five years of practice... The Bank of England minutes also include two references to financial markets showing little reaction to geopolitical risks. Here's the first: Oil prices had also risen during June in response to the conflict in Iraq, a major producer and the potential source for much of the increase in OPEC supply in coming years. But prices had fallen back since the second half of June, leaving them little changed on the month. It was difficult to assess how much this reflected news about the ultimate balance of demand and supply for oil, and, more generally, it was notable that prices had remained in a tight range around $110 per barrel since the second half of 2012, despite numerous economic and geopolitical risks having emerged over that time. And the second: By and large, however, global financial markets continued to be relatively unresponsive to both economic risks and geopolitical events. Market measures of uncertainty about future asset prices suggested that, for a wide range of assets, it was surprisingly low. This is becoming a theme. Last week a member of the Bank's Financial Policy Committee, Donald Kohn, told MPs that said the market tendency to ignore geopolitical risk was \"just bizarre\". The minutes are online here, by the way. There's no major reaction in the financial markets, with the pound now flat against the US dollar. The minutes also show that some Bank of England policymakers pondered whether to experiment with a small rate rise now, just to see how people reacted. The minutes say: A rise in Bank Rate at a time when the economy was growing strongly would facilitate a more gradual path thereafter and would allow the Committee to evaluate the sensitivity of households, firms and financial markets to changes in interest rates, following a long period during which Bank Rate had remained unchanged. Some members of the MPC are clearly worried that raising interest rates now would be a blunder, given the state of the global economy, The minutes say: There were early signs that global growth was weakening, and an unexpected increase in interest rates when real wages were not yet rising could lead to an outsized reaction in asset prices and destabilise the recovery. On the central projection from May, conditioned on very gradual increases in interest rates, inflation had been forecast to return to the 2% target only after three years. A premature tightening in monetary policy might leave the economy vulnerable to shocks, with the effectiveness of any further stimulus uncertain. The Bank of England is concerned, though, that people's earnings aren't increasing faster, especially as inflation jumped to 1.9% last month. The minutes say: The weakness of wages in the face of strong rises in employment was becoming more striking, and there was reason to believe both that reductions in labour market slack were taking longer to affect wage growth, and that the effective supply of labour had increased. The minutes of the MPC meeting confirm that some members of the committee are considering whether to vote to raise rates: The Committee agreed that no increase was warranted at this meeting, although for some members the decision had become more balanced in the past few months than earlier in the year. Here we go...and the top line news is that the Bank of England voted 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged at their record low of 0.5%. But there's plenty of detail lurking..... Nearly time for the Bank of England minutes... Better news from Spain -- the Spanish central bank has revised up its economic forecasts for 2014 and 2015. The Bank of Spain now expects to see growth of 1.3% this year, up from 1.2% previously, and hiked next year's forecast to 2.0%, up from 1.7%. It also predicts that the Spanish economy grew by 0.5% in the April-June quarter, which would be a slight acceleration after 0.4% growth in the first quarter. After suffering a deep recession and tough austerity measures, Spain's economy does appear to be on the mend. But with one in four adults still out of work, the job is far from finished. There's no pick-up in confidence among French factories, according to the latest survey from stats body INSEE. INSEE's monthly measure of the manufacturing business climate remained at its lowest level since September 2013 at just 97, below its long-term average. More here. It's another worrying signal from France, with economists fearing its economy is stagnating this year. Gloucestershire-based engineering firm Renishaw will not be pleased to see sterling bobbing around two-year highs against the euro, though. It reported an 11% tumble in adjusted full-year pretax profits for the last year this morning, from \u00a379.2m to \u00a370m. And the strong pound took most of the blame \u2013 Renishaw's profits would have been \u00a36.8m higher if the pound had stuck at last year's levels. The euro is dropping this morning, down to its lowest level against the US dollar this year. 08:19: EURO FALLS TO 8-MONTH LOW VERSUS DOLLAR OF $1.3455 08:22: EURO FALLS TO NEAR 2-YEAR LOW VERSUS STERLING OF 78.835 PENCE The euro has been weakening recently in the face of geopolitical pressures, as Jeremy Cook of World First explains: Some are keen to paint this as a response to European foreign ministers possibly considering new sanctions on Russia at their meeting in Brussels yesterday. That should please UK holidaymakers heading over (or under) the Channel \u2013 and also cheer the European Central Bank, as a weaker euro should deliver some much-needed inflation. Here's a factoid for the Bank of England to ponder -- the cost of the average London house has soared by \u00a343,115, or 8.2%, since the start of 2014. That's almost \u00a3240 per day - or more than twice the average weekly wage across the UK. Salford comes out as the most sizzling hotspot, with the MediaCity development helping to drive prices up 12% so far this year, according to Zoopla. Here's our story: MediaCity leads to Salford becoming the UK's property hotspot And here's a nifty graphic from City AM . Today's Bank of England minutes could also show whether any policymakers reckon most of the 'slack' in the UK economy has been mopped up. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons: The tone of the debate is likely to be of more interest to the markets that any change in voting patterns. It would be surprising if the voting patterns did change from the 9-0-0, but any signs of a shift in thinking with respect to the amount of spare capacity in the economy could well be considered hawkish. Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics reckon today's minutes will \"probably\" show that the Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously again to keep official interest rates on hold. But the rise in UK inflation could cause some jitters. Admittedly, the MPC would have seen June\u2019s consumer prices figures showing that CPI inflation rose from 1.5% to 1.9% in June. However, this was only slightly above the 1.8% estimate in May\u2019s Inflation Report, and the spike seems likely to be temporary. Paul Fisher has also addressed allegations that the Bank of England turned a blind eye to foreign exchange traders rigging the market. In today's interview, he claims that the idea that the Bank behaved improperly is a \u201cnon-story\" (let's see if the inquiry launched by the BoE comes to the same conclusion...). And he's scathing about some of the misconduct exposed: What\u2019s really shocking is the collusion between traders across firms. These firms are supposed to be ferociously competitive, so how come their traders were talking to each other and arranging things between them? One of the Bank of England's senior policy makers has claimed today that its actions saved the UK economy from a much grimmer fate. Savers, and some economists, have bemoaned the ultra-loose and unconventional monetary policy implemented by the Bank since 20008. But Paul Fisher, who has just left the MPC after five years, has declared that they have delivered the recovery. He was speaking to The Independent, which reports: Mr Fisher trenchantly defends those decisions made at the height of the crisis. He pays tribute to the \u201ctremendous\u201d efforts of his colleagues in the market team \u201cwho really did pull all the stops out to try to turn the economy round\u201d. Mr Fisher also argues that QE, along with the Bank\u2019s Funding for Lending Scheme which subsidises credit to banks, were responsible for the recovery that finally kicked in last year. \u201cA number of our policies had very big powerful effects on the recovery phase, and, without doubt, things would have been much worse if we hadn\u2019t stuck to our guns\u201d he says Critics of QE, though, argue that it's hurt pensioners by driving down the rate of return on government bonds, and also driven up asset prices -- shoring up the rich. Here's the full piece: Paul Fisher: \u2018The Bank delivered the recovery\u2019 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, business and the eurozone. Are Britain's central bankers inching closer to raising interest rates, after more than five years of record low borrowing costs? We'll find out this morning, when the minutes of the Bank of England's latest monetary policy committee meeting are released at 9.30am. Economists reckon it will be the last meeting where every MPC member voted to leave rates at just 0.5% -- but there's always a chance that a hawk hopped off the fence and voted to raise borrowing costs. We'll also be hearing from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, around lunchtime, when he gives a speech at the Commonwealth Games Trade and Investment conference (from 12.45pm). What else is afoot? Well, stock markets are expected to dip back a little as geopolitical tensions swirl. As Stan Shamu of IG puts it: While Russian equities and the ruble enjoyed some reprieve in yesterday\u2019s trade, the repercussions from recent events are far from over. Here's IG's opening calls: FTSE: 6780 -15 German DAX: 9712 -22 French CAC: 4365 -5 Spanish IBEX: 10628 -21 Italian FTSE MIB: 20785 -89 Most Asian markets have risen overnight, though. In the eurozone, the latest consumer confidence figures are due at 3pm BST \u2013 they'll show if recent weak economic data from the likes of France have spooked Europeans. And there's financial results from Capita (profits up 11%), TalkTalk (revenues and subscribers up), and engineering firm Renishaw (profits hit by strong pound). So, something of a summer lull, but we'll do our best. Shout if I've missed something....",

Goldman Sachs said:</p> <blockquote> The announced equalization payment of around $240m is well below our estimated value of $450m (to keep private Kazakhmys cash positive through the end of the decade) and hence a positive for Kazakhmys shares. We view KAZ Minerals as an attractive company, comprising the low-cost east mines as well as the Bozshakol, Aktogay and Koksay growth projects - making it a cash-generative growth stock, on our estimates. <br> However, we estimate free cash flow would remain significantly negative in 2015/16 owing to capex commitments and we forecast a stretched balance sheet...raising concerns over a potential covenant breach. </blockquote> <p>Among the other mining groups, <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> was 12p better at 2066.5p after it beat full year guidance for iron ore production by 4%. Rival <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 54p to \u00a333.91.</p> <p>Overall, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished up just 2.81 points at 6798.15, after trading as low as 6773 and as high as 6822. Despite the continuing uncertainties in Ukraine and Gaza, investors seemed to feel much of the geopolitical tension had begun to ease. Positive trading news from <strong>Capita</strong>, up 55p to \u00a312.10, helped support the market, but a disappointing update at lunchtime from <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>, which slumped 73.5p or nearly 5% to 1481.5, took some of the shine off. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> European equity market enthusiasm continues to be tempered, possibly due to the knowledge that tomorrow morning will bring a plethora of manufacturing PMI data from across the eurozone nations, and these of late have not always guaranteed good news. Any chance the FTSE had of easing itself away from the 6800 level have been anchored by the profits warning from GlaxoSmithKline's second-quarter figures. </blockquote> <p><strong>Weir</strong> fell 44p to \u00a327.04 following reports the Scottish engineering group could be interested in a \u20ac2bn bid for Finnish mining technology group Outotec. Weir did not comment but Outotec said it had not been approached or received a bid.</p> <p><strong>Tesco</strong> slipped to a near 10 year low, down 1.35p at 276p on continuing concerns about a possible price war with <strong>J Sainsbury</strong>, 0.8p lower at 313p, and <strong>Morrisons</strong>, up 1.6 at 173.1p, following the proposed departure of chief executive Philip Clarke.</p> <p><strong>SSE</strong> lost 43p to \u00a314.98 after the energy group's shares went ex-dividend. <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong> slipped 26p to \u00a319.20 for the same reason.</p> <p>Software group <strong>Sage</strong> slipped 4p to 377p despite the company saying trading was in line with expectations. In a sell note Julian Yates at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Recurring revenue grew 7.2%, sustaining first half 2014 levels, while software declined 3.4% versus a flat first half. The mid-market in Europe continues to be a challenge and management are not relying on a better fourth quarter here. Overall, the company keeps its growth targets intact, seeing a better fourth quarter due to momentum in the core business. We see the valuation as rich versus modest profit growth due to Cloud investment. <br> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Renishaw</strong> soared 22% to \u00a318.01 as the engineering group said a strong fourth quarter had helped it lift full year profits by 17%. The company won large orders from an Asian customer and also sold its stake in software group Delcam. Analyst Michael Blogg at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Renishaw retains a huge capacity to surprise and has done so on the upside today. Full year revenue exceeded our estimate by \u00a313.5m (almost all in the Metrology division and mainly in the Far East) and this dropped through to earnings. There was 8% underlying growth, excluding lumpy unpredictable orders in both years. This good news is likely to be reflected in the share price after a period of underperformance. Our estimates and target price are placed under review, but we are comfortable with a buy recommendation. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Iomart</strong> added 3p to 235p on speculation of a possible 290p a share offer for the cloud computing company.</p>",

However, we estimate free cash flow would remain significantly negative in 2015/16 owing to capex commitments and we forecast a stretched balance sheet...raising concerns over a potential covenant breach. Among the other mining groups, BHP Billiton was 12p better at 2066.5p after it beat full year guidance for iron ore production by 4%. Rival Rio Tinto rose 54p to \u00a333.91. Overall, the FTSE 100 finished up just 2.81 points at 6798.15, after trading as low as 6773 and as high as 6822. Despite the continuing uncertainties in Ukraine and Gaza, investors seemed to feel much of the geopolitical tension had begun to ease. Positive trading news from Capita, up 55p to \u00a312.10, helped support the market, but a disappointing update at lunchtime from GlaxoSmithKline, which slumped 73.5p or nearly 5% to 1481.5, took some of the shine off. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: European equity market enthusiasm continues to be tempered, possibly due to the knowledge that tomorrow morning will bring a plethora of manufacturing PMI data from across the eurozone nations, and these of late have not always guaranteed good news. Any chance the FTSE had of easing itself away from the 6800 level have been anchored by the profits warning from GlaxoSmithKline's second-quarter figures. Weir fell 44p to \u00a327.04 following reports the Scottish engineering group could be interested in a \u20ac2bn bid for Finnish mining technology group Outotec. Weir did not comment but Outotec said it had not been approached or received a bid. Tesco slipped to a near 10 year low, down 1.35p at 276p on continuing concerns about a possible price war with J Sainsbury, 0.8p lower at 313p, and Morrisons, up 1.6 at 173.1p, following the proposed departure of chief executive Philip Clarke. SSE lost 43p to \u00a314.98 after the energy group's shares went ex-dividend. London Stock Exchange slipped 26p to \u00a319.20 for the same reason. Software group Sage slipped 4p to 377p despite the company saying trading was in line with expectations. In a sell note Julian Yates at Investec said: Recurring revenue grew 7.2%, sustaining first half 2014 levels, while software declined 3.4% versus a flat first half. The mid-market in Europe continues to be a challenge and management are not relying on a better fourth quarter here. Overall, the company keeps its growth targets intact, seeing a better fourth quarter due to momentum in the core business. We see the valuation as rich versus modest profit growth due to Cloud investment. Among the mid-caps Renishaw soared 22% to \u00a318.01 as the engineering group said a strong fourth quarter had helped it lift full year profits by 17%. The company won large orders from an Asian customer and also sold its stake in software group Delcam. Analyst Michael Blogg at Investec said: Renishaw retains a huge capacity to surprise and has done so on the upside today. Full year revenue exceeded our estimate by \u00a313.5m (almost all in the Metrology division and mainly in the Far East) and this dropped through to earnings. There was 8% underlying growth, excluding lumpy unpredictable orders in both years. This good news is likely to be reflected in the share price after a period of underperformance. Our estimates and target price are placed under review, but we are comfortable with a buy recommendation. Finally Iomart added 3p to 235p on speculation of a possible 290p a share offer for the cloud computing company.",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable's attempt to use positive discrimination to get more women into the boardrooms of major companies has been thwarted by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which has ruled out the use of all-female shortlists. The business secretary had asked the equalities body to advise him on the legality of excluding men when trying to fill top City jobs as part of an effort to improve the gender balance in boardrooms. Laura Carstensen, an EHRC commissioner, has issued new guidance which makes clear that using women-only shortlists is unlawful under equality law. \"It constitutes unlawful sex discrimination to select a person for a role because of their gender. The law does not permit positive discrimination when making an appointment or a promotion,\" the guidance said. \"However, the law provides scope for companies to address any disadvantage or disproportionately low participation on boards by enabling or encouraging applications from a particular gender, provided selection is made on merit.\" Cable had sought the advice after receiving a report into the headhunting industry commissioned from Charlotte Sweeney, a former head of diversity at banks including HSBC and Nomura. She had suggested putting at least one woman on the shortlist for all board positions. The EHRC guidance points out that \"positive action is permitted when people of one gender are under-represented in a sector or company, provided that the measures which are adopted pursue the legitimate aim of addressing the causes of under-representation and that they are proportionate\". EU law permits women-only shortlists for political parties because it falls outside the scope of employment and occupation. Cable said the guidance provided details on what lawful measures can be taken to help deliver greater boardroom diversity while the Institute of Directors (IoD) supported the rejection of women-only lists. \"This will really help our top businesses in what has been in the past a bit of a legal grey area. It confirms it is good and accepted practice for companies to set ambitious aspirational targets to increase the number of women on their board,\" Cable said. \"We completely agree with the commission that board appointments must be made on merit, demonstrated through fair and transparent criteria and procedures. No woman or man wants to be on a board of a company simply because of their gender.\" Oliver Parry, the IoD's corporate governance adviser, said: \"We hope that the guidance issued today will help boards to appoint more women through measures including aspirational targets, wider advertising for posts and mentoring and shadowing programmes.\" The voluntary target recommended by Lord Davies in 2011 was for 25% boardroom representation at all FTSE 100 companies by 2015. There are no longer any all-male boards after the mining company Glencore appointed a female non-executive director last month. Women now make up 22% of FTSE 100 board positions, largely in non-executive roles.",

The US department of justice is also investigating GSK for possible breaches of the foreign corrupt practices act.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/14/china-confirms-trial-gsk-foreign-investigators\" title=\"\">A British-US couple, who have been charged with illegally obtaining private information by China</a>, will now be tried in public rather than in secret after the US and British governments raised concerns. This could mean the trial date, previously scheduled for 7 August, is moved.</p> <p>Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng, who ran a Shanghai corporate investigation consultancy for foreign firms operating in China, were hired by GSK last year to investigate a break-in after a video of the company's former China boss, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/30/glaxosmithkline-pharmaceuticals-industry\" title=\"\">Mark Reilly, having sex with his girlfriend in his Shanghai home</a> was emailed anonymously to 13 GSK executives, including Witty. The whistleblower sent a series of other emails containing detailed allegations of fraud. Reilly has been accused by Chinese authorities of running a \"massive bribery network\" and could face a long prison sentence.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/04/china-gsk-trial-idUSL4N0PF1WS20140704\" title=\"\">Humphrey said he felt \"cheated\" by GSK</a>, because he had not been given the full details of the corruption allegations. GSK hired his firm ChinaWhys to investigate the \"serious breach of privacy and security\" relating to Reilly rather than the allegations themselves. GSK's internal investigations have not found any evidence of widespread fraud. Witty said he was unable to comment on Humphrey's assertion.</p> <p>Despite the problems in China, emerging markets put in a strong performance, with GSK sales up 11% , which partially offset declines in Japan and the US of 7% and 10%. European sales were flat. Turnover in the second quarter fell 4% to \u00a35.6bn.</p> <p>GSK has introduced new inhaled medicines \u2013 Breo and Anoro \u2013 to offset the decline in its biggest seller, the asthma drug Advair, which still makes up nearly a fifth of sales but has come off patent. Uptake of Breo has been slow while Anoro, which has just come on to the US market, looks more promising, Witty said.</p> <p>He said GSK was in a period of transition, and stressed that it had a strong pipeline of new medicines, with six drugs approved last year and more than 40 in late-stage development. The worst of the patent losses are behind it. GSK believes Tivicay, to treat HIV, could become one of its most successful launches.</p>",

The situation is complicated and difficult and while the investigation is active there is little I can add.\" He said the allegations were \"contrary to the values\" he believed in. \"In a company of our size operating in almost every country in the world there's always a small potential for some people to step outside procedure,\" Witty said. \"This isn't acceptable, and where we are aware of misconduct, we take action including dismissal from the company.\" He added that the company had changed the way it did business, including \"how we reward our sales representatives, and stopping payments to doctors to speak on our behalf or to attend medical congresses\". Last week GSK admitted it had dismissed staff in China in 2001 for bribing health officials. Britain's Serious Fraud Office recently began a criminal investigation into the drugmaker's sales practices around the world and said on Wednesday that it was working with the Chinese authorities for the first time ever. SFO head David Green told Reuters the Chinese government had a clear interest in rooting out bribery and corruption, though it might have \"slightly different perspectives\" from the SFO. The US department of justice is also investigating GSK for possible breaches of the foreign corrupt practices act. A British-US couple, who have been charged with illegally obtaining private information by China, will now be tried in public rather than in secret after the US and British governments raised concerns. This could mean the trial date, previously scheduled for 7 August, is moved. Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng, who ran a Shanghai corporate investigation consultancy for foreign firms operating in China, were hired by GSK last year to investigate a break-in after a video of the company's former China boss, Mark Reilly, having sex with his girlfriend in his Shanghai home was emailed anonymously to 13 GSK executives, including Witty. The whistleblower sent a series of other emails containing detailed allegations of fraud. Reilly has been accused by Chinese authorities of running a \"massive bribery network\" and could face a long prison sentence. Humphrey said he felt \"cheated\" by GSK, because he had not been given the full details of the corruption allegations. GSK hired his firm ChinaWhys to investigate the \"serious breach of privacy and security\" relating to Reilly rather than the allegations themselves. GSK's internal investigations have not found any evidence of widespread fraud. Witty said he was unable to comment on Humphrey's assertion. Despite the problems in China, emerging markets put in a strong performance, with GSK sales up 11% , which partially offset declines in Japan and the US of 7% and 10%. European sales were flat. Turnover in the second quarter fell 4% to \u00a35.6bn. GSK has introduced new inhaled medicines \u2013 Breo and Anoro \u2013 to offset the decline in its biggest seller, the asthma drug Advair, which still makes up nearly a fifth of sales but has come off patent. Uptake of Breo has been slow while Anoro, which has just come on to the US market, looks more promising, Witty said. He said GSK was in a period of transition, and stressed that it had a strong pipeline of new medicines, with six drugs approved last year and more than 40 in late-stage development. The worst of the patent losses are behind it. GSK believes Tivicay, to treat HIV, could become one of its most successful launches.",

In the UK, the biggest risks are associated with the housing market,\" he said, speaking in Glasgow at the Commonwealth Games business conference. \"History shows that the British people do everything they can to pay their mortgages. That means cutting back deeply on expenditures when the unexpected happens. If a lot of people are highly indebted, that could tip the economy into recession.\" Carney said that while the Bank's job was not to control house prices, it was concerned about the impact rising household debt would have on the wider economy. For this reason, it had intervened last month to limit the volume of high loan-to-income mortgages that lenders would be permitted to approve. It has also introduced tougher mortgage rules to ensure that borrowers could withstand a rise in interest rates. The governor said that although GDP was back at pre-crisis levels, the Bank's monetary policy committee would not raise rates until real wages were rising consistently. The Bank rate has been held at 0.5% since March 2009. \"The UK economy is starting to head back to normal. The economy is finally producing as much as it did on the eve of the crisis in 2008, and inflation is back near its 2% target. \"A key judgment for the [Bank's rate-setting] monetary policy committee is when and to what extent these developments will translate into real wage growth, and in turn that wage growth into price pressures.\" Carney repeated the MPC's message that once rates did start to rise from an all-time low of 0.5%, increases would be \"gradual and limited\" because risks to the economy would take \"some time to die down\". He said that businesses he had visited understood that any rises would be gradual, encouraging them to hire and invest with an eye on the medium term.",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers are growing increasingly uneasy at leaving interest rates at a record low of 0.5%, minutes of their latest meeting revealed. The public record of the July meeting of the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) shows that although all nine members voted in favour of leaving rates on hold, a rate rise is drawing closer because \"for some members the decision had become more balanced\". Setting out the argument for an early rate rise, the MPC said there would potentially be little risk associated with a small increase in borrowing costs against a backdrop of economic growth. \"On one interpretation, the risk of a small rise in bank rate derailing the expansion and leaving inflation below the target in the medium term was receding as that expansion became more established. \"A rise in bank rate at a time when the economy was growing strongly would facilitate a more gradual path thereafter and would allow the committee to evaluate the sensitivity of households, firms and financial markets to changes in interest rates, following a long period during which bank rate had remained unchanged.\" The MPC has already made it clear that the rates will only rise gradually, and settle around 2-3% rather than the pre-crisis norm of around of 5%.

Elsewhere outsourcing group Capita has climbed 43p to \u00a311.98 after it reported a 16% rise in underlying half year profit to \u00a3238m. But SSE is leading the fallers, down 49p at \u00a314.92 after the energy group's shares went ex-dividend. London Stock Exchange slipped 11p to \u00a319.35 for the same reason. Standard Chartered has dipped 7p to \u00a312.09 following a Financial Times report it had reined in expansion plans so it could conserve capital amid falling profits. Credit Suisse has put an underperform rating on the shares, saying: The group reports first half numbers on 6 August. Following the pre-close update where management lowered expectations, we are not expecting surprises in the headline numbers; instead our focus will be on the detail in terms of capital and asset quality. We have lowered our estimates [2014/15/16 estimates cut by 12%/5%/3% respectively] to reflect the weaker guidance given, and our target price declines to 1,150p (from 1,200p). Overall the FTSE 100 has edged up 8.20 points to 6803.54, unmoved by Bank of England minutes which showed a 9-0 vote for keeping rates and quantitative easing unchanged. Among the mid-caps Renishaw has soared 15% to \u00a316.93 as the engineering group said a strong fourth quarter had helped it lift full year profits by 17%. The company won large orders from an Asian customer and also sold its stake in software group Delcam. Analyst Michael Blogg at Investec said: Renishaw retains a huge capacity to surprise and has done so on the upside today. Full year revenue exceeded our estimate by \u00a313.5m (almost all in the Metrology division and mainly in the Far East) and this dropped through to earnings. There was 8% underlying growth, excluding lumpy unpredictable orders in both years. This good news is likely to be reflected in the share price after a period of underperformance. Our estimates and target price are placed under review, but we are comfortable with a buy recommendation.",

      "bodyText": "TalkTalk has switched 1.1 million customers on to its budget pay-TV service, adding 185,000 in the most recent quarter.
