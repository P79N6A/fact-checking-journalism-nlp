      "body": "<p>Kweku Adoboli repeatedly broken down in tears on Friday as the former UBS \"rogue trader\" defended himself against charges that he gambled away \u00a31.5bn of his Swiss bank's money.</p> <p>Adoboli, 32, burst into tears several times as he told the court in his first day of testimony that he was so wedded to his job that he put in 16-hour days, sometimes slept under his desk, and skipped his grandmother's funeral because he couldn't bear to drag himself away from his trading platform as he battled to reverse multimillion-pound losses.</p> <p>\"UBS was my family and every single thing I did, every single bit of effort I put into that organisation, was for the benefit of the bank. That is everything I lived for,\" he said as he dabbed his eyes with a paper handkerchief in the witness box of court three at Southwark crown court. \"To find yourself in Wandsworth prison for nine months because all you did was worked so hard for this bank.\"</p> <p>At one point, he became so distraught that Judge Brian Keith interrupted proceedings to tell Adoboli that he shouldn't be embarrassed about becoming overrun by his emotions, and that it gave the jury a chance to \"see the man behind the name\".</p> <p>Adoboli spent his childhood in Israel and Syria, where his father, a United Nations diplomat, was posted, before being sent to a Quaker boarding school in Yorkshire.</p> <p>He described his rapid ascent up the ranks after joining UBS as a graduate trainee straight from Nottingham University. The only other job he had before joining the bank was as a waiter.</p> <p>The court heard that when the financial crisis began to take hold in 2007 it was just Adoboli, then aged 27, and John Hughes, 24, in charge of a $50bn (\u00a331bn) portfolio of assets on the bank's exchange traded funds desk in London.</p> <p>\"Our book was massive. A tiny mistake led to huge losses. We were these two kids trying to make it work,\" he said. \"There was a total of 30 months in trading [experience] between the two of us and we were in charge of a $50bn book. We were just losing so much money \u2013 it was mental.\"</p> <p>Prosecutors claim Adoboli began fraudulently trading in 2008 in order to hide the huge losses that were stacking up. The unauthorised trades remained hidden for years in so-called umbrella accounts set up to store the funds.</p> <p>The unauthorised, or \"dummy\", trades eventually cost the bank \u00a31.4bn \u2013 the biggest-ever rogue trading losses in British history \u2013 and wiped \u00a33bn off its share price. Adoboli, who denies two charges of fraud and two of false accounting, said the trades were \"not fraudulent \u2013 it [was] finding a way to do your job\".</p> <p>He said lots of traders were afraid that UBS may have been about to follow other big banks by collapsing, and said everyone at the bank was asking themselves: \"What can we do to help this organisation survive this incredible crisis?</p> <p>\"Every moment of every day [I] spent thinking, 'How do I make this book work?' Nothing else was important enough to overcome that.\"</p> <p>He told the court that in order to try to claw back the losses, he was getting up at 4am to catch up on developments in the markets overnight, before cycling to work at 6am and often staying there until well past midnight.</p> <p>\"The hours were immense,\" he said. \"You were at your desk all the time.</p> <p>\"My grandmother died and I was unable to go to her funeral.

      "bodyText": "Kweku Adoboli repeatedly broken down in tears on Friday as the former UBS \"rogue trader\" defended himself against charges that he gambled away \u00a31.5bn of his Swiss bank's money. Adoboli, 32, burst into tears several times as he told the court in his first day of testimony that he was so wedded to his job that he put in 16-hour days, sometimes slept under his desk, and skipped his grandmother's funeral because he couldn't bear to drag himself away from his trading platform as he battled to reverse multimillion-pound losses. \"UBS was my family and every single thing I did, every single bit of effort I put into that organisation, was for the benefit of the bank. That is everything I lived for,\" he said as he dabbed his eyes with a paper handkerchief in the witness box of court three at Southwark crown court. \"To find yourself in Wandsworth prison for nine months because all you did was worked so hard for this bank.\" At one point, he became so distraught that Judge Brian Keith interrupted proceedings to tell Adoboli that he shouldn't be embarrassed about becoming overrun by his emotions, and that it gave the jury a chance to \"see the man behind the name\". Adoboli spent his childhood in Israel and Syria, where his father, a United Nations diplomat, was posted, before being sent to a Quaker boarding school in Yorkshire. He described his rapid ascent up the ranks after joining UBS as a graduate trainee straight from Nottingham University. The only other job he had before joining the bank was as a waiter. The court heard that when the financial crisis began to take hold in 2007 it was just Adoboli, then aged 27, and John Hughes, 24, in charge of a $50bn (\u00a331bn) portfolio of assets on the bank's exchange traded funds desk in London. \"Our book was massive. A tiny mistake led to huge losses. We were these two kids trying to make it work,\" he said. \"There was a total of 30 months in trading [experience] between the two of us and we were in charge of a $50bn book. We were just losing so much money \u2013 it was mental.\" Prosecutors claim Adoboli began fraudulently trading in 2008 in order to hide the huge losses that were stacking up. The unauthorised trades remained hidden for years in so-called umbrella accounts set up to store the funds. The unauthorised, or \"dummy\", trades eventually cost the bank \u00a31.4bn \u2013 the biggest-ever rogue trading losses in British history \u2013 and wiped \u00a33bn off its share price. Adoboli, who denies two charges of fraud and two of false accounting, said the trades were \"not fraudulent \u2013 it [was] finding a way to do your job\". He said lots of traders were afraid that UBS may have been about to follow other big banks by collapsing, and said everyone at the bank was asking themselves: \"What can we do to help this organisation survive this incredible crisis? \"Every moment of every day [I] spent thinking, 'How do I make this book work?' Nothing else was important enough to overcome that.\" He told the court that in order to try to claw back the losses, he was getting up at 4am to catch up on developments in the markets overnight, before cycling to work at 6am and often staying there until well past midnight. \"The hours were immense,\" he said. \"You were at your desk all the time. \"My grandmother died and I was unable to go to her funeral. It was just John [Hughes] on the desk, it was impossible to leave. \"My life became work,\" he added as he broke down in tears for the fourth time. Adoboli, in a dark suit and maroon tie, said he carried out the unauthorised trades for \"the book, and the bank\", and not out of personal greed, as alleged by the prosecution. Hughes, who gave evidence earlier in the trial, had described Adoboli as \"gung-ho\" and \"quite a maverick\". \"He did not really care about the book as a whole. He cared about being a profitable trader,\" Hughes had said. The court had previously heard that Adoboli walked out of the bank saying he was going to a doctor's appointment and an hour later sent a \"bombshell\" email detailing the losses from his personal account. \"I am deeply sorry to have left this mess for everyone and have put my bank and my colleagues at risk,\" he wrote in the email. The trial continues.",

Spain's government has since capped salary payments to executives at state-rescued banks. Bankia is at the centre of the storm that has swept through the sector as it struggles to cope with billions of euros of bad loans given to real estate developers and land speculators. Created by the merger of seven savings banks, or cajas, Bankia is evidence of considerable consolidation in the sector that analysts say is set to continue. The 45 savings banks that existed five years ago have now been merged into just fourteen, and analysts predict a new round of mergers could see that reduced to 10. The unemployment figures showed that Three of the country's seventeen regions now have more than one in three workers out of a job.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Anglo American's chief executive, Cynthia Carroll, is stepping down next year after months of intense pressure from shareholders and amid wildcat strikes at the company's mines in South Africa. Her departure, after six years at the helm, will leave only two female bosses in FTSE 100 companies a time when the government is attempting to bolster the number of women in boardrooms and comes only weeks after Dame Marjorie Scardino's departure was announced from publisher Pearson. As her resignation was announced \u2013 propelling the shares up 4% to become the largest risers in the FTSE 100 \u2013 American-born Carroll warned against quotas, arguing the women could be seen as \"token\". \"I think there is a need to have more women running companies, but you can't ... appoint women just to appoint women, just to satisfy a particular condition,\" Carroll said. \"What you want more than anything is to develop women in the organisation who will, when they get to the top, be fully capable of delivering and doing the job effectively.\" \"The last thing you want is to have token women,\" she said, adding she wanted to make sure a \"pipeline\" was being developed. \"You need mentors, people with that desire to support women and the vision to have more. We have that in Anglo American in a big way,\" she said. When she became chief executive in March 2007, Carroll was the first non-South African, the first woman and the first outsider to take the reins at the company. She will stay on until a successor is found, which could take up to nine months. Potential successors include Alex Vanselow, the Brazilian former chief financial officer of BHP Billiton and Aaron Regent, the former boss of Barrick Gold. Anglo's chairman, Sir John Parker, said the company would conduct a global search but \"could not afford\" Mick Davis, who is planning to leave Xstrata. Carroll's communication skills had been questioned by shareholders who were also concerned about the miner's share performance and Anglo's exposure to South Africa, where a series of mining disputes have hit output. One of Anglo's largest shareholders, South Africa's Public Investment Corporation, said the company had missed opportunities in Africa and criticised Carroll's \"poor decision making\". It called for a swift replacement. Anglo American Platinum, a subsidiary and the world's biggest platinum producer, sacked 12,000 South African workers in early October after three weeks of strikes. The company is also faced with cost overruns at the Minas-Rio iron ore project in Brazila and a legal battle with Codelco, Chile's state-owned miner. Dismissing suggestions that Carroll had been forced out by shareholders, Parker said her decision to leave was her own as she started her seventh year in a \"very gruelling and demanding role\". Cailey Barker, an analyst at Numis, said: \"Given the challenges and pressures to the business it may not come as a surprise to some, but we believe overall she has done a good job of transforming the company since taking the helm in 2007.\" Despite drastic cost cuts that resulted in 26,000 job losses to streamline a sprawling consortium, analysts at Macquarie calculated Anglo had lost a third of its value since Carroll took the helm, while its peers are worth at least the same as in 2007. Carroll took home more than \u00a32m in salary and bonuses in 2011, plus a payout of \u00a3445,000 from share-based bonus plans that vested during the year. The company said it was too early to say how much she would get on departure. Following Scardino's departure from Pearson there will be only two female chief executives in the FTSE 100: Angela Ahrendts, at fashion group Burberry since 2006, and Alison Cooper, at Imperial Tobacco since 2010. Fiona Hotston Moore, partner at City accountancy Reeves and a campaigner for quotas to put more women in boardrooms, said Carroll's departure \"further highlights the extraordinary absence of women at the top of FTSE 100 companies.\" .",

International director Jonathan Kamaluddin sold \u00a36.6m worth and two others sold shares worth \u00a32.7m. The sale at \u00a321.50 a share, part of a long-term incentive plan dating back to 2009, was made on Thursday but announced to the market on Friday. It sent the stock down 4.8% to \u00a322.15, having fallen 6.7% on Thursday as rumours of the sell-off first circulated.

Strong sales overseas, especially in America and Australia, have helped turn Asos into one of the biggest online retail success stories, with rumours of Amazon looking at a possible takeover. Founded in 2000, it focuses on \"fashion forward 20-somethings\" wanting to emulate their favourite women celebrities. Earlier this month it confirmed plans to hire former Marks &amp; Spencer head of general merchandise, Kate Bostock, who will start in January. She is considered one of the most powerful women in British retail and will hope to continue the company's success which has seen its share price rise more than 500% in the past five years and 78% so far this year.",

But disappointing results from Apple after the market closed on Thursday took the shine off, and Arm's shares fell 8.5p to 656.5p. But they are still 65p up on the week. Credit Suisse issued a neutral rating on the company, but raised its target price from 538p to 645p. It said:</p> <blockquote> We conclude that markets are currently expecting an approximate 15%-20% upgrade to industry volume estimates for smartphones and tablets, Arm's key end markets.

Analyst Steve Liechti at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We view this as a possible net positive but not game changer - while we see some earnings per share upside via near-term merger/cost synergies in a pressured top line business, this does not imply cash returns to shareholders or re-investment in long-term growth Education assets.

On Thursday the debt-laden company said it was suspending payments to its lenders pending completion of its restructuring, and warned its shares could be worthless.

Analyst Steve Liechti at Investec said: We view this as a possible net positive but not game changer - while we see some earnings per share upside via near-term merger/cost synergies in a pressured top line business, this does not imply cash returns to shareholders or re-investment in long-term growth Education assets. If a move precedes exit of FT Group too, this would be good news. But Trinity Mirror fell 9.75p to 51.25p yesterday on worries about its involvement in phone hacking after legal claims were filed against the Daily Mirror on behalf of, among others, former England football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson. Weir rose 29p to \u00a317.17 as Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the pumps group from \u00a314.40 to \u00a316.70 but kept its underweight rating: Expectations look much more realistic now, although certain capital expenditure headwinds remain. Weir's risk-reward is improved, but not yet attractive. Its shares have been buoyed recently by speculation of a possible takeover by the likes of US giant General Electric. Hedge fund group Man added 1.8p to 81.85p on hopes of action to boost its flagging performance. Odey Asset Management, founded by fund manager Crispin Odey, announced on Thursday it had raised its stake in Man from 1.25% to 5.15%. Finally Hibu, the oddly named owner of Yellow Pages which was formerly known as Yell, fell 8% to 0.33p after Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its credit rating on the struggling business from CCC+ to CC with a negative outlook. On Thursday the debt-laden company said it was suspending payments to its lenders pending completion of its restructuring, and warned its shares could be worthless. One bright spark was news that the Office of Fair Trading had recommended that the Competition Commission should consider relaxing a number of restrictions on the company which were introduced in 2007 when it was a major power in the market.",

      "bodyText": "A victim of the mining industry's machismo culture? Up to a point. It's true that Cynthia Carroll, throughout her six years at the top of Anglo American, never shook off the \"outsider\" label. Even at the high point of her reign, rivals whispered - always in vague terms and in private - that Carroll might not be made of the right leadership stuff. The prejudice was always that she had a lot to prove. But look at records elsewhere. Tom Albanese at Rio Tinto and Mick Davis at Xstrata had to tap their shareholders for funds via rights issues after the greatest bull market for commodities in a generation. Those crimes against investors received considerably softer treatment. Anglo merely suspended dividends for a while after the pop in commodity prices in 2009. That said, the reasons for Carroll's departure are not vague. Shareholders have a long list of understandable complaints: a weak share price; slow copper production; delays to a huge iron ore project in Brazil; over-spending on acquisitions; and the unresolved corporate nightmare of strikes, lay-offs and violence in the platinum mines in South Africa. That collection of disappointments, however, should be set against the reality that Anglo American, circa 2007, was a hellishly difficult organisation to run. The twin power bases in Johannesburg and London pulled in opposite directions. The company carried its colonial baggage awkwardly and its safety record was appalling: the 2006 annual report recorded the death of 44 employees and contractors. In all those areas, Carroll has made improvements, preaching a once-alien gospel of community engagement, emphasising safety (though 17 deaths last year were more than in 2010) and attempting to tidy up the portfolio of assets by, for example, buying 100% control of De Beers. But the charge that Anglo has thrown capital around too casually is broadly accurate. Carroll's first big move was to buy the Minas Rio iron ore project in the Brazilian rain forest, an enormous mine requiring the construction of a new port and a 325-mile pipeline. The project is at least three years behind schedule, bogged down by permit and construction wrangles. Deutsche Bank's analysts estimated last month that Minas Rio has destroyed $5.5bn (\u00a33.4bn) of value for Anglo shareholders. Then there is platinum problem in South Africa. Prices are weak and the industry suffers over-capacity. There is no obvious way to satisfy the competing demands of South African politicians, the unions and Anglo's shareholders. One fear is that the saga is sliding towards nationalisation. Carroll will leave that challenge to her successor. He (as it probably will be) will face a question that dogged Carroll on her arrival: would Anglo be worth more if it was broken up into pieces? As it happens, dismembered is probably not the answer. There would be buyers for the best assets, such as copper, but real value will only be created when the huge South African problems are resolved. The country is simply too important to the company. Alex Vanselow, who departed BHP Billiton as finance director this year in search of a chief executive's job, has the virtue of being available now. But, if it's not Vanselow, a hunt will take time and a power vacuum at the top is the last thing Anglo needs given the pace of events in South Africa. Time for chairman Sir John Parker, ultimately responsible for succession, to demonstrate that there is a plan.",

      "body": "<p>A victim of the mining industry's machismo culture? Up to a point. It's true that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/26/anglo-american-cynthia-carroll-step-down\" title=\"\">Cynthia Carroll, throughout her six years at the top of Anglo American</a>, never shook off the \"outsider\" label. Even at the high point of her reign, rivals whispered - always in vague terms and in private - that Carroll might not be made of the right leadership stuff. The prejudice was always that she had a lot to prove.</p> <p>But look at records elsewhere. Tom Albanese at Rio Tinto and Mick Davis at Xstrata had to tap their shareholders for funds via rights issues after the greatest bull market for commodities in a generation. Those crimes against investors received considerably softer treatment. Anglo merely suspended dividends for a while after the pop in commodity prices in 2009.</p> <p>That said, the reasons for Carroll's departure are not vague. Shareholders have a long list of understandable complaints: a weak share price; slow copper production; delays to a huge iron ore project in Brazil; over-spending on acquisitions; and the unresolved <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/05/south-africa-miner-dies-anglo-american\" title=\"\">corporate nightmare of strikes, lay-offs and violence in the platinum mines in South Africa</a>.</p> <p>That collection of disappointments, however, should be set against the reality that Anglo American, circa 2007, was a hellishly difficult organisation to run. The twin power bases in Johannesburg and London pulled in opposite directions. The company carried its colonial baggage awkwardly and its safety record was appalling: the 2006 annual report recorded the death of 44 employees and contractors.</p> <p>In all those areas, Carroll has made improvements, preaching a once-alien gospel of community engagement, emphasising safety (though 17 deaths last year were more than in 2010) and attempting to tidy up the portfolio of assets by, for example, buying 100% control of De Beers.</p> <p>But the charge that Anglo has thrown capital around too casually is broadly accurate. Carroll's first big move was to buy the Minas Rio iron ore project in the Brazilian rain forest, an enormous mine requiring the construction of a new port and a 325-mile pipeline. The project is at least three years behind schedule, bogged down by permit and construction wrangles. Deutsche Bank's analysts estimated last month that Minas Rio has destroyed $5.5bn (\u00a33.4bn) of value for Anglo shareholders.</p> <p>Then there is platinum problem in South Africa. Prices are weak and the industry suffers over-capacity. There is no obvious way to satisfy the competing demands of South African politicians, the unions and Anglo's shareholders. One fear is that the saga is sliding towards nationalisation. Carroll will leave that challenge to her successor.</p> <p>He (as it probably will be) will face a question that dogged Carroll on her arrival: would Anglo be worth more if it was broken up into pieces? As it happens, dismembered is probably not the answer. There would be buyers for the best assets, such as copper, but real value will only be created when the huge South African problems are resolved. The country is simply too important to the company.</p> <p>Alex Vanselow, who departed BHP Billiton as finance director this year in search of a chief executive's job, has the virtue of being available now. But, if it's not Vanselow, a hunt will take time and a power vacuum at the top is the last thing Anglo needs given the pace of events in South Africa. Time for chairman Sir John Parker, ultimately responsible for succession, to demonstrate that there is a plan.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Full bank breakup might be needed, warns Bank of England", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned that a full breakup of Britain's banks might ultimately be needed to prevent their problems wrecking the economy or burdening the taxpayer. Andrew Haldane, Threadneedle Street's director for financial stability, expressed doubts that current proposals would be sufficient to tackle the \"too big to fail\" issue that has dogged the financial sector since the crisis of 2007-08. In a speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs on Thursday night, Haldane said current initiatives were a step in the right direction but did not go far enough. Ultimately, he said, banks might need to have their activities curtailed by tough capital requirements, limits on their size or a modern Glass-Steagall Act, the 1930s law that separated investment from retail banking in the US. Haldane said banks had increased in size dramatically over past decades and this \u2013 together with consolidation and concentration of the industry \u2013 had created expectations of state bailouts in times of trouble. \"These expectations generate lower funding costs, in particular for the largest banks, which in turn encourages further expansion and concentration, worsening the too-big-to-fail dilemma,\" Haldane said. In 2009, following the government support that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Haldane said estimates of the implicit taxpayer subsidy to the world's banks came to $700bn (\u00a3435bn). This implied that \"too big to fail had become hardwired into the structure and pricing of the financial system\". Subsequent reforms of the banks have involved forcing them to hold more capital so that they can absorb losses, ensuring that mechanisms are in place to wind them up without bringing down other institutions with them \u2013 so-called living wills \u2013 and proposals to prevent the speculative activities of banks damaging their high street operations. Haldane said the extra capital surcharges agreed internationally would leave much of the implicit taxpayer subsidy intact. He flagged two possible problems with more effective wind-up regimes: that they would lead to even greater concentration of banks and that there was a risk governments would take the safe option of a bailout if a big bank ran into trouble, rather than face the threat of a systemic meltdown. Haldane said that was concerning, because there was already evidence that recent bailouts had increased government debt to levels that \"may be a significant drag on medium-term growth\". Since the crisis, teams of experts led by Sir John Vickers in the UK, Paul Volcker in the US and Erkki Liikanen in the EU, have been looking at ways of separating investment and retail banking. In order to prevent cross-contamination, Haldane said \"full and faithful implementation of the spirit as well as the letter of the Volcker, Vickers and Liikanen plans\" will be needed. A true separation of capital and culture within the big banks, together with the elimination of \"too big to fail\" would \"require entirely separate governance, risk and balance sheet management on either side of the ringfence \u2026 Only time will tell whether cultural separation can be achieved under the existing structural reform proposals.\" Noting that current reform proposals may prove insufficient, Haldane outlined a number of more radical suggestions. Increasing the level of capital that banks have to hold to several times the current suggested levels would \"reduce materially expected system-wide losses\". In addition, limits could be put on the size of banks, since despite claims by the industry that bigger institutions were more efficient and less costly to operate, there was no evidence that economies of scale applied to banks above $100bn. Haldane said a full separation of investment and commercial banking \u2013 \"a modern-day Glass-Steagall Act\" \u2013 would lessen the risk of basic banking activities being starved of human or financial capital. Increasing competition by removing the barriers to entry would also help to reduce banking concentration and with it the \"too big to fail\" problem.",

      "bodyText": "Chip designer Arm is ending a busy week on a downbeat note. The company, a supplier to Apple, Samsung and Microsoft, unveiled a better than expected update on Tuesday, helped by royalties on its smartphone designs. It was also boosted by Microsoft's Windows 8 launch - where it is encroaching into Intel's territory - and the unveiling of Apple's iPad. But news on Thursday of disappointing results from Apple has taken the shine off, and Arm is currently 15p lower at 650p. Apple is just one of a raft of US companies revealing disappointing results in recent days, ranging from Amazon to Caterpillar. Ahead of US GDP figures later, this has put pressure on the markets, with the FTSE 100 down 35.34 points at 5769.71. Miners were among the fallers with Kazakhmys down 16p at 720p.

      "bodyText": "European markets managed - on the whole - to edge higher as better than expected US GDP figures outweighed poor corporate updates from across the Atlantic and the continuing concerns about the eurozone. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, up 1.66 points at 5806.71 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.44% \u2022 France's Cac climbed 0.69% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB finished 0.36% higher \u2022 But Spain's Ibex edged 0.05% lower \u2022 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.33% or 42 points. Next week sees US consumer confidence figures, the usual round of purchasing manager surveys on the first of the month, and the latest US non-farm payroll numbers - the last before the election. So until then, it's time to shut up shop for the week. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend and we'll be back on Monday. Bankia, Spain's ailing nationalized conglomeration of former savings banks, lost \u20ac7bn euro in the first three quarters of this year - a record in Spanish banking history, says our correspondent Giles Tremlett. The figure came after write-downs of around \u20ac11.5bn relating to losses on property assets. So the troika may be hailing progress in Spain implementing its reform programme, but it's clear why it thinks there are still major issues for the country's banking sector. Earlier we reported that leading Bankia executives will be told to hand back bonuses they 'earned' in 2011. Speaking of Greece, here is a report the Guardian has done on the rise of Golden Dawn and the far right in the country. Definitely worth a read. Germany's Wolfgang Schaeuble has waded into the debate on Greece again, saying there were doubts the country had met its commitments from previous bailouts. In an interview with ZDF television, the finance minister said nothing was decided on Greece's euro membership although they (the EU? Germany?) wanted Greece to be able to stay. Cue \"Grexit\" fears once more. Back in the US and consumer sentiment rose to its highest level in five months in October, according to the latest Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey. The sentiment index rose from 78.3 to 82.6, but on the negative side, it was lower than the initial reading of 83.1 and economists' forecasts of 83. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: All in all, US households remain relatively optimistic about the future of the economy, with the expectations index also at its five year high. Despite the still sluggish labour market, US consumers are confident that the economy will recover in the coming quarters. Part of the enthusiasm might be due to the upcoming elections and we wouldn't be surprised to see a downward correction in November. Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has been sentenced to four years in jail by a Milan court for tax fraud relating to the purchase of TV rights by his Mediaset empire. But he won't be behind bars immediately, if at all. He can appeal the verdict two more times, and will not have to serve time unless the final decision goes against him. Earlier this week he confirmed he would not lead his party in next year's election. And to put all this in context: Spain's programme is on track according to the European Central Bank and the EU after its mission to the country. In a statement just released, the ECB said challenges to the banking system remained acute but: Despite the complexity of the issues at stake, preparations by the Spanish authorities seem well advanced in order to allow for timely policy action in line with the memorandum of understanding. Furthermore, the mission reached agreement with the Spanish authorities on important aspects of the design and functioning of the future Asset Management Company (AMC), including on its overall size and governance. Overall, the findings of this mission point to a successful programme whose implementation is on track. The better than expected US GDP figures are not only good news for Barack Obama as the US election heads into the home straight, they have also breathed some life into stock markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, forecast to open sharply lower, is in fact up around 20 points in early trading. And here's the GDP numbers since 2008, showing a reasonable picture for the world's largest economy since the downturn. The UK government is not convinced by Douglas Carswell's call for Britain to leave the EU (see 14.13). Foreign office minister David Lidington argued that European Union membership is a valuable thing. Responding to Carswell's bill to repeal the legislation that took the UK into Europe, Lidington said: Despite its failings and drawbacks, membership of the European Union is in the national interest of the British people. Lidington then cited the benefits of trade, of access to foreign markets, and of \"diplomatic leverage\". The bill isn't dead, though \u2013 it will be discussed again on 1 March 2013. Several other MPs did speak up on Carwsell's side, but in truth the chamber was pretty empty (typical for a Friday afternoon, when many MPs have sloped off to their constituencies ...) On which note..... domestic duties are calling, so I'll hand this blog over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thanks all, and best wishes for the weekend. In Westminster, Conservative MP Douglas Carswell is presenting his bill to withdraw Britain from the European Union (see 13.13 for the background). Carswell argues that Europe has not worked out as Britain hoped \u2013 we went in seeking a strong trade union and have ended up in an expensive, inefficient bloc that is holding back UK firms from \"cheese makers\" to \"fund managers\". Entertainingly, Carswell is taking a few swipes at UK civil servants and the \"Oxbridge-educated Sir Humphreys\"* who can't see the truth. He also took a pop at Brussels technocrats for imposing rules on Britain Being in the EU has done dreadful harm to our economy. It's put us in the slow lane, but it's done desperate damage to our democracy too. Carswell then makes an unarguable point \u2013 his bill is not going to become law. \"Yet,\" interjects another MP. We'll see.... * Mind you, Sir Humphrey himself had a somewhat cynical take on Britain's place in Europe. Here's some early reaction to, and instant analysis of, the stronger-than-expected US GDP (see 13.31 onwards) from Twitter: Europe's financial markets have rallied since the US GDP data was released. The major indexes are now mostly flat, having been down this morning (see 9.45am). The 2.0% annualised rise in GDP was driven by an increase in spending by consumers and the US government. However, it would have been higher without the drought which struck the US this summer \u2013 and knocked 0.4% off GDP growth. Breaking: The US economy grew by 2% on an annualised basis in the third quarter of 2012. That's a stronger performance than expected, and much better than the annualised 1.3% recorded in Q2 2012. It means US economic output rose by 0.5% between July and September, compared with April-June. More to follow! The House of Commons is about to consider a bill that would bring the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union to an end. The European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill has been introduced by Douglas Carswell (independently-minded Conservative MP, scourge of fiat money and no fan of the civil service either). It will be streamed on the parliamentary website, and is due to start very soon. At the risk of ruining the surprise, the bill is unlikely to get much further (few private member's bills make it on to the statute book). It will be interesting to see how much support Carswell can muster though, at a time when the drive for closer European integration appears to be nudging the UK closer to the exit ... A German MP has dented the d\u00e9tente between Berlin and Dublin by claiming that Ireland cannot have the retrospective bank recapitalisation deal it is seeking unless it agrees to a new financial programme. Norbert Barthle declared that Ireland would have to sign to a new agreement with the Troika, with new conditions, before it could tap the European Stability Mechanism to recapitalise its banks. That rather goes against Angela Merkel's comments on Sunday night that Ireland was a 'special case' (having taken its toxic bank debts on to the public books before Europe had agreed its new bailout powers). The Irish Times has more details of the comments from Barthle, who is the spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU group in the Bundestag. Barthle's views been swiftly rebutted by Ireland's foreign minister, Eamon Gilmore. He pointed out that Ireland is focused on returning to the financial markets, not signing up to more austerity: In one hour's time, we'll discover how the US economy performed in the third quarter of this year. Economists predict growth picked up pace in Q3, at an annualised rate of 1.8% to 1.9% (so almost 0.5% on a quarterly basis). With no deal on the fiscal cliff and no shortage of disappointing earnings from American firms in recent days, the GDP data is eagerly awaited. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says a strong performance could calm nerves in the markets: Third-quarter US GDP figures may help countervail negativity however.... The pickup may stoke hopes that firming growth in the world\u2019s top economy is becoming better able to offset sluggish performance in Asia and a recession in Europe. A protest against the Spanish government's austerity programme has been taking place in Valencia this morning. It was led by civil servants angered by the \u20ac60bn package of tax rises and spending cuts announced by Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister. Here are some photos from the demos: Now here's a clawback \u2013 72 senior bankers at Spain's Bankia have been ordered to repay bonuses which were 'earned' in 2011. Our correspondent in Madrid, Giles Tremlett, reports: Bankia is to tell them to return the money in response to a petition from the European commission, which says they should not have been awarded bonuses just weeks before the bank admitted it needed \u20ac23bn in bailout money. \"We have received the instruction via the Bank of Spain and, effectively, those people will have to return their bonuses,\" a spokeswoman said. Despite Bankia's lurch into nationalisation this summer, most of the executives are still employed at the bank \u2013 making it easier to recoup the money. Here's more reaction to today's Spanish unemployment data, and the wider crisis in Spain's economy (via Bloomberg) Justin Knight, a European rate strategist at UBS AG in London: Unemployment is one part of a multifaceted problem in Spain.... The recession is looking very bad and it looks like it will be worse than forecast. This is a Spanish problem as much as it is a problem of the euro; Spain\u2019s public and private sector net external debt is the same size as Greece\u2019s. Ricardo Santos, an economist at BNP Paribas SA in London: The situation is serious...There is still room for a deterioration in unemployment. Activity is weak and the government will reduce jobs as there are strict targets to adjust the number of public-sector temporary workers, especially in health and education. The only glimmer of hope in today's bleak figures was a small drop in youth unemployment, from 53% to 52% during the quarter. But at 25.02%, the overall rate is desperately high by historic standards, as well as being a Spanish record: Fans of Greek deadlines will be keen to know that Athens has been given until Sunday night to achieve full agreement on its \u20ac13.5bn austerity package. Kathimerini has the details: The three-day extension it got in order to get maximum backing within the three-party coalition will be necessary as minor partner Democratic Left insists on an improvement in the terms concerning labor reforms that it staunchly opposes. The Euro Working Group (EWG) of eurozone finance ministry officials will convene again on Monday to discuss whatever conclusions Athens has come to and prepare the blueprint that the Eurogroup of euro area finance ministers may discuss on Wednesday through a video conference that sources from Brussels say is likely to take place in order to discuss Greece. Our Madrid correspondent, Giles Tremlett, flags up that Spain's jobs crisis is particularly acute in the south of the country. Giles writes: Today's third quarter unemployment figures in Spain are terrible enough, confirming that one in four Spaniards are now out of work. But the figures for some southern provinces are even more shocking. Jaen, in Andalucia, for example, now has 39 percent unemployment \u2013 nearly four out of ten workers. In fact Andalucia, the country's most populous region which stretches from Huelva in the west to Almeria in the east, has an unemployment rate of 35 percent. Of Spain's seventeen regions, two more \u2013 the Canary Islands and western Extremadura \u2013 also have one in three people out of work. Full details are here (pdf). Gloom from Italy, where manufacturing business confidence has fallen unexpectedly. The Italian statistics body reported that business confidence dipped to 87.6 on its index, worse than analysts had forecast and a disappointing reversal after rising in September to 88. Firms reported that their order books were shrinking, at a time when Europe is sliding into recession. Over in Asia, most of the main indices fell today after Apple released weaker-than-expected financial results last night, and Amazon also disappointed. Here's the damage: Japan's Nikkei 225: down 122 points at 8,933, - 1.35% Hong Kong Hang Seng: down 264 points at 21,546, - 1.21% China's Shanghai Composite Index: down 36 points at 2,066, -1.69% Europe's markets are following suit too, led by Spain. FTSE 100: down 33 points at 5772. -0.57% German DAX: down 46 points at 7153, -0.65% French CAC: down 28 points at 3383 Spanish IBEX: down 94 points at 7685, - 1.23% Italian FTSE MIB: down 154 points at 15376, - 0.98% One alarming element of today's rise in Spanish unemployment (see 8.13 onwards) is that most of the country's latest austerity package hasn't kicked in yet. With Spain's likely to keep shrinking through 2013, today's record high of 25% could be broken. Silvio Peruzzo, economist at Nomura in London, warned (vie Reuters): There is a debate over the optimistic growth outlook for next year by the government, which is given little credibility. Weaker growth than expected, coupled with austerity, could easily see unemployment hit 26 percent next year. Here's Independent economist Shaun Richards on the Spanish jobless crisis: El Pais has a great graph showing how Spain's unemployment has risen, on its site this morning: El Pais also has the regional breakdown of today's jobless data, and reports that the highest increases were seen in Andalusia (61,300), Valencia (26,500) and Murcia (20,600). More here. While Spain's jobless rate is at its highest in at least 36 years, the picture in Germany is rather rosier. German consumer confidence has hit its highest level since the financial crisis began. This is based on the monthly consumer sentiment index compiled by GfK, which rose unexpectedly to 6.3, up from 6.1 a month ago. That shows Germans are more upbeat about November's prospects than for any month since October 2007 \u2013 when the credit crunch began. Those surveyed are also more willing to spend than a month ago, and also more bullish about their income expectations. Galling news for those in the periphery. But it could be good news generally, if German consumers can help drag the eurozone forwards. ING economist Carsten Brzeski commented: The news that the Spanish unemployment rate has hit 25% in the last three months highlights the steady deterioration in Spain's economy, which has been shrinking all year. An extra 85,000 joined the ranks of the unemployed in the last quarter, taking the total to 5,778,100. The data was released by the Ministry of Labour and Immigration at 8am BST (9am CEST). The jobless crisis in Spain rivals Greece's own slump in employment. Today's rise may be partly due to the government's labour reforms. Here's Reuters early take: Spain's unemployment rate rose to 25 percent in the third quarter, a new record high, official data showed on Friday as a labour reform making it easier to dismiss workers and steep recession left even more out of a job. The data is separate to the monthly readings from Eurostat \u2013 which pegged the Spanish jobless rate at 25.1% in August. It's the highest rate since at least 1976: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other events in the world economy. We start with some breaking news \u2013 Spanish unemployment has hit a new record high. Government figures just released showed that the jobless rate jumped to 25% in the third quarter of 2012, up from 24.6% in the second three months of the year. More to follow ... Also coming up today ... For the second day running, the big news will probably come outside Europe. It's America's turn to release the first estimate of economic activity for the last three months. After the UK beat forecasts on Thursday and slid gracefully out of recession, the US third-quarter GDP is eagerly awaited. Not least with the presidential election just 11 days away... Concerns over the state of the US economy have been growing in recent days, with a swathe of global giants missing forecasts. This trend continues last night, with both Apple and Amazon failing to shine: \u2022 Wall Street not impressed by iPad numbers \u2013 The Guardian \u2022 Apple And Amazon Earnings Disappoint \u2013 Sky News Back on home turf, we face another day of negotiations between the Greek government and the troika. The junior coalition partner, Democratic Left, continues to oppose parts of the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package that Greece must agree in return for aid. As finance minister Yannis Stournaras said last night: The only obstacle to an agreement is the Democratic Left's stance... I hope that eventually they will agree. We'll be tracking events in Athens through the day, and also covering all the reaction and analysis when the US GDP data is released this afternoon (at 1.30pm BST).",
