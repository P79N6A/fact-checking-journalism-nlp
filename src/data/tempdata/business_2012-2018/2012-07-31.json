Late payment of July's bills will also apply to some 700 privately managed, but state-funded, schools \u2013 though teachers salaries are not affected. The Catalan administration boycotted a meeting between the Spanish government and regional finance chiefs. At the meeting budget minister Crist\u00f3bal Montoro was expected to try to force regional finance chiefs to stick to a joint deficit target of 1.5% this year. \"It doesn't make sense to attend a meeting where everything is already decided,\" said Homs. Catalonia has indicated it will join Valencia and Murcia in asking the government for money from a new regional bailout fund for financing deficits and refinancing existing debt. Regional leaders were waiting to hear exactly what conditions the government would attach to loans from the fund \u2013 which will probably include more austerity and a tighter rein from Madrid. Mariano Rajoy's conservative People's party (PP) government passed laws allowing it to take direct control of the finances of regions that fail to meet deficit targets. That would be greeted angrily in Catalonia, which claims that too much local tax money goes to poorer Spanish regions and where there is growing anger \u2013 with occasional payment boycotts \u2013 at toll roads, which are far more common than in other regions. Experts doubt, however, that regions such as Murcia, Catalonia or Valencia will be able to meet this year's 1.5% deficit target. Regional Catalan president Artur Mas, of the nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, has said he will call elections if Catalonia's finances are taken over by central government. Last year Spain missed its Brussels-imposed deficit target mainly because of the regions, which not only failed to cut their share of the deficit to 1.3% of GDP but increased it to 3.4%. Rajoy has pledged to meet this year's deficit target, with a recently-agreed euro zone bailout of up to \u20ac100bn (\u00a378bn) for Spain's troubled banks insisting that it follow instructions from Brussels on raising taxes and cutting spending. A \u20ac65bn austerity package to cover the period until the end of 2014 was passed this month, including a three point hike in the headline VAT rate. Economists predict that Spain's economy will continue to shrink into 2013 and, possibly, 2014. That will depress tax revenue, making it even more difficult to meet deficit targets.",

Say hello to the m-shaped cycle, a fair description of the world after the financial crisis according to Trevor Greetham of fund management house Fidelity Worldwide. Or, more prosaically, \"brief policy-driven economic upswings are followed by short-lived but intense downturns\".</p> <p>You can see what he means. Downturns come on suddenly in a debt-laden world but policymakers can achieve rapid results when they hit their emergency monetary buttons \u2013 only to see the recovery fade quickly when support is withdrawn. A further complication is that nobody really trusts policies such as quantitative easing to achieve lasting benefits and so confidence falls as soon as the drug is withdrawn. Greetham calculates that periods of acceleration and deceleration in global economic activity have averaged about a year over the past 40 years; since 2007, however, upswings have lasted six months and downswings nine months.</p> <p>In this yo-yo world, policymakers are only jolted into action when panic is intense. So far, Greetham reckons, we've seen only their second-best shots, with sentiment having to slump a lot further before the big guns are rolled out.</p> <p>That analysis provides a suitable commentary for Wednesday's big event. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/26/markets-rally-ecb-preserve-euro\" title=\"\">marched the market to the top of the hill last week by declaring that he was \"ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro\"</a>.

      "bodyText": "The alphabet of letters to describe economic conditions \u2013 such as the V-, L- and W-shaped recoveries \u2013 has not been exhausted, it seems. Say hello to the m-shaped cycle, a fair description of the world after the financial crisis according to Trevor Greetham of fund management house Fidelity Worldwide. Or, more prosaically, \"brief policy-driven economic upswings are followed by short-lived but intense downturns\". You can see what he means. Downturns come on suddenly in a debt-laden world but policymakers can achieve rapid results when they hit their emergency monetary buttons \u2013 only to see the recovery fade quickly when support is withdrawn. A further complication is that nobody really trusts policies such as quantitative easing to achieve lasting benefits and so confidence falls as soon as the drug is withdrawn. Greetham calculates that periods of acceleration and deceleration in global economic activity have averaged about a year over the past 40 years; since 2007, however, upswings have lasted six months and downswings nine months. In this yo-yo world, policymakers are only jolted into action when panic is intense. So far, Greetham reckons, we've seen only their second-best shots, with sentiment having to slump a lot further before the big guns are rolled out. That analysis provides a suitable commentary for Wednesday's big event. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, marched the market to the top of the hill last week by declaring that he was \"ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro\". Now he'd better deliver. Anything less than a big programme of buying Spanish and Italian bonds is bound to disappoint. After the recent run of economic data, investors would conclude that it's too late to avoid another downstroke of the \"m\".",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "France and Italy are trying to bounce a reluctant Germany into swift action to prop up the euro as the deepening crisis sent unemployment to its highest level since the creation of the 17-nation single currency zone in 1999. Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister, and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, made it clear after talks in Rome that they wanted measures to help euro members struggling with high borrowing costs. The joint statement on Tuesday evening followed a day in which news of lengthening dole queues and a standoff between the Greek government and the troika group responsible for setting bailout conditions rattled financial markets. Officials from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Union refused to soften demands for a fresh \u20ac11.5bn (\u00a39bn) package of cuts despite pleas from the coalition government in Athens. Greece has warned it will run out of money on 20 August but the troika said more austerity was the price for continued financial help. Before a crucial meeting of the ECB on Wednesday, investors ditched Spanish and Italian bonds and sought out safe havens in Germany and the Netherlands as doubts continued to surface about the central bank's ability to make good on its promise to do whatever it takes to save the euro. European financial markets have rallied strongly since Mario Draghi, the ECB's president, said last Thursday that he had the necessary firepower to prevent rocketing interest rates on the borrowing of weak eurozone countries leading to the disintegration of monetary union. The rally has lost momentum in the past two days as markets have downgraded their expectations of the ECB meeting. Louise Cooper, analyst at BGC Partners, said: \"I am beginning to think that Mr Draghi's comments last week were made from a position of weakness rather than strength. Isn't it also better to 'shock and awe' the markets rather than promising them they will be shocked and awed at some stage of the future? \"It could be argued that Draghi had to say something quickly to halt the rapidly rising Spanish bond yields \u2013 prior to his comments, Spanish two-year yields went over 7% \u2013 and so he was forced by the markets to say something, which is never an ideal position. \"He may also have been acting pre-emptively to force recalcitrants both on the ECB and within Germany's Bundestag to back his more aggressive ECB stance.\" Monti, who said on Tuesday that he could see \"light at the end of the tunnel\", will hold talks in Finland on Wednesday and in Spain on Thursday as he seeks to put pressure on Angela Merkel to agree to the use of radical measures by the ECB to bring down long-term interest rates. The German government remains cautious about some of the ideas being floated, including pumping more cheap money into European banks, the purchase of bonds by the Frankfurt-based central bank and the granting of a banking licence to Europe's bailout fund, the European stability mechanism, to allow it to receive financial backing from the ECB. Figures released by Eurostat in Brussels showed that the number of jobless people across the Eurozone rose by 123,000 in June, taking the total to 17.8m, the highest level since the eurozone was formed in January 1999. The 14th successive monthly rise in eurozone joblessness brought the cumulative rise to 2.25m since April 2011, and left the unemployment rate at 11.2% Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said: \"With the Eurozone already looking odds on to suffer further GDP contraction in the third quarter after a likely appreciable drop in the second quarter, and with already weak eurozone business confidence softening further across all sectors in July, the likelihood is that the eurozone unemployment rate will move significantly higher over the coming months. \"Indeed, it now looks odds on that the eurozone unemployment rate will exceed 11.5% by the end of the year, although the situation will vary markedly between countries. Furthermore, there looks to be a very real danger that the eurozone unemployment rate could reach 12% in 2013.\" In Greece the troika's hardline stance is putting strains on the fragile \"pro-austerity\" coalition formed after the country's elections in June. Talks between the coalition partners will take place on Wednesday after the socialist leader, Evangelos Venizelos, said the bailout conditions were not working and would have to change.",

Despite chief executive Bob Dudley's assertion that one of Britain's biggest corporate names has moved on from the hammering its reputation and finances have taken, one analyst warned that BP was \"testing the faith\" of investors.</p> <p>The blow-out at a BP-operated well in April 2010 caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 people and saw 4.9m barrels of oil gush into the sea off the coast of Louisiana, leaving the group with a multibillion-dollar damages and clean-up bill. It announced in its latest quarterly update that the cost had risen owing to \"an increase in the provision for various costs and litigation relating to the incident\". The $38bn already includes $14bn in costs to restore 4,375 miles of shoreline and $8.8bn in compensation payments, although it has been reduced by $4bn following settlements with partners in the ill-fated Macondo well.</p> <p>Dudley said he stood by comments made in October last year when he said the group had \"turned the corner\", pledging that operations were returning to normal and setting a target of a 50% increase in cashflow by 2014.</p> <p>\"I don't think that the company is losing its way whatsoever,\" said Dudley, pointing to a return to production in the Gulf of Mexico, where six rigs are now operating. \"These things are massively important in terms of getting BP back to work.\" He added: \"BP is a company still making a transformation. We are building a stronger, safer company.\"</p> <p>The fall in underlying profits to $3.7bn in the three months to 30 June reflected lower oil and gas prices, a higher-than-expected tax hit on its troubled Russian joint venture and maintenance overhauls on its remaining Gulf of Mexico operations. The results included $4.8bn of writedowns largely related to its US refinery and US shale gas businesses, with the performance of the latter hit by a Henry Hub gas price that has nearly halved since last year.</p> <p>BP shares fell 4.3% to 425.05p. Richard Hunter, head of equities at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said the results were worse than recent figures from fellow majors Shell and Exxon, which were also affected by lower commodity prices.

      "bodyText": "BP has set aside a further $847m (\u00a3540m) to pay for the Deepwater Horizon disaster, raising the potential cost to $38bn, but the oil major's embattled boss stood by claims that the group has \"turned the corner\" after the world's worst offshore spill. Atoning for the blow-out in the Gulf of Mexico has been an expensive and ongoing process for BP, with disappointing second quarter figures showing a 35% fall in underlying profits to $3.7bn. Despite chief executive Bob Dudley's assertion that one of Britain's biggest corporate names has moved on from the hammering its reputation and finances have taken, one analyst warned that BP was \"testing the faith\" of investors. The blow-out at a BP-operated well in April 2010 caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 people and saw 4.9m barrels of oil gush into the sea off the coast of Louisiana, leaving the group with a multibillion-dollar damages and clean-up bill. It announced in its latest quarterly update that the cost had risen owing to \"an increase in the provision for various costs and litigation relating to the incident\". The $38bn already includes $14bn in costs to restore 4,375 miles of shoreline and $8.8bn in compensation payments, although it has been reduced by $4bn following settlements with partners in the ill-fated Macondo well. Dudley said he stood by comments made in October last year when he said the group had \"turned the corner\", pledging that operations were returning to normal and setting a target of a 50% increase in cashflow by 2014. \"I don't think that the company is losing its way whatsoever,\" said Dudley, pointing to a return to production in the Gulf of Mexico, where six rigs are now operating. \"These things are massively important in terms of getting BP back to work.\" He added: \"BP is a company still making a transformation. We are building a stronger, safer company.\" The fall in underlying profits to $3.7bn in the three months to 30 June reflected lower oil and gas prices, a higher-than-expected tax hit on its troubled Russian joint venture and maintenance overhauls on its remaining Gulf of Mexico operations. The results included $4.8bn of writedowns largely related to its US refinery and US shale gas businesses, with the performance of the latter hit by a Henry Hub gas price that has nearly halved since last year. BP shares fell 4.3% to 425.05p. Richard Hunter, head of equities at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said the results were worse than recent figures from fellow majors Shell and Exxon, which were also affected by lower commodity prices. He said: \"BP has unfortunately surpassed the disappointing scene which had already been set by Shell and Exxon.\" Richard Griffiths, analyst at Oriel Securities, said the figures were \"testing the faith\" of investors and on a divisional basis \"missed (expectations) at every level\". Dudley acknowledged that two clouds would continue to hover over the company, as BP admitted that \"significant uncertainty\" remained over its Deepwater Horizon obligations, with the business yet to reach a settlement with the US Department of Justice.

      "bodyText": "Warrants used to seize documents and computer files from the homes and offices of the Mayfair property tycoons Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz have been over-ruled by two high-court judges in a bitter blow to the Serious Fraud Office. The investigation into what were suspected corrupt dealings between the Tchenguiz brothers and the executives at the Icelandic bank Kaupthing, which failed in 2008, was the largest pursued by the SFO in almost 10 years. But the SFO has been criticised by two of Britain's most senior judges during a lengthy judicial review of its investigation. The SFO has already conceded that its suspicions over Vincent Tchenguiz were based on errors and were, on closer examination, without grounds. He was dropped as a suspect. However, despite the court judging that error-ridden warrants in relation to Robert Tchenguiz should be quashed too, the SFO insisted it would go ahead with its inquiry. After the judgment, Robert said he would seek damages from the SFO over his arrest last year. The brothers were arrested and questioned in March 2011 in an inquiry into the collapse of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing; both were released without charge pending further investigation. \"We note that the court declined to consider the merits of the future of the investigation, this being the responsibility of the SFO as an investigating and prosecuting authority. The SFO will continue with the investigation with renewed focus and vigour,\" the office said in a statement. Two senior high-court judges ruled on Tuesday that the information presented by the SFO during a 20-minute hearing to obtain the warrants 16 months ago was riddled with errors and failed to present all the facts to the sitting judge. Sir John Thomas and Mr Justice Silber said the judge who granted the order was \"given an account that was not only wholly inadequate, but unfair\". Robert said he and his \"family have suffered enormous damage, not least to my reputation\". He added: \"I also intend to bring proceedings against the SFO in respect of my arrest.\" The judgment also heavily criticised the SFO, and in an unusual decision, the judges called on the government to increase its funding. \"It is clear that incalculable damage will be done to the financial markets of London if proper resources, both human and financial, are not made available for such investigations and prosecutions.\" With the investigation into Robert still ongoing, the high-court judgment said: \"It is very important that proceedings of this kind are confined to the issues that strictly arise, and are not utilised as a means of indirectly seeking the court's view on an investigation.\" It ruled that the information given presented to a crown court judge failed to lay out the facts, while the judge's failure to give a reason for providing the warrants was also criticised. It said the failure was \"a grave and material omission, which resulted in the judge not being given a fair presentation of the key issue in the case \u2013 was this a case where Kaupthing made a wrong commercial decision in December 2007 \u2026 or was this dishonest and collusive lending?\"",
