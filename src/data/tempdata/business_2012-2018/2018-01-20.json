      "bodyText": "Whenever a policy fails to deliver, a good place to see why this happened is to look at the government\u2019s objectives. This week, we received a very good explanation of the government\u2019s objectives for the national broadband network and why it will continue to disappoint so many of us. The poor regard in which Australia\u2019s internet is held was displayed cuttingly this week by American journalist Ben Rothenberg, who is in Melbourne covering the Australian Open. He tweeted about a match in Auckland where it was suggested American Jack Sock had displayed a lack of effort. He then casually used our internet as a punch line: \u201c(I\u2019m working on uploading a video of Sock\u2019s match but on this Australian wifi it\u2019s going to take about an hour, bear with me y\u2019all).\u201d It was a nicely timed sentiment, given the news this week that only a quarter of those who connected to the NBN via fibre to the node (FTTN) would be able to access download speeds of 100Mbps (megabits per second) once the rollout was completed. Now you might expect the government would be scrambling to explain what it is doing to improve the situation. But you would be wrong. Far from expressing concern, the minister for communications, senator Mitch Fifield, wrote an opinion piece for Fairfax newspapers essentially boasting about those numbers. He claimed there was no failure because \u201cgiven the choice, Australians have shown that 100Mbps speeds are not as important to them as keeping monthly internet bills affordable, when the services they are using typically don\u2019t require those speeds\u201d (Netflix was the service he cited). Now you might think the fact that higher internet speeds are unaffordable for a majority of Australians is a problem. But again you would be wrong. And it is all about policy objectives. The government\u2019s objective for the national broadband network was not to give Australians a world-class internet with speeds and prices equivalent or better than the rest of the world, which in turn would provide the country with infrastructure that would set us up for the next 100 years. As the NBN\u2019s own corporate plan puts it, \u201cnbn\u2019s key objective is to ensure all Australians have access to fast broadband as soon as possible, at affordable prices, and at least cost\u201d. But what is fast? Well, senator Fifield made it clear that it was 25Mps, as that was the speed recommended to download Netflix. He said \u201ceveryone will have access to speeds of at least 25Mbps\u201d and \u201ctwo-thirds of premises will have access to 100Mbps\u201d. When your objective is only to provide everyone with an internet that allows them to download Netflix, then that is what you deliver. Policy objectives have long been a problem with the NBN. The Labor party, for example, did wish to have the faster fibre to the home (FTTH) connections, but it too came with a caveat. Because the ALP was forever afraid of budget deficits, the NBN was set up to be eventually sold at a profit. As such it could be deemed an investment and spending on it was \u201coff-budget\u201d. This led to pricing issues that have caused the price of top-end internet speeds to be out of reach for most people, and where internet service providers (ISPs) have in effect skimped on buying access from the NBN, which means your connection slows during peak times. That may improve under a new pricing model the NBN has just released \u2013 which has already led to some ISPs reducing their prices. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has also cracked down on how ISPs advertise their speeds. Last year, Telstra agreed to compensate 42,000 customers because the limitations on their connections \u201cwere not capable of receiving the maximum advertised speeds of the plans\u201d. That is why most ISPs now refer to \u201cstandard/typical evening speeds\u201d rather than the maximum possible speed. But in the end it still comes back to policy objectives. If your objective is an internet that is good enough to download Netflix in 2018, you can ignore what the requirements will be in 10, 20 or 50 years\u2019 time, and you can also overlook the crucial issues of upload speeds that are vital for businesses. If your objective is also to somehow make a profit from it all, then you try to do it as cheaply as possible by using sub-par technology such as FTTN rather than FTTH or FTTC (to the curb), , and under a structure that has people being either unable to afford plans with faster speeds or to access them. And then to justify your objective, you claim that being unable to afford something is a matter of \u201cchoice\u201d and proof that faster speeds are not needed. At present, the objective is to roll out the national broadband network as fast as possible and to upgrade to FTTH or FTTC - as a representative from NBN Co told a recent parliamentary committee \u2013 \u201cas and when consumers are willing to pay more because they need higher speeds\u201d. But we now have a system where the unwillingness to pay more is viewed as evidence that the need is not there, so does anyone expect that upgrade to occur soon? And we all know that increased need will happen \u2013 but it will come at greater cost because, in effect, we will do the same thing twice \u2013 the first time on the cheap and the second time properly. It\u2019s why there may be fixes around the edges \u2013 some better pricing plans, maybe less buffering \u2013 but until the actual objective of the NBN changes, it will continue to disappoint and remain a punch line.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brexit, at its heart, is a recognition that Britain has become steadily weaker since it spent much of its empire wealth fighting two world wars \u2013 too feeble in the years before the 2016 referendum to sustain an exchange rate of $1.60 and \u20ac1.40, just as it was too poor to cope with $4 to the pound in the 1950s and $2 to the pound in 1992. Manufacturers were unable to make things cheaply, reliably or efficiently enough against the headwind of a high-value currency, forcing many to give up. An economy that boasted 20% of its income coming from manufacturing in the 1980s found it was the source of barely 10% at the beginning of this decade. Surges in GDP growth in the 70 years since the war can be attributed (and this short list makes the point crudely) to periods when there were cheap raw materials and energy costs; or a growing population; or foreign ownership and management of key industries; or the offloading of vast amounts of state and mutually owned assets; or cheap borrowing. Without these in operation to improve the UK\u2019s performance, a lower exchange rate became inevitable. Some Brexit campaigners made a cheaper currency their explicit aim, arguing that while Britain\u2019s wealth and standing in the world would be diminished in the short term, the breathing space given to manufacturers would allow them to sell abroad at cheaper prices, then use the funds to invest and gain the efficiencies needed to cope with a return to a higher exchange rate sometime in the next decade. There is a good deal of logic to the argument, but it rests, like so many revolutionary aims, on the many and competing forces in the economy doing exactly what its proponents want them to. For instance, manufacturers, with a few honourable exceptions, have refused to invest more than the bare minimum for decades, even when the exchange rate has helped them. There are windfall profits to be made when currencies fall: but these windfalls have been trousered by shareholders, not invested. Banks, too, are a roadblock to growth and principally need to wean themselves off the property drug. This is why the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, argues strongly for regional banks to bypass the existing high street lenders. Again, this appears like a new-world solution to an age-old problem. What could be more farsighted and lead to more diversity than supporting a new breed of financial lender with a remit to find successful entrepreneurs? But the risks are huge \u2013 not just of lending to people with dud business plans, but also of creating an institution that is stuck in the mire of British hope-for-the-best management from the moment it is launched. Without a revolution in the way companies and public sector institutions are managed, there is little hope of a self-induced revival. That is why the car industry is now foreign owned and run. Brexit is also said to be the answer to Britain getting a pay rise. With fewer immigrants, the argument goes, the labour market will tighten and before too long workers will find themselves in the happy position of bidding up their wages. Not so fast. When so much growth over the past six years of recovery has been in the low-paid services sector, it is more likely that those businesses, confronted by angry staff, will close rather than pay up. They provide a discretionary service with a price ceiling: charge more and the customer will choose to do something else. That goes for hotels and coffee bars. They could all suffer hugely. So whether the solution to a more balanced and faster-growing economy is providing existing institutions with an incentive (a lower pound to exporters) or bypassing institutions, such as today\u2019s commercial banks, there is little guarantee the GDP dial will move. Power to the workers from lower immigration doesn\u2019t make a difference if all it means is that the jobs they are doing disappear. Brexit is only something \u2013 even if you accept the premise of socialism in one country or free-market bonanza \u2013 that works on paper. Which is a distinct problem when so much of what the UK has relied on for growth is running dry. There are not many state assets left to flog. Raw materials and energy costs are rising, while the foreign ownership and management of key industries could decline as Brexit cuts off easy access to the world\u2019s largest free-trade bloc. This week, GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2017 will show the economy trundling along in the run-up to Christmas. If modest growth is all that is required, it can be achieved as long as borrowing remains cheap. Without cheap borrowing, predictions of the economy\u2019s decline will become real.",

The US chief executives in Davos will not be saying no to the generous tax cuts Trump is offering, but they certainly don\u2019t want him to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) or start a trade war with China.

No prizes for guessing who it has in mind. Trump will make headlines whatever he says. One option would be to play to the crowd inside the conference hall by insisting that the US remains wedded to multilateralism.

But it would also be news if Trump decides that Davos provides the perfect opportunity to please his supporters by sticking it to the global elite.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump will loom large at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week, as the self-styled anti-globalist joins the annual gathering of billionaires, business executives and politicians. The meeting at the luxury ski resort in the Swiss Alps at the start of each year is set to be dominated by the US president, who is due to give a special address to the conference on Friday. The official theme of this year\u2019s forum is \u201ccreating a shared future in a fractured world\u201d, which could have taken its cue from Trump alone. However, it does leave enough wiggle room to take in Brexit and the growing risks from technological advances, climate change and rising inequality. Political upheaval and rising populism will also be hot topics for the more than 2,500 delegates from the realms of business, politics, academia, the charity sector and the arts, plus the usual smattering of celebrities. These will be the themes to watch out for. Trump brings \u2018America first\u2019 to a global gathering The US president might enjoy the trappings of power and a billionaire\u2019s lifestyle, like the most ardent of globalists at Davos, yet politically he has set himself up as the very opposite of the WEF and all that it stands for. The organisers set great store in \u201cmulti-stakeholder\u201d solutions and the idea that global problems are best solved by countries working together \u2013 which makes the event an unlikely stomping ground for a president bent on isolationism and putting \u201cAmerica first\u201d. Protectionism and the potential for the disruption of world trade and cooperation will be a hot topic all week. Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF, gave a thinly veiled warning to Trump at his pre-meeting press conference, arguing \u201cno individual alone can solve the issues on the global agenda\u201d. He said the world was at an inflection point where there was a \u201creal danger of a collapse of our global systems\u201d. That may be no bad thing for Trump, who has shown little love for global institutions. His keynote address just before the close of the meeting on Friday will be unmissable. The booming world economy Almost 10 years on from the financial crisis, and the global economy has got its mojo back. The International Monetary Fund will deliver its latest world economic outlook update on Monday from Davos, where there are sure to be questions about the sustainability of the current upswing. The IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, will deliver the update and speak on several other panels throughout the week. The prospect of rising inflation and the removal of economic stimulus by central banks will be sure to feature prominently, while the theme of the conference \u2013 creating a shared future \u2013 will raise the issues of wealth and growing income inequality. The rise of the robots The increasing use of artificial intelligence, robotics and the automation of jobs has been a repeating theme at Davos, and this year is no different. The impact of AI will be one of the forum\u2019s major events, with a one-to-one interview to be held between Schwab and the chief executive of Google, Sundar Pichai. The \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d will be a key theme once more, with a focus on how the loss of millions of jobs could undermine social cohesion. The way states respond to governing and taxing technologies and borderless business will be high on the agenda. Brexit sideshow Although unlikely to be a major theme at Davos this year, the annual summit will present UK ministers with an opportunity to rub shoulders with European leaders just before they pile into more substantive talks on trade later this year. Theresa May and Philip Hammond will be in attendance, while representatives from all 28 EU member states will also be heading to Davos, including the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the French president Emmanuel Macron. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will be making his first visit to Davos, planning to use the event as an opportunity to explain why the rules of the global economy need rewriting. May, on the other hand, will be expected to explain how Britain still matters on the global stage as it quits the EU. Climate-change risks to the fore Trump moved quickly to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords in one of his first acts as president last year. At Davos, where the environment is always among the most important issues up for debate, this won\u2019t have gone down well. The former US vice-president Al Gore is attending and will speak on several panels, including one about how extreme weather events are proving more devastating and expensive. The WEF\u2019s global risks perception survey, released last week, cited climate change-related issues as the top problems facing the world, while it also issued a thinly veiled warning to the US president that \u201cnation-state unilateralism\u201d will make it harder to combat change and ecological damage. Harvey Weinstein fallout comes into focus In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal, gender equality and issues such as bullying and harassment in the workplace will be in sharp focus at Davos this year. Business leaders have often talked about encouraging diversity in the past, although are also accused of having made very little headway. Women will only account for 21% of all of the participants this year. At least three sessions will directly tackle the problems facing women at work, including one with the Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson and Canadian minister for the status of women, Maryam Monsef, titled \u201cGender, power and stemming sexual harassment\u201d. Helping the developing world More than a third of participants come from developing or emerging economies, while the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, will address the opening plenary. Humanitarian crises are on the agenda, with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees out of Myanmar likely to feature prominently, as the forum considers the outlook for 2018. The actor Cate Blanchett, who alongside Elton John has won a prize designated for artists who best represent the \u201cspirit of Davos\u201d, will speak to raise awareness about the refugee crisis. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani student who fights for education and women\u2019s rights, will also speak about the importance of education and equal opportunities.",
