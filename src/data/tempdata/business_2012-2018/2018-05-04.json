The tourist authority VisitBritain said about 50,000 Americans were expected to be among the crowds lining the roads in Windsor and soaking up the atmosphere in the capital when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot later this month.

The couple\u2019s decision to get married in the grounds of Windsor Castle had also turned Slough, Maidenhead and Reading into rental hot spots, the company said. With pub landlords given special permission to stay open until 1am on the eve of the nuptials, as well as on the day itself, the British Beer &amp; Pub Association thinks the extended trading hours could deliver a \u00a310m sales boost. \u201cRelaxed licensing hours for pubs will be welcomed by pub-goers and provide a real boost to the pub trade,\u201d said Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the BBPA \u2013 which represents the owners of 20,000 pubs. The wedding clashes with the FA Cup final between Manchester United and Chelsea, but while the wedding kicks off at noon the action does not start at Wembley until teatime \u2013 avoiding potential tussles over the big screen.

Online gambling firm Betway is offering odds of 100/1 that the mercury will hit 100F (37.7C) on the big day. The country\u2019s beleaguered retailers have been limbering up for the event since the engagement was announced at the end of last year with merchandise running the gamut from twee \u00a312 tea-towels at John Lewis to Argos\u2019s \u00a314.99 rip-off of Markle\u2019s engagement ring in cubic zirconia rather than diamonds. Markle has also been boosting the fortunes of British fashion retailers by mixing high street names such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Jigsaw into her designer wardrobe for public engagements. The big supermarkets are also expected to benefit as Britons host street parties and use the event as an excuse for a get-together. It is not clear how many street parties are taking place nationwide but the figure is likely to be in the hundreds, with Hertfordshire county council alone reporting 51 applications. VisitBritain said the pomp and pageantry associated with the royal family was part of the country\u2019s appeal to overseas visitors, with the bride\u2019s nationality an added bonus because American visitors are the UK\u2019s highest spending overseas group. \u201cWe are looking at it as a showcasing moment on TV stations around the world,\u201d said VisitBritain director Patricia Yates. \u201cOur history and heritage is a huge draw internationally and this is an opportunity to reach a younger audience with a contemporary story.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A recovery on Wall Street in the wake of the US jobs figures - and despite the uncertain end to two days of trade talks between the US and China - gave a late lift to European markets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 64.45 points or 0.86% higher at 7567.14, making its sixth weekly gain in a row Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 1.02% to 12,819.60 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.26% to 5516.05 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.12% to 24,335.02 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.65% better at 10,104.1 But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.84% to 823.89 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 270 points or 1.13%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back on Tuesday after the May day Bank Holiday. US markets have recovered from a wobby start, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up more than 200 points. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Equities are advancing on a broad front as the week moves to its close, and while non-farm payrolls didn\u2019t deliver anything of a particularly spectacular nature, the overall impression is of a US economy moving in the right direction. Fans of symbolic moves will be pleased to see the unemployment rate move below 4%, and even though the wage figure failed to beat expectations, the year-on-year number has continued to recover from its late-2017 weakness, with the upward trend from the 2013 lows there for all to see. Reports that Warren Buffett had been a steady buyer of stocks in the first quarter thanks to the volatility will have stiffened a few wavering souls, helping to cancel out some of the trade war worries we saw overnight. A mixed US jobs and wages report has led, appropriately enough, to a mixed opening for US markets. After an early dip the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up just 3 points while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are both marginally lower. Here\u2019s our report on the US jobs figures: The rebound in the dollar following the US jobs data has seen the pound lose 0.58% to $1.3495, meaning sterling has lost all the gains it made against the US currency this year. However much the Fed hikes, it will not be to 40% one sincerely hopes. But the Argentinian central bank has hoisted its rates to that level in the second rise in 24 hours. On Thursday it raised them from 30.25% to 33.25% and now has lifted them to 40%. The move comes in an attempt to defend the peso, which has fallen more than 16% so far this year against the dollar. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s move to raise its own interest rates has seen outflows of capital from emerging market currencies and into the dollar. The dollar dipped in the immediate aftermath of the US data, with analysts concerned about the weaker than expected wage growth and the chance it might limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to raise interest rates by as much as expected. But the US currency soon rebounded on the basis that the figures were not really likely to sway the Fed one way or the other. Economist James Knightley at ING Bank said: The April US jobs report is a bit mixed. Employment rose 164,000, but when you add in 30,000 upward revisions to the past 2 months then it is pretty much in line with the market expectation for a 193,000 rise. Unemployment fell to 3.9%, the lowest level since December 2000, but the fall from 4.1% was amplified by a sizeable chunk of unemployed people leaving the labour force \u2013 note the participation rate fell from 62.9% to 62.8%. Rounding out the report was a softer wage number. There were some downward revisions and a weaker month on month reading for April of 0.1%, which mean the annual wage growth rate remained at 2.6%, rather than coming in at 2.7% as predicted. It isn\u2019t a particularly exciting report and certainly shouldn\u2019t alter market expectations for monetary policy in any meaningful way, but it just feels a bit soft given the state of the economy. Other surveys paint a stronger picture and we still believe that the wage story will turn higher and be the catalyst for the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on the inflation threat...we continue to look for 3 further interest rates rises this year, starting with June 13. Revisions to the payroll number for February and March paint a slightly better picture overall: The 164,000 increase in US payrolls in April was well below the average monthly gain of 191,000 over the previous 12 months, the Labor Department said. In terms of sectors, there were job gains in professional and business services, manufacturing, health care, and mining over the month of April. There was little change in other major industries, including construction, retail, transport and warehousing, leisure and hospitality, and government. Breaking: The US economy added 164,000 jobs in April, weaker than the 192,000 forecast by economists. On the flip side, the number for March was revised up by the Labor Department, to 135,000 from an initial estimate of 103,000. Average wage growth was weaker than expected, at 2.6%. Economists had predicted March\u2019s 2.7% growth would be unchanged. Meanwhile the unemployment rate fell more than expected to 3.9% in April from 4.1% in March. It was expected to edge down to 4%. Almost time for the US non farm payrolls report for April. Economists are predicting a rebound in job creation after a particularly weak March. Headline expectations according to a Reuters poll (March\u2019s figures in brackets, which could be revised): Non-farm payrolls: 192,000 (103,000) Unemployment rate: 4% (4.1%) Average annual earnings growth: 2.7% (2.7%) Growth in eurozone retail sales slowed in March, according to figures published earlier by the statistics agency Eurostat. The volume of goods sold dipped 0.1% compared with February, as consumers spent less on non-food items. Sales had risen by 0.3% in February. It dragged the annual rate of growth down to 0.8% from 1.8%. Monthly sales growth was strongest in Latvia, up 2.3% in March, while sales fell 1.7% in Ireland. The US and Chinese delegations have reached agreement on some aspects of the trade row but there are still relatively big differences on other issues, according to China\u2019s Xinhua news agency. Reuters reports: The two sides, though, committed to resolving their trade disputes through dialogue, state-run Xinhua reported. And the U.S. negotiators agreed to bring up with U.S. President Donald Trump the question of a ban on U.S. companies selling goods and software to Chinese telecommunication equipment maker ZTE Corp after representations from the Chinese side, the report said. ZTE faced the seven-year ban after the U.S. said it failed to keep to an agreement it made after breaching U.S. sanctions. The talks over the past two days have involved a high-level U.S. trade delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, following months of threats and counter threats from both sides in a series of disputes over trade practices. The U.S. team has already left Beijing and is heading back to the U.S., a U.S. official told Reuters early on Friday evening. The Americans have yet to give their account of the talks. The trade discussions had been \u201ccandid, efficient and constructive,\u201d Xinhua said, but gave almost no details on what the officials had agreed. The officials exchanged opinions on resolving tariffs and non-tariffs measures, on expanding two-way investment and the protection of intellectual property, and on expanding U.S. exports to China and bilateral services trade, Xinhua reported. It gave no indication of what actions might be taken based on those exchanges. \u201cMy impression was that (the talks) didn\u2019t go well given the rhetoric,\u201d said Kevin Lai, senior economist at Daiwa Capital markets in Hong Kong. \u201cI think the divide is still very big.\u201d Back with the trade talks, and Reuters is reporting some Chinese proposals to the US: The latest business surveys from the eurozone suggest the weaker growth achieved in the first quarter of 2018 could be spilling over to the second. The headline index on the IHS Markit services sector PMI fell to an eight-month low of 54.7 in April, from 54.9 in March. It nudged the composite index, which combines manufacturing and services, down to 55.1 last month, from 55.2 in March. However, the figures still indicated fairly robust growth across the single currency bloc, with any number above 5o signalling expansion. Ireland was the top performer in April on the composite measure: Ireland: 57.6 France: 56.9 Spain: 55.4 Germany: 54.6 Italy: 52.9 Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, provides some context: The final PMI numbers confirm the marked, broad-based fading of the eurozone\u2019s growth spurt so far this year. The headline index has fallen from an 11-and-a-half year peak in January to a 15-month low in April. Despite the drop, the PMI is not yet at a worryingly low level, but the survey details hint at further easing in the coming months. Here is our full story on the job losses planned at BT: Reports are coming from China of a leaked list of demands/wishes from the US trade delegation in Beijing. On the list is the request that China cuts its trade surplus to $200bn by 2020, from more than $300bn in 2017. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Lingling Wei has details from the list: New car sales in the month of April from 2002-2018: The rise in new car sales in April should be treated with caution, says Ian Gilmartin, head of retail at Barclays corporate banking: The uptick in new car sales will be welcome news for many sellers, but we can\u2019t have it both ways \u2013 just as we partly attributed last month\u2019s poor result to an unfair comparison to an unusually strong March 2017 ahead of the tax changes, similarly April 2017 was relatively weaker after the VED increase came into force, which flatters today\u2019s numbers. With the exception of last year, it is still the weakest April since 2013 but after a full year of declines, the industry will cheer a sales increase in whatever way it\u2019s achieved. Sales of new cars rose in April for the first time in a year, but the sharp decline in diesel sales continued. New car registrations rose 10.4% compared with the same month last year, to 167,911 according to the latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. However, the trade body cautioned that last month\u2019s figures were flattered by a particularly week April last year, after buyers had brought forward purchases to avoid the new vehicle excise duty (VED) rules coming into force in the same month. Diesels sales plunged 25% to 51,377, while petrol sales were up 38% to 107,169. Alternative fuel sales rose 49% to 9,365. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT commented on the latest figures: It\u2019s important not to look at one month in isolation and, given the major disruption to last April\u2019s market caused by sweeping VED changes, this increase is not unexpected. While the continuing growth in demand for plug-in and hybrid cars is positive news, the market share of these vehicles remains low and will do little to offset damaging declines elsewhere. Consumers need certainty about future policies towards different fuel types, including diesel, and a compelling package of incentives to deliver long-term confidence in the newest technologies.\u201d Bad news for BT workers this morning as the British telecoms giant prepares to announce more than 6,000 job cuts next week, according to the Financial Times. BT is expected to announce the cuts alongside its full-year results next week, when chief executive Gavin Patterson will update investors on strategy. Shares have nearly halved over the past two years, and Patterson will be hoping that a major new programme of job/cost cuts will go some way to appease shareholders. The latest job cuts will be in addition to the 4,000 redundancies announced a year ago, the FT reports. With the exception of the CAC in France, major markets across Europe are higher this morning. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,526 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.4% at 12,742 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,495 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 24,245 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,050 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 386 While investors are likely to welcome Steven Mnuchin\u2019s upbeat tone over in Beijing, expectations of a major breakthrough today remain low. Lukman Otunuga, analyst at currency trading firm FXTM, explains: The chances of a breakthrough trade deal from the two-day meeting are seen as highly unlikely. However, the talks could be a positive step for the two nations to avoid a potential trade war. Although it is difficult to predict the outcome of the trade meetings, continual talks and negotiations between the Trump administration officials and Chinese officials may ease tensions. Any signs of a possible breakdown in negotiations between the US and China have the ability to weigh on risk sentiment, consequently punishing global stocks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A second day of trade talks between America and China is underway as the two sides negotiate policy in a meeting that could potentially avert a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters in Beijing this morning that \u201cwe are having very good conversations\u201d with Chinese counterparts. The comments are likely to boost hopes that a full-scale trade war can be avoided. It\u2019s also non-farm payrolls day in the US, which is always a favourite with investors looking for clues on the state of the wider economy and the likely timing of the next interest rate rise. The agenda: 9am BST: eurozone service sector and composite PMI report for April 10am BST: eurozone retail sales for March 1.30pm BST: US non-farm payrolls report for April 1.30pm BST: US wage growth for April",

On Thursday the bank lifted borrowing costs from 30.25% to 33.25%, having already raised them from 27.25% on 27 April. The peso has suffered with foreign investors moving their money from emerging market currencies into the dollar to benefit from the recent rate rises by the US Federal Reserve. However, in recent days nervous Argentinians have also been cashing in their pesos for dollars. Argentina has come under pressure because of its slow economic growth along with one of the world\u2019s highest inflation rates, which is currently running at an annualised 25.4%. The country is in the middle of a pro-market economic reform programme under its president, Mauricio Macri, and after the latest rate rise the Treasury minister, Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne, stood by the government\u2019s plan to cut inflation to 15% this year. The central bank said it would continue to use \u201call the tools at its disposal\u201d to achieve that target. Thursday\u2019s rate rise did little to support the peso, which lost 7.83% to 23 pesos to the dollar. But Friday\u2019s increase resulted in the currency recovering some ground to 21.7 pesos. Even so, the peso is the worst performing emerging market currency this year, having lost about 19% of its value since the start of January. Dujovne also said on Friday that the government would cut its deficit target from 3.2% to 2.7% of GDP, meaning it would need to borrow \u00a33bn less this year. Edward Glossop, the Latin America economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cRisks to the peso have been brewing for a while \u2013 large twin budget and current account deficits, a heavy dollar debt burden, entrenched high inflation and an overvalued currency. \u201cThe real surprise is how quickly and suddenly things seem to be escalating.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Workers at TGI Fridays are to stage the UK\u2019s first strike over tips after ballots at two branches of the restaurant chain backed industrial action. Outlets in Milton Keynes and Covent Garden face walkouts on 18 May in protest against a new policy that hands 40% of service charge payments paid on credit and debit cards to back-of-house employees, including kitchen staff. The waiting staff, all members of the Unite union, voted unanimously for action against the changes that they say could cost them up to \u00a3250 a month in lost earnings. TGI Fridays potentially faces a summer of disruption with strike ballots under way at four more restaurants, including at the Trafford Centre in Manchester and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. Dave Turnbull, a regional officer at Unite, said: \u201cTGI\u2019s has been sent a loud message that our members will not be bullied and shoved into pay poverty. If TGI\u2019s wants to look at how it can reward kitchen staff, then work with us on a fair solution \u2013 not implement an overnight wage grab where Peter has been robbed to pay Paul.\u201d The potential strike action comes as the government faces renewed pressure to crack down on restaurants that ask waiters to hand over some or all of their tips. A spokesperson for the UK arm of TGI Fridays, which is owned by a US private equity firm, said: \u201cOur team members are a part of our Fridays family, and we care about them. We believe all our team members should be \u2013 and are \u2013 treated and paid fairly. Despite this, a small number at Milton Keynes stadium and Covent Garden have voted to strike. We are listening to them and are collectively working to find a resolution. In the meantime, we will be doing all we can to ensure our guests receive the usual great dining experience and that the restaurant remains open as normal.\u201d The dispute at TGI Fridays comes as McDonald\u2019s workers in the UK take action over zero-hours contracts and working conditions. Staff from branches in Manchester and Watford are joining colleagues in Crayford and Cambridge as part of the \u201cMcStrike\u201d as workers demand a minimum \u00a310-an-hour living wage. Members of the Bakers Food and Allied Workers\u2019 Union are also asking for a choice of fixed-hour contracts, the end of unequal pay for young workers, and union recognition.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As thousands of holidaymakers fly into Menorca this summer, a glance out the window will illustrate the past and future of the island\u2019s energy system. In the picturesque harbour of the capital, Mah\u00f3n, where cruise ships dock alongside a marina full of luxury yachts, sits a pollution-belching, oil-fired power station inaugurated by Gen Franco more than half a century ago. On the other side of this Mediterranean isle lies row upon row of solar panels, tucked between traditional dry-stone walls. The Balearics, like many islands, are overwhelmingly reliant on costly, dirty fossil fuel imports for power, heat and transport. There is Mediterranean sun \u2013 and Menorca is known as the windy island \u2013 but renewables have barely made a dent. Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera generate only 4% of their power from green energy and have some of the lowest renewables figures in the whole of Spain. The local government, however, has recently launched a plan to transform the islands\u2019 energy usage and a new climate law, with the aim of converting to 100% renewables by 2050, which it says will help tourism, protect the environment and save money. Francina Armengol, the president of the Balearic government, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a political act, we haven\u2019t done it to win votes. We believe it\u2019s the right thing.\u201d Her blueprint says renewables should reach 35% of electricity needs by 2030, that an ageing coal plant on Mallorca be shut down by 2025 and the use of gas increase to fulfil energy needs as solar grows. Large new car parks \u2013 the islands have some of the highest car ownership levels in Spain \u2013 will be ordered to fit solar power. New diesel cars will be banned from 2025, electric cars will be supported by charging points and street lights will be switched to LEDs. It will not be an easy transition. There are local and national obstacles to this vision. While the governments in the Balearics and Madrid, together with the tourist industry, energy companies, unions and ecologists are publicly agreed on the end destination, there are disagreements over the timetable. Citing energy security, Madrid has rejected the Balearic government\u2019s proposal to gradually close the sizeable Es Murterar coal power station in Mallorca and fill the gap with existing gas capacity. Endesa, the company that runs coal, gas and oil plants on the islands, has suggested a compromise, with Es Murterar being mothballed but not dismantled. Some of the station\u2019s 300 workers are unconvinced, despite promises of retraining and new job opportunities in the renewables business. \u201cThere will be no light and no jobs,\u201d said one employee during a break outside the plant, which is adjacent to a natural park and only a few minutes\u2019 walk behind the hotels and sandy beach of Alcudia Bay in the north-east of the island. There are also significant local challenges to the obvious alternative of more solar power. Residents have campaigned against solar projects because they are a blot on the landscape and because solar firms want agricultural land. As Marc Pons, the Balearic government\u2019s energy minister, admits: \u201cThere is a lot of sensitivity in rural areas.\u201d The main conservation group in Mallorca \u2013 GOB Mallorca \u2013 welcomes small solar schemes, especially on rooftops, but the spokesperson Margalida Ramis said it opposes large-scale solar farms that \u201care not about community but profit\u201d. Scale, however, is necessary to make solar economics work here and to overcome other local challenges \u2013 such as land-leasing, which costs five times more than on the mainland. Jordi Quer, who runs a solar firm in Mallorca, is frustrated but determined. \u201cWe are just waiting for a solar industry here,\u201d he said. In the meantime, local government is trying to kickstart the industry. Solar arrays have been fitted on scores of public buildings, from schools to hospitals. A further hurdle is the Balearics\u2019 regulated energy market. The islands\u2019 fossil fuel power station operators receive a \u20ac250-300m annual subsidy to compensate them for keeping residential energy prices the same as on the mainland. Solar park owners do not. Teresa Ribera, a former Spanish climate minister, said the use of public money should be an argument for \u201cthe best and cleanest options, not to waste the money in dirty options\u201d. In Menorca, there are some more hopeful signs. Mahon\u2019s oil power station is expected to switch to cleaner gas within two or three years. Conxa Junalola, the town\u2019s mayor, said residents were \u201cvery worried\u201d about the impact on their health from burning oil. Meanwhile, a significant 49MW solar farm should spring up by 2020 next to the existing 4MW one. That would take solar from 2.5% of the island\u2019s electricity needs to around a fifth. While there is a core of local people opposing the solar park, which still awaits permission from Madrid for a grid connection, it is backed by the island\u2019s influential green group. GOB Menorca wants to see more big solar farms, adapted to the landscape. And it is not only islanders calling for more renewables. Research by the tour operator Tui, a major presence on the islands, shows holidaymakers want hoteliers to use renewable energy. Jane Ashton, Tui\u2019s sustainability director, said: \u201cI think they [tourists] definitely do care. Our research over the years has shown that.\u201d A Guardian straw poll of tourists in Palma, Mallorca\u2019s capital, found they were shocked by how little solar was being used. Madrid, which is believed to prefer expanding renewables on the mainland and upgrading undersea cables to export more of it to the Balearics, insisted it was not blocking the islands\u2019 green plan. Talks between the Balearics and national government had been described as \u201cproductive\u201d. Spain was advancing more renewables and decarbonising its energy system, an energy ministry spokesperson said.",

      "bodyText": "The US unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in April, its lowest rate since December 2000, as employers stepped up hiring, modestly adding 164,000 jobs over the month. Although many employers now say it\u2019s difficult to find qualified workers, they have yet to significantly bump up pay in most industries. Average hourly earnings rose 2.6% from a year ago, slightly below expectations. The fall in the unemployment rate was also boosted by a drop in the labour force participation rate \u2013 the percentage of people who are currently employed or in search of a job. The participation rate dipped for the second straight month to 62.8% in April, near to levels previously seen in the 1970s. Job gains occurred in professional and business services, manufacturing, health care, and mining, the labor department announced. Employment in professional and business services increased by 54,000. Employment in manufacturing increased by 24,000 in April. On Twitter, Donald Trump celebrated the news and attacked his critics as his presidency becomes ever more mired in controversy. Trump wrote: \u201cJUST OUT: 3.9% Unemployment. 4% is Broken!

    "webTitle": "BT expected to cut 6,000 jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT is set to announce about 6,000 job cuts worldwide as it looks to rebuild investor confidence after a torrid 18 months blighted by the Italian accounting scandal and patchy financial performance. The telecoms company is expected to announce the cuts, which amount to about 6% of its 98,000 global workforce, as part of a corporate strategy to be unveiled by its chief executive, Gavin Patterson, at BT\u2019s annual financial results next Thursday. The latest round of cuts, which are expected to affect managerial and back-office employees, will mean BT will have shed 10,000 jobs in the last year. Analysts estimate that the cuts, first reported by the Financial Times (\u00a3), will ultimately save BT about \u00a3500m from its \u00a34.7bn annual wage bill. BT declined to comment. Patterson, whose pay package fell by \u00a34m after the Italian accounting scandal destroyed his chances of receiving a performance-based bonus, is seeking to rebuild investor confidence. BT\u2019s share price has more than halved in the last two years, and is down a quarter compared with a year ago. The share price was up about 1% to 234p at lunchtime on Friday. Last May, BT announced 4,000 jobs were to be cut, about half from its UK operation. Those cuts were forecast to save about \u00a3300m over two years. The cuts followed problems at BT\u2019s global services division, which provides IT and communications services to clients ranging from the BBC to Bromley council, and the accounting scandal at its Italian business, which cost \u00a3530m to clean up. Prospect, the union representing 140,000 public and private sector workers such as engineers and managers, said it expected to be consulted and heavily involved in any job cuts programme. \u201cProspect has been aware that BT may be looking to cut jobs and will be aiming to work with the company to minimise the number of employees impacted,\u201d said Philippa Childs, the union\u2019s national secretary. \u201cOur priorities are to ensure that our members\u2019 jobs and livelihoods are protected.\u201d Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas, in a note to investors earlier this week, referred to BT\u2019s publication of its full-year results next week as the \u201cday of reckoning\u201d. Exane believes BT will also be forced to cut its dividend for the financial year by up to a third, and that job losses could be closer to 6,600. \u201cWe think redundancies will be a key focus at the upcoming results,\u201d said Sam McHugh, the lead analyst on the note. \u201cHeadcount reduction remains one of the key drivers of \u2018value creation\u2019 at incumbent telco operators, many of whom still have large workforces.\u201d BT\u2019s last large-scale redundancies came in 2008 and 2009 when 30,000 jobs went, again largely as a result of the poor performance of its global services division. Patterson has endured a rollercoaster 18 months that has included a record \u00a342m fine from the regulator Ofcom over delays in installing high-speed internet connections for rival telecoms companies. Compensation payments could hit \u00a3300m. He authorised an eye-watering \u00a31.2bn deal to keep exclusive Champions League rights, an increase of a third on BT\u2019s current deal, as the popularity of its BT TV service began to wane. Patterson then called an end to the expensive strategy of trying to outgun Sky for the prime Premier League TV rights in the latest auction \u2013 settling for a \u201cviable second\u201d, bringing to an end years of spiralling rights inflation that has cost both sides billions. While BT is in the process of cutting staff, its standalone subsidiary Openreach, which is responsible for building and managing most of the UK\u2019s broadband infrastructure, is on a massive recruitment drive. In February, Openreach said it intended to create more than 3,500 engineering jobs this year as part of a plan to speed up the rollout of fibre broadband and eliminate \u201cnot-spots\u201d in cities and suburban areas. Kicking off a drive to upgrade the UK to next-generation gigabit-speed internet, Openreach said it would recruit and train the engineers in order to reach its new target of 3m homes and businesses by 2020.",

      "body": "<p>BT is set to announce about 6,000 job cuts worldwide as it looks to rebuild investor confidence after a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/28/bt-profits-italian-scandal-deutsche-telekom-orange\">torrid 18 months blighted by the Italian accounting scandal</a> and patchy financial performance.</p> <p>The telecoms company is expected to announce the cuts, which amount to about 6% of its 98,000 global workforce, as part of a corporate strategy to be unveiled by its chief executive, Gavin Patterson, at BT\u2019s annual financial results next Thursday.</p> <p>The latest round of cuts, which are expected to affect managerial and back-office employees, will mean BT will have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/11/bt-chief-pay-italy-accounting-scandal-gavin-patterson-bonus\">shed 10,000 jobs in the last year</a>. </p> <p>Analysts estimate that the cuts, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8394f7b4-4ec6-11e8-9471-a083af05aea7\">first reported by the Financial Times (\u00a3)</a>, will ultimately save BT about \u00a3500m from its \u00a34.7bn annual wage bill. BT declined to comment.</p> <p>Patterson, whose <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/11/bt-chief-pay-italy-accounting-scandal-gavin-patterson-bonus\">pay package fell by \u00a34m</a> after the Italian accounting scandal destroyed his chances of receiving a performance-based bonus, is seeking to rebuild investor confidence. BT\u2019s share price has more than halved in the last two years, and is down a quarter compared with a year ago.</p> <p>The share price was up about 1% to 234p at lunchtime on Friday.</p> <p>Last May, BT announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/11/bt-chief-pay-italy-accounting-scandal-gavin-patterson-bonus\">4,000 jobs were to be cut</a>, about half from its UK operation. Those cuts were forecast to save about \u00a3300m over two years.</p> <p>The cuts followed problems at BT\u2019s global services division, which provides IT and communications services to clients ranging from the BBC to Bromley council, and the accounting scandal at its Italian business, which cost \u00a3530m to clean up.</p> <p>Prospect, the union representing 140,000 public and private sector workers such as engineers and managers, said it expected to be consulted and heavily involved in any job cuts programme.</p> <p>\u201cProspect has been aware that BT may be looking to cut jobs and will be aiming to work with the company to minimise the number of employees impacted,\u201d said Philippa Childs, the union\u2019s national secretary. \u201cOur priorities are to ensure that our members\u2019 jobs and livelihoods are protected.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas, in a note to investors earlier this week, referred to BT\u2019s publication of its full-year results next week as the \u201cday of reckoning\u201d. Exane believes BT will also be forced to cut its dividend for the financial year by up to a third, and that job losses could be closer to 6,600.</p> <p>\u201cWe think redundancies will be a key focus at the upcoming results,\u201d said Sam McHugh, the lead analyst on the note. \u201cHeadcount reduction remains one of the key drivers of \u2018value creation\u2019 at incumbent telco operators, many of whom still have large workforces.\u201d</p> <p>BT\u2019s last large-scale redundancies came in 2008 and 2009 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/14/bt-cuts-15000-jobs-annual-loss\">when 30,000 jobs went,</a> again largely as a result of the poor performance of its global services division. </p> <p>Patterson has endured a rollercoaster 18 months that has included a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/27/bt-fined-42m-over-delays-to-high-speed-cable-installation\">record \u00a342m fine</a> from the regulator Ofcom over delays in installing high-speed internet connections for rival telecoms companies.

The allegations were made as part of a formal complaint to parliament about Iain Wright\u2019s conduct when he spearheaded an inquiry into the retailer\u2019s working practices. Wright was also accused of presiding over a \u201cmedia circus\u201d while he was chair of the business select committee, in a letter from Sports Direct\u2019s chairman Keith Hellawell. Hellawell said angry calls to Sports Direct\u2019s customer services team more than doubled after the MP conducted a number of interviews during the 2016 investigation. \u201cOn one occasion, the calls included a threat to rape a member of staff, and another caller said that they hoped Sports Direct employees would be diagnosed with cancer,\u201d Hellawell wrote. \u201cOur staff were also subject to a number of physical assaults and verbal abuse in our stores. \u201cThis coincided with a catastrophic fall in the share price of Sports Direct, which depleted tens of millions of pounds from the value of our share bonus pool for eligible staff.\u201d Wright\u2019s investigation of working conditions at Sports Direct \u2013 which followed a Guardian investigation and resulted in the company\u2019s founder, chief executive and majority shareholder Mike Ashley being hauled before MPs \u2013 concluded that its Shirebrook warehouse was run like a \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d. Sports Direct criticised the inquiry, saying Wright\u2019s behaviour towards the company \u201crisked undermining confidence\u201d in the select committee process. The company also claimed that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent refusal to appear before MPs could be linked to the \u201cpolitical vilification\u201d faced by Sports Direct. \u201cIn recent times some select committee proceeding have exposed witnesses appearing before them to a form of inquiry that can only be called a \u2018public trial\u2019,\u201d Hellawell wrote. \u201cPublic exposure of that kind has the potential in a high-profile case to adversely affect the companies\u2019 and individuals\u2019 fundamental rights including commercial rights, privacy and fair process.\u201d Responding to Sports Direct\u2019s claims, Wright, who stepped down as an MP before last year\u2019s election, said the committee was right to act because the retailer was \u201ctreating agency workers like muck\u201d. \u201cThey make a number of allegations, which I completely and utterly rebut. It was their business model and their treatment of workers that raised those problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI find this whole situation bizarre and baffling, and I think the work that we did really, really stands up as a fantastic example of what a select inquiry can do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former owner of collapsed high street giant BHS, Dominic Chappell, has launched a bid to clear his name after being convicted of breaching pensions laws. Chappell, 51, is appealing against a conviction for failing to provide the pensions watchdog with vital documents. The former racing driver launched his appeal on Friday in an attempt to repair his \u201ctarnished reputation\u201d. But Hove crown court was told that solicitors had been unable to make much headway with the appeal case because Chappell could not afford to pay them. Michael Levy, defending, said: \u201cMr Chappell does not have legal aid and funding has always been a difficulty.\u201d He said after Chappell was convicted in January he could not instruct solicitors because he did not have any money to do so. \u201cAfter the case Mr Chappell was not in a position to instruct anyone to work on his behalf because he was not in a position to with regards to funds.\u201d Levy told Judge Christine Henson QC: \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic, I know, but this is why I am not in a position to give your honour the detail you require.\u201d He told the court he wanted to call \u201cthree or four witnesses\u201d as part of the appeal as only calling Chappell as a sole witness in the original case in January was \u201cnot satisfactory\u201d. Chappell, of Blandford Forum, Dorset, did not take the stand and declined to comment after the hearing. The three-times bankrupt, who had no previous retail experience, bought the high street chain from billionaire Sir Philip Green for just \u00a31 in March 2015. The company crashed with the loss of 11,000 jobs 13 months later, leaving a pensions black hole of around \u00a3571m. In January, Chappell was convicted and fined \u00a350,000 with \u00a337,000 costs after being found guilty of failing to disclose vital details to the pensions watchdog as part of its investigation into the collapse of the high street chain. He was ordered to pay \u00a32,500 a month. The following month he was also hit with a bill of around \u00a310m by the Pensions Regulator as it attempted to claw back money for the pension scheme. The Pension Regulator (TPR) launched an investigation into BHS just days after Chappell took over the company \u2013 which was once a mainstay of the high street with 164 stores across the UK. The regulator, which has a responsibility to safeguard pensions, said it made the move to protect the pensions of 19,000 members. It later agreed a deal with Green that he should pay around \u00a3363m towards the pension deficit. The regulator charged Chappell with neglecting or refusing to respond to three Section 72 notices demanding he hand over vital documents and information to them relating to the purchase of the company. In the first prosecution of its kind under these charges, Chappell was found guilty of all three charges and faces an unlimited fine for failing to comply with the notices. But Chappell hit out at Pensions Regulator and said he had been the \u201cfall guy\u201d and \u201cscapegoat\u201d for the collapse of BHS. The appeal hearing is set to go ahead on 17 September.",

      "bodyText": "New car sales in the UK increased for the first time in a year in April, but demand for diesel models continues to be in freefall. The sale of 168,000 cars across the month, a 10% rise on March, was helped in part by the cold weather in the previous reporting period pushing deliveries into April, and by Easter giving dealers two extra days to sell, the industry said. Drivers are still turning away from diesel cars, which face the looming threat of city pollution charges across Europe. Diesel sales fell by a quarter, to 51,377. The market share for diesels, which have been blamed for illegal levels of nitrogen oxides across the UK, has shrunk from 45% in 2017 to 30% in 2018 so far. The appetite for electric, hybrid and plug-in cars is booming, with sales up by half to 9,365, according to figures from the industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, cautioned against looking at one month in isolation, saying that while increasing demand for greener cars was welcome, their numbers were fairly small and would \u201cdo little to offset damaging declines\u201d, in an apparent reference to diesel vehicles. The ostensibly positive results for the month are also flattered by the fact that in April 2017 sales were relatively low because of changes to vehicle excise duty. Ian Gilmartin, an analyst at Barclays, said: \u201cWith the exception of last year, it is still the weakest April since 2013 but after a full year of declines, the industry will cheer a sales increase in whatever way it\u2019s achieved.\u201d SMMT called the results strong and said it expected the market to continue gradually recovering this year. Prof David Bailey, an automotive industry expert at Aston University, said he still expected sales for the year to be down 5% to 10% on 2017. \u201cThe trend is still clear, that sales for the first part of this year are looking down and the trend away from diesel is still pronounced,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "HM Revenue and Customs is considering allegations the parcel delivery company Hermes \u201ccoerced\u201d managers into misleading an official investigation into whether the company has paid some of its self-employed couriers below the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. The tax authority ensures employers pay at least the minimum and launched an investigation into Hermes in 2016 after the Guardian revealed some couriers were earning less than \u00a36 an hour, below the \u00a37.20 minimum at the time. Hermes delivers for Marks and Spencer and John Lewis and relies on about 15,000 \u201clifestyle couriers\u201d who are paid per delivery and are categorised as self-employed, but many believe they should be classed as workers and earn the national minimum. A manager at the company has claimed that before a tax inspectors\u2019 visit last year senior Hermes managers coached staff who were about to be interviewed. \u201cIf we gave an answer to the manager we were corrected and told not to say that but to say something more positive,\u201d the anonymous whistleblower said in a letter to Frank Field MP, the chair of the Commons work and pensions select committee, which has also investigated Hermes. \u201cWe were coerced into saying something which wasn\u2019t true. Most of which related to self-employed couriers and how they were treated.\u201d The manager claims Hermes \u201cwent out of their way\u201d to bring in senior staff \u201cto purposely tell us what to say\u201d. Hermes said it categorically denies that any coaching or coercion took place and said it told managers tasked with briefing staff who were meeting HMRC inspectors not to \u201clead the individuals to answer in any particular way\u201d. Field has forwarded the manager\u2019s allegations to HMRC, saying: \u201cHermes appears to have coerced its management staff into supplying information to HMRC that is untrue and which offers an inaccurate representation of the couriers\u2019 employment relationship with the company.\u201d Its chief executive, Jon Thompson, replied: \u201cWe value receiving the kind of information you have given us. Clamping down on those who try to cheat the system through evading taxes is a key priority for us \u2026 We assess all the information we receive before making a decision on the most appropriate course of action.\u201d One tax implication of self-employment in this case is that Hermes does not have to pay employers\u2019 national insurance contributions of 13.8% on earnings above \u00a3162 a week. A spokesperson for Hermes said: \u201cAll employees were asked to cooperate fully with HMRC as we are confident in our operating model.\u201d It added: \u201cHMRC is highly skilled at recognising if \u2018coaching\u2019 has taken place\u201d and that it urged managers to tell staff \u201cto be open and honest with HMRC\u201d. Hermes is this week facing an employment tribunal claim from a group of couriers that they are in fact workers, and that as workers they should be entitled to holiday pay and to receive the national living wage. The rival delivery firm DPD last month offered all of its drivers drivers sick and holiday pay. The move was part of wholesale reforms to its gig working model, sparked by the death of a driver it charged for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes and who later collapsed and died. The Hermes claim mirrors several other similar tribunal hearings \u2013 including verdicts in cases brought against Uber, Addison Lee, City Sprint, Excel and eCourier \u2013 where judges have ruled that staff should be given the legal classification as \u201cworkers\u201d, thereby receiving the minimum wage and holiday pay rights.
