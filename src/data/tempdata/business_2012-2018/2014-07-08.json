But the shareholder who complained at Tuesday's annual meeting about how long the group-wide turnaround is taking could also have grumbled about the world's longest settling-in period.</p> <p>Nothing at M&amp;S ever happens quickly.

      "bodyText": "PS: Associated Press has a good write-up of events in Brussels today, as finance ministers remain divided on how to get the European economy moving: Here's a flavour: Europe remains at odds over whether governments should have more leeway to use borrowed money to turn on the stimulus taps in a bid to boost anemic economic growth levels. Germany, the Netherlands and others argued that European Union rules limiting government debt must remain unchanged, while Italy continued with its vocal campaign to seek exceptions that would allow for more spending to help reduce unemployment. And finally, on a lighter note, it's the Wall Street Journal's 125th birthday today - and to mark the event, they've recreated the news of that era in today's style. Worth a read: All it lacks is a liveblog. And that's probably all for today. Goodnight! GW With technology shares dropping, it's a bad day for investors in social media companies: Wall Street is losing ground too: Chris Beauchamp of IG points out that a profit warning from Air France helped to push markets down today, as investors wait for mining giant Alcoa\u2019s results tonight. He writes: The FTSE is busily confounding bulls and bears alike, swinging higher one week and then sharply lower the next, as the post-2009 trend fizzles out. With the long weeks of summer stretching out before us, the grim reality is that such trading will probably be the norm until September when normal service resumes. Airline stocks remain out of favour due to the Air France KLM warning this morning, as IAG drops to levels not seen since November, while Shire slumped despite news that AbbVie had raised its bid for the firm by 11% from the previous rebuffed offer. Judging by the price reaction, it seems this bid will fail too. It's been a poor day in the stock markets, with the main European indices all falling today as investors get jittery. The FTSE 100 has shed 67 points to 6753, a drop of 1%, and it's a similar picture in German and France. Wall Street has also opened lower, with the Dow Jones index down 0.8%. We're about to enter earnings season, and there are fears that companies may not hit expectations. Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading at Charles Schwab in Austin, explains (vie Reuters): The bar has been raised and expectations for earnings are higher than they were last quarter. If they don't come in as expected, stocks could pull back.\" Mystery solved: So, there we have it -- two quite conflicting views of the UK economy. The Office for National Statistics reckons that manufacturing output suffered its biggest fall since the start of 2013, shrinking by 1.3% in May (details start here) While NIESR believes GDP growth has actually picked up, with the economy expanding by 0.9% in the last three months. The key being that it believes factory output will recover in June. Professor David Blanchflower wonders whether we're entering a softer economic patch, given other surveys and weaker-than-expected output data from Germany this week. Britain's recovery picked up pace in the last three months, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR's estimates that the UK economy grew by 0.9% in the second quarter of 2014 - a slight acceleration on the 0.8% recorded in the first three months of the year. That would mean that the UK economy had grown by a healthy 3.2% in the last 12 months, making it larger than its pre-crisis peak. An expansion of 0.9% would also be the fastest growth in a calendar quarter in four years. NIESR also isn't too worried by the 1.3% drop in manufacturing output recorded in May, according to data released this morning. It says: The month-on-month dip in the ONS\u2019 latest production estimates is expected to weigh only marginally on the economy\u2019s overall robust performance in 2014Q2. Although it has cut its forecast for March-May to +0.7%, from + 0.9%. Despite concerns over M&amp;S's performance, Marc Bolland does still retain the support of most shareholders. Reuters reports: Bolland's re-election as a director of the company was backed by 96 percent of shareholders who voted at the meeting, according to indicative poll results. To recap.... Marks &amp; Spencer has faced its disgrunted shareholders after another year of falling profits fuelled concerns over its strategy, and maintained the pressure on chief executive Marc Bolland. Small investors at its annual general meeting at Wembley Stadium today criticised M&amp;S's performance, hours after the company reported that general merchandise sales had fallen again, for the 12 quarter running. One shareholder said M&amp;S is delivering \"the slowest turnaround in history\". He then accusing the company of demeaning women with its Alice In Wonderland-inspired Christmas advert, in which lingerie model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley lost most of her clothing. M&amp;S was also accused of a lack of leaderhip, having fallen behind the likes of Next. One former staffer, Mr Brown, said Bolland had consistently disappointed him during his time as CEO. And private shareholder John Farmer said M&amp;S's board was too complacent, and questioned whether it could recover with Bolland at the helm. Two shareholders urged the company to meet with Living Wage campaigners, but chairman Robert Swannell declined. There was also criticism of M&amp;S in-store clothing ranges, the amount of sugar in its meals, and the amount of chilli in its spaghetti bolognese. M&amp;S's top management claimed that they have made major progress in improving its infrastructure, after many years of under-investment. Swannell told shareholders that the \"heavy lifting\" needed to raise M&amp;S up to standard was almost complete. \"We know we have to do more,\" he said. \"We now have to deliver on the investment we've made.\" And he admitted that the company's performance had been mixed \u2013 with food sales outperforming the rest of the business. While Bolland explained at some length how M&amp;S's warehouses and IT systems had improved \u2013 encouraging news for those shareholders who didn't \"doze off\"... In other news, US pharmaceutical firm Abbvie has hiked its takeover offer for Britain's Shire again. M&amp;S has now rattled through the 24(!) resolutions on the agenda. Shareholders have been dispatched to their free lunch, with chairman Swannell thanking them for keeping the company on its toes. Do call, write or email anytime, he says breezily (which might irk the shareholder who blasted Swannell for ignoring two letters). And that's that.... We had a brief outage there sorry. The Times's Deirdre Hipwell has tweeted some highlights: M&amp;S is accused of being out of touch, by discouraging staff from joining a union. Swannell says staff are free to do what they want, and insists that most employees are happy. (this Facebook page, though, shows some staff would welcome union recognition) The waiting is over. John Farmer, a regular face at UK annual general meetings, has the microphone: Farmer lays into M&amp;S, asking: When will the board stop \"complacently apologising\" for poor performance and actually rectify the situation, after three years of falling clothing sales? And can the company recover without the current CEO \"moving on\". Chairman Swannell insists that it is \"utterly misplaced\" to call us complacent. We are one of the least complacent boards around, he insists (isn't that a teensy bit complacent?) And Swannell acknowledges that Next have been performing well -- they've been on the right track for 10, 20 years. We need to match that, he adds. Customers have to pay when they phone M&amp;S's call-centre, another shareholder complains. The spaghetti bolognese now contains too much chilli, and your energy providers are too slack at reading bills. Swannell \"takes the comments on board\". What impact did a technical problem in January, which prevented customers making orders, have on profits? Robert Swannell claims he doesn't know what glitch this is -- and anyway, it can't be the shiny new website's fault as it didn't start until February. It's also \"Alice in Wonderland\"* to assume you can launch a new e-commerce operation without glitches, Swannell adds. [* - I don't think he's referring to that 'demeaning' advert] A second questioner, from campaign group Citizens UK, also asks M&amp;S to consider signing up to the Living Wage. Chairman Robert Swannell repeats that \"I can't make commitments that I cannot live up to.\" Our staff do great service, and we want the very best. We will be one of the best employers, Swannell promises. But won't you at least meet with Citizens UK to discuss this? Swannell refuses to commit. (the living wage, calculated as the minimum pay needed to cover the cost of living, is \u00a37.65 per hour, or \u00a38.80 in London). Another shareholder, a former staffer, urges M&amp;S to meet with the Living Wage Foundation so that it can sign up to the scheme. Hundreds of employers have done the right thing and become an accredited living wage provider. It would be wonderful news to announce at next year's AGM, she says. Swannell says M&amp;S pays \"at the top end\", with generous benefits. But he won't make this commitment. There are 3.2m people with diabetes in the UK, and many more who aren't diagnosed, says Mr Durham, another shareholder. I know what you're saying, interrupts Robert Swannell, healthy food is important. Don't interrupt me, Mr Durham shoots back. M&amp;S food often includes more sugar than other competitors. It is 'dangerously' adding to the number of diabetes sufferers. We are the leaders in healthy eating, Swannell insists. It's at the core of our Plan A. But I take the general point - we will play out part in shaping healthier habits. Now Mrs Ward asks whether M&amp;S is closing unprofitable stores, or converting them into food-only outlets. If not, why not? We consider this very carefully around the boardroom table, chairman Swannell replies. We don't have any genuinely unprofitable stores today, but we are looking to the future. A shareholder asks about an incident last year when a Muslim member of staff declined to serve a customer trying to buy alcohol. Swannell says M&amp;S is \"entirely respectful of everyone's particular taste.... It's a very rare event when we get it wrong.\" A long question about how M&amp;S needs to do more to cater for older shoppers (some with \"wider waistlines\") who want to look 'smart, chic, colourful\". Apparently the current ranges are too dull and generally inappropriate. Robert Swannell claims that he opens the newspaper and reads that executives he's never heard of are leaving M&amp;S. Excellent question -- is the absence of a bonus for M&amp;S's 80,000+ staff a \"failure of leadership\"? Swannell says that, quite rightly, shareholders and commentators expect that bonuses are paid when outstanding performances are delivered. We didn't hit our targets, so bonuses weren't handed out. But he doesn't accept it's a failure of leadership (wonder what the staff make of that...) Now a former staff member, Mr Brown, lays into Marc Bolland. I've been coming here every year, he says, and every year I'm ultimately disappointed by M&amp;S's performance, he says. Profits are down, and the share price is languishing where it was a decade ago. Robert Swannell replies that M&amp;S is \"building a stronger business\", and the board needs to see it through. Another shareholder, Mrs Abrahamson, wins applause for criticising the availability of M&amp;S ranges. Why isn't the Twiggy range available on the high street, and why are certain larger lingerie products only available online? Why do none of M&amp;S's non-executive directors have any retailing or textile expertise? Swannell concedes the point -- but we can't get 50 skills on the board unless we have 50 board members, he argues. Here's the M&amp;S advert in question, in which Rosie Huntington-Whiteley loses most of her clothes. Our first shareholder says he has written to Swannell twice and not received the courtesy of a reply. M&amp;S is suffering falling profits again, and falling behind the likes of Next. This must be the slowest turnaround of a ship in history. And then he wades into the \"Magic and Sparkle\" campaign -- if it was so good, why did you hold big sales afterwards? And wasn't John Lewis's \"The hare and the bear\" advert better? The shareholder then blasts M&amp;S for its Alice-in-Wonderland adverts in which the model falls through a hole and loses her clothes twice -- most \"unlike Alice\". These ads are \"utterly demeaning\" to women, creating a vision of women as something to be undressed, he rails. Swannell refuses to accept this charge, insisting that M&amp;S does not demean women (and pointing out that the star of the advert, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is M&amp;S's lingerie model.) Finally, onto questions.... and chairman Robert Swannell urges investors to be brief as there are a lot of questions to wade through.... I fear the retail press pack are losing patience.... Now fashion director Belinda Earl is outlining the various efforts to kickstart M&amp;S's clothing sales. Apparently, 50% of menswear products have an 'innovative feature' such as special anti-crease technology. That dozing shareholder may have the right idea.... Oh, the perks of being a CEO.... Bolland is hammering home that M&amp;S is a decent citizen -- we work with children to clean beaches, and we've trained in-store staff to become Dementia Friends, he says. Joel Hills of ITV News reckons Bolland's statement is terribly familiar.... M&amp;S has been under-investing for the last 20 years, Bolland claims. If so, that's a damning verdict on Sir Stuart Rose's legacy (the previous CEO), and those who came before him.... Marc Bolland is now explaining, at some length, how his team have been beavering away to improve the M&amp;s infrastructure. No danger of the audience wearing away the edges of their seats: The new website's better! (even if sales have taken a nasty hit) Bolland concedes that some M&amp;S stores need improving -- analyst Louise Cooper doesn't argue: Our technology was a terrible state, Bolland says; \"We had 1990s IT systems....\". Now we're running on an SAP system, he smiles. Not sure this is going to wow the small investors (unless they've also got shares in the German software giant) Marc Bolland looks terribly pleased to report that Marks &amp; Spencer's best performing bakery is at its new store in Paris -- yes, Britain is selling baguettes to the French. Our retail correspondent Zoe Wood flags up that M&amp;S shareholders are not happy about having to drudge to the home of football (they often flock the Royal Festival Hall on South Bank) She also tweets the early key points: Now CEO Marc Bolland is on his feet, saying that the performance over the last year was a \"mixed bag\". Profits fell 4%, he reminds M&amp;S shareholders. And the new website is in its running-in period -- every customer has had to reregister on the site, he explains. And Bolland points to the recovery in womenswear, saying sales in this crucial area have risen in the last quarter in like-for-like terms (a key measure of performance) Chairman Robert Swannell insists that M&amp;S's rebuilding job is near the end of the road: \"Our period of heavy lifting in making the required improvements to the infrastructure of M&amp;S is coming to an end.... We are now set up for delivery.\" And then he hands over to Marc Bolland (\"well done, well done\" someone whispers as Swannell takes his seat). M&amp;S\"s website will deliver the results we need, Swannell insists, despite the impact on sales as it gets up to speed. (reminder, sales tumbled by 8% in the last quarter) Swannell flags up that no-one at M&amp;S received a bonus in the last year because the firm missed its targets, and then elicits a round of applause for a handful of front-office staff. M&amp;S Robert Swannell concede that the retailer's performance has been \"mixed\". The food operation has been \"outstanding\", but the general merchandise arm, despite \"outstanding improvements\" in its product range, has failed to meet financial expectations. As reported this morning, GM sales slumped by 1.5% on a like-for-like basis in the last three months. He's also offering Bolland support - saying M&amp;S has the right team in place.... The Marks &amp; Spencer AGM is underway. Robert Swannell, chairman, begins by saying that few companies can boast \"such an active and engaged shareholder base\". It is being streamed live here. Marks &amp; Spencer shareholders are gathering at Wembley for today's annual meeting. The M&amp;S AGM is famous in the City as a particularly agreeable day out. I popped along a few years ago, and was handed an ice-cream at the door, followed by a free bar afterwards. But will that be enough to dampen criticism of CEO Marc Bolland, especially with online sales slumping 8% in the last quarter?... Worth noting that Britain's manufacturing sector still hasn't clawed its way back to its pre-crisis peak; indeed, it's over 10% smaller than in 2008. It's the same story for other G7 countries: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight calls the data a \"nasty jolt\", that might make an interest rate rise this year less likely: With Governor Mark Carney stressing that the strength of data will drive when the Bank of England will first edge up interest rates, the disappointing May industrial production data will likely be seen as supportive to the Bank holding off from raising interest rates until 2015. However, it is still a close call as to when the Bank of England first moves on interest rates and there will undoubtedly be many swings in expectations over the coming weeks and months. At least we can be pretty sure that the Bank of England will sit tight on monetary policy at when the July MPC meeting ends on Thursday. EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says the drop in output in May shows the challenges that factories still face, including the weak state of the euro economy:. Deputy chief economist, Neil Prothero, explains: This brings to an end a very strong run of data and serves as a reminder that manufacturers continue to face a number of headwinds, not least subdued external demand across Europe, which continues to weigh on export prospects. Prothero adds, though, that monthly production data can be volatile, and \"the dip in May contrasts with other positive surveys and healthy domestic order expectations\". Rob Wood of Berenberg bank simply doesn't believe that UK factories performed so poorly in May (see 9.43am onwards for the details) The surprise drop in UK manufacturing output in May is unlikely to be a true reflection of what is happening in the sector. Industrial production fell by 0.7% and manufacturing output declined by 1.3% in May, well below consensus expectations. That is utterly at odds with strong survey readings and the 1.8% rise in manufacturing employment over the past year. On these figures, manufacturing just gave up all its gains since January, which is unlikely to be a good description of what is really happening in the sector. A big bounceback in output is possible next month. Marc Ostwald, strategist at ADM Investor Services, says the 1.3% slump in manufacturing output in May is a \"very large downside surprise\". Ostwald adds: One has to wonder whether the bell is tolling for the UK's economic \"goldilocks\" period, and by extension for the pound's strength. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale flags up that recent surveys of purchasing managers have been rather more positive, showing solid growth: Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency company, World First, says the drop in factory output suggests Britain may not be rebalancing its economy as well as hoped: \u201cThis is the first decline in 6 months for UK factory output and calls into question just how strong the balancing act of UK growth really is. \u201cPMI survey data has continued to show strong growth in orders, employment and sentiment in recent months so to see such a decline is indeed puzzling. \u201cTrade should begin to benefit from an improving growth picture globally although the strong level of the pound may be starting to impinge on export orders. All in all, this is a confusing release and hints that the UK recovery may not be quite as strong as data has shown in the previous few months...\u201d And Chris Giles of the Financial Times warns that the recovery will be bouncy: Here's how the pound reacted, losing almost half a cent against the dollar at one stage. Andrew Sentance, a former policymaker at the Bank of England, reckons we shouldn't panic. He points out that manufacturing output has still grown by 1.1% over the last three months, despite May's dip. The pound has fallen by 0.3 of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.710, as traders calculate that the Bank of England is less likely to raise interest rates soon. Looking at the details of the factory output data (online here), it appears that most sectors of Britain's manufacturing base suffered a drop in output in May: Crumbs! UK manufacturing output has suffered its biggest decline in 16 months, suggesting that Britain's recovery may not be as secure as hoped. Total factory production across the UK fell by 0.7% in May compared to April, dashing expectations of a 0.2% rise. And manufacturing led the decline, with output falling by an alarming 1.3% -- economists expected a 0.4% increase. The Office for National Statistics reported that the manufacturing decline was led by weaker production in: \"basic metals &amp; metal products; basic pharmaceutical products &amp; pharmaceutical preparations; and computer, electronic &amp; optical products.\" On an annual basis, UK manufacturing output was up 3.7% in May, down from 4.3% in April. So, did something nasty happen to the global economy in May? Data released yesterday showed that Germany's factory output took a tumble during the month. More detail and reaction to follow.... Back to Marks &amp; Spencer's results.... and Keith Bowman of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers reckons investors are still giving Marc Bolland the 'benefit of the doubt'. The City is also encouraged to hear that M&amp;S's Womenswear business was \"in growth\", and that M&amp;S wants to become a \"more profitable\" business. Bowman adds: \u201cAgainst a backdrop of low expectation, M&amp;S appears to have offered some hope. An increased focus on profit margin generates potential longer term optimism, with General Merchandise sales no worse than forecast. Key Womenswear sales have grown, while a recent improvement in online sales, despite previously flagged difficulties, provides some relief. On the downside, General Merchandise sales are still in retreat, whilst like-for-like food sales are marginally below forecast. Furthermore, the group\u2019s international sales are not without difficultly given ongoing challenges in Ireland and shipment timing issues this time around to franchise partners in the Middle East. What would Thomas Piketty make of those surging Rolls-Royce sales, we wonder... Torsten M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s, CEO of Rolls-Royce, declares: This is an excellent half-year result and demonstrates the continued confidence that our customers have in our company and our fine cars. The new Rolls-Royce Wraith has been a stunning success in the super-luxury segment, setting new modern style and technology leadership benchmarks. More here. Breaking away from M&amp;S to another famous brand....and sales of Rolls-Royce cars have jumped by a third in the last year. Parent company BMW has reported that it shifted 1,968 Rolls-Royce cars in the first half of this year, up from 1,475 a year ago, and is on track for a record year. BMW reports: Rolls-Royce continues to see strong customer demand for Wraith, significant orders for the recently announced Ghost Series II and good demand for the Phantom family of cars across the world. Strong sales performances were seen in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Europe. Sales in Germany have doubled, while the US has overtaken China as Rolls-Royce's biggest market. It's another sign that the spending power of the world's richest people remains undimmed despite the financial crisis. They, of course, have benefitted as the stimulus measures from central banks push up asset prices [source: the Bank of England] If you fancy a Wraith, prices begin at around \u00a3230,320. The wider BMW group has also hit a milestone. It has sold one million cars in the first six months of this year, a record number. #chortle Another analyst, Richard Perks of Mintel, isn't convinced that M&amp;S's troubles are simply down to a new website: Marc Bolland has insisted that he is \"really committed\" to what he is doing at M&amp;S, on an early-morning call with reporters. Bolland, who replaced Sir Stuart Rose in 2010, also said he was happy with the 'step by step' progress being achieved at the company. M&amp;S is also denying that there are problems at its e-distribution centre at Castle Donington, or with the new M&amp;S site, despite those sliding sales.... M&amp;S shares have inched almost 1% higher in early trading: James McGregor, director of retail consultants, Retail Remedy, reckons M&amp;S is running out of excuses: \"This is the last quarter that the bedding-in of the new website can be used as an excuse for the poor performance of clothing. \"Alongside clothing, the ongoing performance of food is starting to look tragicomic. \"Clothing at M&amp;S is still very much on the rack and we will need to see strong numbers on a consistent basis to be convinced otherwise. And M&amp;S's fundamental problem remains; what, exactly, is its role today? Who is is targeting? \"M&amp;S wants to be an international, multi-channel brand but will it ever achieve this while its identity problems continue? Josh Raymond, analyst at City Index, reckons today's results from M&amp;S \"could have been worse\", but there are still \"significant concerns\" over Marc Bolland's leadership. He's also concerned by the slump in online sales as M&amp;S gets its new website in order, having spent \u00a3150m on it: It remains to be seen whether the website impact is becoming a fundamental concern on sales or whether this is really just teething issues with its roll out, which the firm maintains will last approximately six months (having been rolled out in February). City traders reckon M&amp;S's shares are going to pick up a little this morning: 07:43 - MARKS &amp; SPENCER'S SHARES SEEN OPENING 1 PERCENT HIGHER AFTER UPDATE - TRADERS Financial journalists are staggered that M&amp;S could have suffered an 8% drop in online sales, at a time when retailers should be profiting from the e-commerce boom: So what's gone wrong? M&amp;S insists that its new web site is \"technically resilient\" \u2013 the problem appears to be that it's not cracked how to run it properly. Or as it puts it: As previously indicated, we are now focussed on optimising the website commercially, with updates made on a regular basis. We have recently seen a gradual improvement in sales performance, despite a lower level of promotional activity. We expect to return to growth ahead of our peak trading period. And here's the details of M&amp;S's results: Group sales +2.3% UK: total sales +2.0%, like-for-like +0.3% GM: total sales -0.8%, like-for-like -1.5% Clothing: total sales +0.1%, like-for-like -0.6% Food: total sales +4.2%, like-for-like +1.7% M&amp;S.com -8.1% International sales +4.7% Here we go! Marks &amp; Spencer has suffered another fall in general merchandise sales, as the travails with its new website continue to hit turnover. Hours before its annual meeting, M&amp;S has told the City that clothing, footwear and homeware sales slumped by 1.5% on a like-for-like basis in the last three months. That means they've been falling steadily for the last 3 years. And clothing sales are also down again, falling 0.6% (if you strip out the impact of new stores. But the big shock is on the web site - sales at M&amp;S.com have tumbled by 8.1%! M&amp;S had already warned that it was having teething trouble with the site \u2013 this looks more like a nasty abscess. Once again, M&amp;S's food sales have saved the company, up 1.7% on a like-for-like basis in the 13 weeks to June 28. Marc Bolland, chief executive, insists that M&amp;S is making progress: \"We have seen a continued improvement in Clothing, although as anticipated the settling in of the new M&amp;S.com site has had an impact on sales. We are pleased that the Womenswear business was in growth, driven by full price sales, in line with our increased focus on margin. Our Food business had another great quarter, continuing to outperform the market, through our focus on differentiation through quality and innovation.\" But Bolland also remains cautious: Despite some improvement in consumer confidence, market conditions remain challenging. Details and reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, business and the eurozone. One of Britain's most famous high street stores is in the spotlight today. Marks &amp; Spencer is holding its annual general meeting with shareholders, and should face tough questioning on its weak performance in clothing and its struggle to get its new website working properly. The AGM starts at 11am at Wembley Stadium -- inviting comparisons between CEO Marc Bolland's performance and that of the England football team. And to set the scene, M&amp;S is releasing its latest quarterly results this morning, followed by a press conference with journalists. Here's our preview: Marks &amp; Spencer boss under pressure as clothing sales dip again I'll be tracking all the events through the day as usual....",

      "bodyText": "The Vatican bank has announced a plunge in net profit last year after a \"painful but necessary process\" of reform saw it close thousands of accounts, wind up investments and hire expensive external experts to help with the clean-up. The long-troubled Institute for Works of Religion (IOR), as the bank is officially called, is preparing to enter a new era \u2013 operating under a different governance structure with a new chairman and board, to be unveiled on Wednesday. George Pell, the Australian cardinal picked by Pope Francis as head of the Vatican's new Secretariat for the Economy , said it was thanks to the changes made under German chairman Ernst von Freyberg that the bank was now able to move \"to a second phase of reform under new leadership\". But the financial statement for 2013, released on Tuesday, showed quite how dramatic an impact the reform had made on the bank last year, with net profit down from \u20ac86.6m (\u00a368.8m) in 2012 to \u20ac2.9m. Results for the first six months of 2014, however, showed a net profit of \u20ac57.4m, the bank said. Among the causes of last year's plunge were \"extraordinary expenses\" related to the hiring of outside professionals such as the Promontory Financial Group, a global consulting firm brought in to review accounts and tighten anti-money laundering measures, the bank said. It also blamed the \"writedown of proprietary investments in externally managed investment funds committed to between 2012 and early 2013\" \u2013 before Francis's election, totalling a loss of \u20ac28.5m. And it included in the losses a \u20ac15.1m loan made by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's former secretary of state and emeritus pope Benedict XVI's right-hand man, to a production company specialising in religious programmes owned by one of his acquaintances. Keen to bring an end to the whiff of scandal that has emanated sporadically from the corridors of the IOR for decades, Francis has been taking advice on how to apply his reform agenda and commitment to ethical finance to an institution whose reputation as an opaque offshore hub has often brought embarrassment to the Vatican. Earlier this year, he approved a plan for the bank that would not see it closed down \u2013 which had been an option \u2013 but restructured, strengthening efforts begun during Benedict XVI's papacy to bring the bank into line with anti-money laundering norms. Since last May, the bank said on Tuesday, the accounts of 2,091 clients had been blocked and around 3,000 \"customer relationships\" terminated as part of efforts to return the bank to its core role as a place for Catholic institutions and clergy to deposit their cash. Around 2,600 of those \"relationships\" concerned dormant accounts, the IOR said, while almost 400 were ended due to newly restricted clientele criteria, with a resulting outflow of \u20ac44m. A further 359 were earmarked for closure, it added. In total, the bank now has almost 15,500 clients, some of whom have more than one account, down from 18,900 in 2012. \"At the beginning of my mandate, I repeatedly said that I would proceed with zero tolerance for any suspicious activity,\" said Von Freyberg, who was appointed by Benedict XVI in the twilight of his papacy. \"We have carried out our reforms in this spirit and have not only drastically improved procedures to make the institute safer and more transparent, but have also put the institute's owner in a position to act on the basis of facts.

      "bodyText": "Drax, the operator of Britain's biggest power station, has secured up to \u20ac300m (\u00a3238m) of European Union funding to build a power plant whose carbon dioxide emissions will be trapped and buried deep beneath the North Sea. The new plant will be built on land next to Drax's existing power station near Selby in Yorkshire. It will burn enough coal for 630,000 homes and 90% of its CO2 will be transported by pipeline for permanent storage under the North Sea. The project, called White Rose, is a joint venture between Drax, Alstom and BOC and is the first large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in the EU. White Rose will capture and bury the plant's CO2 with transport and storage provided by National Grid. Leigh Hackett, chief executive of Capture Power, which runs White Rose, said: \"The NER300 award represents another significant milestone for us in our development programme and an important potential source of funding for the project, as well as providing a strong signal for CCS in Europe. \"We are well on track to demonstrate the key role that CCS can play in the future UK energy mix. CCS is an important technology providing clean, reliable and cost competitive electricity with the potential to contribute greatly to the decarbonisation of global power markets.\" Parliament's energy and climate change committee called in May for the UK's first CCS plants to be fast-tracked because they were vital to limit climate change. The MPs criticised the government's conduct of its \u00a31bn competition for the first plants. White Rose applied for funding from the European NER300 programme a year ago.

Within general merchandise, the troubled online business was down by 8.1%, embarrassingly, after the recent website relaunch, but M&amp;S brush this aside as \"settling in\" and breezily say that online sales are expected to return to growth by Xmas. Although womenswear sales are said to have been up, there is no comment on menswear or kidswear and homewares must have been well down ...

First and foremost, it has to inject some positive momentum into its UK [general merchandise] sales. That it has failed to do so for so long suggests that there is a considerable headwind facing the M&amp;S brand, an output of the stores, something that the present management team has not managed to break. Whilst there has been management change with respect to the GM offer and considerable third party support of the last two clothing seasons, such plaudits have not translated into satisfactory sales growth, so leading to a series of trading disappointments and downgrades.

An increased focus on profit margin generates potential longer-term optimism, with general merchandise sales no worse than forecast. Key womenswear sales have grown, while a recent improvement in online sales, despite previously flagged difficulties, provides some relief. On the downside, general merchandise sales are still in retreat, whilst like-for-like food sales are marginally below forecast ... For now, M&amp;S remains a work in progress.</p>",
