      "bodyText": "The stinging report by two committees of MPs on the failure of BHS left two points hanging in the air. First, the MPs did not say how much Sir Philip Green, whose reputation was demolished over 59 pages, should pay to cover the shortfall in the BHS pension schemes. It merely said Green \u201chas a moral duty to act, a duty which he acknowledges\u201d. Second, the committees did not recommend that Green should be stripped of his knighthood. Even Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, who had previously raised the prospect of a de-gonging, confined himself to a heavy hint outside the pages of the report. \u201cWhat kind of man is it who can count his fortune in billions but does not know what decent behaviour is?\u201d asked Field. Such relative restraint on the part of the MPs was sensible. It is up to the Pensions Regulator to determine the true size of the shortfall. And it will be the Honours Forfeiture Committee that decides whether SPG, as the tycoon\u2019s hangers-on refer to him, should be plain PG again. But the report provides ammunition by the bucketload for both bodies. In 2000, Green bought a business with a surplus in its pension scheme of \u00a343m and then paid his family dividends far in excess of BHS\u2019s profits. In 2015, having failed to fund the schemes adequately or complete a restructuring to the satisfaction of the regulator, he sold BHS with a \u00a3345m pensions shortfall. The buyer was the \u201cwholly unsuitable\u201d Dominic Chappell, a twice-bankrupt individual who was out of his depth. The verdict on Green is damning and unequivocal. He \u201coverlooked or made good each of Chappell\u2019s shortcomings and proceeded with a rushed sale regardless\u201d, says the report. Then he attempted to blame everybody apart from himself. Some of those other actors, especially professional advisers such as Grant Thornton and Olswang, indeed failed in their duties while collecting fees that have still not been disclosed. But the fateful sale of BHS to an incompetent chancer with inadequate funding was driven \u201cpersonally\u201d by Green, says the report. Armed with that conclusion, the Pensions Regulator should press for Green to repair the pension damage in full. It would be a disgrace if even part of the shortfall is covered by the Pension Protection Fund, the lifeboat scheme that is supported by a levy on 6,000 other defined benefit pension schemes. Green \u2013 or, strictly speaking, Lady Green, as the ultimate owner of the family empire \u2013 is rich enough to pay. Let the couple do so rather than shuffle off part of the shortfall on to other companies\u2019 schemes. Estimates of the size of the bill vary. On one accounting measure, the combined shortfall in BHS\u2019s two schemes was \u00a3571m at the point of collapse. A few technical tweaks, such as cash buyouts for members who are decades away from retirement, may be permitted to reduce the cost. But is hard to see how, if the Pensions Regulator is doing its job properly, Green could be asked for less than \u00a3400m. If that feels daunting, even for a billionaire, Green has only himself to blame. The report describes how BHS \u201cdeclined to make the employer contributions necessary to maintain the sustainability of the pension schemes over the duration of Sir Philip Green\u2019s period in charge\u201d. In the early years, trustees\u2019 demands for higher contributions were resisted on the grounds that investing in the business would be more lucrative; then, when BHS faltered, beefier payments were deemed unaffordable. Green let a small pensions shortfall become towering. Whether the correct number is \u00a3400m, \u00a3500m or more, the buck still stops with him. The knighthood question is only slightly trickier. Gongs, in theory, are not meant to depend on the future good behaviour of the recipient, assuming no laws have been broken. In practice, however, the BHS shambles, as with Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, surely falls into the exceptional category. Goodwin\u2019s award for services to banking was impossible to maintain after the bank collapsed. Similarly, Green\u2019s knighthood for services to retailing looks absurd in light of events. The pragmatic compromise in the interests of BHS pensioners is probably this. If Green pays up in full and without further fuss, he can keep his gong. The rest of us will just laugh (again) at the silliness of presenting honours to business people before their careers and character can be judged.",

      "bodyText": "The number of applications to build new shops fell by 9% in the past year, according to a report on Monday, marking the seventh decline in a row. There were 6,700 applications for new retail developments in 2015, down from 7,360, according to commercial law firm EMW. They are down by nearly a half from the pre-recession peak of 11,900 in 2008. The fall shows the continuing pressures on shopkeepers as consumers desert the high street in favour of online shopping with e-commerce companies. EMW said that despite traditional retailers increasingly focusing on and expanding their online services, many are often failing to compete effectively with online-only retailers, such as Asos and Boohoo. It said the recent failures of traditional retailers BHS, Austin Reed, and convenience store chain My Local were partly caused by the continued success of online-only brands. Retailers would face additional problems if the Brexit vote has an adverse effect on the UK economy, the firm added. Aimee Barrable at EMW said: \u201cWith online retailers continuing to win market share, high street firms have less of an appetite to open new shops, instead opting to develop online services or squeeze extra profits from existing space by changing the shopping experience or repurposing stores to act more as showrooms or collection points. \u201cRecent high-profile closures will lead to more retail space becoming available on the market. Those retailers still looking to expand their high street presence might look to acquire some of these recently vacated stores instead of applying for any new retail developments.\u201d She added: \u201cAlso, it may be that many retailers wait before committing to any new shop developments until they have a clearer picture of the economy in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.\u201d Last week, official statistics showed the volume of retail sales decreased by 0.9% between May and June, worse than the 0.6% fall expected by economists.

    "webTitle": "UK banks prepare response to expected interest rate cut", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High street banks are preparing to set out how they will respond to the interest rate cuts likely to be sparked by the Brexit vote, amid expectations it could pressure them to cut jobs and earmark more branches for closure. Lloyds Banking Group, in which taxpayers have a 9% stake, is facing questions from the City about any plans to step up its cost-cutting measures. This is because it is more closely linked to the UK economy than rivals with international operations. The bank has embarked on a programme to cut \u00a31bn from costs in the three years to 2017, which already involves 9,000 job cuts and 200 branch closures. There are expectations that this will be accelerated. The bailed-out bank is among a number of high street banks reporting their results this week. Barclays and Virgin Money are also publishing their six-month figures at a time when bank share prices have been pummelled in the wake of the vote to leave the EU. The following week HSBC, Standard Chartered and the 73% taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland will report their trading for the first six months of 2016. But analysts are more interested in banks\u2019 reaction to the EU vote, which could have a dramatic impact on the domestically focused banks if the economy slows and bad debts \u2013 or impairment charges \u2013 rise. Expectations are also mounting that the Bank of England will cut interest rates from an already historic low of 0.5% on 4 August, which will put pressure on bank profits. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said: \u201cWe think the focus will be updates to guidance for core UK earnings post-referendum. We cut domestic UK banking earnings [by approximately] 20% post the vote as we expect margin pressure, lower loan growth and normalisation in impairment trends.\u201d Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said it would be difficult for banks to provide a clear outlook statement. \u201cWe might get more announcements around cost-cutting,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reasons why Lloyds could be aggressive on costs is their margins are being squeezed on low interest rates.\u201d Approximately 45,000 roles had already gone at Lloyds since HBOS was rescued in 2008, before the latest round of cuts, and the workforce has fallen to about 75,000. In February, at the time of its results for 2015, Lloyds said it was ahead of its October 2014 plan to cut costs but provided no further detail. Analysts will be waiting to see if Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive, can decide how to wring further costs out of the business, which also owns Halifax. Lloyds would not comment on expectations of cost-cutting measures. Analysts at Deutsche Bank: \u201cGiven the more difficult revenue environment we expect questions to management on potential further cost rationalisation.\u201d The government has put on hold its plans to sell shares to the public and the views of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, on such a share offering are unclear. Its shares closed on Friday at 55.5p \u2013 below the 73.6p at which taxpayers break even on their stake \u2013 and amid expectations that plans for major dividends could be delayed. At Barclays, which will report on Friday, its new chief executive, Jes Staley, will face questions about the bank\u2019s growth prospects and progress on selling its African arm. It is a crunch week for banks across Europe as the results of stress tests on EU banks, including those in the UK, are published by the pan-European banking regulator on Friday. The European Banking Authority is not issuing a pass or fail on the results, which are being announced while the focus is on Italian banks and the possibility they will need to raise more capital. Analysts at Credit Suisse said that a \u201cshallow recession is already priced in\u201d for bank shares on stock markets across Europe. They added: \u201cThe EBA test could be a positive market event, showing the sector has improved its ability to withstand economic shocks.\u201d",

This is because it is more closely linked to the UK economy than rivals with international operations. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The bank has embarked on a programme to cut <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/28/lloyds-banking-group-axe-9000-jobs-200-branches\">\u00a31bn from costs in the three years to 2017</a>, which already involves 9,000 job cuts and 200 branch closures. There are expectations that this will be accelerated.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The bailed-out bank is among a number of high street banks reporting their results this week. Barclays and Virgin Money are also publishing their six-month figures at a time when bank share prices have been pummelled in the wake of the vote to leave the EU. The following week HSBC, Standard Chartered and the 73% taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland will report their trading for the first six months of 2016. </p> <p>But analysts are more interested in banks\u2019 reaction to the EU vote, which could have a dramatic impact on the domestically focused banks if the economy slows and bad debts \u2013 or impairment charges \u2013 rise. Expectations are also mounting that the Bank of England will cut interest rates from an already historic low of 0.5% on 4 August, which will put pressure on bank profits.</p> <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley said: \u201cWe think the focus will be updates to guidance for core UK earnings post-referendum. We cut domestic UK banking earnings [by approximately] 20% post the vote as we expect margin pressure, lower loan growth and normalisation in impairment trends.\u201d</p> <p> Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said it would be difficult for banks to provide a clear outlook statement. \u201cWe might get more announcements around cost-cutting,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reasons why Lloyds could be aggressive on costs is their margins are being squeezed on low interest rates.\u201d</p> <p> Approximately <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/30/lloyds-boss-unrepentant-job-losses\">45,000 roles had already gone at Lloyds since HBOS was rescued in 2008</a>, before the latest round of cuts, and the workforce has fallen to about 75,000. In February, at the time of its results for 2015, Lloyds said it was ahead of its October 2014 plan to cut costs but provided no further detail.</p> <p>Analysts will be waiting to see if Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive, can decide how to wring further costs out of the business, which also owns Halifax. Lloyds would not comment on expectations of cost-cutting measures.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Analysts at Deutsche Bank: \u201cGiven the more difficult revenue environment we expect questions to management on potential further cost rationalisation.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/lloyds-bank-shares-to-be-offered-cut-price-to-the-public\">put on hold its plans to sell shares to the public</a> and the views of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, on such a share offering are unclear. Its shares closed on Friday at 55.5p \u2013 below the 73.6p at which taxpayers break even on their stake \u2013 and amid expectations that plans for major dividends could be delayed.</p> <p>At Barclays, which will report on Friday, its new chief executive, Jes Staley, will face questions about the bank\u2019s growth prospects and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/barclays-cuts-dividend-as-profits-fall-8-percent\">progress on selling its African arm</a>.</p> <p> It is a crunch week for banks across Europe as the results of stress tests on EU banks, including those in the UK, are published by the pan-European banking regulator on Friday. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The European Banking Authority is not issuing a pass or fail on the results, which are being announced while the focus is on Italian banks and the possibility they will need to raise more capital. </p> <p>Analysts at Credit Suisse said that a \u201cshallow recession is already priced in\u201d for bank shares on stock markets across Europe.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After years of sitting on its hands, the Bank of England will swing back into action next month with measures to nurse the economy through the post-Brexit period. Interest rates will be cut from their already historic low of 0.5%. The Bank is considering pumping more electronic money into the economy and could ease credit conditions. The Treasury is also gearing up to provide stimulus measures. Now that George Osborne\u2019s plan to balance the budget by the end of this parliament has been ditched, there is scope for Philip Hammond to be more creative in his autumn statement later this year. He has already dropped the broadest of hints that he will seize this opportunity. One benefit of Brexit is that it allows the economy to be rebooted. That is true after any severe economic shock, which certainly applies to the decision to leave the EU. The last time UK policymakers had the chance to implement root and branch cures to the economy\u2019s structural weaknesses was during the financial and economic crisis of 2008-09. Instead they bottled it, relying almost wholly on the Bank of England to support activity through interest rate cuts and the money-creation programme known as quantitative easing (QE). This was later backed up by Funding for Lending, under which the Bank provided incentives for high street banks to lend more to households and businesses. The impact of all this was to rekindle the housing market and drive up asset prices. There was a boost to the economy, but the benefits were mostly felt by the haves rather than the have-nots. It was business as usual rather than change of the sort seen, for example, after the Great Depression of the 1930s or the oil shocks of the 1970s. What was needed then, and is even more urgently needed now, is a more comprehensive approach. Britain needs a version of Abenomics, the three-arrow strategy named after Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, which involves monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural reform. Let\u2019s take those in turn. Monetary policy is the Bank of England\u2019s job. It embraces setting the official cost of borrowing, buying bonds from banks in exchange for cash to increase the supply of money, and programmes such as Funding for Lending. The advantage of monetary policy is that it is the quickest way of stimulating activity, which is why the Bank is the first line of defence against a post-Brexit recession. But apart from sending out the message that Threadneedle Street has a steady hand on the tiller, it is not obvious why easier monetary policy should have a marked effect on the economy. Interest rates have been at 0.5% for more than seven years, so cutting them to 0.25% or even 0% is not going to do much. Likewise with another \u00a350bn worth of QE, on top of the \u00a3375bn that was pumped into the economy during the Great Recession, and the years that followed. Fiscal policy is the Treasury\u2019s job. It is a posh way of describing changes to tax and public spending. When the economy was floundering after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, Alastair Darling cut VAT and brought forward infrastructure projects to raise demand. For the most part though, the Treasury has preferred to let the Bank of England do the heavy lifting. Monetary policy has been loose; fiscal policy has been tight. The justification for the conservative approach to fiscal policy has been that the Great Recession left the UK\u2019s public finances in a heck of a mess. There are two measures of a nation\u2019s financial health; the budget deficit, which looks at the difference between tax receipts and spending in any one year, and the national debt, which is an accumulation of all the deficits (and rare surpluses) over time. Britain\u2019s budget deficit hit a peacetime record during the Great Recession, while the national debt more than doubled. Structural reform involves the nitty-gritty stuff that makes the economy work more effectively: whether children have the right sort of education so that they can find decent employment; the state of the country\u2019s infrastructure; the ease with which an entrepreneur with a good idea can find long-term finance. In the 1980s, there was a tendency to equate structural reform with smashing the trade unions and privatising the nationalised industries. Real structural reform goes deeper and requires something that has typically been in short supply in Britain: patience. Indeed, the tendency has always been for the quick fix, the misguided belief that there is an instant remedy for problems that have been quietly but destructively festering over many decades. These longstanding problems \u2013 the hollowing out of manufacturing, the concomitant overreliance on the City, a large and growing trade deficit, big regional differentials in productivity \u2013 have been given a political manifestation by Brexit. There was a strong link between voting patterns and the health of the local economy. So what needs to be done? Despite the likely lack of any real traction, the Bank of England needs to ease monetary policy aggressively on 4 August. This will help boost confidence and might prevent the economy sliding into recession in the second half of the year. Hammond has apparently given some licence by the prime minister to be radical with fiscal policy and should use it. Investment by the private sector has been weak since the Great Recession and is likely to be even weaker in the aftermath of Brexit. The government, therefore, needs to fill the gap. There are two ways of doing this. The first involves the Treasury taking advantage of low interest rates to borrow for long-term investment. Not just in roads, railways and airports but in Britain\u2019s digital infrastructure and its human capital. One of the country\u2019s most glaring structural weaknesses is that the unemployment rate for young people who leave school with the most basic education is among the highest in the developed world. An alternative approach would be to harmonise the activities of the Treasury and Bank of England, with the former issuing infrastructure bonds and the latter buying them up through its QE programme. This idea was floated by the Green New Deal group (of which I am a member) after the Great Recession, proposing a major programme of housebuilding and energy efficiency involving jobs for every UK constituency. Jeremy Corbyn latched on to this idea, calling it People\u2019s QE, when he was running for the Labour leadership, but he now appears less keen. This is a bit curious. A Green New Deal or People\u2019s QE is something governments need to have up their sleeve when times get tough and they have run out of alternatives. Like now.",

      "bodyText": "Gaming groups 888 and Rank are considering a \u00a33bn joint bid for struggling rival William Hill. The pair issued a statement saying they had formed a consortium for a potential transaction for William Hill, which last week ousted its chief executive, James Henderson, after failing to capitalise on the growing online betting market. The move turns the tables on William Hill, which just over a year ago made an unsuccessful \u00a3700m bid for 888. The deal collapsed because the two sides could not agree on a price, with one of 888\u2019s Israeli founders reported to be holding out for a higher offer. In their statement on Sunday, 888 and Rank said no formal approach had been made, and there was no guarantee of an eventual offer. However, they added: \u201cThe consortium sees significant industrial logic in the combination, through consolidation of their complementary online and land-based operations, delivery of substantial revenue and cost synergies and from the anticipated benefits of economies of scale, which will accrue to all shareholders.\u201d A weekend report suggested Rank and 888 would merge before making an offer for William Hill. In their joint statement the companies said: \u201cIn relation to the proposed transaction, no decision has yet been taken as to whether 888 would be an offeror or offeree company in respect of certain of the steps that may be taken in order to implement the proposed transaction.\u201d William Hill is expected to issue a short statement on Monday dismissing the move. Sources close to the company said the proposal was clearly premature, and that a three-way deal was fraught with risk. Since the attempt to link up with 888, they said, William Hill had made other acquisitions which made a new deal unnecessary. The company had made it clear on Thursday that, despite the departure of its chief executive, it believed it had a valid strategy and the scale to make the necessary investment in technology to take the business forward. But on Thursday, William Hill\u2019s chairman, Gareth Davis, said: \u201cSignificant challenges remain and in the recent past online has not performed against expectations.\u201d Regarding the online business \u2013 which accounts for about 35% of William Hill\u2019s revenues \u2013 he said there had been issues with the functionality of the website and user experience. Online growth had been weak in the UK and non-existent internationally. Earlier in the year the company issued a profits warning after a poor Cheltenham horseracing festival. The potential move from Rank and 888 for William Hill is the latest in a series of upheavals in the gaming sector as it faces increased taxes, growing competition and a crackdown on lucrative fixed-odds betting terminals. Paddy Power and Betfair have already merged, and the joint business is a FTSE 100 member. Ladbrokes and Gala Coral are awaiting clearance from the Competition and Markets Authority for their \u00a32.3bn tie-up. Approval is expected next month although the combined group might be told to sell off hundreds of shops. If the deal goes ahead, Ladbrokes and Gala will overtake William Hill as Britain\u2019s biggest bookmaker. Last year, 888 tried to merge with Bwin Party but lost out to rival GVC. 888 was founded by two Israeli families who still own the majority of shares, and has become one of Britain\u2019s biggest online gaming groups encompassing sports betting, online bingo and casino games. Its potential partner Rank is Britain\u2019s largest operator of bingo halls and casinos, including upmarket venues catering for high-rollers. In the past 12 months, the three companies have experienced contrasting fortunes on the stock market. William Hill\u2019s shares have dropped 31%, giving it a market value of about \u00a32.7bn. Rank has slipped around 3% to be worth \u00a3935m, but 888 has added 29% and is now worth about \u00a3800m.",

      "bodyText": "When Barack Obama passed his signature healthcare law in 2010, one of its aims was to encourage competition among insurers. The insurers reacted by snapping each other up. Last summer four of the five biggest health insurers announced mergers, cutting their number to three. Now the Obama administration has cried halt. On Thursday the justice department filed lawsuits to block two mergers that would have dramatically consolidated the health insurance market. \u201cThese mergers would restrict competition for health insurance products sold in markets across the country and would give tremendous power over the nation\u2019s health insurance industry to just three large companies,\u201d attorney general Loretta Lynch said announcing the decision. \u201cOur actions seek to preserve competition that keeps premiums down and drives insurers to collaborate with doctors and hospitals to provide better healthcare for all Americans.\u201d Both Anthem, which was set to acquire Cigna, and Aetna, which was set to acquire Humana, have said they will appeal the ruling. But experts believe their chances are slim \u2013 at least as long as there is a Democrat in the White House. The decision by the justice department comes at a time when it has signaled that it will take a tougher stance on antitrust concerns, says Jeffrey Spigel, head of the Antitrust Practice Group at King &amp; Spalding. Under the Obama administration, both the justice department and the Federal Trade Commission have shown more willingness to litigate antitrust cases when past administrations have opted to settle, Spigel said. A number of other multibillion dollar deals have been blocked in recent years by the justice department , including the proposed merger of wireless companies AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in 2011 and the proposed merger of oil field services providers Halliburton and Baker Hughes this year. The latest round of mega mergers in the insurance industry comes on the heels of waves of consolidation that have left only five major national insurers. The mergers would have combined four of those insurers into two companies, leaving only three dominant insurance companies in the US. Anthem and Cigna would have consolidated the large employer market while Aetna and Humana would have had a leading position in the private Medicare Advantage market. Health insurance companies have long held that mergers are needed for scale in order to remain competitive. Anthem expected to realize around $2bn in \u201csynergies\u201d from its combination with Cigna, while Aetna had projected around $1.25bn in savings for its deal with Humana. But the deals angered many in Congress. During a regulator testimony, Anthem and Aetna \u201crefused to identify a dime of supposed savings from these mergers that would be passed on to the consumers\u201d, said Carmen Balber, executive director at Consumer Watchdog, a consumer advocacy organization. \u201cPremiums have gone up and benefits gone down from previous insurance mergers,\u201d explained Balber, adding that the two proposed mergers would have led to higher prices, worse benefits and more difficulty getting benefits for consumers. \u201cIt is a great sign that the Department of Justice blocked\u201d the deals, Balber added. Aetna and Humana argue that the combination of the two companies would be more \u201cefficient and effective\u201d, which would decrease cost for members. The two companies said in a joint statement that they have \u201cplans to vigorously defend the companies\u2019 pending merger\u201d. Anthem is challenging the justice department\u2019s understanding of the insurance market, putting out a statement saying that \u201cthe DoJ\u2019s action is based on a flawed analysis and misunderstanding of the dynamic, competitive and highly regulated healthcare landscape and is inconsistent with the way that the DoJ has reviewed past healthcare transactions.\u201d Cigna for its part has taken a more muted tone, advising investors the deal is no longer projected to close this year, \u201cif at all\u201d. Overturning the ruling on appeal will be difficult, Spigel predicts. During antitrust merger reviews, companies work to identify potential divestitures in areas of problematic overlap as a compromise. While Anthem has said it \u201cwill remain receptive to any efforts to reach a settlement with the DoJ that will allow us to complete the transaction,\u201d neither of the two proposed mergers were able to provide enough divestitures to satisfy regulators. One issue with divestitures is finding buyers that would not be problematic in such a consolidated market, explained Spigel. Allowing the two mergers to go forward would also make it more difficult for new insurers to enter a market, further hindering future competition, said Balber. The action by the justice department signals that the health insurance market has become so concentrated it is unlikely that any further large scale deals can be done. \u201cAt least under this administration,\u201d says Spigel, adding with a laugh, \u201cwho knows what will happen if Trump is elected.\u201d This article was amended on 26 July 2016. An earlier version stated that Aetna was set to acquire Cigna and Anthem was set to acquire Humana. It was the other way around: Anthem was set to acquire Cigna, and Aetna to acquire Humana.

    "webTitle": "Manufacturers make, shops sell. But Dollar Shave Club breaks that mould", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dollar Shave Club\u2019s razors are \u201cfucking great\u201d, the company\u2019s founder declared in its first advert. Michael Dubin, who started the business four years ago, last week convinced Unilever of their merits, too. In buying Dollar Shave Club for an estimated $1bn, the consumer goods company could be sending a signal about the way we shop. Post-deal analysis focused on what Unilever could add to Dollar Shave Club, which has shaken up the US male shaving market with a monthly subscription service and a viral marketing campaign. The company sends grooming products to customers for as little as $1 a month. In that first \u201cfucking great\u201d ad, Dubin also tells customers that they are being ripped off when buying branded razors because they\u2019re simply funding celebrity endorsements, and technology they do not need. \u201cDo you like spending $20 a month on brand-name razors? Nineteen go to Roger Federer,\u201d Dubin says in the ad. Unilever, one of the world\u2019s biggest companies, will now provide backing for Dollar Shave Club\u2019s expansion in the US \u2013 where it has already claimed 5% of a shaving market dominated by Gillette \u2013 and eventually into Europe and the rest of the world. But Dollar Shave Club will also bring something to Unilever: expertise on how to sell products directly to consumers. Unilever owns some of the best-known brands in the world \u2013 including Magnum ice cream, Flora margarine and Dove soap. For decades, its model has been to sell its products to customers through retailers, such as Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s in the UK. However, the internet offers a new avenue for manufacturers. It provides the opportunity to sell directly to customers \u2013 without shops being involved. Customers could buy one-off items from a manufacturer\u2019s website or, like they do with Dollar Shave Club, take out a subscription that means products are sent to them at regular intervals. Dollar Shave Club has made this work for male grooming products, so why couldn\u2019t there be a club for Lynx deodorant or Tresemm\u00e9 shampoo, which are also Unilever brands? Unilever has already built a team of up to 800 to work on its e-commerce side, and it is hoping to learn more through Dollar Shave Club. \u201cI think you will see implementations of the learnings from them in businesses we already have outside of the US,\u201d Paul Polman, Unilever\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cThen we will look at opportunities to introduce the model in other countries, where you need a certain penetration of online shopping.\u201d Polman said countries where online shopping is already popular \u2013 such as China \u2013 were potential markets for direct selling. He also said the company\u2019s \u201cprestige\u201d beauty brands and its Australian T2 teas could also be sold this way. Unilever already sells T2 directly to customers through branded shops in England and New York City as well as Australia. This could have implications for all retailers. Supermarkets in particular are already under pressure from Amazon, discounters and convenience stores: the last thing they need is another front to compete on. Although it is early days for Unilever, there is logic behind manufacturers selling directly to customers. They can cut the costs of dealing with retailers and take more control of their products. A consumer brand can lose prestige if it is seen on supermarket shelves next to cheaper, own-label alternatives. Starting to sell directly to consumers will not be a straightforward change, which is why it hasn\u2019t happened yet \u2013 and why Unilever is buying the expertise of Dollar Shave Club. In 2008, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever\u2019s great rival, bought a stake in online retailer Ocado, yet it has still to launch a meaningful retail service. Nonetheless, every now and again a deal comes along that signals a shift in direction for an industry. And Unilever\u2019s acquisition of Dollar Shave Club is one of them. Even nimble Fox may not bound over barriers to trade There\u2019s quite a competition over which of Theresa May\u2019s ministers has the toughest post-Brexit job. A good case could be made for Philip Hammond, the Alistair Darling of our time, inheriting the economy just as things are turning sour. Or for David Davis, who has the task of balancing immigration controls against access to the single market as he negotiates Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. Spare some sympathy, though, for Liam Fox, heading the new ministry of international trade: he has perhaps the toughest job of the lot. There has been a lot of talk since the referendum about how the UK can now cut its own trade deals with countries such as China, Brazil, India and the US. So, Fox can be nimble, avoiding the cumbersome processes that have bedevilled, for example, the attempt by Brussels to agree the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Washington. It is a nice thought, conjuring up images of Sir Francis Drake\u2019s warships playing havoc with the Spanish Armada as it slowly made its way up the English Channel. The analogy has its limitations, however: not least the fact that Drake had no trouble finding sailors to crew his vessels while Fox has only a handful of UK officials with any experience of negotiating trade deals and is looking to bring in foreign mercenaries. A shortage of personnel is not his only problem. He arrives in office at a time when global trade is barely growing \u2013 a far cry from the heady early days of globalisation in the 1990s. Back then, the UK was able to exploit the fall in the value of the pound that resulted from Black Wednesday in September 1992 because demand for exports was strong. World trade volumes increased by 7% a year on average during the 1990s. Then, the current was for more open trade. Today, the tide has turned in favour of protectionism. Getting speedy trade deals that work for Britain is going to be mightily difficult. It is cold out there. Sports Direct saga shows need for change in the law Mike Ashley and the board of Sports Direct should be ashamed of the way their company is described by MPs in a report about its working practices. Ashley\u2019s excuse \u2013 that he was not aware of many of the incidents that were related to him about employees being mistreated \u2013 is not good enough. A company\u2019s boss has a duty to ensure that staff are treated well. The board needs a total overhaul, with a new independent chairman to ensure that Ashley sticks to his promise to improve working conditions. However, more fundamental changes are also required. Directors have a legal duty to deliver value for shareholders, but it is time they had a legal duty to protect the interests of employees too. This could have two helpful effects \u2013 ensuring that bosses cannot turn a blind eye to bad working practices; and forcing companies to consider employees when they receive a takeover bid. This could be a handy way to get out of unwanted foreign takeovers.",

Michael Dubin, who started the business four years ago, last week convinced Unilever of their merits, too.</p> <p>In buying Dollar Shave Club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/20/unilever-buys-dollar-shave-club-male-grooming-fight-p-g-procter-gamble-gilette-acquisition\" title=\"\">for an estimated $1bn</a>, the consumer goods company could be sending a signal about the way we shop. Post-deal analysis focused on what Unilever could add to Dollar Shave Club, which has shaken up the US male shaving market with a monthly subscription service and a viral marketing campaign.</p> <p>The company sends grooming products to customers for as little as $1 a month. In that first \u201cfucking great\u201d ad, Dubin also tells customers that they are being ripped off when buying branded razors because they\u2019re simply funding celebrity endorsements, and technology they do not need.</p> <p>\u201cDo you like spending $20 a month on brand-name razors? Nineteen go to Roger Federer,\u201d Dubin says in the ad.</p> <p>Unilever, one of the world\u2019s biggest companies, will now provide backing for Dollar Shave Club\u2019s expansion in the US \u2013 where it has already claimed 5% of a shaving market dominated by Gillette \u2013 and eventually into Europe and the rest of the world.</p> <p>But Dollar Shave Club will also bring something to Unilever: expertise on how to sell products directly to consumers. Unilever owns some of the best-known brands in the world \u2013 including Magnum ice cream, Flora margarine and Dove soap. For decades, its model has been to sell its products to customers through retailers, such as Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s in the UK.</p> <p>However, the internet offers a new avenue for manufacturers. It provides the opportunity to sell directly to customers \u2013 without shops being involved.

      "bodyText": "Iain Wright has been a busy man. Like a university student cramming to get his essays done before school\u2019s out for summer, the chairman of the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee has been knocking out reports during the final few days before the parliamentary recess. On Friday, the committee\u2019s take on the working practices at retailer Sports Direct was released, which pulled few punches, and contained words such as \u201cpunitive\u201d, \u201cappalling\u201d, \u201cunreasonable\u201d, \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201ccontempt\u201d. Anyway, Wright\u2019s work will be back in front of the invigilators again on Monday, with the publication of the investigation into the collapse of BHS, which the BIS committee has conducted jointly with Frank Field\u2019s work and pensions gang. It is hard to envisage this making great reading for Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, or Dominic Chappell, the \u201cWalter Mitty\u201d who Green decided was a suitable buyer of a business safeguarding 11,000 jobs and a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Westminster gossips suggest the BHS report will be even punchier than Sports Direct. All of which wraps up Wright\u2019s coursework for the year, which might one day form part of some weightier thesis. How about \u201cthe worst of British business\u201d as a possible title? Arrests, falling shares, gloom \u2013 that\u2019s banking Another terrible few days for the banks, which obviously pains us all. Last week, Mark Johnson, a British citizen and HSBC\u2019s global head of foreign exchange trading, got nicked by the FBI and charged with fraudulently rigging a multibillion-dollar currency exchange deal. Meanwhile, back in the UK, more mundane problems persist. Shares in Virgin Money, which is run by Jayne-Anne Gadhia and reports numbers this week, are wallowing near all-time lows, while the stock of Lloyds Banking Group (still 9% owned by the UK taxpayer and also reporting this week) isn\u2019t doing much better. This is an inconvenience to Lloyds\u2019 dashing chief, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who everybody assumed would be mounting his black horse for a victory lap by now. But Brexit and low interest rates are making his life pretty tough. Lloyds shares closed on Friday at 55.58p, some way below the taxpayer\u2019s supposed break-even price of 73.6p. Still, if you count the dividends, fees and other proceeds we\u2019ve received, there\u2019s a view we could get our money back by flogging the rest of our stake for 8.4p a share. That\u2019s if you believe Hargreaves Lansdown \u2013 which might make a few quid from any retail offer. Has ARM\u2019s new owner gone out on a limb? \u201cIt would be a dreadful shame if this acquisition followed form \u2013 job losses, investment drain and, worst of all, new technologies and skills ebbing out of our economy. [The business secretary] must surely be regretting dragging his heels on his promised Cadbury law [which would make it more difficult for foreign takeovers to succeed].\u201d It is a topical view, following the announcement of the \u00a324bn takeover of UK chip designer ARM Holdings by Japan\u2019s SoftBank last week, even if the words were said about Vince Cable in 2011 by Unite\u2019s Tony Burke. Burke, of course, was speaking about US technology giant Hewlett-Packard, which had just taken over Cambridge-based software firm Autonomy, then the darling of Britain\u2019s tech sector, for \u00a37bn. Yet if anybody is regretting HM government\u2019s inaction on that one, it is probably HP boss Meg Whitman, since the US group ended up taking a $5bn charge on the deal. That is not to say that the ARM transaction will also be unsuccessful \u2013 or that Burke\u2019s view is invalid \u2013 but it does illustrate that these things can work both ways. Anyway, there\u2019ll be plenty more scope to debate this one, starting this week. With delicious timing, ARM\u2019s half-year results are due on Wednesday.",
