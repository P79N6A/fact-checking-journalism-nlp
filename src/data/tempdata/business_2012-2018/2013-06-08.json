      "bodyText": "Along-anticipated document landed on George Osborne's desk last week. It is thought to spell out the process by which the bailed-out banks could be returned to the private sector by handing shares to taxpayers. If the chancellor embraces the plan, he might have a chance of creating a much-needed feelgood factor in the run-up to polling day in May 2015. The ideas set out by the Policy Exchange thinktank will be published formally on 10 June, just as Osborne awaits delivery of another report, this time one he commissioned, which is rumoured to run to 600 pages. Drawn up by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, set up in the wake of Barclays' \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor a year ago, the report could have wide-ranging implications for the whole of the banking industry. The precise timing of the report's publication is not set in stone but the commissioners \u2013 including former Chancellor Lord Lawson and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby \u2013 will begin a two-day closed-door meeting to try to reach agreement on their recommendations. The commissioners, chaired by MP Andrew Tyrie, are thought to want to make their views known before Osborne's Mansion House speech on 19 June. The date is regarded by bankers as an ideal opportunity for the chancellor to reveal his thinking on the future of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, and to respond to the banking commission, assuming the members have reached consensus on a range of issues by then. The commission's report is the more influential, and is likely to make uncomfortable reading not only for Barclays but for the many other banks that gave evidence over the past six months. During that time RBS and Swiss bank UBS were also fined for rigging the Libor rate. Even HSBC and Standard Chartered, which had come through the banking crisis relatively unscathed, were fined by US regulators over money laundering and sanction-busting respectively. Peter Hahn of Cass Business School, who himself gave evidence to the commission, wonders whether such bad behaviour is seen as a \"cost of doing business\" by the banks. \"Everyone at the senior management level would say, of course no,\" he says. Hahn points out that the commission helped personalise much of what went wrong in the crisis. Its stinging report into the collapse of HBOS forced former chief executive James Crosby to hand back his knighthood. At one hearing, former Lloyds boss Eric Daniels was lambasted for the sale of payment protection insurance while at another Welby described UBS as a \"corrupted organisation\". The auditors who signed off banks' accounts, and the experts who set pay and bonuses at the big banks, have also been subjected to grillings. The financial sector is therefore braced for a wide range of recommendations, such as new criminal offences making it easier to send bankers to jail, a crackdown on City pay, a 10-year deferral period for bonuses, the creation of portable bank accounts to foster competition and \u2013 bankers' worst fear \u2013 a recommendation for a full-blown competition inquiry. For a brief period the commission strayed into the question of whether RBS should be broken up, a policy advocated by Lawson, who may try to convince his fellow commissioners to back a recommendation to split RBS into a good and bad bank. Sir Mervyn King, outgoing governor of the Bank of England, backs a similar idea, while Welby has called for RBS to be split into regional banks. Osborne's views on achieving a sell-off have not been made public but he is not thought to be keen on splitting up RBS. He told the commission nationalising RBS, likely to be necessary if is broken up, could cost the taxpayer up to \u00a310bn. After the International Monetary Fund urged him last month to set out a view on the banks, he said: \"Now is the time for a clear strategy on how to return RBS and Lloyds to the private sector in a way that protects value for the taxpayer.\" Legislation may well be needed. Shadow financial spokesman Chris Leslie said: \"We will want to question the chancellor's motives on this front. He has already started using the language of 'we'll never get our money back'.\" If the chancellor does kickstart a share sale, it could provoke fresh speculation about the management of the two banks. Lloyds chairman Sir Win Bischoff has already said he will stand down, while chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio will earn a bonus if he stays on to oversee a share sale. At RBS, chairman Sir Philip Hampton has reportedly told the bank's non-executive directors that he has begun a search for successor to Stephen Hester, parachuted in as chief executive during the 2008 bailout. But Hester, who is close to seeing through his five-year turnaround programme, said in May: \"If I'm wanted [to lead the privatisation] why wouldn't I want to do that?\" Osborne seems to be preparing to reveal when and how that privatisation might begin.",

Almost 60% of the firm's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/13/wpp-shareholders-vote-against-sorrell-pay\" title=\"\">shareholders voted down a plan</a> to increase his pay by up to 60%.

He broke the unspoken rule in the corporate world by commenting on his own pay. \"In 1985 I borrowed \u00a3250,000 to buy almost 15% of WPP.

Instead, the challenge sparked years of public squabbling that in the refined circles inhabited by its wealthy clients could be defined as most ungenteel. Now, having raged for three years, the Gallic \"handbag war\" is entering a new phase. In the next few weeks, the French authorities are expected to rule on the bitter dispute between the two firms. Did LVMH sneakily and with great subterfuge attempt a creeping takeover of Herm\u00e8s when it obtained shares in the company using cash-settlement equity swaps and, it is claimed, subsidiaries? If so, it could face a fine of up to \u20ac10m. Or has Herm\u00e8s, anxious to remain family-run and independent, engaged in a snobbish and condescending \"slander and smear\" campaign against its bigger, brasher rival? If so, the company that referred to LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, France's richest man, as an \"intruder in the garden\" (adding \"we don't want him in the house\") will have to learn to live with its uninvited and unwanted guest. If the buoyant luxury goods market, which appears to be bucking the recession, was not so important to France's struggling economy, the handbags-at-dawn standoff between two of the country's most prestigious brands might be mildly amusing. Its first customer may have been a horse, but Herm\u00e8s has come a long way from its relatively humble beginnings as a harness and bridle shop for European nobles. This is the company that made scarves for Queen Elizabeth II and Jackie Onassis\u2013 who decorated her walls with them \u2013 and boots for the former shah of Iran, and created the once-ubiquitous \"Kelly\" bag, named for Princess Grace of Monaco. Herm\u00e8s, which has gone from strength to strength in recent years, and posted a record-breaking profit of \u20ac740m in 2012, on a \u20ac3.48bn turnover, is also purveyor of the ultimate \"it\" bag, the Birkin \u2013 named after British singer Jane Birkin \u2013 whose price can match that of a luxury car and whose exclusiveness has survived reports that queen of bling Victoria Beckham has 100 of them in her closet. Not that Herm\u00e8s talks about its customers. For a firm that considers its hand-stitched, hand-crafted goods the ne plus ultra of refinement, good taste and timeless luxury, such a lack of discretion would be downright vulgar. Herm\u00e8s makes no secret of considering itself several cuts above Louis Vuitton. The right-of-centre Le Figaro newspaper reported that the Herm\u00e8s family has \"always had a condescending view of Louis Vuitton and its bags of coated canvas\". Asked once why Herm\u00e8s shunned initials, Xavier Guerrand-Herm\u00e8s, great-great-grandson of Thierry Herm\u00e8s, who opened the first harness shop in Paris in 1837, retorted: \"If someone knows us, they will know us.\" To the Herm\u00e8s clan, LVMH is a brash upstart, as is Arnault, a close friend of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, also viewed as a parvenu. The stable of firms in Arnault's empire, acquired often by snapping up small, dispute-riven companies, includes Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon, the world's largest champagne house, as well as Givenchy, Guerlain, Marc Jacobs and C\u00e9line. In 2010, when the French stock-market watchdog, the AMF, announced its investigation into how Arnault acquired his 17% of Herm\u00e8s shares, it warned it would be \"long, difficult and very complex\". The inquiry has sparked three years of claims and counter-claims between the luxury giants. A leaked AMF report carried in Le Monde claimed LVMH, which has since built up its holding to 22.6%, had been increasing its stake in Herm\u00e8s since 2001 through subsidiaries using the code name Mercure, investing amounts too small to require disclosure. LVMH said it would \"vigorously\" contest the claims. Last July, Herm\u00e8s launched a lawsuit \"contre X\" \u2013 against unknown persons \u2013 for insider trading and complicity in insider trading. LVMH countersued for \"blackmail, false accusation and unfair competition\". Patrick Thomas, joint chief executive of Herm\u00e8s, told French journalists that LVMH's emergence as a shareholder was neither \"desired, nor desirable\" and was against stock exchange rules: \"The small Herm\u00e8s shareholders would not have sold [their shares] had they known LVMH was behind the attack.\" At a final hearing at the end of May, the two sides were still slugging it out. The AMF's decision is expected by the end of June. Thomas, who will hand over the reins to Axel Dumas, 42, a sixth-generation member of the Herm\u00e8s family, told French news channel BFMTV: \"We must not have someone who is a rival and perhaps a threat holding too-significant capital. From the beginning we have said that the way that LVMH got into Herm\u00e8s is, and I'm measuring my words, illicit.\" Thomas has even suggested that LVMH's withdrawal from Herm\u00e8s is \"in the interests of France\". LVMH has repeatedly argued that its actions were perfectly legal. Vice-president Pierre God\u00e9 said: \"It is not for a publicly listed company to ask whether it likes its shareholders or not. LVMH is a shareholder and asks to be treated like any other.\"",

The difference with Wednesday's forum is that it threatens to be quite entertaining, as the headline act is the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who was pondering these issues long before the debates were fashionable (or the BBC's Stephanie Flanders secured a monopoly in chairing them). Back in 1992, Welby penned an essay entitled \"Can Companies Sin?\", which presented some splendid suggestions on persuading corporations to behave. \"Clearly a company cannot be imprisoned,\" he wrote, \"but a court could sentence it to carry a record of its corporate crimes on its headed paper.\" \"Secondly, shareholders should have the cost of their companies' wrongdoing vividly presented to them,\" he continued. \"A judge could order that a [fine] be deducted from the next dividend.\" That may sound like the type of City lots of ordinary punters desire, but would it appeal to Barclays boss Antony Jenkins, a former preacher for payment protection insurance who's now a born-again evangelist for corporate responsibility? We might find out during Wednesday's debate at St Paul's \u2013 where the pair will share a pulpit. Bright outlook for Justin There is a broad spread of views on Justin King, the longstanding boss of J Sainsbury. They tend to range from him being (a) a skilled chief executive, if a little too sure of himself (Fleet Street's take); (b) an effective boss of a company operating in a difficult market (the City's current stance); or (c) an exceptional business leader (J King's assessment). Still, say what you like about him, there are few who question his commitment to the grocer over his past nine years in charge \u2013 with some City wags observing that his year-round tan occasionally makes it appear as though King is made in the corporate colours. King will front another trading statement this week \u2013 no doubt with his usual impeccable style \u2013 which the City expects to confirm Sainsbury's as the current leader in its challenging field. Inevitably, he'll also be asked to quash constant retirement rumours too. There are, however, tidbits of evidence suggesting King speaks the truth when claiming he'll work past his 10-year anniversary, as the group's website trumpets the opening of \"Britain's greenest convenience store\" just down the road from his west Midlands home. That suggests he's concentrating on business, rather than potential leisure options. The new shop used to be a tanning salon.

Then his finance director, Godfrey Davis, switched sides in a power struggle with the Singaporean billionaire Christina Ong, and took his job as chief executive and chairman too. That bout of handbags between the old friends actually turned out extremely well for shareholders, as the company's value soared over the next decade. Until 2012, that is, when owning Mulberry stock went out of fashion. The share price has almost halved in the past year, after the group introduced its new line in profit warnings, the latest of which came in March. This week the company announces its full-year results, which are expected to show pre-tax profits down by about 28% at \u00a326m, partly on the back of a weak Asian market. Still, for those who believe that new product launches mean there's still much to be optimistic about, there's this spring's release of Mulberry's new Willow bag.

      "bodyText": "Whatever the Eurosceptics may say, presidents of the European commission do serve one important function: scuttling big projects that have become politically toxic. A decade ago, Romano Prodi declared \"stupid\" the fiscal straightjacket of the early euro era, and that put paid to the growth and stability pact. At first, when small fry such as Ireland and Portugal broke the pact they were rebuked \u2013 even fined \u2013 by the commission. When France and Germany couldn't live with its strictures, Prodi threw in the towel. Ultimately, evading the pact became so pervasive that it began to undermine the commission's credibility. Fast-forward to 2013 and this cycle has repeated itself. Since 2010, governments of EU countries have committed themselves to austerity and the pastoral commission has taken the lead in monitoring, coaxing, and occasionally chastising its flock. In the meantime, public support for the EU has tanked. Pew Research reported in May that the proportion of people with a favourable view of the EU had fallen from 68% in 2007 to 46%. Only 29% now believe European integration has strengthened their country. Just 17% believe cutting public debt should be their government's top priority. Emphasising austerity, then, is not only out of step with public opinion but has threatened support for the European project. Ultimately, austerity threatened the political viability of too many sacred cows. Step forward Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, austerity's executioner. In late April, he departed from the script in comments to a thinktank in Brussels. Acknowledging the ebb in public support for the EU, he then made the link to the current \"financial situation\". After that came the killer blow. Barroso noted that the current policies had reached their limits and then opined that successful policies must have a minimum degree of \"political and social support\", as he put it. The fact that Barroso's spokesman tried to play down his remarks only added fuel to the fire. Austerity's failure is not just political. Two days before Barroso spoke, Eurostat, the EU statistics body, announced that government deficit reduction in 2012 had stalled in both the eurozone and across the wider EU. Worse, despite all the attention given to austerity, the share of national income spent by governments crept up in 2012, rising more in the eurozone than in the rest of the EU. The EU's austerity programme either failed to curb government spending or failed to deliver deficit cuts. These facts make a mockery of the OECD's contention, highlighted in its recent economic outlook at the end of May, that austerity programmes in Europe had worked because they would enable debt-to-GDP ratios to stabilise by 2030. So it's back to pump-priming then? Not so fast. In the wonderland that makes for current economic policymaking, abandoning austerity has, with one notable exception, come with pledges not to reflate economies with public spending. The exception, bizarrely, comes from the European commission. Just recently, Barroso repeated his demand that EU member states give the European Investment Bank billions of euros to invest in infrastructure. National spending on bridges is bad, but Brussels-driven spending is fine. At best this shifts the spending off national balance sheets; at worst it is incoherent. Since tax and spending policy is off the table and monetary policy has been outsourced to central banks, what agenda is left for finance ministers and Brussels? The emphasis is to be on structural reform. Certainly international organisations such as the IMF and European commission had been advocating structural reform earlier, along with austerity. Now the former is the only game in town. What can we realistically expect, then, from this new phase of crisis-era policy response? Not even the proponents of structural reforms argue that it pays off quickly. Reminders of this came in the recent debate over the economic legacy of Margaret Thatcher. It was telling how often serious economic commentary pointed to gains in output per head by 2007, some 28 years after she came to office. Reforms were credited with bolstering competition and increasing numbers at work, but not with raising the UK's productivity relative to peers. Structural reform is no quick fix. Many promoters of structural reform are honest enough to acknowledge that it generates short-term pain. This isn't difficult to understand. If you've been in a job where it is hard to be fired, labour market reform introduces insecurity, and you might be tempted to save more now there's a greater prospect of unemployment. Economy-wide labour reform might induce consumer spending cuts, adding another drag on a weakened economy. Moreover, this short-term pain isn't likely to be well-received by voters. Indeed, this is why politicians with a healthy interest in their futures have resisted implementing structural reforms. Still, suppose sweeping structural reforms were implemented with the active support of the European commission. The near-term pain will again undermine support for the European project, and it will fall to another commission president to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce. With austerity's demise, the bankruptcy of policies for economic recovery will become increasingly apparent. Simon J Evenett is a professor of economics at the University of St Gallen, Switzerland.

      "body": "<p>Whatever the Eurosceptics may say, presidents of the European commission do serve one important function: scuttling big projects that have become politically toxic. A decade ago, Romano Prodi declared \"stupid\" the fiscal straightjacket of the early euro era, and that put paid to the growth and stability pact. At first, when small fry such as Ireland and Portugal broke the pact they were rebuked \u2013 even fined \u2013 by the commission. When France and Germany couldn't live with its strictures, Prodi threw in the towel. Ultimately, evading the pact became so pervasive that it began to undermine the commission's credibility.</p> <p>Fast-forward to 2013 and this cycle has repeated itself. Since 2010, governments of EU countries have committed themselves to austerity and the pastoral commission has taken the lead in monitoring, coaxing, and occasionally chastising its flock. In the meantime, public support for the EU has tanked. <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/\" title=\"\">Pew Research</a> reported in May that the proportion of people with a favourable view of the EU had fallen from 68% in 2007 to 46%. Only 29% now believe European integration has strengthened their country. Just 17% believe cutting public debt should be their government's top priority. Emphasising austerity, then, is not only out of step with public opinion but has threatened support for the European project. Ultimately, austerity threatened the political viability of too many sacred cows.</p> <p>Step forward Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, austerity's executioner. In late April, he departed from the script in comments to a thinktank in Brussels. Acknowledging the ebb in public support for the EU, he then made the link to the current \"financial situation\". After that came the killer blow. Barroso noted that the current policies had reached their limits and then opined that successful policies must have a minimum degree of \"political and social support\", as he put it. The fact that Barroso's spokesman tried to play down his remarks only added fuel to the fire.</p> <p>Austerity's failure is not just political. Two days before Barroso spoke, Eurostat, the EU statistics body, announced that government deficit reduction in 2012 had stalled in both the eurozone and across the wider EU. Worse, despite all the attention given to austerity, the share of national income spent by governments crept up in 2012, rising more in the eurozone than in the rest of the EU.</p> <p>The EU's austerity programme either failed to curb government spending or failed to deliver deficit cuts. These facts make a mockery of the OECD's contention, highlighted in its recent economic outlook at the end of May, that austerity programmes in Europe had worked because they would enable debt-to-GDP ratios to stabilise by 2030.</p> <p>So it's back to pump-priming then? Not so fast. In the wonderland that makes for current economic policymaking, abandoning austerity has, with one notable exception, come with pledges not to reflate economies with public spending. The exception, bizarrely, comes from the European commission. Just recently, Barroso repeated his demand that EU member states give the European Investment Bank billions of euros to invest in infrastructure. National spending on bridges is bad, but Brussels-driven spending is fine. At best this shifts the spending off national balance sheets; at worst it is incoherent.</p> <p>Since tax and spending policy is off the table and monetary policy has been outsourced to central banks, what agenda is left for finance ministers and Brussels? The emphasis is to be on structural reform. Certainly international organisations such as the IMF and European commission had been advocating structural reform earlier, along with austerity. Now the former is the only game in town.</p> <p>What can we realistically expect, then, from this new phase of crisis-era policy response?</p> <p>Not even the proponents of structural reforms argue that it pays off quickly. Reminders of this came in the recent debate over the economic legacy of Margaret Thatcher. It was telling how often serious economic commentary pointed to gains in output per head by 2007, some 28 years after she came to office. Reforms were credited with bolstering competition and increasing numbers at work, but not with raising the UK's productivity relative to peers. Structural reform is no quick fix.</p> <p>Many promoters of structural reform are honest enough to acknowledge that it generates short-term pain. This isn't difficult to understand. If you've been in a job where it is hard to be fired, labour market reform introduces insecurity, and you might be tempted to save more now there's a greater prospect of unemployment. Economy-wide labour reform might induce consumer spending cuts, adding another drag on a weakened economy. Moreover, this short-term pain isn't likely to be well-received by voters. Indeed, this is why politicians with a healthy interest in their futures have resisted implementing structural reforms.</p> <p>Still, suppose sweeping structural reforms were implemented with the active support of the European commission. The near-term pain will again undermine support for the European project, and it will fall to another commission president to deliver the <em>coup de gr\u00e2ce</em>. With austerity's demise, the bankruptcy of policies for economic recovery will become increasingly apparent.</p> <p><em>Simon J Evenett is a professor of economics at the University of St Gallen, Switzerland.
