      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell tells his high-spending advertising clients that there's no such thing as bad publicity. But the globe-trotting boss of WPP is unlikely to have enjoyed the limelight much last week, when a 30% rise in his salary caused an investor outcry and sparked a humiliating defeat for the media company's pay policy, in the highest-profile victory for investors during the current \"shareholder spring\". Sorrell knew the pay deal \u2013 taking his salary to \u00a31.3m and total remuneration for 2011 to \u00a313m \u2013 was facing rejection. But the decision to cling on to the pay rise shows the determination of the 67-year-old, who, according to an analysis by the Observer, has taken home more than \u00a3110m in the last 10 years from bonus schemes dating back as far as the early 1990s. A staggering 60% of shareholders voted against it \u2013 a historic victory for FTSE investors, who have registered rebellions at companies as diverse as insurance company Aviva and car dealership Pendragon so far this year. Investors argue Sorrell stirred up the row over his pay rise, handed out during a time of political and public concern over top pay, by writing a highly personal defence of it in the Financial Times. His argument that he was worth it because he had turned Wire &amp; Plastic Products \u2013 a \u00a31m company that specialised in making shopping baskets \u2013 into a \u00a310bn marketing giant cut no ice with his audience. In fact, it added fuel to the fire. In a sign of the deterioration in WPP's relationship with shareholders, chairman Philip Lader will begin a crucial round of meetings with them to try to heal the wounds on Monday. A former US ambassador to London, Lader is going to need every ounce of his diplomatic charm to win around shareholders, who also expressed their anger by registering protest votes against a number of members of the company's board. Sorrell says he is \"disappointed\". He argues he has put \u00a340m of his own money into WPP \u2013 including some \u00a31.7m into a single incentive scheme. Some of those that have paid out in the last 10 years date back to 1992. The best known is the Leadership Equity Acquisition Plan, which dates back to the late 1990s and was one of the factors that led to the bumper \u00a350m in cash and shares that Sorrell received in 2004, when a series of performance-related deals from schemes dating back as long as 10 years all paid out at once. An analysis of his remuneration over the last 10 years provides an illustration of the complexities of top pay, based as it is on intricately constructed share-based schemes spread over multiple years. While over that decade he took home on average around \u00a310m, there are some big spikes \u2013 such as the \u00a350m in 2004, about which he said at the time: \"What I did was truly entrepreneurial. It means taking a risk and putting your money where your mouth is.\" In 1985, Sorrell, a former finance director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, borrowed \u00a3250,000 to buy a 15% stake in WPP. The company became his acquisition vehicle to unite ad agencies JWT and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, media buyer Mediacom and public relations firms such as Hill &amp; Knowlton. He now ranks in the top 500 wealthiest people in Britain. He argues that he rarely sells shares \u2013 the obvious exception being the \u00a312m-worth offloaded in 2005 to fund a divorce settlement \u2013 and few doubt WPP is his life. When the company celebrated its 25th anniversary two years ago, Sorrell recalled the words of former Liverpool football manager Bill Shankly: \"It's not a matter of life and death, it's more important. And that is what WPP is, more important.\" Shareholders argue that what is important now is for the company to start heeding their concerns. Lader is promising to listen hard as he tours the offices of the most powerful investors in the City along with Jeffrey Rosen, the US investment banker who chairs WPP's remuneration committee, which sanctioned the pay rise. To investors, who are more accustomed to delivering Politburo-style endorsements to directors, it is a crucial moment. Abigail Herron, corporate governance manager at Co-operative Asset Management, says she has been \"stonewalled\" by other companies that suffered humiliating protests \u2013 Cairn Energy, the former FTSE 100 company whose report was voted down, and bookmaker William Hill, whose pay deals were passed by the tiniest margin. \"My question is what will happen with WPP,\" she says. It is not just at Sorrell's company where pay campaigners are hoping for change. \"I think the test will be when we come back next year \u2013 both with the quantum and the design of the remuneration,\" says Catherine Howarth, chief executive of FairPensions, who has attended many of the annual meetings where revolts have been registered. This year's six \"no\" votes \u2013 a record \u2013 have only been advisory, although business secretary Vince Cable is expected to announce shortly whether to grant investors binding powers over pay matters. Arguably, the biggest showdown is yet to come. Mining company Xstrata wants to hand out \u00a3172m in retention packages to 73 staff \u2013 including chief executive Mick Davis \u2013 to lock them in following the controversial merger with commodities trading company Glencore. Davis is another FTSE 100 boss who regularly features highly on the lists of highest-paid executives, and even before the retention packages were revealed, shareholders had registered protest votes over Xstrata's pay schemes at the company's annual meeting. Glencore and Xstrata have made the retention packages a key part of their merger, which investors vote on next month; the deal \u2013 already unpopular with some \u2013 cannot go ahead unless investors also approve the payments. Sir John Bond, the Xstrata chairman, who is leading the major charm offensive around the City, is receiving a message of deep scepticism about the deals; some investors have told him that concessions will be essential \u2013 particularly the insertion of performance conditions to the pay deals \u2013 to stand a chance of being voted through. As it stands, the scene is set for the next flashpoint in a long, hot shareholder spring.",

      "bodyText": "I am the founder of Pro-Business Against Greed. I was managing director of a public company, Greggs the bakers, for 24 years. I believe in taking a long-term view \u2013 building a business for the benefit of consumers, employees and shareholders \u2013 and being of benefit to society as a whole. For me, this is the moral and sensible justification for business's existence in our civilisation. Unfortunately, this view of business has been largely undermined by the growth in excessive rewards and greed \u2013 the \"because I'm worth it\" attitude. It is essential that our politicians and legislators bear down on these excesses \u2013 through encouragement, threat and legislation. We must have binding, forward-looking votes on remuneration at AGMs. As an absolute minimum, these should take place every three years. There must be appropriate regulation to ensure companies have external, independent members on their remuneration committees (university vice-chancellors, for example, would have the ability and common sense to be excellent candidates). There should also be regulation encouraging simplicity and transparency in pay packages. I believe chief executives' and senior bankers' pay is too high and must be reduced. If their packages halved in value over the next few years, they would still be generous. There should be three elements of remuneration: basic pay for doing a good job \u2013 the sort of good job one would expect of the average chief executive \u2013 an annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary for a truly exceptional performance, and grants of shares to match an individual's investment in shares, made out of their bonus. To encourage long-termism, these shares should vest over between seven and 15 years, and not be saleable until three years after they have retired or left the company. Politicians and legislators, as well as company boards and investors. must keep up the pressure if we are to reduce this gross inequity which has grown up in our society.",

I was managing director of a public company, Greggs the bakers, for 24 years. I believe in taking a long-term view \u2013 building a business for the benefit of consumers, employees and shareholders \u2013 and being of benefit to society as a whole. For me, this is the moral and sensible justification for business's existence in our civilisation. Unfortunately, this view of business has been largely undermined by the growth in excessive rewards and greed \u2013 the \"because I'm worth it\" attitude.</p> <p>It is essential that our politicians and legislators bear down on these excesses \u2013 through encouragement, threat and legislation. We must have binding, forward-looking votes on remuneration at AGMs. As an absolute minimum, these should take place every three years. There must be appropriate regulation to ensure companies have external, independent members on their remuneration committees (university vice-chancellors, for example, would have the ability and common sense to be excellent candidates). There should also be regulation encouraging simplicity and transparency in pay packages.</p> <p>I believe chief executives' and senior bankers' pay is too high and must be reduced. If their packages halved in value over the next few years, they would still be generous. There should be three elements of remuneration: basic pay for doing a good job \u2013 the sort of good job one would expect of the average chief executive \u2013 an annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary for a truly exceptional performance, and grants of shares to match an individual's investment in shares, made out of their bonus. To encourage long-termism, these shares should vest over between seven and 15 years, and not be saleable until three years after they have retired or left the company.</p> <p>Politicians and legislators, as well as company boards and investors. must keep up the pressure if we are to reduce this gross inequity which has grown up in our society.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The leaders of airlines from every continent jetted into Beijing last week, escorted by their hosts to a banquet in the very heart of China's political establishment \u2013 the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square. Given the red carpet treatment and majestic setting, few onlookers might have thought this was an industry in crisis. Yet when the talking started, the state of aviation was summed up in a word that belies the traditional macho swagger of airline bosses: fragile. The annual global summit of the International Air Transport Association (Iata) has resembled a United Nations of airlines, filled with delegates from the flag carriers of countries around the world. But the borders are becoming less distinct as the likes of British Airways and Iberia, Air France and KLM merge and consolidate, seeking to cut costs rather than struggle on alone. This is an industry that has already made a multibillion-dollar global loss in seven of the last 12 years: and for European airlines, in the eye of the economic storm, losses are predicted to top $1bn this year. Tony Tyler, the genial president of Iata, refused to predict names or numbers but, when pressed, conceded that more airlines would doubtless go bust soon \u2013 and even the biggest names were not immune. Perhaps only the cash-rich Gulf carriers can sit easy. From the platform, Akbar al-Baker, the chief executive of Qatar Airways, delivered an unnerving prediction with a grin: \"When we meet again next year,\" he declared, \"there will be far fewer of you sitting there.\" Gone already from the Iata conference hall this year were Mal\u00e9v, the Hungarian flag carrier for 56 years, and Spanair, the fourth largest airline in Spain until it nosedived in January. The current travails of Qantas, the Australian carrier, will have sent a further chill down executive spines. Traditionally, governments have sought to maintain their flag-carrier airlines: Australia's Qantas Sale Act prevents it falling into foreign ownership. But can the current state of affairs continue? Earlier this month, Qantas shares fell below A$1 for the first time since the carrier was privatised 17 years ago, following a profit warning blamed on a combination of hard-up Europeans cancelling their holidays and sharply rising fuel costs. Attempts to restructure the airline last year led to a dispute that saw the entire fleet grounded. \"Akbar told me I should put the union leaders in jail,\" joked Qantas boss Alan Joyce, to the conference, hastily adding he wouldn't seriously like to do that. There is no doubt that he feels vulnerable: it emerged last week that the airline had hired investment bankers to come up with a bid defence strategy in case a predator comes knocking. Qantas's biggest problem is the ever-more competitive environment. The rapid ascent of Middle East airlines and their hub airports, pioneered by Emirates in Dubai, lately joined by the rampant Etihad from Abu Dhabi, is prising the market for long-haul routes away from Qantas's backyard. While the \"Flying Kangaroo\" still dominates on domestic routes, only one in five Australians choose the flag carrier to travel abroad. Qantas, like all airlines, has seen its fuel bills balloon. Escalating oil prices mean fuel now represents on average a third of airline operating costs, from about 13% a decade ago, according to Tyler, putting profits were \"on a knife edge\". Globally, Iata forecasts $3bn profits this year for the entire industry, on revenues of more than $600bn. Even those razor-thin margins are down to a handful of major carriers that continue to boom in China and the Asia-Pacific countries. Joyce, speaking in his other role as Iata's new chairman, says: \"The number of airlines in the industry is too many. It's too fragmented, and consolidation is a good thing.\" Consolidation, most agree, will continue and accelerate. Willie Walsh, International Airlines Group (IAG) chief executive, bluntly agrees that there are too many carriers. \"Many will disappear. And you won't see new airlines appear. The barriers to entry are much higher now.\" Consolidation, in Walsh's view, won't be down to the kind of takeover he recently finalised \u2013 the \u00a3186m acquisition that will see BMI integrate into BA. The future, he says, will be waiting for the weakest \"to go belly-up \u2013 it's the cheapest form of consolidation\". Walsh points to the US, where the consolidation of major airlines has left, he says, a \"stronger, more rational industry over time\". The IAG boss has said \"synergies\" between the British and Spanish airlines he controls will take until 2015 to be fully realised. Christoph Franz, the chief executive of the German carrier Lufthansa, which has swallowed up both the Swiss and Austrian national carriers in the last five years, is equally adamant that other airlines need to go. \"We have 50 airlines in Europe. In America you have six [major network carriers].\" Competition rules, he says, will exacerbate company failures. \"In the last decade it was acquisition and mergers. Now, with BMI, you see you have to provide expensive remedies and give up slots\" to acquire rivals \u2013 in this case, a dozen prized landing slots at Heathrow. According to Franz, \"it means the smaller airlines can't be bought \u2013 only go bankrupt. The current competition regime is triggering consolidation through bankruptcies.\" Carriers that traditionally applied for state aid no longer can, he says, \"and if they don't get it, it's very difficult\". The big rationale for consolidation, says Douglas McNeill, a transport analyst at Charles Stanley, is that it concentrates control in an industry that has tended to grow too quickly in good times. Too many seats keep fares low and eat away at profits. \"The fewer airlines there are, the less of that capacity indiscipline there will be.\" Ownership rules that limit foreign shareholdings (to 49% in Europe and Australia, to 25% in the US) are perhaps the only thing holding back full-scale consolidation. \"You can spend a lot of money buying shares but you can't get control, so what's the point of that? 49% is seldom of much use,\" says McNeill at Charles Stanley. \"In my opinion, it's not a wise investment.\" Some suggest Qantas could thrive in an alliance with Emirates, looking to the Gulf carrier to provide an onward network rather than sustain its own routes to Europe. But Emirates has said it is not looking for an alliance. Neither, says al-Baker, is Qatar. In the face of the Middle Eastern carriers, Qantas's long-haul future may just wither away. Either way, an industry of fewer global players looks inevitable, and the kangaroo may not be the last to have its tail clipped.",

Willie Walsh, International Airlines Group (IAG) chief executive, bluntly agrees that there are too many carriers. \"Many will disappear. And you won't see new airlines appear. The barriers to entry are much higher now.\"</p> <p>Consolidation, in Walsh's view, won't be down to the kind of takeover he recently finalised \u2013 the \u00a3186m acquisition that will see BMI integrate into BA. The future, he says, will be waiting for the weakest \"to go belly-up \u2013 it's the cheapest form of consolidation\".</p> <p>Walsh points to the US, where the consolidation of major airlines has left, he says, a \"stronger, more rational industry over time\". The IAG boss has said \"synergies\" between the British and Spanish airlines he controls will take until 2015 to be fully realised.</p> <p>Christoph Franz, the chief executive of the German carrier Lufthansa, which has swallowed up both the Swiss and Austrian national carriers in the last five years, is equally adamant that other airlines need to go. \"We have 50 airlines in Europe. In America you have six [major network carriers].\" Competition rules, he says, will exacerbate company failures. \"In the last decade it was acquisition and mergers. Now, with BMI, you see you have to provide expensive remedies and give up slots\" to acquire rivals \u2013 in this case, a dozen prized landing slots at Heathrow.</p> <p>According to Franz, \"it means the smaller airlines can't be bought \u2013 only go bankrupt. The current competition regime is triggering consolidation through bankruptcies.\" Carriers that traditionally applied for state aid no longer can, he says, \"and if they don't get it, it's very difficult\".</p> <p>The big rationale for consolidation, says Douglas McNeill, a transport analyst at Charles Stanley, is that it concentrates control in an industry that has tended to grow too quickly in good times. Too many seats keep fares low and eat away at profits. \"The fewer airlines there are, the less of that capacity indiscipline there will be.\"</p> <p>Ownership rules that limit foreign shareholdings (to 49% in Europe and Australia, to 25% in the US) are perhaps the only thing holding back full-scale consolidation. \"You can spend a lot of money buying shares but you can't get control, so what's the point of that? 49% is seldom of much use,\" says McNeill at Charles Stanley. \"In my opinion, it's not a wise investment.\"</p> <p>Some suggest Qantas could thrive in an alliance with Emirates, looking to the Gulf carrier to provide an onward network rather than sustain its own routes to Europe. But Emirates has said it is not looking for an alliance. Neither, says al-Baker, is Qatar. In the face of the Middle Eastern carriers, Qantas's long-haul future may just wither away. Either way, an industry of fewer global players looks inevitable, and the kangaroo may not be the last to have its tail clipped.</p>",

He goes on about the \"relentless logic\" of the need for the eurozone to become a fiscal union, and he drops heavy hints that he believes they should start the revolution without Greece. The spectacle of a rightwing Conservative chancellor advocating European fiscal union is ironic in the extreme \u2013 and the extreme right of the Conservative party must have very sore eyes. As for the potential conflict between the eurozone's ideas of financial and banking regulation and those that suit the City of London, we have seen nothing yet. But it is an ill wind that blows no chancellor any good, and the travails of the eurozone have given Osborne the perfect cover for a major U-turn in economic policy. Aside from the torrent of news about continuing banking crises around Europe, even if the banking system is fixed \u2013 a big if \u2013 the tenor of Germany's plans for the economic policy of the eurozone is deeply worrying. If one looks around the world, one finds that most of Europe, including the UK, is in a depression; that China and other emerging economies are slowing down; and that the US, which seemed at one stage to have a more stimulatory economic policy than the rest, is in fact \"recovering\" far more slowly than had been hoped. No wonder President Obama and his entourage are taking such a close interest in events in the eurozone. Economic trends, and a lack of leadership, are reviving all too vivid memories of the 1930s. We know how honourable were the motives of Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand in pushing for monetary union after the reunification of Germany in 1990. But, as the former Bank of England and United Nations economist Mica Panic concludes in a masterly study of globalisation and the eurozone: \"The main problem with [the eurozone] in its present form is that, whatever the original intention, it has turned out in practice to be nothing less than an attempt, in the macroeconomic management and the welfare state in particular, to put the clock back to the 1930s!\" (Globalisation \u2013 A Threat to International Cooperation and Peace?, 2011.) It is abundantly clear that everyone is dissatisfied with the eurozone in its present form. Unfortunately, the plethora of putative remedies flowing out of the body politic, whether they involve eurobonds, banking unions or medium-term plans for a quasi-fiscal union, do not address the central economic issue of our time: how to emerge from the depression that is with us here and now. During the depression of the early 1930s, Keynes was fully behind the kind of monetary stimulus that is all the rage in the UK these days. But he came to the conclusion that monetary policy was not enough. Among the many distinguished modern practitioners who agree with him is none other than that great student of the Great Depression, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, the world leader in monetary policy! The error being committed by the Germans with their \"fiscal pact\", and our own chancellor with his austerity programme, is essentially one of timing. It is all very well trying to balance the budget if and when we emerge from depression. But the attempt at fiscal rectitude now risks \u2013 indeed, almost certainly guarantees \u2013 prolonging the depression. As Bernanke recently said in the US context: \"A severe tightening of fiscal policy at the beginning of next year that is built into current law \u2013 the so-called fiscal cliff \u2013 would, if allowed to occur, pose a significant threat to the recovery.\" He added: \"Fortunately, avoiding the fiscal cliff and achieving long-term fiscal sustainability are fully compatible and mutually reinforcing objectives. Preventing a sudden and severe contraction in fiscal policy will support the transition back to full employment.\" The evolution of Keynes's thinking on the issue of stimulatory monetary policy being necessary but not sufficient to achieve emergence from depression is well captured in Robert Skidelsky's and DE Moggridge's biographies. A more recent account is contained in Sylvia Nasar's Grand Pursuit \u2013 The Story of Economic Genius. As Nasar says: \"Once monetary policy was rendered ineffectual, the only option for shoring up demand was getting money into the hands of those who could spend it.\" With monetary policy almost at its limits \u2013 although the Bank of England now seems to be trying even harder \u2013 a pithy observation of Keynes's strikes a chord: \"The inability of the interest rate to fall has brought down empires.\" The indefatigable US economist Paul Krugman concludes his new book End This Depression Now! with the words of Christina Romer, Obama's former economic adviser: \"The evidence is stronger than it has ever been that fiscal policy matters \u2013 that fiscal stimulus helps the economy add jobs, and that reducing the budget deficit lowers growth at least in the near term.\" The point is not only that fiscal contraction should be eschewed in times of depression, but that, with the private sector not spending enough, the government should be using fiscal policy actively to offset private sector contraction.",

      "standfirst": "Spending \u00a3738m on football might annoy customers waiting for a fast internet connection, but BT thinks it can afford it", 
      "body": "<p>And now over to the football results read by James Alexander Gordon: Premier League footballers 1: BT and BSkyB shareholders 0. The \u00a33bn carve-up of the Premier League broadcast rights was a shock result that had footie fans cheering, but investors weeping into their cups of Bovril.</p> <p>The arrival of a formidable challenger to Sky in the shape of BT is to be welcomed, because competition will keep TV and broadband prices keen. But the telecoms provider's expensive foray into sports broadcasting will stick in the craw of the millions of households still waiting for a decent broadband connection.</p> <p>BT is writing a \u00a3738m cheque for 114&#xa0;games \u2013 nearly \u00a36.5m a match \u2013 which works out at roughly a third of the \u00a32.5bn it is spending to upgrade its creaking copper network to fibre for an increasingly internet-addicted customer base.</p> <p>That investment will mostly cover urban areas, the two thirds of UK homes that are easiest to reach and already have access to the most reliable broadband, as well an attractive alternative in the shape of Virgin Media's very fast cable network.</p> <p>But what of the households being left out in the cold? The government has earmarked public money to ensure that, within five years, 90% of the UK will have superfast broadband, with the final 10% guaranteed a basic 2Mb connection \u2013 enough for one computer to watch the BBC iPlayer.</p> <p>That pot of public money is just \u00a3530m, comfortably less than BT's football flutter, and the company has offered to match that when it wins contracts from local councils to carry out the work. Further sums may come from Europe. But there are already signs that this won't deliver the 2017 targets.</p> <p>On Friday morning, as the City was digesting the dramatic shift in Britain's pay-TV landscape by lopping points off BT's and Sky's share prices, Cumbria county council took a brave decision.</p> <p>Living in one of Britain's beauty spots has its disadvantages, and many Cumbrians are on the wrong side of the digital divide when it comes to broadband. The council has \u00a340m, including \u00a317m from the government pot, to get 90% of homes and businesses connected with speeds of 25Mb or more by 2015.</p> <p>BT and rival Japanese group Fujitsu have both submitted bids for the work. After months of deliberation, instead of declaring a winner, the council has very publicly sent them back to the drawing board. BT says it cannot afford to spend more on fibre, because even in urban areas the new cables will take 12&#xa0;years to turn a profit. Perhaps. But the football rights only last for three years, and experts at research firm <a href=\"http://www.endersanalysis.com/\" title=\"\">Enders Analysis</a> think it unlikely BT will make a return by 2016. Unless it can take more matches from Sky in the next auction, or dramatically increase the 700,000 subscribers to its BT Vision TV service, the sports channel will probably continue to make a loss.</p> <p>It's a pattern that bankrupted previous Sky challengers like Setanta, but with \u00a36bn a year in earnings, BT can afford to take the hit. And it argues that good TV content will help sell fibre. Bundle in 80Mb broadband with top-flight films and sport and you can reel them in.</p> <p>Ultimately, what BT has chosen to do is invest its money where the competition is. It is laying fibre in Virgin Media areas, and investing in TV in order to keep its own broadband customers from jumping ship to Sky.

      "bodyText": "And now over to the football results read by James Alexander Gordon: Premier League footballers 1: BT and BSkyB shareholders 0. The \u00a33bn carve-up of the Premier League broadcast rights was a shock result that had footie fans cheering, but investors weeping into their cups of Bovril. The arrival of a formidable challenger to Sky in the shape of BT is to be welcomed, because competition will keep TV and broadband prices keen. But the telecoms provider's expensive foray into sports broadcasting will stick in the craw of the millions of households still waiting for a decent broadband connection. BT is writing a \u00a3738m cheque for 114 games \u2013 nearly \u00a36.5m a match \u2013 which works out at roughly a third of the \u00a32.5bn it is spending to upgrade its creaking copper network to fibre for an increasingly internet-addicted customer base. That investment will mostly cover urban areas, the two thirds of UK homes that are easiest to reach and already have access to the most reliable broadband, as well an attractive alternative in the shape of Virgin Media's very fast cable network. But what of the households being left out in the cold? The government has earmarked public money to ensure that, within five years, 90% of the UK will have superfast broadband, with the final 10% guaranteed a basic 2Mb connection \u2013 enough for one computer to watch the BBC iPlayer. That pot of public money is just \u00a3530m, comfortably less than BT's football flutter, and the company has offered to match that when it wins contracts from local councils to carry out the work. Further sums may come from Europe. But there are already signs that this won't deliver the 2017 targets. On Friday morning, as the City was digesting the dramatic shift in Britain's pay-TV landscape by lopping points off BT's and Sky's share prices, Cumbria county council took a brave decision. Living in one of Britain's beauty spots has its disadvantages, and many Cumbrians are on the wrong side of the digital divide when it comes to broadband. The council has \u00a340m, including \u00a317m from the government pot, to get 90% of homes and businesses connected with speeds of 25Mb or more by 2015. BT and rival Japanese group Fujitsu have both submitted bids for the work. After months of deliberation, instead of declaring a winner, the council has very publicly sent them back to the drawing board. BT says it cannot afford to spend more on fibre, because even in urban areas the new cables will take 12 years to turn a profit. Perhaps. But the football rights only last for three years, and experts at research firm Enders Analysis think it unlikely BT will make a return by 2016. Unless it can take more matches from Sky in the next auction, or dramatically increase the 700,000 subscribers to its BT Vision TV service, the sports channel will probably continue to make a loss. It's a pattern that bankrupted previous Sky challengers like Setanta, but with \u00a36bn a year in earnings, BT can afford to take the hit. And it argues that good TV content will help sell fibre. Bundle in 80Mb broadband with top-flight films and sport and you can reel them in. Ultimately, what BT has chosen to do is invest its money where the competition is. It is laying fibre in Virgin Media areas, and investing in TV in order to keep its own broadband customers from jumping ship to Sky. In Cumbria, nobody is lining up to build a deluxe fibre network. The government has no plans to divert significant new sums into broadband before the next general election, despite the economic benefits that good internet access can bring. The argument from the ministers in charge, Jeremy Hunt and Ed Vaizey, is that the private sector will fill the gap.

      "bodyText": "The outgoing head of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, will warn the G20 summit that Europe runs the risk of sparking a Lehman-style global crisis that will have dire consequences for developing nations. As Greek voters go to the polls in elections that could determine the future of the eurozone, Zoellick told the Observer he was advising emerging nations to ready themselves for the consequences of events in the single-currency area. The election of an anti-austerity government would spark the most serious crisis for the euro so far, following the apparent failure of a Spanish bank bailout last week. German chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday ruled out renegotiating Greece's bailout, saying the country must stick to its deals with international lenders. Unofficial polls suggest the conservative New Democracy party is ahead of the anti-austerity Syriza by four percentage points \u2014 though as much as 15% of the electorate remains undecided. As all eyes focus on Athens, Zoellick said: \"Europe may be able to muddle through but the risk is rising.\" He added: \"There could be a Lehmans moment if things are not properly handled.\" The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 proved to be the trigger for the deepest slump in the global economy since the 1930s, and Zoellick said developing countries needed to \"prepare for the uncertainty coming out of the eurozone and the wider financial markets\". He added: \"It will be better if they can avoid piling up short-term debts that can come due in volatile periods and look to the fundamentals of future growth \u2013 infrastructure and human capital.\" Zoellick, whose five years at the bank has coincided with the financial and economic crisis, retires at the end of the month. Fearing that Europe's sovereign debt problems could have spillover effects, he said the bank had been increasing its lending to support Bulgaria's banking system and acting to prevent a credit crunch in south-east Europe. Steps were also being taken to protect countries in north Africa that were vulnerable to Europe's debt crisis and trade finance facilities were being strengthened for francophone west Africa. \"Uncertainty in markets is now starting to increase costs for developing countries,\" he said. \"The ripple effects are making everybody's life harder.\" Zoellick said his organisation was concentrating on helping developing countries to prepare projects that could go ahead with the right investment and to protect the most vulnerable if there was a second leg to the global downturn. \"Given the volatility in the world economy, there is a big emphasis on helping developing countries to develop social safety nets that don't bust the budget,\" he said. Countries such as Mexico and Brazil, he added, had shown they could do this using low-cost, effective targeting, information technology and the right incentives. While the World Bank's sister organisation, the IMF, has been more directly involved in the rescue operations for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, Zoellick said that the bank had been monitoring events in Europe carefully. Higher interest rates for countries such as Spain and Italy, which have announced big structural reform programmes, were the result both of market uncertainty and the failure of other European countries to provide \"the right backing\" for the governments in Madrid and Rome. As the former US trade representative, Zoellick said he was concerned that the prolonged crisis was starting to lead to pressures for protectionism and economic nationalism. \"This is not just an economic crisis but a political threat as well,\" he said. \"We must make sure we keep markets open and beware against creeping protectionism. We are starting to see some increase in the use of trade restrictions.\" Several European leaders urged Greeks to stick with the euro, including Spain's prime minister Mariano Rajoy and Jean-Claude Juncker, who is Luxembourg's prime minister and head of the group of eurozone finance ministers. \"If the radical left wins [in Greece] \u2013 which cannot be ruled out \u2013 the consequences for the currency union are unforeseeable,\" Juncker told the Austrian newspaper Kurier. \"I can only warn everyone against leaving the currency union. The internal cohesion of the euro zone would be in danger.\"",
