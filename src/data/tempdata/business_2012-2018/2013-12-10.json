Nathan Bostock, who was only promoted to the top finance position on 1 October, is understood to have quit to become deputy chief executive of the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander. It is a bank he knows well, having left Santander in 2009 to join RBS after its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. His resignation, which was discussed a meeting of the RBS board on Tuesday night, leaves a gap in a key management position and presents a problem for the new chief executive, Ross McEwan, himself only ten weeks into one of the most prominent roles in British banking. Bostock's arrival at Santander may fuel expectations that the flotation of the UK arm of the Spanish bank is back on the agenda \u2013 after being postponed in the aftermath of the banking crisis \u2013 and will fuel speculation that he could eventually be a candidate for the top job at the Spanish bank in the UK. At Santander, Bostock is also expected to take up the position of chief risk officer, as well as being deputy chief executive to Ana Botin. Santander has previously said it would reconsider the conditions for a flotation of the UK arm in late 2014. Santander was not immediately available to comment.

Bostock, a former head of restructuring at RBS, would also have been playing a key role in creating the mini 'bad bank' inside the bailed-out bank that was ordered by George Osborne. Bostock's departure comes as RBS faces criticism over IT systems failures that left customers unable to withdraw cash last week for three hours, and allegations about its treatment of small businesses. McEwan admitted that the bank had failed to invest properly in IT systems for decades after a computer glitch left customers of RBS and its NatWest subsidiary unable to use credit and debit cards on the busiest online shopping day of the year. McEwan will now be seeking to fill a number of key roles \u2013 Bostock's job as finance director, a head of the non-core division, and his own full-time replacement as head of the retail bank from which he was promoted when Stephen Hester was ousted in the summer.

Rio Tinto owns Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), the company which operates the Ranger mine in the Northern Territory, where a crack in a leach tank turned into a massive spill in the early hours of Saturday. ERA said it had completed its preliminary inspections and was satisfied the surrounding area was safe and Kakadu had not been contaminated, but there were still concerns in the scientific and Indigenous communities that rain had the potential to carry the contaminated slurry. On 3 December, a similar accident happened at Rossing, a mine in Namibia owned by Rio Tinto, with the company reporting a leach tank failed but it did not say how much of the radioactive slurry \u2013 which, like the Ranger spill, also contained acid \u2013 was spilled. It said some employees were treated at the scene for \u201cminor\u201d injuries and there was no environmental impact.

The year before, a review found the mine had been leaking 100,000 litres per day of contaminated water into fissures beneath Kakadu, although it has not been established where the leaked water went or what its effect on the environment would be.

    "webTitle": "Foxtons estate agents gains promotion to FTSE 250 index", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Foxtons, the estate agent that Londoners love to hate but cannot do without, is set to join the ranks of Britain's leading companies on Wednesday when it is promoted to the FTSE 250 index. Foxtons' elevation is the latest landmark in the rise, fall and rebirth of the notoriously aggressive chain, which has ridden the wave of London's housing market for more than 30 years. It also marks another peak in a property revival that is quietly concerning the Bank of England. With its fleet of liveried Minis, cafe-style branches and ruthless marketing tactics, Foxtons has divided opinion for decades. Some see its arrival in a community as the hallmark of gentrification \u2013 while others see it as the death knell for the neighbourhood. When Foxtons opened a branch this year in Brixton, which has steadily moved upmarket since the 1981 riots, someone spray-painted the word \"yuck\" on the window. The paint was cleaned off but, in case anyone missed the point, it was soon replaced by \"yuppies out\". Alan Piper, secretary of the Brixton Society, said Foxtons' arrival added to concerns about longtime residents being squeezed out by rising house prices. \"Foxtons is probably a symptom of that more than the cause, much as people like to hate them. Some of us thought the graffiti was understandable in the circumstances but we couldn't work out who did it.\" Foxtons has been held up as a prime example of the pushy practices of British estate agents \u2013 always among the least respected of trades. Its agents have been accused of pulling down rivals' signs and the company was fined in 2003 for \"flyboarding\" \u2013 putting up boards outside houses it was not selling. The chain's flotation document gave insights into how it goes about its business. When a new agent is hired, they are given the use of a brashly painted Foxtons Mini and can choose to earn a \u00a310,000 salary \u2013 less than the minimum wage \u2013 plus 10% commission or a \u00a317,500 salary plus 5% commission. This, the prospectus said, \"encourages a positive culture of competition among its employees to deliver its premium service offering\". The price for that service is a non-negotiable 2.5% as the sole agent on a house sale compared with an average of about 1.5%. Foxtons was founded by Jon Hunt, who had a spell in the army and worked at another estate agent before opening in a converted cafe in Notting Hill in 1981. At the time the area was rundown, despite its closeness to upmarket Kensington, but it gentrified and Hunt began expanding into other London hotspots. A major plank of Hunt's growth drive was his offer of zero commission for sellers in the first three months after opening \u2013 a tactic Foxtons still uses to gain an early foothold in a market. But the ploy is also at the heart of one of the accusations against the firm: that it lures sellers by giving inflated valuations and ties them in until they drop the price \u2013 still paying Foxtons' premium fee. The manager of a rival, long-established estate agent in Enfield, where Foxtons opened this year, said: \"I know of more than a handful of people who successfully moved without paying an agent's fee and that's great for them. \"But what I'm finding is they fundamentally overvalue. It's as old as the hills. I was valuing a house just the other day and the client showed me all the valuations he had been given. They were all around the \u00a3350,000 mark \u2013 except for one at \u00a3390,000. It was almost comical.\" The manager's claims have not been independently verified. But Foxtons' business methods have also been highly successful and have shaken up the industry. Its branches open 362 days a year, 12 hours a day and it was an online trailblazer in the late 1990s. By 2007, the firm had 20 branches and business was thriving as house prices boomed. Hunt sold the company to private equity firm BC Partners in May 2007, making him about \u00a3360m. Two months later, the housing market froze as the financial crisis loomed. Some said Hunt's timing showed he was a genius, though he rejected this. He now spends his time restoring the beauty of a 1,800-hectare (4,500-acre) estate in Suffolk while developing property. But Foxtons was saddled with big debts in a dead market. Michael Brown, now in charge, set about cutting costs and by 2010 Foxtons was expanding again with five branch openings. The firm floated in September at 230p, giving it a value of \u00a3649m. Brown, whose stake was valued at about \u00a352m at float, remains in charge. On Tuesday night the shares were 294p and the \u00a3830m market value put Foxtons firmly on track to enter the FTSE 250. Just as Hunt sold when the market was booming, so the flotation was made possible by the sudden revival of house prices, especially in London. But some economists warn that rapid price gains are the sign of a pre-election bubble fuelled by the chancellor's Help to Buy scheme and near-zero interest rates. Danny Gabay of Fathom Consulting said prices have been too high since 2000 and that London prices are 70% above their long-term sustainable rate Gabay said: \"The debate about whether we are in a new property bubble is nonsensical. We never got out of the old one. \"Let the good times roll for them [Foxtons]. It's a great time to be an estate agent but how long can it last? My guess is until about May 2015 [the date of the next general election].\" The good times are rolling at Foxtons. Last month's trading statement said turnover in the third quarter was up 18% from a year earlier with property sale revenue up 29%. Analysts at Credit Suisse, one of the two leading investment banks on Foxtons' float, argued the company was undervalued. First, they said the housing market was in good health with low interest rates making mortgages affordable and loan approvals rising. Second, they said Foxtons' disciplined culture would keep it ahead of the pack as it expanded in London and elsewhere in the South East. Henry Pryor, who negotiates house purchases for upmarket buyers, said Foxtons was still as aggressive as ever but that its negotiators knew their job. \"I haven't always approved of all their methods but I never have any doubt who they are working for and that is the seller. \"The fact that their brand has risen and fallen like the tide of the Thames means they have racked up their fair share of critics but there's no law saying you have to sell through an estate agent and you only have to look what they've achieved.\" Foxtons declined to comment for this article.",

      "body": "<p>Foxtons, the estate agent that Londoners love to hate but cannot do without, is set to join the ranks of Britain's leading companies on Wednesday when it is promoted to the FTSE 250 index.</p> <p>Foxtons' elevation is the latest landmark in the rise, fall and rebirth of the notoriously aggressive chain, which has ridden the wave of London's housing market for more than 30 years.</p> <p>It also marks another peak in a property revival that is quietly concerning the Bank of England.</p> <p>With its fleet of liveried Minis, cafe-style branches and ruthless marketing tactics, Foxtons has divided opinion for decades. Some see its arrival in a community as the hallmark of gentrification \u2013 while others see it as the death knell for the neighbourhood.</p> <p>When Foxtons opened a branch this year in Brixton, which has steadily moved upmarket since the 1981 riots, someone spray-painted the word \"yuck\" on the window. The paint was cleaned off but, in case anyone missed the point, it was soon replaced by \"yuppies out\".</p> <p>Alan Piper, secretary of the Brixton Society, said Foxtons' arrival added to concerns about longtime residents being squeezed out by rising house prices.</p> <p>\"Foxtons is probably a symptom of that more than the cause, much as people like to hate them. Some of us thought the graffiti was understandable in the circumstances but we couldn't work out who did it.\"</p> <p>Foxtons has been held up as a prime example of the pushy practices of British estate agents \u2013 always among the least respected of trades. Its agents have been accused of pulling down rivals' signs and the company was fined in 2003 for \"flyboarding\" \u2013 putting up boards outside houses it was not selling.</p> <p>The chain's flotation document gave insights into how it goes about its business. When a new agent is hired, they are given the use of a brashly painted Foxtons Mini and can choose to earn a \u00a310,000 salary \u2013 less than the minimum wage \u2013 plus 10% commission or a \u00a317,500 salary plus 5% commission.</p> <p>This, the prospectus said, \"encourages a positive culture of competition among its employees to deliver its premium service offering\". The price for that service is a non-negotiable 2.5% as the sole agent on a house sale compared with an average of about 1.5%.</p> <p>Foxtons was founded by Jon Hunt, who had a spell in the army and worked at another estate agent before opening in a converted cafe in Notting Hill in 1981. At the time the area was rundown, despite its closeness to upmarket Kensington, but it gentrified and Hunt began expanding into other London hotspots.</p> <p>A major plank of Hunt's growth drive was his offer of zero commission for sellers in the first three months after opening \u2013 a tactic Foxtons still uses to gain an early foothold in a market.</p> <p>But the ploy is also at the heart of one of the accusations against the firm: that it lures sellers by giving inflated valuations and ties them in until they drop the price \u2013 still paying Foxtons' premium fee.</p> <p>The manager of a rival, long-established estate agent in Enfield, where Foxtons opened this year, said: \"I know of more than a handful of people who successfully moved without paying an agent's fee and that's great for them.</p> <p>\"But what I'm finding is they fundamentally overvalue.

To the sceptics who say such medium-term ambitions should be taken with a pinch of salt, especially when they rely on continued strong growth in already-strong Asia, the Pru could make two counter-arguments. First, that the last set of comparable targets, which covered 2011-13, have been met, or are being met. The group has achieved five and the sixth should be secured this financial year. What's more, none looked to be a breeze back in December 2010, when its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, was obliged to woo shareholders with a decent self-improvement story after they gave a thumbs-down to his \u00a324bn pursuit of the AIA group. The share price has almost doubled since then. Second, the Pru, as ever, is making the case that investors should study the fundamentals of the high-growth Asian markets. Thiam's now-familiar charts on the growth of the middle-class in Asia tell the tale: this body of people numbered 525 million in 2009 and the projections are for 1.74 billion by 2020 and 3.23 billion by 2030.

      "bodyText": "Tesco's UK strategy has been slammed in an outspoken note by a US stockbroker that claims the retailer has put up prices faster than any other British grocer while its non-food ranges are more expensive than those at John Lewis. Britain's largest supermarket chain's prices are now closer to Sainsbury's than Asda, according to Bruno Monteyne, a senior retail analyst at Bernstein. Monteyne, a former Tesco executive, said: \"Tesco is now in an impossible position: it is neither value nor quality, it is simply everywhere, and can't compete with either the quality or value retailers.\" Tesco said it rejected Monteyne's claims about its pricing. A spokesman said: \"We compete very hard on price and quality to give customers the value they want from Tesco.\" But Monteyne also claimed Tesco has focused too much on putting down new space both at home at abroad while losing its lead in terms of consumers' perception of its breadth of ranges and continues to be seen as poor on fresh food and bakery. Monteyne's analysis follows a dismal trading statement last week in which Tesco revealed that underlying sales fell by 1.5% at the end of November. The supermarket has been losing market share to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl as well as more upmarket stores such as Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer as the UK food market becomes increasingly divided. Tesco's performance overseas is also poor, with underlying sales falling in every international market. Monteyne says these stores have been too centrally controlled from the UK \"heavily dependent on a small group of people sitting in a room thousands of miles from the actual operations.\" Monteyne's Tesco career included a spell as its supply chain director in Asia.",

      "bodyText": "There were fresh warnings on Tuesday night that the UK's economic recovery was too reliant on hard-pressed consumers after official data showed exports falling. The figures for October showed production at British factories continued to rise but Britain's trade deficit remained stubbornly high despite the government's push to rebalance the economy. Overall, manufacturing output rose 0.4% from September, matching forecasts from City economists who had expected some slowdown from growth of 1.2% a month earlier. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said output also rose 0.4% in the wider industrial sector, which includes mining, oil and gas extraction and utilities such as water supply. That was just ahead of forecasts for 0.3% growth but again down from September, when output rose 0.9%. However, separate data from the ONS showed Britain's trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed less than expected. \"October's figures on industrial production and trade offered some good news for the government's oft-proclaimed ambition for an economy more biased towards manufacturing. But, on the external side, the picture remains weak,\" said Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics. \"For now, the UK's economic recovery looks like remaining a distinctly domestic affair.\" The industrial data follows a series of buoyant surveys on the UK economy suggesting businesses are generally becoming more confident about the recovery and are hiring more staff to keep up with growing orders. The ONS said that in annual terms, industrial output grew at its fastest pace since January 2011, rising 3.2%. The growth in the industrial sector helped nudge estimates for the overall economy higher in the latest assessment from respected thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). It reckons GDP grew by 0.8% in the three months ending in November after growth of 0.7% in the three months ending in October. \"Our estimates suggest that the recent pattern of broad-based sectoral growth has continued,\" the group said. The ONS data suggested that within manufacturing much of the strength continued to come from the car industry. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said although the figures showed the economy continued growing into the final quarter of the year they highlighted the economic challenges that still remained. \"Though manufacturing is recovering, output is almost 9% below its pre-crisis level. We still have a large trade deficit and not enough progress is being made to rebalance the economy towards net exports,\" he said. The trade data came days after the government's independent forecasters revised down the contribution they expect net trade to make to the economy. In its latest outlook alongside chancellor George Osborne's autumn statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility said much of the UK recovery was still being driven by consumers. Echoing economists' concerns about exports remaining subdued, the ONS said the UK's deficit on trade in goods was \u00a39.7bn in October. That was \u00a30.4bn lower than in September but bigger than the \u00a39.35bn forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Against the backdrop of ongoing uncertainty in the UK's key export market, exports to the European Union fell 3.8% and the deficit on trade in goods with the EU was at a record \u00a36.5bn.",

In this agenda there is no place for retreating into nationalism and protectionism. We know better than this and should stay focused on the key reform priorities: completing the banking union, implementing growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, and structural reforms in labour and product markets. I have little doubt that all these reforms are beneficial and trust-enhancing, even though some of them may be opposed by vested interests or entail adjustment costs in the short term.</p> <p>Our common responsibility for the euro area strengthens the case for reform. As I said recently in Berlin, it is never the case that sound economic policies are good for some in the euro area but not for others, even though they are sometimes portrayed in that way.</p> <p>A great deal of progress has been made, but more needs to come. Let me conclude by again quoting Curzio: \u201cThe EMS crisis could have marked the end of EMU. Instead, it sparked efforts to acquire sufficient institutional capital to support confidence in the new European currency\u201d (p. 213). The crisis has identified some weaknesses in our European construction.

What was behind the production pick-up? Very likely resilient export demand and the continuation of re-stocking, the two sources of demand which are expected to lift the Italian economy out of technical recession already in 4Q13.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>In conclusion, the ING predicts that Italian GDP will rise by 0.2% in Q4, officially exiting recession.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52a6ebbce4b08659a9046edd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-10T10:59:45.480Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Official: Italian economy didn't shrink in Q3</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6971f106-fb98-4f41-b35a-382310feca5e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/12/9/1386606549937/MDG--Traffic-chokes-the-r-009.jpg\" alt=\"MDG : Traffic chokes the roads outside the Lateran Palace on Piazza di San Giovanni in Rome\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lateran Palace on Piazza di San Giovanni in Rome.

      "bodyText": "The latest word from Brussels is that EU ministers are battling to reach an agreement on rules for how failed banks will be handled. Lots of redrafting is going on, so a deal (if it comes) might not come until late tonight: (that's Brussels time). So I\"m going to wrap up here. Your best plan to keep up with events in Brussels is probably Peter Spiegel's twitter page: http://www.twitter.com/spiegelpeter #collegiate And keep watching our site for developments on the Volcker Rule (fastFT are also on the case). A reminder of the key points; Christine Lagarde has called for more action to stimulate growth in Europe, saying the crisis isn't over until the jobless crisis is resolved. In the UK, manufacturing output is up -- but the trade deficit remains high. And the NEISR thinktank reckons the economy grew by 0.8% in the last three months. Italy is also on the brink of leaving recession, after its GDP reading for Q3 was revised up from a -0.1% contraction to 0.0%. But French industrial production fell. Mario Draghi urged action on European Banking Union (are you listening in Brussels?) Wall Street regulators, including the Fed, have been approving new rules to restrict US banks engaging in risky trading with their own money. GM has named Mary Barra as its next CEO, making her the first woman to ever run a major auto firm. And jitters over the prospect of the Fed tapering its bond purchase programme next week helped push Europe's stock market down. I'll be back tomorrow. Goodnight. A limp day's trading has ended in Europe with losses across the main indices, FTSE 100: down 36 points at 6523, -0.55% German DAX: down 80 points at 9114, -0.88% French CAC: down 42 points at 4091, -1% Spanish IBEX: down 49 points at 9438, -0.5% Italian FTSE MIB: down 48 points at 18236, -0.27% It's been another day of fretting about whether the Federal Reserve will start to taper its bond purchases next week, as Brenda Kelly of IG explains: The residual positivity from the US equity closes this morning has worn off, as investors look ahead to the rest of the week and the economic releases that may potentially cement even a small scaling back of asset purchases this month. The FTSE has benefitted from a minor flight to safety as caution creeps in, outperforming other European benchmarks today. In London, gold and silver miners Randgold Resources (+4%) and Fresnillo (+1.8%) -- Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains that \"that gold and silver prices jumped sharply on the back of a weaker US dollar and short covering demand\". Here's Nick Fletcher's closing market report: Randgold and Fresnillo fly after gold and silver prices recover A third regulator , the SEC, has approved the Volcker Rule: SEC chair Mary Jo White said she \"strongly\" supports the goal of the rule, to \"eliminate short term financial speculation\" in institutions that benefited from taxpayer help when the crisis began. FastFT flags up that Fed chair-in-waiting, Janet Yellen, did raise concerns over the Volcker Rule -- concerned that reining in Wall Street banks from speculative trading in some assets could disadvantage them, or suck liquidity out of the financial markets. But the Fed backed it. In America, progress in bringing in the Volcker Rule to keep Wall Street firms in line has been hampered by some large snow falls on the East Coast. Despite that, the Federal Reserve's board of governors has just approved the plan -- which restricts banks from making risky traders with their own money. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had already given its approval around 30 minutes ago. Five regulators were due to vote on the plan today -- under the final version, banks will be given until 2015 to comply. Reuters helpfully snapped the key points earlier: 10-Dec-2013 14:30 - VOLCKER RULE TO CURB PROPRIETARY TRADING WOULD REQUIRE BIGGEST BANKS\u2019 CEOS TO ATTEST TO BANKS\u2019 COMPLIANCE-U.S. REGULATORS 10-Dec-2013 14:30 - FEDERAL RESERVE EXTENDS VOLCKER RULE COMPLIANCE PERIOD TO JULY 2015 FROM JULY 2014 - FINAL VOLCKER RULE DOCUMENT 10-Dec-2013 14:30 - RULE WOULD ALLOW MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES WHEN TRADING DESK\u2019S INVENTORY IS DESIGNED NOT TO EXCEED REASONABLE NEAR-TERM DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS 10-Dec-2013 14:30 - RULE WOULD ALLOW HEDGING ACTIVITY THAT MITIGATES \u201cSPECIFIC, IDENTIFIABLE RISKS OF INDIVIDUAL OR AGGREGATED POSITIONS\u201d HELD BY THE BANK - REGULATORS 10-Dec-2013 14:30 - BANKS COULD ENGAGE IN PROPRIETARY TRADING OF US GOVERNMENT DEBT AND, IN MORE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, FOREIGN OBLIGATIONS UNDER VOLCKER RULE 10-Dec-2013 14:30 - VOLCKER RULE ALSO BANS BANKS FROM OWNING AND SPONSORING \u201cCOVERED\u201d HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS - REGULATORS 10-Dec-2013 14:30 - REGULATORS SAY FINAL RULE DEFINES \u201cCOVERED FUNDS\u201d MORE NARROWLY THAN PROPOSAL WITH REGARD TO FOREIGN FUNDS AND COMMODITY POOLS 10-Dec-2013 14:30 - U.S. REGULATORS SAY MOST COMMUNITY BANKS HAVE LITTLE OR NO INVOLVEMENT IN PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES, WOULD NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH RULES It's become something of a journalistic cliche to declare that Matteo Renzi, freshly elected as leader of Italy's Democratic Party, is the new Tony Blair (I committed it only yesterday, and might well do it again tomorrow). The FT's Janan Ganesh argues, though, that Renzi should aim to follow the example of another centre-left leader, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who made sweeping changes to German's labour market and welfare state a decade ago. Not that the voters thanked Schr\u00f6der for it in 2005..... Back in Brussels, European finance ministers are struggling to reach agreement on new rules to underpin banking union. Lithuania (which holds the EU presidency), tweets that they've adjourned until 6pm (5pm GMT) while technical teams work on new proposals for how failing European banks would be handled. That's the \"Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive\" and the Single Resolution Mechanism. The European press pack are hunkering down.... Confirmation that Mary Barra's appointment to become the first female boss of a car firm is a big deal -- from Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe: General Motors, America\u2019s largest car manufacturer, has named Mary Barra its chief executive, making her the first woman to head a major auto firm. Barra\u2019s appointment was announced Tuesday, a day after the US government sold off its last stake in the auto giant. The daughter of a GM worker, Barra joined the company at 18 and is currently its global head of product development. Michelle Krebs, a veteran auto analyst at Edmunds.com, said the move was a major victory for women in the auto industry. \u201cMy first comment to colleagues was: \u2018Holy shit!\u2019 I honestly didn\u2019t think this would happen in my lifetime.\u201d More here: Mary Barra named GM CEO to become America's first female car chief Barely five months after being welcomed into the community of EU nations, Croatia has been told that its finances are too flaky. The European Commission has just announced that it is opening an excessive deficit procedure against Croatia. It has concluded that Croatia won't hit the EC's target of 3% of GDP within three years, without cutting spending or raising taxes. The EC said: According to notified data, Croatia's general government deficit reached 5% of GDP in 2012, and total government debt amounted to 55.5% of GDP. In the draft 2014 budget adopted on 4 December, the Croatian Government envisages that the deficit will stay above 3% of GDP over the entire period 2013-2016. Here's the press release. Some reaction to NIESR's forecast that UK GDP rose by 0. 8% in the last three months: Just in: The UK economy grew by 0.8% in the three months to November, according to the NIESR think tank in its latest monthly estimate of UK output. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research predicted that the pace of Britain's recovery is continuing in the final quarter of this year, after the economy also grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2013 (July-September). A month ago, NIESR predicted growth of 0.7% in August - October, so today's forecast suggests the pace picked up in November. It said: Our estimates suggest that the recent pattern of broad based sectoral growth has continued. These robust rates of growth are consistent with a gradual narrowing of the UK\u2019s negative output gap. However, NEISR still believes that Britain's economy won't reach its pre-crisis peak (of 2008) until 2015. The recession is over, but the \"period of depression\" will probably continue for another year. And NEISR also reproduced its graph showing how this recovery is still the weakest in at least a century, despite the UK's official forecaster hiking its predictions for growth this year and in 2014. Wall Street has opened for business. It's another quiet start, with the main indices dropping around 0.2% -- the Dow is down 30 points at 15,995. Twitter, though, jumped 3% to a new record high. Marketwatch says there's optimism over a new advertising targeting tool which the micro-blogging site launched last week. General Motors has chosen its first ever female boss in its 100+ year history by appointing Mary Barra as its next chief executive. It also, we - and Bloomberg - reckon, makes her the first woman to run any major automotive company (shout if you think we're wrong) Barra, currently executive vice president of global product development (the first woman to do that job at GM as well) takes over next month. GM also explained that Dan Akerson, who is 65, is retiring several months early because his wife was recently diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer. Here's the full statement. There's a good profile of Barra on Businessweek, from June this year, explaining that she's worked for the company for more than three decades. She reformed GM's HR operation before being handed the role of chief product officer: Here's a flavour: Barra, 51, comes across as measured and standard-issue corporate, the opposite of swaggering. Rather than brag about the awesome torque of the new Corvette, she talks about \u201cdriving an organization that\u2019s customer focused.\u201d She considered buying a restored Chevrolet Camaro a few years ago but hasn\u2019t, in part because, says a confidante, it would be a dangerous temptation for her teenage son. She\u2019s a corporate survivor who\u2019s played a role in the soap opera of GM management for a generation, emerging on a very public stage as the leader of the company\u2019s $15 billion vehicle development operations, a role that will largely determine the success or failure of the company for a decade or more. I'll pop a link to Christine Lagarde's speech soon, but in the meantime Matina Stevis of the WSJ is tweeting some of the key points from Brussels: IMF chief Christine Lagarde is warning that more needs to be done to fix Europe's economic problems. Lagarde is giving a speech to the European Economic &amp; Social Committee in Brussels now. She's citing Europe's youth unemployment crisis as a sign that, while Europe is \"turning the corner\", there is much more to be done. Behind the positive headlines, she says, \"there are clearly signs that all is not well\" in Europe. Growth and output rates are too low, and are also unbalanced across the region. And Europe also doesn't provide enough demand for its own products. But Lagarde was most pointed in her comments about youth unemployment, which hit a new record high of 24.4% in the euro area. She said: Can a crisis really be over when 12% of the labour force is without a job? When unemployment among the youth is in very high double digits, reaching more than 50% in Greece and Spain? And when there is no sign that it is becoming easier for people to pay down their debts?\" And also pointed to the long-term cost of creating a generation without the skills to succeed in the labour market: \"What is at stake is Europe's potential for growth in the future,\". Lagarde went on to propose a four-point solution: better credit flow (by cleaning up weak banks) supporting demand (through loose monetary policy, and possibly more accommodative fiscal policy) reducing households, firms and government debt (through fiscal consolidation, better private sector debt restructuring, and by putting the bill for future bank rescues on creditors, not taxpayers) Making markets more growth-friendly (through labour reforms, lower direct taxes on employees and increasing competition across borders) Here's the full story: Youth unemployment could prolong eurozone crisis, Christine Lagarde say Tesco may have just crossed research firm Bernstein off its Christmas card list, after the company's analysts laid into its business model. Bernstein gave Tesco two criticisms for the price of one, saying: Tesco is not value, not quality, just everywhere. Tesco is now in an impossible position: it is neither value nor quality and can't compete with either the quality or value retailers. From being within 1% of Asda's prices, the gap is now 5% to 9%. My colleague Nick Fletcher reports: Tesco dips after downbeat broker note And Steve Hawkes of the Telegraph tweets: EU finance ministers are still deliberating over plans for banking union in Brussels, having taken a brief break at 1pm CET to remember Nelson Mandela: Unemployment across the 34 mainly rich countries which make up the OECD remained flat at 7.9% in October, but the eurozone's jobs market was much weaker. In a new report today, the OECD said: In the euro area, the unemployment rate decreased by 0.1 percentage point to 12.1% in October, the first decline since February 2011. This mainly reflected a decline in the unemployment rate in France for the first time since March 2011 (by 0.2 percentage point to 10.9%) while unemployment rates remained unchanged in Germany and Italy, at 5.2% and 12.5%, respectively. The unemployment rate was stable in Japan (at 4.0%) in October and it decreased in Mexico (by 0.1 percentage point to 4.9%). In the United States, the unemployment rate increased (by 0.1 percentage point to 7.3%), but more recent data show that it decreased in November 2013 (by 0.3 percentage point to 7.0%), while it remained stable in Canada during the same period(at 6.9 %). There's also a handy chart showing how euro area unemployment rose rapidly once the eurozone crisis began. Sky News's Ed Conway sets a simple challenge: My colleague Katie Allen has analysed the latest UK trade and manufacturing data, and explains that there's little signs that Britain is rebalancing: Production at British factories continued to rise in October but exports fell, according to official data that will temper optimism about the recovery. Overall, manufacturing output rose 0.4% from September, matching forecasts from City economists who had expected some slowdown from growth of 1.2% in September. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said output also rose 0.4% in the wider industrial sector, which includes mining, oil and gas extraction and utilities like water supply. That was just ahead of forecasts for 0.3% growth but again down from September, when output rose 0.9%. However, separate data from the ONS showed Britain's trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed less than expected, dealing another blow to government hopes of rebalancing the economy towards external demand and away from its reliance on domestic consumers. \"October's figures on industrial production and trade offered some good news for the government's oft-proclaimed ambition for an economy more biased towards manufacturing. But, on the external side, the picture remains weak,\" said Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics. \"For now, the UK's economic recovery looks like remaining a distinctly domestic affair.\" Manufacturing boosts UK industry but exports weaker ECB president Mario Draghi has repeated his call for European governments to agree banking union and make the structural reforms needed to put the eurozone on a firmer footing. Speaking in Rome at an event in memory of the economist Curzio Giannini, Draghi declared\" We need to continue and further strengthen the financial sector reform agenda and build more resilience in the financial system. While our knowledge to fine-tune the financial cycle may be limited, the financial system must be made more robust to shocks by, for example, increasing capital and liquidity buffers. As Don Kohn recently said, \u201cWe may not be able to make better drivers, but we can make cars and roads safer to reduce damage when accidents happen\u201d. The creation of a banking union and the comprehensive assessment leading up to it are essential steps in improving the governance of the financial sector in the euro area and increasing its resilience. The comments on banking union are particularly timely, with EU finance ministers discussing the issue in Brussels as he spoke (see opening post). Draghi also talked about the importance of central banks maintaining the public's trust -- his answer is to stick firmly to your mandate. Draghi also spoke about how the European reform agenda has been put on \"a new footing\" since the dark days of the eurozone crisis two winters ago. Here's his conclusion: It is now crucial to complete this agenda at the European and national level. In this agenda there is no place for retreating into nationalism and protectionism. We know better than this and should stay focused on the key reform priorities: completing the banking union, implementing growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, and structural reforms in labour and product markets. I have little doubt that all these reforms are beneficial and trust-enhancing, even though some of them may be opposed by vested interests or entail adjustment costs in the short term. Our common responsibility for the euro area strengthens the case for reform. As I said recently in Berlin, it is never the case that sound economic policies are good for some in the euro area but not for others, even though they are sometimes portrayed in that way. A great deal of progress has been made, but more needs to come. Let me conclude by again quoting Curzio: \u201cThe EMS crisis could have marked the end of EMU. Instead, it sparked efforts to acquire sufficient institutional capital to support confidence in the new European currency\u201d (p. 213). The crisis has identified some weaknesses in our European construction. But I am convinced, like Curzio, that together we will be able to repair these weaknesses and emerge from the crisis with a stronger Europe. The speech is online here. Paolo Pizzoli of ING says that Italy is getting close to exiting recession, following the news that Italian GDP did not fall in the last quarter as initially thought. Pizzoli commented: The demand breakdown, previously undisclosed, provides some surprises. Private consumption and gross fixed capital formation subtracted 0.1% each from quarterly growth, broadly confirming expectations. The positive contribution coming from net exports (0.4%) was more of a surprise, with in addition a stronger than expected acceleration in stock building, which provided a 0.6% positive contribution to quarterly growth. Pizzoli is also encouraged by the earlier news that Italian industrial production rose by 0.5% in October (see 9.11am) -- calling it \"a good start\" to the current quarter. The improvement was widespread, involving consumer goods (+0.8% month-on-month), investment goods (+0.5% MoM) and intermediate goods (+0.6% MoM), with the sole exception of the volatile energy component (-0.9% MoM ). What was behind the production pick-up? Very likely resilient export demand and the continuation of re-stocking, the two sources of demand which are expected to lift the Italian economy out of technical recession already in 4Q13. In conclusion, the ING predicts that Italian GDP will rise by 0.2% in Q4, officially exiting recession. Italy's economy has stopped contracting after two years of austerity-driven decline, according to new official data released this morning. The Italian statistics office has revised up its estimate for the Italian economy's performance in the third quarter of this year. Instead of a 0.1% drop in GDP, it believes output was flat at 0.0%. That means that after eight quarters of contraction, the Italian economy has now reached stagnation. It's a welcome sign, given the wider eurozone grew by a paltry 0.1% in the July-September quarter. However, an ISTAT spokesman said (via Reuters): From a technical point of view this data is not sufficient to say the recession is over. And ISTAT are right to be cautious. This morning's data also shows that companies stockpiled more goods in their inventories during the quarter, while exports, demand, consumption and government spending all fell. Here's the details: Final domestic demand: -0.2% Final national consumption: -0.1% Consumer spending: -0.1% Government spending: 0.0 % Gross Fixed Investment: -0.1% Inventory Changes: 0.6% Net Exports: -0.4% GDP: 0.0% Today's revisions mean the Italian economy is still 1.8% smaller than a year ago. Recovery is a long way back... Britain's record-breaking goods deficit with the EU (a new all-time high of \u00a36.5bn in October) is partly due to the gap with Germany, which got a little wider last month. While exports to Germany rose by \u00a329m, to \u00a32.46bn, imports increased by \u00a369m to \u00a34.77bn. More charts from the ONS report: And here's the key charts, showing how the UK's overall trade balance has remained stubbornly in deficit for the last year: And there's also been little progress in narrowing the UK's deficit in goods trading: Less encouraging news: Britain's deficit in trading goods with the rest of the world fell in October, but by less than economists expected. The UK's global goods trade balance came in at -\u00a39.732bn, compared with -\u00a310.099bn in September. The City expected a reading of -\u00a39.35bn. Britain's made a \u00a37.1bn surplus on services, though, so the UK deficit came in at -\u00a32.619bn, compared with -\u00a32.644bn the previous month. The deficit in goods trading with the European Union rose to almost \u00a36.5bn, a record high (up from \u00a36.2bn in September). The ONS explains: In October 2013, exports of goods to countries within the EU decreased by \u00a30.5 billion to \u00a312.1 billion. Over the same period imports of goods from the EU decreased by \u00a30.2 billion to \u00a318.5 billion. This means that the overall trade in goods balance with the EU reached a record deficit of \u00a36.5 billion. Britain's deficit in trading goods with the rest of the world fell, though, to -\u00a33.254bn, from -\u00a33.892bn. Charts to follow.... Today's data means UK industrial production rose by the fastest annual rate in almost three years. The Office for National Statistics reported: Total production output in October 2013 increased by 3.2% compared with October 2012, the highest growth since January 2011. This increase reflected rises in three of the four main components of the index. Manufacturing increased by 2.7%, the highest growth since May 2011, and contributed 1.9 percentage points; mining &amp; quarrying increased by 13.4% and contributed 1.4 percentage points; and water supply, sewerage &amp; waste management increased by 8.8% and contributed 0.8 percentage points to the increase in the IoP. These rises were partially offset by a decrease in electricity, gas, steam &amp; air-conditioning output of 9.9%, which contributed 0.9 percentage points. Encouraging news: output across Britain's factories rose last month. Industrial output increased by 0.4% in October, and the narrower measure of manufacturing output also increased by 0.4%. This means UK manufacturing output is 2.7% higher than a year ago, while industrial production is up a hefty 3.2% compared to October 2012. Finance ministers have gathered in Brussels for today's Ecofin meeting -- here's a snap of Spain's Luis de Guindos (left), Sweden's Anders Borg (middle) and Portugul's Maria Luis Albuquerque (right) chatting before the start. A quiet start to trading in Europe, with the FTSE 100 just up 2 points (0.03%), the DAX up 17 points (+0.2%), and the French CAC gaining just 4 points (0.1%). Trader seem reluctant to take many big bets ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, where it will decide whether or not to start slowing its QE bond-buying programme now. Markets traditionally rally in the run-up to Christmas, as Jonathan Roy, sales trader at London Stone Securities, explains: People are being a bit more cautious, no one is really taking big positions. After a bit of a bounce on Friday we have come to a point where people are very reluctant to sell out given the historical Santa (Christmas) rally, but they are also reluctant to buy given the Fed meeting next week. Better news from Italy -- Industrial production rose by 0.5% month-on-month in October That shows a pick-up from September, when output rose by 0.2%. Output is still 0.5% smaller on a year-on-year basis, though. But encouragingly, most sectors grew -- with energy production the big faller. Here's ISTAT's breakdown of Italian industry in October: Consumer goods +0.8% Investment goods +0.5% Intermediate goods +0.6% Energy goods -0.9% In the corporate world, Whitbread reported decent sales growth at its Costa Coffee and Premier Inns operations this morning. Like-for-like revenue at Premier Inn rose 5.4% in the 13 weeks to the end of November, which may indicate economic activity picking up. And Costa remains a hot performer, with sales up 4.9%. The firm has opened 152 new Costas since February, and is planning another 300 in the next year, as its battle with Starbucks continues. Back in April, a survey suggested that Costa was benefitting from the row over its US rival's tax affairs. Today's statement is here. We learned overnight that the Greek government still hopes to receive its next aid loan before the end of the year, even though a deal with its international lenders remains elusive. Negotiations with the Troika appear deadlocked, with Eurogroup chief Jerorn Dijsselbloem telling reporters last night that: Realistically, it's going to be very very hard, if not impossible, to finalise this review before this year's end, so the final work will have to be done on that in January. Commissioner Olli Rehn agreed, saying that the full troika team will only return to Athens in January. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras, though, told CNBC he hopes that the next payment of \u20ac1bn could be handed over before January. The FT's Peter Speigel tweeted the key points from last night's press conference: While EU finance ministers worry about dealing with failed banks, US regulators are due to rubber stamp new rules to keep Wall Street in check today. Reuters reports: The Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, who championed the reform, prohibits banks from betting on financial markets with their own money, a practice known as proprietary trading. The rule, which has now mushroomed into 800 pages, will also bar them from owning more than 3% of hedge funds or private equity funds. The final version of the crackdown is expected to be tougher than when it was proposed two years ago, after the activities of the 'London Whale' pushed JPMorgan Chase to a $6bn (\u00a33.64bn) loss in 2012, highlighting the perils of speculative trading. More here: US set to adopt Volcker rule to curb banks' risky trading We've already had some weak economic news, from France. French industrial production fell by 0.3% month-on-month in October, worse than the 0.1% growth economists expected, and matching the 0.3% decline seen in September. On a better note, though, the French manufacturing sector grew by 0.4% after shrinking by 0.5% the previous month -- but it still 1.1% smaller than a year ago. Statistics body INSEE reported: Output increased in the manufacture of transport equipment (+2.6%). Meanwhile, output decreased slightly in other manufacturing (\u20130.2%) and in the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment; machine equipment (\u20130.2%). Moreover, it slumped by 14.3% in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products. The full report is online here. I've lifted the key charts. Weak industrial production will add to concerns over the strength of the French economy, which contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2013. Europe is only making slow progress towards a full banking union to fend off a repeat of the financial crisis, points out Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank. From his morning note to clients: The key remaining question is who in the EU will in the future decide on bank resolution and the use of the future centralised resolution fund. Germany has argued that to have the EU Commission take the decisions, a treaty change would be needed, meaning effectively it would be impossible. Germany had suggested to use a network of national supervisors. The FT reports that Germany and France made progress towards a compromise, which would open up the way for a deal at the summit next week. The resolution architecture is not planned to be in place before 2018 at the moment, with the resolution fund not filled entirely until much later. As a result, the current machinations are unlikely to have much bearing on the ECB\u2019s assessment of Eurozone banks in 2014. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. European finance ministers could take an important step towards creating closer banking union today, as they meet for their monthly ECOFIN meeting in Brussels. The ministers, from across the EU, will be discussing the rules for winding up failing banks, known as the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). And there are hopes of an agreement, which could being Europe closer to full banking union. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, said last night that the SRM would be top of the agenda at the Ecofin meeting today There is a great sense of urgency among the colleagues to reach an agreement if possible tomorrow. Progress has been hampered by the long-running dispute between Berlin and France. The two sides disagree over how cleaning up bailed banks should be funded (Germany favoured national funds; France a central pot), and how the SRM could be controlled (by national states, or the Commission). Encouragingly, French finance minister Pierre Moscovici told the FT last night that a pact is close: Pierre Moscovici said it was essential any deal included a single, central rescue fund for dealing with failed banks, something that Berlin has resisted, favouring a network of national funds instead. But Mr Moscovici indicated a compromise that would combine both German and broader EU demands was in the works following a meeting in Berlin last Friday of key countries and EU officials convened by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, German finance minister. \u201cWe have to build compromises,\u201d Mr Moscovici told the Financial Times ahead of a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels. \u201cThere has to be both a single resolution fund and a role given to national input. That is not a contradiction. It is an articulation between them that we are seeking.\u201d So we might get progress today. There's also plenty of economic news coming up, that will show how the UK economy is faring: 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing and production data for October 9.30am GMT: UK trade data for October 10am GMT: Italian Q3 GDP, second estimate 3pm: NIESR's estimate of UK GDP for the three months to November Also, Mario Draghi is speaking in Italy this morning, and US regulators will be approving new regulations - Volcker Rule - to rein in risky trading by banks. Of which more shortly.... We'll be tracking all the big developments through the day....",

      "bodyText": "It is no secret that two of the three winners of this year's Nobel economics prize disagree \u2013 after all, they are economists. But Robert Shiller has taken the tiff with Eugene Fama over the efficiency of markets to a new level. Highlighting what he sees as a mismatch between Fama's findings and his theories, he suggested his fellow laureate must feel like a Catholic priest who has discovered God does not exist. While Shiller holds that investors, being human, can be swayed by psychology, Fama contends markets are always efficient, with people incorporating all available information into prices. To mark their acceptance of the prize last night, the two economists and fellow prizewinner Lars Peter Hansen spoke to Swedish public service television SVT about sharing the Nobel prize for their seemingly opposing theories. While Fama said it was \"great\" to share the prize, Shiller was less enthusiastic. \"[Fama] is a careful researcher, an inspired researcher,\" he said, adding: \"I don't know if Fama ever states his theory really clearly, if he did it might sound a little odd.\" The author of Irrational Exuberance mused that Fama may suffer from \"a cognitive dissonance\" given, he argued, that his own findings contrast with orthodoxy at his University of Chicago home. Meanwhile, Fama said there was no way to settle their 21-year debate. Shiller, whose wife is a psychologist, told SVT (just before 28 minutes into the interview): \"I shouldn't try to psychoanalyse Eugene Fama but I know that he is committed \u2026 to a libertarian philosophy, teaching at the University of Chicago where Milton Friedman once lived. \"It must affect your thinking somehow that they really believe in markets. I think that maybe he has a cognitive dissonance. His research shows that markets are not efficient. So what do you do if you are living in the University of Chicago? It's like being a Catholic priest and then discovering that God doesn't exist or something, you can't deal with that, you've got to somehow rationalise it.\" In his hour-long interview with the official broadcaster for the Nobel prize ceremony, Shiller questioned how much the two really differ and suggests Fama does actually share his \"value investing\" approach - a consistent policy of buying assets that are low priced and being patient. Where they differ, Shiller says, is on how rational investors are and on how well they can foretell market moves. \"Some people who seem crazy turn out to be smart after all. Apparently that is what Fama thinks. I think they are just crazy,\" Shiller said, conceding his remarks \"may be insulting\" to his fellow laureate. As Shiller puts it, Fama has a \"fundamentally different view of the world\". \"That's the world we live in, when it comes to economics people have emotions, it's not like chemistry or physics,\" he said. In Fama's words, the difference between the two economists is that both see the expected return on a stock as \"a price for bearing risk\" that can vary through time but that whereas he, Fama, puts that down to \"rational variation and the reward for bearing risk\" behavioural people like Shiller \"say it is market mispricing that eventually gets corrected\". Asked about sharing the prize, Fama has faint praise for Shiller. \"I think it's great. Lars has been my friend and colleague for almost 30 years. He does great stuff, it's 180 degrees different than mine. Bob has been around for a long time. He works in the same area. His work is very good and well recognised,\" he says.",

      "bodyText": "The former Goldman Sachs secretary who was jailed in 2004 for stealing more than \u00a34m from her banker bosses has landed a job coaching white-collar criminals in how to cope with a prison term. Joyti Waswani, who served half of her seven-year sentence in three closed prisons under her then married name of Joyti De-Laurey, is said to be Britain's biggest female fraudster after stealing vast sums from her bosses, Scott Mead, Jennifer Moses and Moses's husband, Ron Beller, all of whom were directors of the investment bank. The trio were so wealthy they did not notice their savings being plundered \u2013 despite, the court was told, Waswani buying more than \u00a3300,000 worth of Cartier jewellery, flying lessons for her husband and a \u00a3150,000 speedboat. Released in 2007, she has been working as director of fundraising for the Royal London Society, the prisoner charity, before taking up her new role as a consultant at a start-up business called Prison Consultants, which says it advises its clients on \"how to prepare and deal with the unfamiliar surroundings of serving time at Her Majesty's establishments\". The business has launched just as many high-profile white-collar cases are coming to court, from the prosecution of bankers allegedly involved in rigging benchmark interest rates, to the phone hacking trial currently at the Old Bailey. \"I didn't feel safe at all when I first went in,\" recalls Waswani. \"I felt really scared. Every five minutes there was a kick-off [a scuffle]. You don't need to know how to make friends; you just need to know how not to make enemies.\" Hence the role with Prison Consultants, a business conceived by Steve Dagworthy, another former white collar criminal who served half of his six-year sentence for what was described in court as a \u00a33m Ponzi scheme. Dagworthy took his idea to a longstanding business contact called Steve Hamer, a former chairman of Swansea City FC, who formed the company and employs Dagworthy as a consultant. Dagworthy says: \"If you go inside for fraud, the first question [from inmates] is 'how much?'. The second is 'what did you do with it?'. If they think you've got money, they'll start working you. You will get one person asking 'anything you need?'. Then you'll get someone else who gives you a hard time. So you go to the person that's been friendly to ask for help, but it costs you. And often you find that those two people have been working together.\" Both Waswani and Dagworthy warn of other traps that white collar prisoners fall into, such as taking jobs in the prison kitchen, where inmates are frequently left with the choice of breaking unwritten prison rules or taking the risk of smuggling food to the wing. \"If you don't do it, that's when the bullying starts,\" says Dagworthy.

    "webTitle": "Wall Street facing tighter scrutiny as regulators move on Volcker rule", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wall Street is facing tighter scrutiny of its trading activities after US regulators moved on Tuesday to impose stricter rules on the types of trades banks can make following the financial crisis. The long-delayed \u201cVolcker rule\u201d is aimed at curbing high-risk trading on Wall Street of the kind blamed for triggering the worst financial crisis in living memory. But the rule hit yet another hurdle Tuesday \u2013 snow storms closed much of Washington and some staff at the top five US financial regulators looked set to vote on the rule from home. Five years after the financial crisis, the Volcker rule has become the most controversial element of the Dodd-Frank Act, the largest overhaul of the financial system since the Great Depression. Many details of the 71-page rule, preceded by about 900 pages of explanatory text, are still to be finalised. But according to those who have seen the final draft, it appears the new legislation will impose tougher requirements in some areas than the banks had first expected. The rule, named after former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, aims to crack down on so-called proprietary trading \u2013 betting on financial markets for banks' own gain. The rule aims to separate everyday banking from the kinds of high-risk trading that caused the financial crisis. The rule would curb the number of risks banks can take so that they do not exceed \"the reasonably expected near-term demands of customers\", the regulators said. The rule will also tackle so-called portfolio hedging, a practice that was supposed to allow banks to offset risks with investments in other portfolios but which critics charge has been used by Wall Street to hide risky speculative bets. Under the new rule banks will be required to identify the exact risk that is being hedged. According to the executive summary issued by the US Federal Reserve, Volcker would also prohibit \u201cany banking entity from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, or having certain relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund,\u201d with some exceptions. It would also require banks to establish an internal compliance programme \u201cdesigned to help ensure and monitor compliance with the prohibitions and restrictions of the statute and the final rule.\u201d While the Volcker rule was drawn up in the wake of the financial crisis, it was given fresh impetus last year after JP Morgan Chase\u2019s $6bn losses on the so-called \u201cLondon whale\u201d trades. The bank contended at the time that the huge risky bets being made in London were meant to hedge risks being taken elsewhere. Wall Street\u2019s lobbyists have won some key concessions. Some securities linked to foreign sovereign debt \u2013 money owned by foreign governments \u2013 will be exempt. There will also be exceptions for banks\u2019 market-making desks, as long as traders are not paid in a way that rewards proprietary trading. Wall Street\u2019s bonus culture has been seen by some as a prime cause of excessive risk taking. \u201cThis provision of the Dodd-Frank Act has the important objective of limiting excessive risk-taking by depository institutions and their affiliates,\u201d Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said in a statement. \u201cThe ultimate effectiveness of the rule will depend importantly on supervisors, who will need to find the appropriate balance while providing feedback to the board on how the rule works in practice.\u201d The rule will not come into force until July 2015 and Wall Street lawyers are now expected to comb through the document looking for loopholes and considering whether to mount a legal challenge. Oliver Ireland, co-head of financial services practice at Morrison and Foerster, said with such an enormous rule \u201cthe devil is very much in the detail.\u201d \u201cFundamentally it\u2019s the same rule in that it tries to put an end to prop trading,\u201d he said. But he said he doubted it would be enough to halt the next financial crisis. The rule addresses banking entities \u2013 not hedge funds. And even in this case, where risky trades are being limited, Ireland said there was a good case that the wrong issues were being tackled. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop \u2018too big to fail\u2019. It\u2019s not going to stop banks taking risks. Banks lend money with the expectation of getting it back and that\u2019s fundamentally a risky business,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is aimed at trading and if you look back at the last financial crisis that goes back to bad lending practices on mortgages. That happened before anyone had traded anything,\u201d he said.",

The increase is expected to be driven by its Asian business where it expected 15% annual operating profit growth over that period. Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> We interpret [the \u00a310bn target] to mean significant returns of surplus capital for shareholders. At the welcoming dinner last night the chairman emphasised that any surplus capital belonged to shareholders, implying a very positive outlook for the return of surplus.

Ian Gordon at Investec repeated his buy recommendation on Lloyds, saying:</p> <p>This disposal should be seen in the context of last Friday's disposal of \u00a3147m UK commercial real estate, last Thursday's disposal of \u00a3610m non-performing Irish retail mortgages, and on 29 November, the sale of \u00a31.1bn European/Nordic corporate real estate \u2013 all achieved close to existing marks with minimal income statement impact, but usefully capital accretive.</p> <p><strong>Smiths Group</strong> climbed 21p to \u00a313.99 after Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation on the technology company from equal weight to overweight and lifted its price target from \u00a314.35 to \u00a315.07. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> We move to overweight because we believe Smiths' valuation does not reflect potential returns either on a steady-state basis or from M&amp;A. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>CSR</strong> soared nearly 10% to 559.5p after the chipmaker announced it was quitting the digital camera market with the lost of 200 roles.</p> <p>It said it would withdraw investment from its camera-on-a-chip platform because of a weak market due to growing use of smartphones for photography.</p> <p>The company is taking an impairment charge of $90m this year and will cut 200 jobs by the end of the second quarter of 2014.</p>",

GE, Siemens and Caterpillar have all been mentioned as possible predators in the past, but a new name was added during the day. Traders heard talk that Swiss oilfield service and equipment company Weathford could be interested in Weir, with a price of \u00a330 a share mentioned. Prudential was boosted by a positive update from its investor day, with a new cash target raising hopes in the City of bumper payouts to shareholders. The insurer put on 21p to \u00a312.87 after it said it was targeting at least \u00a310bn of cumulative cash generation between 2014 and 2017 - around a third of its market capitalisation. The increase is expected to be driven by its Asian business where it expected 15% annual operating profit growth over that period. Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon said: We interpret [the \u00a310bn target] to mean significant returns of surplus capital for shareholders. At the welcoming dinner last night the chairman emphasised that any surplus capital belonged to shareholders, implying a very positive outlook for the return of surplus. We have increased our target price to 1592p (from 1453p) per share and maintain our buy recommendation. After last week's sales drop a number of brokers cut their rating on Tesco, yesterday analysts at Berstein joined the throng of negative comment. The research firm put an underperform rating and a 300p price target on Tesco, saying the supermarket has raised its prices faster than rivals in the last few years and had lost its differentiation. They said: Tesco is not value, not quality, just everywhere. Tesco is now in an impossible position: it is neither value nor quality and can't compete with either the quality or value retailers. Elsewhere Whitbread slipped 50p to \u00a334.75 despite strong third quarter sales as profit takers moved in. It was a similar story for Tui Travel, down 5.7p at 378.3p after its positive full year results. Standard Chartered fell another 30p to \u00a312.84 while Lloyds Banking Group dipped 0.04p to 78.16p after raising \u00a3680m from the sale of its remaining 21% stake in wealth manager St James Place, up 3.5p at 647p. Ian Gordon at Investec repeated his buy recommendation on Lloyds, saying: This disposal should be seen in the context of last Friday's disposal of \u00a3147m UK commercial real estate, last Thursday's disposal of \u00a3610m non-performing Irish retail mortgages, and on 29 November, the sale of \u00a31.1bn European/Nordic corporate real estate \u2013 all achieved close to existing marks with minimal income statement impact, but usefully capital accretive. Smiths Group climbed 21p to \u00a313.99 after Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation on the technology company from equal weight to overweight and lifted its price target from \u00a314.35 to \u00a315.07. The bank said: We move to overweight because we believe Smiths' valuation does not reflect potential returns either on a steady-state basis or from M&amp;A. Among the mid-caps CSR soared nearly 10% to 559.5p after the chipmaker announced it was quitting the digital camera market with the lost of 200 roles. It said it would withdraw investment from its camera-on-a-chip platform because of a weak market due to growing use of smartphones for photography. The company is taking an impairment charge of $90m this year and will cut 200 jobs by the end of the second quarter of 2014.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that long-term prospects for eurozone growth look bleak unless politicians act urgently to stoke domestic demand and tackle youth unemployment. After months of relative calm in financial markets, and with Ireland due to end its painful bailout programme and its reliance on the IMF this weekend, some European politicians have declared the worst to be over for the 17-member single currency zone. But speaking at the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels, Lagarde warned against prematurely declaring an end to the economic crisis. \"Can a crisis really be over when 12% of the labour force is without a job? When unemployment among the youth is in very high double digits, reaching more than 50% in Greece and Spain? And when there is no sign that it is becoming easier for people to pay down their debts?\" She warned that high youth unemployment could jeopardise the economy's ability to grow in the future, by creating a generation of young people without the skills to take their place in the jobs market. \"What is at stake is Europe's potential for growth in the future,\" she said. \"Unemployment at a young age means a lack of on-the-job training, depreciating skills, and possible withdrawal from the labour market. Experience tells us that long spells of unemployment lead to a less productive workforce down the road.\" Lagarde called for a raft of reforms, including fixing the battered banking sector to \"jump-start growth\", and warned that with monetary policy all but exhausted, and interest rates already close to zero, governments might yet need to resort to a new fiscal stimulus if recovery fails to take hold. \"In the event growth is low for a protracted period of time and monetary policy options are depleted, fiscal policy will need to provide more support to domestic demand,\" she said. In a veiled criticism of Germany, which has tended to rely on an export-led growth model, Lagarde suggested that boosting Europe's growth potential will require stoking demand at home too. \"Most of the demand for European goods and services comes from abroad, not from within, leaving the economy at the mercy of the ups and downs of global trade. European demand for European products remains lacklustre.\" After European Central Bank president Mario Draghi unexpectedly announced a cut in interest rates last month to stave off deflation, Lagarde called for the ECB to \"keep interest rates low and convince investors that it will do so for as long as is necessary\". The IMF would also like to see a series of labour market reforms, including making it easier for skilled employees to cross Europe's borders in search of work; cutting employment regulation; and shifting the burden of taxation from income on to consumption, in the hope of boosting future job prospects. \"There can be no letting up on reforms until growth has recovered sufficiently to arrest the rise in unemployment and debt,\" Lagarde said.",

The increase is expected to be driven by its Asian business where it expected 15% annual operating profit growth over that period. Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> We interpret [the \u00a310bn target] to mean significant returns of surplus capital for shareholders. At the welcoming dinner last night the Chairman emphasised that any surplus capital belonged to shareholders, implying a very positive outlook for the return of surplus. We have increased our target price to 1592p (from 1453p) per share and maintain our buy recommendation. </blockquote> <p>In a buy note Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> We were pleasantly surprised that Prudential has chosen to set itself new targets, with the group's circumstances very different today than it was three years ago.

      "bodyText": "Prudential has been boosted by a positive update from its investor day, with a new cash target raising hopes in the City of bumper payouts to shareholders. The insurer has put on 18p to \u00a312.84 said it was targeting at least \u00a310bn of cumulative cash generation between 2014 and 2017 - around a third of its market capitalisation. The increase is expected to be driven by its Asian business where it expected 15% annual operating profit growth over that period. Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon said: We interpret [the \u00a310bn target] to mean significant returns of surplus capital for shareholders. At the welcoming dinner last night the Chairman emphasised that any surplus capital belonged to shareholders, implying a very positive outlook for the return of surplus. We have increased our target price to 1592p (from 1453p) per share and maintain our buy recommendation. In a buy note Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said: We were pleasantly surprised that Prudential has chosen to set itself new targets, with the group's circumstances very different today than it was three years ago. However, we applaud these targets, which, on first viewing, appear pretty stretching and aggressive.

      "bodyText": "Package holidays are back in vogue, according to Tui Travel, as strong demand boosted underlying profits to record levels. The company behind the Thomson and First Choice brands said Britons' unwillingness to give up holidays despite straitened times had driven a 21% increase in underlying pre-tax profits, to \u00a3473m in the year to 30 September. However, when one-off charges and restructuring costs were included, pre-tax profit fell 10%, to \u00a3181m. Europe's largest tour operator said it was benefiting from a focus on its \"unique\" holiday offers with value-added services and improved flight experience. Demand for such holidays was particularly strong in the UK, where underlying operating profits improved by \u00a354m to \u00a3251m, boosting margins 1.1 percentage points to 6.5%. Chief executive Peter Long said it had had an outstanding year. \"The package holiday is very much back in vogue. Fundamentally, what it's saying is that customers are not going to forgo their overseas summer break because they need that to recharge the batteries,\" he told Radio 4's Today. Tui said winter 2013-14 bookings were in line with expectations, with 60% of the programme sold. Long said there was huge demand for tablet-enabled services from customers. The company's digital app was launched during the year in the UK and Germany, receiving almost 200,000 downloads to date. After the unrest in Egypt, the company reduced the number of holidays it offered in the country in response to falling demand. Egyptian destinations now account for less than 5% of winter 2013-14 holidays. The company said it was pleased with summer 2014 trading despite strong comparatives from the previous year, with around 13% of the programme sold. Long said that while the UK economy was improving, the company was focused on offering value for money as customer finances remained squeezed. \"UK consumer sentiment is improved but our customers' income is still under pressure, and particularly disposable income.\" He said all-inclusive holidays were still very popular as they offered \"complete certainty\" of cost. Tui was the first UK operator to fly customers on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and Long said the company was getting \"phenomenal feedback\" after deliveries were initially delayed by the safety concerns associated with the aircraft's lithium-ion batteries. The Dreamliner flies to some of Tui's popular long haul destinations, including Canc\u00fan in Mexico, Florida, and the recently launched Thailand. France proved more of a challenge for Tui, with underlying operating losses widening to \u00a360m from \u00a347m over the year. Long said it reflected a \"perfect storm\" in Europe's second largest economy, which is on the verge of slipping back into recession and where demand for travel to North Africa - traditionally a popular destination for French tourists - is low. Overall, the group's underlying operating profit jumped 20% to a record \u00a3589m and the company said it was confident of delivering its target of underlying annual operating profit growth of between 7% and 10% over the next five years. Revenue increased by 4% to \u00a315bn over the full year, and the board recommended a dividend of 9.75p a share, taking the total dividend for the year to 13.5p a share, up 15%.",

The latest quarterly jobs report by Manpower found that employers have continued to hire part-time staff in large numbers despite forecasts that the economy is expected to expand at the fastest pace for a decade. Likening the jobs market to a swan, the recruitment firm said the outwardly \"serene\" progress in employment growth masked a market that is \"paddling away furiously\" with downward pressure on pay, skills shortages and underemployment remaining serious issues. \"It's still an employer's market and employees are yet to feel the effects of the economic recovery in their pockets,\" said Mark Cahill, managing director of Manpower. \"These issues don't look like they will ease up much in the near future.\" The survey showed many employers were still reluctant to make the commitment to hire full-time staff while the recovery remained fragile. It also showed that hiring intentions in London have slumped below the national average, while every region in the UK recorded a positive outlook for jobs, partly in response to a rise in hiring intentions by energy firms. Under intense pressure since Labour announced it would implement a price freeze after the next election, energy firms have received a blitz of complaints. To counter the problem, Manpower said, the companies have hired thousands of staff in regional call centres. \"We've seen plenty of criticism of the energy companies for hiking gas and electricity bills,\" said Cahill. \"However, we've noticed the big energy companies are now looking to take on thousands of extra staff to deal with a rising demand in calls. Customers are ringing up the gas and electricity firms in greater numbers, perhaps to question their bill or even to switch provider. The effect of this greater volume of calls is that the utility companies now need to hire to meet this demand.\" But many new jobs were part-time and showed that persistent pressures on pay, underemployment and a lack of skills would continue into next year. Cahill said: \"Going into 2014, the UK jobs market has the characteristics of a swan: it's making steady, serene progress on the surface but a very different picture emerges beneath the water, where it is paddling away furiously.\" A separate report by jobs website totaljobs.com found that the increasingly harsh environment in private sector firms was encouraging jobseekers to favour roles in the public sector by over three to one. In a survey of more than 5,000 UK jobseekers, 55% said they would prefer to work for a public sector organisation compared with an equivalent role in the private sector. The private sector was favoured by 16%. Almost two-thirds of job hunters said the working culture, including hours, holidays and flexi-time, was the main attraction of public sector roles.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's economy needs sustained low interest rates to spur growth and repair the stricken banking sector, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned, in a strong rebuttal of critics calling for a rapid rate hike in response to a galloping housing market. Speaking in New York, Carney said it would be a mistake \"to rush to a more extreme response\" when the UK economy remained blighted by high unemployment and slow growth in major export markets. His comments followed a report by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \u2013 which represents surveyors and estate agents \u2013 that found expectations for future house price growth hit a 14-year high during November. A combination of soaring demand and the restricted supply of new homes pushed price expectations for the new year to a level not seen since the height of the 1990s boom, it said. Almost 60% more surveyors and estate agents across the country predicted prices would continue their upward trend rather than fall back over the coming three months. \"This is the highest reading since September 1999 and demonstrates the impact that the recovery in demand allied with anaemic supply is having on the housing market,\" said RICS's chief economist Simon Rubinsohn. \"Housebuilding is on the up, but it is rising nowhere near quickly enough to make up the shortfall that has built up in recent years.\" Several MPs on the Treasury select committee joined the chorus of disapproval at rising house prices during a hearing with Robert Chote, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's independent economic forecaster. Questioning Chote about the chancellor George Osborne's autumn statement last week and the prospects for the government's finances, Tory MP Brooks Newmark said a housing boom was potentially destabilising. Newmark said a housing bubble could undermine the progress made during the recovery from the financial crash. Chote argued that it was possible rising prices were due to market forces and not a bubble. He said it was possible rising debt levels would be followed by rising wages, which would keep household debts within sustainable levels. Meanwhile, Carney said a resurgence of consumer spending and a housing market recovery should be welcomed. He said the UK economy was regaining some of its old strength and heading for sustained growth. But he said subdued export markets and the weakness of the banking sector still weighed heavily and hampered growth. He said: \"The Ghost of Christmas Past should not be forgotten. A recovery may be gaining pace but our economies are a long way from normal. [Borrowing] is still high and weak demand for advanced economy exports could persist for some time. \"The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come suggests that it is unlikely that equilibrium interest rates will return to historically normal levels any time soon,\" he said. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which Carney chairs, published forward guidance in the summer that linked a rise in interest rates to a fall in unemployment to 7%. The committee estimated that the target will be reached in the autumn of 2016. But market analysts are expected a rise in rates a year earlier following a sharper than expected fall in the unemployment rate during the last three months to 7.6% from 7.8%. Carney said his concerns about the underlying problems facing the UK economy had failed to dim his optimism about the country's long term future. In a direct riposte to economists, including former White House economics adviser Larry Summers, who have argued that the west is entering a period of Japanese-style stagnation, Carney said it was possible for the BoE to adopt a \"catalytic role to help deliver [sustained growth]\" alongside political measures to \"reinforce an open, global economy\". Summers said earlier this year that western economies were destined to follow Japan's lead into a long period of low growth as they struggled to compete against Asian economies while managing their ageing workforce. Summers said the response of central banks to make credit cheap had failed in the past to encourage growth. The governor argued that the BoE's policy of low interest rates allowed banks and households to repair their finances and pay down debts. Only when the conditions for consistent growth are established will the UK restore the confidence needed to encourage investment growth, he said. A report by the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) argued an unbridled housing boom was unlikely. It said stretched household finances, tighter regulations on lenders and the prospect of higher rates in the medium term meant housing market activity may well \"ease back of its own accord\". The CML predicted a rise in gross lending from an estimated \u00a3170bn this year to \u00a3195bn next year, and \u00a3206bn in 2015.",

      "body": "<p>Britain's economy needs sustained low interest rates to spur growth and repair the stricken banking sector, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned, in a strong rebuttal of critics calling for a rapid rate hike in response to a galloping housing market.</p> <p>Speaking in New York, Carney said it would be a mistake \"to rush to a more extreme response\" when the UK economy remained blighted by high unemployment and slow growth in major export markets.</p> <p>His comments followed a report by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \u2013 which represents surveyors and estate agents \u2013 that found expectations for future house price growth hit a 14-year high during November. A combination of soaring demand and the restricted supply of new homes pushed price expectations for the new year to a level not seen since the height of the 1990s boom, it said.</p> <p>Almost 60% more surveyors and estate agents across the country predicted prices would continue their upward trend rather than fall back over the coming three months. \"This is the highest reading since September 1999 and demonstrates the impact that the recovery in demand allied with anaemic supply is having on the housing market,\" said RICS's chief economist Simon Rubinsohn.</p> <p>\"Housebuilding is on the up, but it is rising nowhere near quickly enough to make up the shortfall that has built up in recent years.\"</p> <p>Several MPs on the Treasury select committee joined the chorus of disapproval at rising house prices during a hearing with Robert Chote, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's independent economic forecaster.</p> <p>Questioning Chote about the chancellor George Osborne's autumn statement last week and the prospects for the government's finances, Tory MP Brooks Newmark said a housing boom was potentially destabilising.</p> <p>Newmark said a housing bubble could undermine the progress made during the recovery from the financial crash.</p> <p>Chote argued that it was possible rising prices were due to market forces and not a bubble. He said it was possible rising debt levels would be followed by rising wages, which would keep household debts within sustainable levels.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Carney said a resurgence of consumer spending and a housing market recovery should be welcomed. He said the UK economy was regaining some of its old strength and heading for sustained growth.</p> <p>But he said subdued export markets and the weakness of the banking sector still weighed heavily and hampered growth.</p> <p>He said: \"The Ghost of Christmas Past should not be forgotten. A recovery may be gaining pace but our economies are a long way from normal.
