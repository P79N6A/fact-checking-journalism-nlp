It's a travesty given the state of public education in the US that we've laid off hundreds of thousands of schoolteachers; rehiring them would not only help the economy but it would also improve our long-run growth potential.

Obama's own inspector general has roundly criticized the treasury department for its glacial approach in helping underwater homeowners and its unwillingness to pressure the big banks \u2013 recipients of Tarp bailouts, mind you \u2013 to help.

      "bodyText": "Business secretary Vince Cable has urged shareholders to keep up the pressure on boardroom pay as he pledged to press ahead with his plans to hand investors new powers to clamp down on excessive bonus deals. After a fortnight of big protests by City investors about pay at underperforming companies, Cable welcomed the \"very healthy\" signs that shareholders are finally taking control of the companies they own. Cable said: \"There is a broader movement. It's about reacting to extremes. We've seen ludicrous levels of payments unrelated to performance.\" Some 60% of shareholders failed to back executive payouts at insurance company Aviva on Thursday \u2013 putting intense pressure on chief executive Andrew Moss. The insurer was among five companies to face protest votes on that day alone. On Friday three more companies \u2013 engineering company IMI, Avocet Mining and promotional products company 4imprint \u2013 faced rebellions. At FTSE 100 company IMI more than 30% of investors failed to support a new boardroom incentive plan. Almost 20% of investors failed to back Avocet Mining while almost 25% failed to back 4imprint's pay policies. \"Investors need to keep it up,\" said Cable. \"It needs to be sustained.\" Cable is currently considering whether to give shareholders more power by making the annual vote on remuneration binding on companies. It is currently only an advisory vote which companies can simply ignore. He is also considering ways to simplify the way executive pay is disclosed. The business secretary believes the government's pressure has given shareholders new confidence: \"There's a process going on, a very healthy one, where investors are taking control of the companies they own. It's a very positive trend. We've reinforced it, giving them the confidence [to vote].\" Without pre-empting the outcome of the consultation, he said, \"it is certainly our intention to have a binding vote\". The consultation also floated the idea of having a \"super majority\" threshold for votes on remuneration reports \u2013 which currently have a 50% pass rate \u2013 although he conceded that the consultation was looking at issues about whether a majority investor might be able to have disproportionate influence. Pay policies at international companies such as Citigroup in the US and UBS in Switzerland have also faced opposition. A revolt at Citigroup last month \u2013 where investors voted down the \u00a39m pay packet of chief executive Vikram Pandit \u2013 kicked off a wave of unexpectedly large rebellions. At Barclays one in three investors failed to back the bank's pay policies. The Aviva vote this week was only the fourth time a FTSE 100 company has had its pay polices voted down in the 10 years since the remuneration vote was introduced. The revolts are taking place in the midst of the annual general meeting season and further tensions could emerge in the coming days at companies as diverse as bookmaker William Hill, commodities trader Glencore and the materials science group Cookson. Investor body Pirc is advising its clients, pension funds and local authorities to vote against the Cookson report in protest over the company's performance and decision to hand out bonuses. The payouts include an estimated \u00a37m to chief executive Nick Salmon from a long-term incentive plan after a five-year period in which the company has lost 86% of its value. Cookson disputed Pirc's analysis and said it does not reflect the achievements of the current management team.",

The report is expected to rattle nerves at the White House, which has enjoyed a run of positive economic news over the last six months. The US stock market has risen 12% since January. Weak growth and high unemployment create a formidable challenge for President Barack Obama, who is under pressure from his likely Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, to do more to create jobs. The Democratic administration will also be concerned at the prospect of a prolonged recession in Europe after most countries in the 17-member eurozone suffered a fall in economic activity in April. Weak manufacturing output reported a few days ago was matched by a drop in services activity that was only mildly mitigated by stronger than expected retail sales. Italy led the downturn after its services sector shrank for the 11th consecutive month in April and at its sharpest rate for almost three years. It had already suffered the worst manufacturing numbers for three years. Analysts said a collapse in consumer spending following cuts in wages, benefits and pensions was behind the fall in output. They suggested the currency bloc's recession could extend beyond the summer after output also contracted in core countries such as France and the Netherlands along with Italy and Spain. Germany's services sector continued to grow, but at a much slower pace than in March. The final reading of April's Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the entire eurozone services sector came in at 46.9, a full point lower than the preliminary reading of 47.9 reported two weeks ago, which itself was far weaker than City analysts had expected. It was the steepest downward revision to the PMI since October 2008, in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse. Anything less than 50 signifies contraction. Survey compiler Markit attributed the revision to business conditions worsening at a faster rate towards the end of the month, and said the figure was consistent with a 0.5% quarterly rate of economic contraction.

The first is the imminent collapse in the pressure pump market in north America and the second looks to be the emerging threat of a freeze in miner capital expenditure, The latter exposure is less toxic than its unconventional oil and gas position and may only account for 10%-12% of group profits. Already we had factored in a demise of this mining equipment market in our bear scenario forecasts but we plug in a bit more.

      "bodyText": "A company in the vanguard of the American shale gas revolution has been \"fracked\" by a regulatory investigation amid controversy over its founder using his personal stakes in corporate wells to borrow nearly $1bn (\u00a3618m). The board of Chesapeake Energy has removed founder Aubrey McClendon as chairman \u2013 he remains chief executive \u2013 and scrapped highly unusual remuneration arrangements which led to his borrowing $846m. Chesapeake also confirmed that the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) has started an \"informal\" investigation into both the company and McLendon, with which it said they would all co-operate. The company was an early beneficiary of shale drilling but the slump in the price of US natural gas has driven the business into a first quarter financial loss and halved its share price this year. The second largest gas producer in the US has been forced to admit it may run out of money in 2013. The Oklahoma-based energy firm did not say what the SEC review would focus on but there is widespread presumption that it involves executive perks under which McClendon was potentially rewarded with the company's own oil and gas. Chesapeake said it had been told to retain certain documents but also declared the investigation did not presume wrongdoing. The board has also now scrapped the founder well participation programme, although not until mid-2014, 18 months before the end of its previously agreed term. \"McClendon will receive no compensation of any kind in connection with the early termination of the FWPP,\" the company said. The well programme provides him with a contractual right to participate and invest as a working interest owner, with up to a 2.5% working interest, in new wells drilled on the company's leasehold land. It is thought he used his stake as collateral to borrow money to keep up with further investments as the company expanded. McClendon has also been made to give up the chairmanship. Pete Miller, the company's lead independent director, said the separation of the chairman and chief executive roles would \"improve Chesapeake's corporate governance and the early termination of the FWPP will eliminate a source of controversy, both of which should send a positive signal to the market and improve shareholder value\". McLendon said: \"This action reflects our determination to uphold strong corporate governance standards and will also enable me to focus my full time and attention on execution of the company's strategy, the implementation of our transformation into a major oil producer and the completion of our asset monetisation and joint venture objectives.\" The business grew on the back of shale gas discoveries using the fracking method of breaking up rocks with strong chemicals which has attracted the ire of environmentalists.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has played down the likelihood of any imminent sell-off of the government's 83% stake, even as it hailed the achievement of \"important recovery milestones\". The bailed-out bank signalled it was ready to resume payments to bondholders \u2013 which were banned until the end of last month under EU state aid rules \u2013 and said it would next week pay back the last of the cash borrowed to keep it afloat during the banking crisis. But despite these \"milestones\", RBS remained loss-making, reporting a \u00a31.4bn first-quarter loss compared with \u00a3116m a year ago \u2013 although it was largely caused by a \u00a32.5bn change in the value of the bank's debt. It also took an extra \u00a3125m charge for compensating customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). The taxpayer is sitting on a \u00a322bn loss on its stake in the bank, bought at an average price of 50p, even after the 2% rise in the shares to 25p, which will prohibit any sell-off by the government. \"As far as I'm aware there is no desire to sell at the current share price,\" said Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, despite speculation that a stake could be sold to Middle Eastern investors. The operating profits, which Hester prefers to focus on, were \u00a31.2bn, which he said showed \"excellent progress continues in removing 'mistakes' of the past\". Parachuted in to run RBS during its October 2008 bailout, Hester has previously said that investors regard buying bank shares as \"dumb\" and he repeated that on Friday, saying that \"the share price is sending a very clear signal\". Hester, who has waived a near-\u00a31m bonus following political pressure, also admitted it would be \"at least a year\" until any decision could be made on resuming dividends to shareholders. \"One of the manifestations of the end state of RBS is that we should be a strong dividend payer and the issue is how we get there.\" The bank is planning a one-for-10 share consolidation \u2013 which would move the share price to 248p and is intended to reduce volatility in its price \u2013 which Hester described as \"a matter of symbolisation in terms of presenting a new face to the capital markets\". He described the move to resume payments to bondholders as an \"important recovery milestone\" and pointed out that the bank would next week pay off the last of the funds it borrowed from the Bank of England \u2013 about \u00a3163bn \u2013 during the crisis. The government has made a profit of at least \u00a31bn on the loans. RBS is still borrowing from the European Central Bank. But the government is still insuring the bank's most troublesome assets through the Asset Protection Scheme, although RBS may be able to exit the scheme when it will have paid a total of \u00a32.5bn in fees. RBS, like other UK banks, is being subjected to \"stress tests\" by the Financial Services Authority, which will influence its ability to leave the scheme, RBS said. Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec who forecasts a share price of 30p by Christmas, said: \"It is hardly a sexy story, but give credit for the very strong evidence of balance sheet repair.\" As with its rivals, RBS continues to be hit by charges to compensate customers for PPI mis-selling and has set aside \u00a31.2bn for claims. By the end of March it had paid out \u00a3501m and Hester concurred with Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of Lloyds, who this week hit out against bogus claims. In Ireland \u2013 where Hester said the bank had granted some \"stupid\" loans \u2013 the bank continues to face \"exceedingly difficult market conditions\" and incurred an operating loss of \u00a3310m as customers fell behind on repayments. In the UK, Hester said that the official GDP data \u2013 which showed a contraction of 0.2% in the first quarter, taking the UK back into recession \u2013 did not paint a true picture of the economy, which he thought was a \"bit better than those GDP numbers but it's still pretty flat\". RBS's lending, measured by balances drawn down by customers, fell 1% and Hester said: \"At the moment customers are holding their fire.\"",

It also took an extra \u00a3125m charge for compensating customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI).</p> <p>The taxpayer is sitting on a \u00a322bn loss on its stake in the bank, bought at an average price of 50p, even after the 2% rise in the shares to 25p, which will prohibit any sell-off by the government.</p> <p>\"As far as I'm aware there is no desire to sell at the current share price,\" said Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, despite speculation that a stake could be sold to Middle Eastern investors.</p> <p>The operating profits, which Hester prefers to focus on, were \u00a31.2bn, which he said showed \"excellent progress continues in removing 'mistakes' of the past\".</p> <p>Parachuted in to run RBS during its October 2008 bailout, Hester has previously said that investors regard buying <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/23/rbs-boss-british-banks-investment\" title=\"\">bank shares as \"dumb\"</a> and he repeated that on Friday, saying that \"the share price is sending a very clear signal\".</p> <p>Hester, who has waived a near-\u00a31m bonus following political pressure, also admitted it would be \"at least a year\" until any decision could be made on resuming dividends to shareholders. \"One of the manifestations of the end state of RBS is that we should be a strong dividend payer and the issue is how we get there.\"</p> <p>The bank is planning a one-for-10 share consolidation \u2013 which would move the share price to 248p and is intended to reduce volatility in its price \u2013 which Hester described as \"a matter of symbolisation in terms of presenting a new face to the capital markets\".</p> <p>He described the move to resume payments to bondholders as an \"important recovery milestone\" and pointed out that the bank would next week pay off the last of the funds it borrowed from the Bank of England \u2013 about \u00a3163bn \u2013 during the crisis. The government has made a profit of at least \u00a31bn on the loans. RBS is still borrowing from the European Central Bank.</p> <p>But the government is still insuring the bank's most troublesome assets through the Asset Protection Scheme, although RBS may be able to exit the scheme when it will have paid a total of \u00a32.5bn in fees. RBS, like other UK banks, is being subjected to \"stress tests\" by the Financial Services Authority, which will influence its ability to leave the scheme, RBS said.</p> <p>Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec who forecasts a share price of 30p by Christmas, said: \"It is hardly a sexy story, but give credit for the very strong evidence of balance sheet repair.\"</p> <p>As with its rivals, RBS continues to be hit by charges to compensate customers for PPI mis-selling and has set aside \u00a31.2bn for claims. By the end of March it had paid out \u00a3501m and Hester concurred with Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of Lloyds, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/01/lloyds-boss-hits-out-fraudulent-ppi-claims\" title=\"\">this week hit out against bogus claims</a>.</p> <p>In Ireland \u2013 where Hester said the bank had granted some \"stupid\" loans \u2013 the bank continues to face \"exceedingly difficult market conditions\" and incurred an operating loss of \u00a3310m as customers fell behind on repayments.</p> <p>In the UK, Hester said that the official GDP data \u2013 which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/25/recession-figures-bad-day-osborne\" title=\"\">showed a contraction of 0.2% in the first quarter</a>, taking the UK back into recession \u2013 did not paint a true picture of the economy, which he thought was a \"bit better than those GDP numbers but it's still pretty flat\".</p> <p>RBS's lending, measured by balances drawn down by customers, fell 1% and Hester said: \"At the moment customers are holding their fire.\"</p>",

This is way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery,\" he told Fox News.</p> <p>\"I think the American people know that their lives are not better than they were three and a half years ago,\" Romnney said. \"They know that the incomes in this country have not risen, they've fallen. They know the president in his first months in office said that he would hold unemployment below 8% and we've had 38 straight months of unemployment above 8%.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Romney had used an op-ed in the Cleveland Plain Dealer to attack the president's jobs record. Presented as a letter to Obama who is to formally launch his election campaign in Ohio on Saturday, Romney said: \"Dear Mr. President: Welcome to Ohio. I have a simple question for you: Where are the jobs?\"</p> <p>John Boehner, the House Speaker, issued a statement using the same refrain within minutes of the figures being released. \"Where are the jobs? Families are stuck,\" he said. \"The wages of those fortunate enough to have a job are stagnant, but they're paying more for everything from gasoline to groceries. </p> <p>\"And those looking for work can't find it because Obamacare, our spending-driven debt, and the threat of tax hikes are making it harder for small businesses to hire. Nearly half of college graduates are unemployed or underemployed in president Obama's economy.\"</p> <p>Analysts were divided in their assessment too. </p> <p>\"The drop in the unemployment rate to 8.1% is deceptive to say the least, as this was driven by a drop in the participation rate to 63.6% from 63.8% previously. This is down from 64.2% a year ago. This has been driven by a stunning 2,693,000 people leaving the labour force in 12 months,\" said David Semmens, senior US economist at Standard Chartered.</p> <p>Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank, explained the slight dip in the markets as investors looking at the strong figures winter figures as unusual and the latest numbers as closer to the real picture of the jobs' market recovery. \"The winter was stronger than we expected in part because of the mild weather,\" he said.</p> <p>But Betsey Stevenson, assistant professor of business and and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school, was more upbeat. \"We lost a lot of jobs in this recession, so we aren't anywhere near adding all the jobs back,\" she said. \"But we are clearly adding jobs and we've been adding them fast enough to bring down the unemployment rate. This month is obviously disappointing, but as we saw with last month's number, we have to keep our eye on the long-run trends and, of course, pay attention to revisions.\"</p> <p>The figures will also put pressure on Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to act and increase the likelihood of a third massive round of bond buying in an aim to boost the economy \u2013 a tactic known as quantitative easing. Last week Bernanke said: \"If unemployment looks like it's no longer making progress, that will be an important consideration in thinking about policy options.\"</p> <p>The two disappointing months followed three months of 200,000 plus jobs growth in December, January and February. Even at 200,000 a month, it would take until 2020 for the US to add back the 10m jobs it needs to return to employment levels last seen before the recession.</p> <p>Government cuts continued to hold back jobs growth. Governments cut payrolls by 15,000 in April. Professional and business services rose by 62,000 jobs. Manufacturers added 16,000.</p> <p>The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was little changed at 5.1 million in April.</p> <p>Earlier this week a survey by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing (ADP) also suggested the recovery in the labour market had weakened.</p> <p>Companies hired 119,000 in April after a 201,000 gain a month earlier, according to the monthly report from payroll giant. Economists had expected companies to add closer to 183,000 for the month.</p>",

They know the president in his first months in office said that he would hold unemployment below 8% and we've had 38 straight months of unemployment above 8%.\" Earlier in the day, Romney had used an op-ed in the Cleveland Plain Dealer to attack the president's jobs record. Presented as a letter to Obama who is to formally launch his election campaign in Ohio on Saturday, Romney said: \"Dear Mr. President: Welcome to Ohio. I have a simple question for you: Where are the jobs?\" John Boehner, the House Speaker, issued a statement using the same refrain within minutes of the figures being released. \"Where are the jobs? Families are stuck,\" he said. \"The wages of those fortunate enough to have a job are stagnant, but they're paying more for everything from gasoline to groceries. \"And those looking for work can't find it because Obamacare, our spending-driven debt, and the threat of tax hikes are making it harder for small businesses to hire. Nearly half of college graduates are unemployed or underemployed in president Obama's economy.\" Analysts were divided in their assessment too. \"The drop in the unemployment rate to 8.1% is deceptive to say the least, as this was driven by a drop in the participation rate to 63.6% from 63.8% previously. This is down from 64.2% a year ago. This has been driven by a stunning 2,693,000 people leaving the labour force in 12 months,\" said David Semmens, senior US economist at Standard Chartered. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank, explained the slight dip in the markets as investors looking at the strong figures winter figures as unusual and the latest numbers as closer to the real picture of the jobs' market recovery. \"The winter was stronger than we expected in part because of the mild weather,\" he said. But Betsey Stevenson, assistant professor of business and and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school, was more upbeat. \"We lost a lot of jobs in this recession, so we aren't anywhere near adding all the jobs back,\" she said. \"But we are clearly adding jobs and we've been adding them fast enough to bring down the unemployment rate. This month is obviously disappointing, but as we saw with last month's number, we have to keep our eye on the long-run trends and, of course, pay attention to revisions.\" The figures will also put pressure on Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to act and increase the likelihood of a third massive round of bond buying in an aim to boost the economy \u2013 a tactic known as quantitative easing. Last week Bernanke said: \"If unemployment looks like it's no longer making progress, that will be an important consideration in thinking about policy options.\" The two disappointing months followed three months of 200,000 plus jobs growth in December, January and February. Even at 200,000 a month, it would take until 2020 for the US to add back the 10m jobs it needs to return to employment levels last seen before the recession. Government cuts continued to hold back jobs growth. Governments cut payrolls by 15,000 in April. Professional and business services rose by 62,000 jobs. Manufacturers added 16,000. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was little changed at 5.1 million in April. Earlier this week a survey by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing (ADP) also suggested the recovery in the labour market had weakened. Companies hired 119,000 in April after a 201,000 gain a month earlier, according to the monthly report from payroll giant. Economists had expected companies to add closer to 183,000 for the month.",

      "bodyText": "Italy's recession is likely to be longer and deeper than expected after its services sector shrank for the 11th month running in April and at its sharpest rate for almost three years. A collapse in consumer spending following cuts in wages, benefits and pensions was behind the fall in output shown in Friday's data and follows the worst manufacturing numbers for three years earlier in the week. The dire figures from Rome added to a picture of weakening demand across the eurozone's vast services sector, which shrivelled at a much faster rate in April than initially thought. Economists suggested that the currency bloc's recession could extend beyond the summer after output contracted in core countries such as France and the Netherlands along with Italy and Spain. Madrid will come under further pressure from unions and anti-poverty campaigners to relent on public spending cuts scheduled for this year after the services sector fell to 42.1 from 46.3 in March. The final reading of April's Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) for the entire eurozone services sector came in at 46.9, a full point lower than the preliminary reading of 47.9 reported two weeks ago, which itself was far weaker than City analysts had expected. It was the steepest downward revision to the PMI since October 2008 and the immediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse. Anything below 50 signifies contraction. Survey compiler Markit attributed the revision to business conditions worsening at a faster rate towards the end of the month, and said the figure was consistent with a 0.5% quarterly rate of economic contraction. A dearth of new orders suggested the figures for May could be even worse. \"Little can be said to remain of any 'core' of strength in the region,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \"Growth has practically ground to a halt even in Germany, and France has joined Italy and Spain in seeing a strong rate of economic decline.\" On Thursday, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said the eurozone economy would recover gradually over the year. But the latest PMIs, which have a good record of tracking economic growth, suggest he will have to wait a while yet. \"Stimulus measures implemented by the ECB have not had a lasting impact on the real economy. Confidence also fell back further in April,\" said Williamson. Eurozone unemployment hit 10.9% in March, equalling a record high set 15 years ago, and the latest PMIs suggest that is unlikely to improve. New business, backlogs of work and input and output prices all showed significant downward revisions compared with the initial flash readings. Annalisa Piazza of analysts Newedge Strategy said Spain and Italy's figures present a worrying picture for activity in the sector. \"Both Italy and Spain are suffering from a marked cyclical slowdown and tight fiscal conditions add further pressure on domestic demand. Today's PMI figures clearly point to further deterioration in the second quarter, with risks of another sharp contraction in activity,\" she said.",
