      "bodyText": "It\u2019s like air pollution. Everyone knows it is happening, but they don\u2019t want to admit they are part of the problem. Britain\u2019s gender pay gap has refused to close for years. At 9.4% in 2016, the difference between average pay for male and female full-time employees was little changed from the 10.5% gap five years earlier. The gap for all employees, full-time and part-time, has been coming down but was still 18.1% in 2016. That gulf reflects the fact part-time workers \u2013 both men and women \u2013 earn less on average per hour than their full-time counterparts and a much higher proportion of women work part-time. Yet ask big employers about where the gap has come from and they will inundate you with information about their firm\u2019s diversity schemes, mentoring programmes and parental support. Everyone says they are doing something, and yet here we are. Women still earn significantly less than men on average and progress is laughably slow. One analysis, by consultants Deloitte, estimated that at this pace the pay gap will not be eradicated until 2069 \u2013 or 99 years after the Equal Pay Act. The government knows this is bad for productivity and bad for society. So this week, possibly tired of waiting for change, it is shaking things up. From Thursday, employers with more than 250 staff will be required by law to collect data so they can publish their gender pay gap, gender bonus gap and a breakdown of how many women and men get a bonus. They must also reveal the proportion of men and women in each of four pay segments, or quartiles, from lowest to highest pay. There are no rules about what bosses should do once they uncover pay gaps but the government\u2019s push to get the figures out into the cold light of day has to be welcome. The results must be published within 12 months on the employer\u2019s website and a government site. If customers do not like what they see, they can go elsewhere. The same goes for potential recruits. Existing employees could use the findings to challenge their managers. At its simplest, this is naming and shaming. No one will want to be top of the gender pay inequality rankings. But there is also an element of helping companies to help themselves. Unless they recognise the awkward truth that they have a pay gap, they won\u2019t do anything to get rid of it. It\u2019s worth being slightly cynical and recognising that not everyone will be upfront about their pay differences. Employment lawyer Josephine Van Lierop at Slater and Gordon notes employers are not required to provide any narrative with their pay data and so they may fail to shine any light on why they have a gap. She goes further: We also suspect there will be a certain degree of licence for employers to exclude and manipulate data, which is highly subjective [and open to] interpretation in any event. We expect big-budget organisations to be hiring expert pay consultants to identify and manipulate the numbers, how the parameters of the quartiles are identified, which people are counted and to put a positive spin on the data\u201d But let\u2019s hope the majority recognises the benefits of taking the new rules seriously and using them as a chance to boost both morale and productivity. To do that, employers will need to get to the bottom of what has caused any gaps. That is harder than it sounds. The reasons for the gender pay gap are many and complex. Given there are laws against men earning more than women for doing exactly the same work, gaps are rarely down to outright discrimination. One factor often flagged for women\u2019s lower earnings is the time they take out to have children and the nature of work they return to \u2013 the so-called motherhood pay penalty. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) notes the gender gap is relatively small up to age 39 for full-time employees. From 40 upwards, the gap is much wider. So it goes from just 1.5% for 30-39 year-olds to 13.4% for the 40-49 age bracket and 16.2% for the 50-59 bracket. Employers must also ask themselves how they are treating people who choose to go part-time. From the age group 22-29 upwards, the pay gap for full-time and part-time employees together is wider than for full-time employees alone. The ONS says this shows that, in those age groups, more women are working part-time in jobs that tend to be lower paid. But it is worth noting that for just part-time workers, the gender pay gap was minus 6% in 2016 \u2013 meaning female part-time employees earned 6.0% more than male part-time employees. Those who really want to close their pay gaps will look at their findings by age group and will consider whether parental and other caring duties are responsible. Then they will consider what sort of parental leave they are providing for men and women and what flexibility they could offer, whether that is working from home or job shares. Employers should also look at how many women they are promoting into the top, high-earning positions and whether they are considering a wide range of candidates when jobs come up. A more radical reaction to their findings would be simply to close the gap by giving women a pay rise. One firm that did that, London marketing start-up Brainlabs, was featured in this column last year. After it found an 8.6% pay gap, it raised female employees\u2019 pay by an average of 8.6%. The idea \u2013 agreed by a company-wide vote \u2013 was that rather than waiting for good intentions to level up men and women\u2019s pay over time, the employer levels the pay and then works backwards to ensure individuals\u2019 pay represents value for money for the firm. About a year on from introducing what it dubbed the \u201cpay gap tax\u201d, Brainlabs director Sophie Newton says the gap is now a \u201cnegligible\u201d 1.8%. The company has been looking at how to entrench gender equality through its recruitment, management, pay, environment and giving people ways to speak up. Newton, a mathematician, has built technology that tracks and shows the gender balance and pay gap for the company, each team and department. \u201cI can see on a daily basis what the stats are and am aware of small shifts over the course of a year,\u201d she says. \u201cMore importantly, the measures introduced last year have contributed to a much more gender-balanced company at all levels,\u201d she adds. Half of its 90 employees are now female and three of the eight senior managers are women. It would be naive to think many others will take such radical action when the inconvenient truths about their pay gaps start appearing on company websites over the coming year. But the new rules will shed a fresh light on gender pay discrepancies and surely recognising the scale of the pay gap problem is better than carrying on as if it will close itself.",

The idea \u2013 agreed by a company-wide vote \u2013 was that rather than waiting for good intentions to level up men and women\u2019s pay over time, the employer levels the pay and then works backwards to ensure individuals\u2019 pay represents value for money for the firm.</p> <p>About a year on from introducing what it dubbed the \u201cpay gap tax\u201d, Brainlabs director Sophie Newton says the gap is now a \u201cnegligible\u201d 1.8%. The company has been looking at how to entrench gender equality through its recruitment, management, pay, environment and giving people ways to speak up.</p> <p>Newton, a mathematician, has built technology that tracks and shows the gender balance and pay gap for the company, each team and department. \u201cI can see on a daily basis what the stats are and am aware of small shifts over the course of a year,\u201d she says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/19/rewrite-rules-economics-end-growing-chasm-inequality\">It\u2019s time to rewrite the rules of economics to end the growing chasm of inequality  | Liam Byrne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMore importantly, the measures introduced last year have contributed to a much more gender-balanced company at all levels,\u201d she adds.

      "bodyText": "David Green, the director of the Serious Fraud Office, has warned that British businesses should not consider deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) the \u201cnew normal\u201d if they are caught misbehaving. Green was speaking to the Observer after Tesco and the SFO announced they had reached a DPA over the accounting scandal that rocked Britain\u2019s biggest retailer in 2014. The settlement includes a fine of \u00a3129m to be paid by Tesco. DPAs allow companies to settle with the SFO without facing criminal prosecution. The companies must agree to specified conditions, which can include a fine and their conduct being monitored for a set period. Used in the US for some time now, DPAs were introduced in the UK only three years ago. The Tesco case is the fourth time the SFO has used its new power: it previously reached settlements with Standard Bank, Rolls-Royce and a third company that cannot be named for legal reasons. The Tesco deal still needs high court approval: a hearing is scheduled for 10 April. Getting such well-known British companies to pay huge fines could be construed as a major victory for the SFO, which suffered a setback last year, after City brokers were found not guilty of helping Tom Hayes rig Libor interest rates. Rolls agreed to pay \u00a3671m to the SFO and the US Department of Justice over allegations that it bribed middle men around the world between 1989 and 2013. However, Green is keen to clarify that DPAs are not the only route that the SFO will take when investigating companies. This is are significant because the fraud-busting agency is still investigating alleged wrongdoing at several other huge companies, including Barclays, GlaxoSmithKline and Airbus, maker of the A380 superjumbo. The Barclays case is particularly high-profile, involving not one of the biggest banks in the world and a key plank of the UK economy, but also Qatar, a major investor in Britain that only last week committed to investing \u00a35bn here \u2013 a move viewed as a significant vote of confidence in the wake of the Brexit vote. The SFO\u2019s investigation centres on whether \u00a32bn that Barclays lent to Qatar was then returned to the bank as part of the \u00a37.3bn bailout that saved Barclays at the height of the financial crisis. Barclays turned to Middle Eastern investors at the time to avoid falling into state ownership. Green and his team are now close to making a decision on whether to formally charge Barclays and former senior executives at the bank, to drop the case, or to seek a DPA. Speaking about DPAs in general, Green said: \u201cWe are an investigating and prosecuting organisation: that is what we do. But having been given this new power, which comes from a US model, and has been adapted for this jurisdiction, we will use it only in very specific circumstances. \u201cAbsolutely crucial to those circumstances is that the company has been fully cooperative with us. There is a reason for that. Unlike with the American model, a judge over here has to decide whether or not the DPA is in the interest of justice. That is quite a high bar. \u201cIf a company is totally uncooperative and sort of leads us a merry dance for four or five years by not cooperating with our investigation, I am sure you would agree that it would be almost impossible for us to represent to the judge that the DPA was in the interests of justice. Companies that don\u2019t cooperate will be prosecuted. Indeed, their conduct may be so egregious that they have to be prosecuted anyway and a DPA wouldn\u2019t be appropriate.\u201d These comments could be significant in Barclays\u2019s case, because the bank has clashed with the SFO during its investigation, which was launched in August 2012. For example, the SFO had to go to court to try to force Barclays to hand over potential evidence after the bank claimed it was protected by legal privilege. Legal privilege ensures that advice between a lawyer and client is kept confidential. Eventually the bank partially waived privilege and handed over 100,000 documents. Asked whether his comments meant that a DPA could be ruled out for Barclays, Green said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t comment on that. All I would say is that it is only companies that cooperate with us which we would consider a DPA for.\u201d The SFO boss said last year that the organisation\u2019s decision on the Barclays case could be reached by the end of March. However, with March now passed, Green says that a decision could come by the end of May. \u201cWe don\u2019t work to timetables; we work to proper decisions on the evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cI think for all sorts of reasons it is safer to look probably at the end of May.\u201d On whether the SFO\u2019s decision will be affected by the importance of Barclays and Qatar to the economy, he added: \u201cAny charging decision is always based on the code test with crown prosecutions. Firstly there is the evidential test \u2013 is there sufficient evidence? If there isn\u2019t then you don\u2019t have to go any further, that\u2019s it. \u201cIf there is sufficient evidence, then you look at the public interest \u2013 is it in the public interest to conduct this particular prosecution? Obviously there, all sorts of considerations come into play. In bribery cases you are specifically not allowed under OECD rules to take into account the national economic interest.\u201d Whatever the SFO\u2019s decision on Barclays, DPAs will be one of Green\u2019s legacies as the director of the SFO. He took over in 2012 when it was facing heavy criticism for its botched arrest of tycoons Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz. One of Green\u2019s first acts as director was to drop the investigation into the brothers. Green pushed for DPAs to be introduced in the UK and then oversaw the first settlements in the UK. These have meant that high-profile investigations have resulted in companies paying out hundreds of millions of pounds, when previously the UK has struggled to prosecute firms. \u201cIt is always satisfactory to be able to use a new statutory power in a positive way, and to use it properly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut prosecutors are a fairly sober bunch. No one sits around celebrating \u2013 you are working on evidence, and we are just making use of a new power that has been given to us.\u201d Green\u2019s four-year contract as director was extended last year until 20 April 2018. However, the SFO boss does not intend to stay beyond that. \u201cI think six years is probably long enough,\u201d he said. Although critics of DPAs say the settlements allow companies to walk away from serious offences, Barry Vitou, head of global corporate crime at London law firm Pinsent Masons, said that they should be seen as a success and something that secures the future of the SFO. The body\u2019s existence has been questioned in the past by politicians \u2013 including by Theresa May, who as home secretary considered rolling it into a National Crime Agency. \u201cThere is a stark contrast between the SFO when he started and the SFO in 2017. If you talk to anybody, the SFO is working,\u201d Vitou said. The lawyer added that DPAs could ensure that innocent employees of a company were not punished for the misdeeds of others. \u201cPersonally I think we should look at them as a success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe previous set-up wasn\u2019t working. The reality is that you can\u2019t put a company in prison; the biggest hit you can impose is an economic fine. It is deeply unjust for all apples in the barrel to suffer when two rotten apples in the barrel did something they shouldn\u2019t. There is no economic sense in pushing a company like Rolls-Royce to its knees.\u201d Done deals Tesco Tesco has agreed with the SFO to pay a fine of \u00a3129m as part of a DPA, although this deal requires court approval. The DPA relates to false accounting at Tesco subsidiary Tesco Stores Ltd, and is not an admittance by the company that it or any of its employees committed a criminal offence. The settlements relate to Tesco\u2019s admitting, in 2014, that it had overstated profits by \u00a3326m. Dave Lewis, chief executive of Tesco, said the settlement allowed the retailer to \u201cmove on\u201d. Lewis took over as boss of Tesco after the false accounting incident took place Rolls-Royce Rolls-Royce and the SFO announced in January that the aerospace and defence company had agreed to pay \u00a3671m in relation to allegations that it bribed middle men around the world between 1989 and 2013. Sir Brian Leveson, the judge who approved the DPA, said the SFO investigation had uncovered \u201cthe most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption\u201d. However, he approved the DPA because the management of Rolls, which has been overhauled since the bribery took place, cooperated extensively with the SFO, even providing evidence and reports that the organisation had not requested.",

      "bodyText": "Could it be 2005 and 2006 all over again? Industry figures last week showed that UK credit-card debt has soared while the savings rate has plunged to an all-time low. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, data shows that late last year car loans were being taken out at a faster rate than any time in US history. Almost everyone in America leases a car or buys it using cheap credit. Except that they don\u2019t take the opportunity to lower their outgoings and cut their monthly loan bills. Instead, they take the cheap credit and buy a bigger car. A much bigger car. This applies as much to those on low incomes as the wealthy. And the same trend can be seen in the UK. In 2008 it was the mortgage sector in the US that triggered the worst global financial crash since 1929. US house buyers on low incomes were sold homes by lenders using teaser rates that offered massive discounts for two or three years on standard fixed rates. Refinancing was easy as long as the base rate remained low. Once the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, it become financially crippling to refinance a mortgage and arrears began to creep upwards. By 2006, millions of American families were in financial trouble and by 2008 hundreds of thousands were handing the keys of their homes back, leaving the banks with huge debts on their balance sheets. Today the US central bank is again raising interest rates, and the jump in credit costs is hitting the finances of low-income families, forcing them into arrears or to default on their loans. But the situation is very different to 2008 and even the years leading up to it. Car loans are an important component of the credit market, but are still dwarfed by home loans. As such, it is unlikely that dodgy car-loan books will see the big lenders getting themselves in such deep trouble. The lenders, and especially the big banks, have much bigger reserves, giving them deeper pockets when the times comes to cover their losses. The regulators are also alive to a problem they blatantly ignored ahead of the last crash. Last November, the New York Federal Reserve bank warned that arrears in the sub-prime car-loan sector were a \u201csignificant concern\u201d. The Bank of England has also voiced concern about rising household debts levels and last week promised a review of banks\u2019 lending standards. It is likely that the cause of the next crash will come from a dark corner of the financial services industry that regulators believe is insignificant until it whacks them on the nose. But, at least for now, they are not the complacent animals of yesteryear and will snap at the big financial firms to keep their practices in order. Another detail from 2008 that is absent in 2017 is the role of credit agencies, which ranked the worst sub-prime loans as triple-A in 2005 and 2006. These days the regulators have more realistic data to hand. There are also quirks in the official figures that give a false picture of consumers\u2019 financial position. For instance, the official figures show a collapse in the savings rate is to a significant degree the result of pension funds switching funds out of risky assets and into safer ones following the Brexit vote. This depresses the incomes of pensioners\u2019 funds and drags down the savings rate, but is a technical issue and doesn\u2019t indicate that pensioners are on a spree, suddenly spending all their savings. Nonetheless, the regulators need to remain vigilant. Even low rates of default can ripple through the financial system. And should a crash be avoided in the UK, it could still happen in the US, where a Donald Trump inspired credit boom is predicted by many \u2013 with an accompanying hangover. An air war over Europe? Of all the warnings that pro-Brexit voters chose to ignore last June, the notion that planes might cease to link this island to the continent barely figured on the Project Fear register. Nine months on, with the pound depressed, food prices up, and article 50 triggered, it might be worth hesitating a little longer when Ryanair repeats that there is a \u201cdistinct possibility of no flights\u201d for a period when Brexit happens. Of course, Europe\u2019s biggest airline has form when it comes to courting publicity, and many of its chief executive\u2019s wider views on politics come across as headline-hunting exercises. But the Irish airline has a finely tuned sense for aviation agreements, and an ear for blarney, through its disputes with the European commission and its navigation of local employment and taxation laws. So it is worth noting that it has not been impressed by the Department for Exiting the EU\u2019s promises to prioritise airlines\u2019 concerns. The clock is ticking on Britain\u2019s two-year separation, but as Ryanair points out, its own flight schedules need to be fixed a year before that, effectively doubling the speed of Britain\u2019s dash into turbulence. And many of Britain\u2019s international flying rights do not exist outside the EU: there is no fallback agreement. The idea of grounded planes sounds preposterous to British ears; less so to continental airlines and governments, which might appreciate a new competitive advantage. More likely is that in 12 months\u2019 time Britain will face either the further relocation of Ryanair routes \u2013 and some of easyJet\u2019s \u2013 or have to accept Europe\u2019s terms for associate membership of its common aviation area. However, with flights to Europe accounting for two-thirds of all UK air traffic, March 2019 could bring plane-free skies not seen since Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull exhaled its ash in 2010. Such a scenario remains unlikely, because surely a deal will be reached. But the very possibility will make Remainers shake their heads in wonder. Britain has the largest aviation industry in Europe, and to preserve it, ministers must now beg and wheedle to reclaim its rights, which they have just signed away. A mission impossible for Paramount boss? Don\u2019t envy Jim Gianopulos, the new head of Paramount Pictures. Running a Hollywood studio remains a glamorous job, but amid the premieres and parties the challenges are piling up. The US film industry is threatened by the rise of the Netflix-led streaming companies, by rampant piracy and by the popularity of alternative distractions, such as gaming and social media. Then there are obstacles specific to Paramount and its lowly competitor Sony. It is very difficult competing with big hitters like Disney \u2013 owner of the Star Wars and Marvel Comics franchises \u2013 and Warner Bros, the studio behind the Harry Potter universe, and both studio minnows also have struggling parent groups. Gianopulos has some decent properties at his disposal, including the Mission: Impossible series, but he has to take one decision for the greater cultural good. Please, Jim, let the latest Transformers film \u2013 due for release in June \u2013 be the last.",

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, data shows that late last year car loans were being taken out at a faster rate than any time in US history.</p> <p>Almost everyone in America leases a car or buys it using cheap credit. Except that they don\u2019t take the opportunity to lower their outgoings and cut their monthly loan bills. Instead, they take the cheap credit and buy a bigger car. A much bigger car.</p> <p>This applies as much to those on low incomes as the wealthy. And the same trend can be seen in the UK.</p> <p>In 2008 it was the mortgage sector in the US that triggered the worst global financial crash since 1929. US house buyers on low incomes were sold homes by lenders using teaser rates that offered massive discounts for two or three years on standard fixed rates. Refinancing was easy as long as the base rate remained low.</p> <p>Once the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, it become financially crippling to refinance a mortgage and arrears began to creep upwards.</p> <p>By 2006, millions of American families were in financial trouble and by 2008 hundreds of thousands were handing the keys of their homes back, leaving the banks with huge debts on their balance sheets.</p> <p>Today the US central bank is again raising interest rates, and the jump in credit costs is hitting the finances of low-income families, forcing them into arrears or to default on their loans.</p> <p>But the situation is very different to 2008 and even the years leading up to it. Car loans are an important component of the credit market, but are still dwarfed by home loans. As such, it is unlikely that dodgy car-loan books will see the big lenders getting themselves in such deep trouble.</p> <p>The lenders, and especially the big banks, have much bigger reserves, giving them deeper pockets when the times comes to cover their losses.</p> <p>The regulators are also alive to a problem they blatantly ignored ahead of the last crash.</p> <p>Last November, the New York Federal Reserve bank warned that arrears in the sub-prime car-loan sector were a \u201c<a href=\"http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/11/just-released-subprime-auto-debt-grows-despite-rising-delinquencies.html\" title=\"\">significant concern</a>\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Brexit, according to its cheerleaders, offers British businesses the chance to expand trade beyond Europe to the rest of the world. Trade minister Liam Fox infamously said the easy option of shipping goods across the Channel had deterred businesses large and small from looking further afield. They had become fat and lazy, and now they would be forced to be more entrepreneurial. Setting aside the reasons why countries all over the world mostly export to their neighbours (it\u2019s cheaper, and there are shared histories and cultures) and try to do so within free-trade blocs (profits are higher when tariffs are low and regulations are harmonised). let\u2019s consider the question of how fat and lazy business has become. Is it ready to accept Fox\u2019s challenge? One way of making an assessment is to examine the health of exporting hubs around the UK, and the readiness of employers and their workers for the task ahead. In just over a month, local elections in Britain will include votes for six directly elected mayors of combined local authorities, a new layer of local government. This has prompted the Office for National Statistics to pull together figures covering the new areas, from the Liverpool City Region and Greater Manchester combined authorities in the north to the west of England, and the odd couple of the Cambridge and Peterborough combined authority in the east. There will be six new authorities. Leeds, Newcastle and Sheffield failed to make the cut. Sitting in the middle is the West Midlands combined authority, which from 4 May will have a \u00a31.1bn budget to spend on improving local transport and skills. As an economy, the West Midlands should be revving its engines quietly in readiness for Brexit. But the ONS figures show the region has fundamental weaknesses that few would expect, especially when it lays claim to have the UK\u2019s second city at its heart, with hi-tech manufacturing to rival the German Ruhr. One basic measure of economic readiness is the percentage of people in employment. The national average is 73.9%. Of all the combined authorities, the West Midlands has the lowest at 65.1%. It also comes at the bottom of the pile on the ONS measure of labour productivity, with output per hour lower than in Manchester, Liverpool and the rest. One explanation for the low productivity figures might be found in the education sector, where the West Midlands achieves another low. According to the ONS, it has more than three times the average share of population with no qualifications, and a relatively low proportion of residents with a degree-level qualification. The West Midlands, a centre for traditional engineering and manufacturing industries, also has the worst female employment rate of the six authorities. Whatever the reasons, the lack of female participation in the workforce has a significant knock-on effect on average household disposable incomes, which are also the lowest of the six combined authorities. The conclusion must be that none of these tests finds Britain\u2019s industrial heartland in good shape and ready for the brave new world of Brexit. Champions of the region argue there are large pockets filled with hi-tech manufacturing, and that companies in the services sector can claim to be among the best in the country. Jaguar Land Rover and the aerospace firm Moog boast stellar productivity rates, while areas such as Sutton Coldfield are solidly wealthy and stuffed with highly paid graduates. It\u2019s certainly true that the average figures for the region are dragged down by the districts of Sandwell and neighbouring Dudley, which have struggled for years with little private investment or government support. Wolverhampton up the road now has a respected university, but this investment in higher education has so far done little to affect youth unemployment in that city. Another factor depressing the region\u2019s figures can probably be found in the number of skilled workers with productive jobs who would boost the ONS figures if only they lived inside the authority\u2019s boundaries, rather than in leafy Warwickshire and Shropshire villages. But that says much about the failures of policymakers. It says that Birmingham, as the region\u2019s driving force, wasted the Millennium money thrown at it by Gordon Brown in the 10 years before the financial crash in a way that Leeds, Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool didn\u2019t. Sadly, Birmingham\u2019s leaders were unable to construct a living city with a public transport system that knitted the region together. And it shows that the mayor will need more money than is currently on offer, especially when another 10 years of austerity was the main course on Philip Hammond\u2019s budget menu. Council chiefs spend most of their time firefighting to protect the most vulnerable citizens, not debating how to copy London\u2019s cycleways. The combined authority\u2019s \u00a31.1bn budget is spread over 30 years. That will leave local businesses to play a bigger role \u2013 investing not just in their own plant and machinery, but also in the local infrastructure. Do they have the means at a time of extra costs from the apprenticeship levy, higher business rates and the uncertainty that comes with Brexit? It\u2019s a tall order.",

      "bodyText": "The 1969 book The Peter Principle is practically unique among management texts, in that it\u2019s based on a good gag. The premise is that employees are promoted until they reach a job at which they prove incompetent \u2013 a line that\u2019s funny because of its truth, be that for sales directors, banking bosses or foreign secretaries. Anyway, a chap called Tom Schuller has come up with a clever modern twist called The Paula Principle, which argues that most women get promoted to a level below their competence. Far from rising to a position their talents don\u2019t deserve, they languish below what they could easily manage. Assuming that both principles are accurate, women should be paid more than men, as they will be comparatively better qualified for their roles \u2013 but we know from the data that the opposite is true. Which brings us to Thursday, when British businesses with more than 250 employees will have to start collating data on their gender pay gap \u2013 and then publish figures by April 2018. So the problem will be solved and the Peter Principle will be eradicated, then? Maybe not. As Josephine Van Lierop, an employment lawyer at Slater &amp; Gordon, says: \u201cWe expect big-budget organisations to be hiring expert pay consultants to identify and manipulate the numbers.\u201d More the cheater principle, then. Business booming in regulation game Gender pay-gap statistics are just one of the new requirements on businesses imposed from this week. As Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), puts it: \u201cWe enter a new tax year with a raft of changes adding to the upfront cost of doing business. While corporation tax is decreasing, companies are more concerned about the escalating burden of input costs, which hit firms before they even turn over a single pound. \u201cCompanies of all sizes will now see the introduction of the apprenticeship levy, immigration skills charge, a new national living wage, and pensions auto-enrolment. Such costs are likely to cause many firms to implement cost reduction measures, and weigh down on firms\u2019 ability to invest, recruit and grow their business. \u201cThe government must do more to ease the upfront burden on businesses, and allow them to get on and invest, train their staff, and trade all over the world.\u201d All of which is likely to represent the sentiments of many businesses \u2013 although not all. All the consultants about to make a killing, for example. Is Diamond a broker\u2019s best friend again? It has been a while since the results of Panmure Gordon have caused much of a ripple in the City, but that was before we knew it was to be taken over by a consortium that includes former Barclays boss Bob Diamond. Once branded the \u201cunacceptable face of banking\u201d (Diamond, not Panmure) the American financier\u2019s Atlas Merchant Capital is teaming up with QInvest, the Qatari investment bank, to acquire one of London\u2019s oldest stockbroking firms. On Tuesday the firm is due to announce results. All of which should give us a bit more information on what the banker is getting into and will no doubt reignite the debate over whether Diamond has served enough time away from the City after resigning from Barclays in the face of political pressure following the Libor scandal. That was five years ago, and while a lot has remained constant (the 65-year-old\u2019s reputation, plus his stubbornly dark locks) there has at least been some effort to soften Diamond\u2019s hard image. Not least, there was a video posted on social media in December that showed the old banker burping his new grandson, Henry, which is sure to have appealed to City folk. The banker barely looked at the child and instead appeared to be fixated on a Chelsea match on the telly.",

      "bodyText": "This week brought fresh outrage from conservatives as the new secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, told the National Press Club \u201cneoliberalism has run its course\u201d and Paul Keating, seen by many as a neoliberal champion, agreed with her. But rather than provoke cries of communism and class warfare, for anyone who has been paying attention over the past decade, the correct response to McManus and Keating\u2019s assertions should be \u201cwell, duh\u201d. McManus\u2019s speech, in which she not only rang the death knell for neoliberalism but reiterated the right for unions to resist unjust laws (pretty much a central tenet of unions ever since unions were first illegally formed in the 1800s) drew the expected shrieks from the right. The Australian\u2019s editorial, for example, referred to it as \u201cclass warfare\u201d, and Peter Dutton called her a \u201cmodern-day communist\u201d. It\u2019s always class warfare when those representing the low paid worry about inequality. When the most powerful business executives in Australia come to parliament and demand their companies get a tax cut \u2013 as occurred on the same day as McManus\u2019s speech \u2013 class warfare is never mentioned. That\u2019s because neoliberals see company tax cuts as good for workers. A lower company tax, so the theory goes, leads to increased investment, which in turns increases productivity and leads to better pay for workers. It\u2019s a nice theory, and one that works nicely so long as you ignore that over the past decade productivity has risen while real wages have barely grown. The great thing about neoliberalism (a bit of a dopey term, that really just means \u201csmall government-pro-market\u201d policies) is that it always works so long as you ignore all the times it doesn\u2019t. In the 1980s, neoliberal economic reforms did work well, if you ignore the 1987 stock market crash and the deepest post-second world war recession Australia has ever seen. The great period of moderation from the early 1990s onwards, where monetary policy took over the role of stimulating the economy from government spending, also worked well so long as you ignore rising inequality, declining levels of infrastructure, housing affordability, the global financial crisis and the growth of radicalism which has seen racism and xenophobia come into major parties, and a situation where a senator of this country can actually lament in a mainstream newspaper that \u201cmany Jews want to suppress Holocaust denialism\u201d. And the reality is we didn\u2019t need to wait for the GFC to know there were problems with letting the market rule. In climate change, we have the biggest market failure in the history of economics. For pro-free marketers climate change is a nasty bur in their shoe. If you accept climate change could lead to rising sea levels, coastal inundation, dislocation of large masses of people, increased intensity of tropical storms and droughts, and grave risks to food and water supply, then you have to accept the market failed to account for such impacts and not only allowed, but ensured they would happen. Little wonder many free marketeer thinktanks and political parties have instead embraced lunatic theories about climate change being a conspiracy involving the UN, Nasa, every university in the world, China, all major meteorological bodies, the World Bank and the makers of tin foil hats. Delusion is preferable to admitting fault. The love of neoliberalism also sees in Australia an odd nostalgia for the 1980s \u2013 a time where under the Hawke government \u201creform\u201d flourished. Much like the belief in the infallibility of the small government/pro-market policy, the conservative nostalgia for the 1980s only makes sense if you ignore many things. Yes, when the Hawke government took power in 1983 it brought with it a smaller government outlook \u2013 where balancing the budget was crucial, and where lowering tariffs, privatising assets and letting the market operate was championed. But it was also a government that introduced the capital gains tax, the fringe benefit tax, the petroleum resources rent tax, Medicare and the Accord. It was also a long time ago. We are now as close to the 1983 election of the Hawke government as people at that time were to the 1949 election of the Menzies government. Arguing Hawke and Keating\u2019s approach to the economy is the path to follow is roughly as sensible as someone in the 1980s suggesting Ben Chifley\u2019s policy to nationalise the banks was worth exploring. Policy moves forward and good policy should react to failures. And right now there is a lot of failure. From 1990 to 2007 the seven largest economies in the world grew on average by 2.3% each year; since 2010 (which leaves out the two horror GFC years of 2008 and 2009) that growth has averaged just 1.7%. In Australia over the same two periods the average growth level has gone from 3.3% to 2.6%. Things have flatlined so greatly since the GFC that the Treasury now views Australia\u2019s long-term average growth level as 2.75% rather than the previous level of 3%. And remember this is at a period where interest rates and wages growth are at record lows and industrial disputes at near record lows. So when Paul Keating this week responded to McManus\u2019 statement by saying that \u201csince 2008 ... we have a comatose world economy held together by debt and central bank money\u201d, he was stating the bleeding obvious. Such has been the record of the world economy over the past 10 years that you would start to question Keating\u2019s intelligence were he not to assert that \u201cliberal economics has run into a dead end and has had no answer to the contemporary malaise\u201d. It is a view even the IMF \u2013 the former arch champions of neoliberalism \u2013 are also arguing. Last year researchers for the IMF argued the benefits from austerity measures (the most beloved neoliberal measure) were \u201cfairly difficult to establish\u201d but that \u201cthe costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent\u201d. That doesn\u2019t mean we need to return to the 1970s, but neither does it mean we regard all the movements since the 1980s as positive \u2013 whether it be the push for ever lower company taxes, greater industrial relations flexibility, reduced government spending, falling real Newstart payments, failed work-for-the-dole schemes, taxation policy that rewards property speculation and lack of government intrusion to deal with climate change either through a price on carbon or investments in renewable energy and the energy market. Sally McManus isn\u2019t being radical when she argues that neoliberalism has run its course, she is merely responding to evidence.",

Last year researchers for the IMF argued the benefits from austerity measures (the most beloved neoliberal measure) were \u201cfairly difficult to establish\u201d but that \u201cthe costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent\u201d.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean we need to return to the 1970s, but neither does it mean we regard all the movements since the 1980s as positive \u2013 whether it be the push for ever lower company taxes, greater industrial relations flexibility, reduced government spending, falling real Newstart payments, failed work-for-the-dole schemes, taxation policy that rewards property speculation and lack of government intrusion to deal with climate change either through a price on carbon or investments in renewable energy and the energy market. </p> <p>Sally McManus isn\u2019t being radical when she argues that neoliberalism has run its course, she is merely responding to evidence. </p>",
