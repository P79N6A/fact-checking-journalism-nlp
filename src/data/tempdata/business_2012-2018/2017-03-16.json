      "bodyText": "Continued failure by the Coalition government to pass budget savings could lead to an increase of taxes or would require $50bn in cuts to social services to make up an annual shortfall from 2020, the Business Council of Australia has warned. In its pre-budget submission, released on Friday, the peak business body estimates that taxes would have to rise by $5,000 per household or $2,000 per person from 2020 to pay for a looming revenue shortfall. Unlike submissions from the welfare sector that called for a range of new revenue measures, the BCA argues that taxes should not rise to close the budget deficit. On Friday Malcolm Turnbull seized on the BCA submission as evidence the Senate should pass the government\u2019s proposed budget savings, but declined in an interview on 3AW to be drawn into whether further cuts were needed. The BCA submission says that with real spending growth set to increase to 3% from 2020, spending will outpace projected economic growth \u201clocking in a structural deficit of at least 3% of GDP or $50bn in today\u2019s terms\u201d. The BCA chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, warned that \u201cstubborn opposition to savings measures and the absence of an agreed strategy to tackle the budget problem are foisting a growing debt burden on young Australians and our future generations\u201d. \u201cAustralian households will bear the costs of inaction through blunt cuts in services, higher taxes and a weaker, less resilient economy.\u201d The fate of the Turnbull government\u2019s $4bn omnibus savings bill is still unclear, after Nick Xenophon warned in February that the welfare cuts in the bill came at \u201ctoo high a cost\u201d. The bill involves a range of cuts to paid parental leave, scrapping the energy supplement for new recipients, requiring jobseekers under 25 to wait four weeks before accessing income support and cutting the pension to migrant pensioners who spend more than six weeks overseas. The BCA submission notes that $50bn in budget cuts amounts to the equivalent of one-third of the current social security budget, or almost the entire education and defence budgets combined. \u201cNeither of these options \u2013 higher taxation or savage budget cuts \u2013 is acceptable but they are inevitable if we fail to act now,\u201d Westacott said. The deficit \u201cwasn\u2019t created by lower revenues\u201d and therefore \u201cnew taxes are not the solution\u201d, she said. \u201cNor are higher tax rates, as they would do nothing to improve services or increase value for money. We cannot afford to think that as our spending grows, we should simply tax more.\u201d Turnbull said the BCA was \u201cencouraging the Senate to pass our budget measures\u201d, which were still being negotiated. \u201cIf we don\u2019t rein in the deficit ... the inevitable consequence is that we will, and particularly our children will have lesser services or higher taxes.\u201d Asked whether the budget would contain further cuts, Turnbull said the government had already set out a plan to reach budget surplus by 2020-21 but its plans were still subject to negotiation. \u201cWhile we often talk about the crossbench, let\u2019s focus on the responsibility of the Labor party ... the obligation on [Bill] Shorten is to take up the responsibility and help us bring the budget back into balance.\u201d In its budget submission, released in February, the Australian Council of Social Services called on the government to save $9.4bn in 2018-19 with measures including winding back negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts, and abolishing private health subsidies. It also called for a range of new revenue measures, including applying the Medicare levy surcharge to all high-income earners and imposing a sugar tax on sweetened drinks.",

      "bodyText": "The retail tycoon Sir Philip Green has ended his exile from the London social circuit with a lavish party at the Dorchester hotel to celebrate reaching retirement age. The guest list for the event to mark his 65th birthday included the model Kate Moss, the Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly and Sports Direct\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley. Green\u2019s reputation has been battered since the collapse of retail chain BHS, which led to 11,000 job losses. His family seemed to have paid heed when organising this party. In previous years, arrangements by his wife, Tina, included a toga party in Cyprus with entertainment from Rod Stewart and private concerts starring Robbie Williams and Stevie Wonder. This year, the big name entertainer was the magician Dynamo (Steven Frayne). Before the collapse of BHS, Green, who is worth an estimated \u00a33bn, was a gossip column favourite thanks to a glamorous social circle of supermodels and A-list Hollywood actors. But his 65th was a little light on stardust \u2013 possibly following the wrangling over the size of his cheque required to make good the shortfall in the BHS pension fund that had fuelled months of critical headlines. One guest said the party had brought together family, friends and close business associates. \u201cIt was something his family wanted to do for him out of respect for his age and the fact he has always done the right thing.\u201d Green, whose wife is based in Monaco, has a permanent suite at the five-star Park Lane hotel, his base duringthe week. For the party, the Greens took over the China Tang restaurant at the Dorchester to treat 100 friends. At this art deco-inspired venue, cocktails cost \u00a312 while the dim sum starts at \u00a35. But the \u00e0 la carte menu offers scope to loosen the purse strings, with \u00a360 bowls of bird\u2019s nest soup, and whole lobster with noodles available for just under \u00a360. But even if partygoers ordered off-menu, they would have struggled to have equal the \u00a36m tab for Green\u2019s 60th, when guests were flown to an exclusive resort in Mexico for a four-day blowout. Green\u2019s milestone birthday means he is officially a state pensioner, a status that entitles men of his age a pension of up to \u00a3155.65 a week and other financial aid such as the winter fuel allowance. Several years ago, the Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith encouraged the better-off elderly to pay back taxpayer-funded extras such as fuel payments and free bus passes and television licences. Green could not be reached for comment on his plans for the future, but with his new \u00a3100m family super yacht Lionheart, a Saga cruise is probably out of the question. Last year, Green faced calls to be stripped of his knighthood but the pressure for him to face such a censure eased after he reached a \u00a3363m settlement with the pensions regulator last month. The deal, which was backed by the trustees of the BHS pensions scheme, represented a \u201csignificantly better outcome\u201d for former BHS staff than the scheme entering the pension protection fund, the government\u2019s pensions lifeboat. Announcing the deal, Green apologised to BHS pensioners again. \u201cI hope that this solution puts their minds at rest and closes this sorry chapter for them.\u201d The Labour MP Frank Field, who has locked horns with Green over BHS\u2019s fate, said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a better way of rubbing the noses of BHS pensioners and the 11,000 people who lost their jobs in his mess than hosting a birthday party at one of the most expensive hotels in the Britain.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Can budget 2017 fix housing affordability? Here are seven options | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Housing affordability is battling with energy and penalty rates to be the hot-button issue in Australian politics. There was a time rising house prices was seen as a political win, but now the issue is big enough that the government is making noises about making it a key part of the May budget. The latest housing finance figures served to highlight that the issue of housing affordability remains unsolved. After a period of relative easing of investor borrowing, the past six months has seen an explosion in investors getting loans. Investor lending has grown by more in the past year than it has since September 2014. Such growth invariably leads to increases in house prices, so any a cooling in the market appears a ways off: So what to do? As with any policy there is no one solution but here are a few of the proposals around at the moment. Let first-home buyers access superannuation for a deposit This idea was giving a push by Joe Hockey back in 2015, and it is now being mooted as a possibility in the May budget. Back in 2015 I suggested it was pretty harebrained, and nothing has made me change my mind. A big problem with housing affordability is there is too much demand for houses \u2013 from first-home buyers, people looking to buy a bigger house and by investors. This just adds to the demand. It will invariably raise house prices, as it is designed to allow first-home buyers more capital with which to compete with investors \u2013 effectively just putting more money into the hands of more buyers. The measure only makes sense if you view housing as part of a retirement policy and that you are better off owning a home \u2013 and then selling it once you have retired \u2013 than building up your superannuation. That might be true, but is a different issue to housing affordability. The government is reportedly considering a tweak on the policy of allowing people to use their superannuation, but as part of equity \u2013 so when/if the property is sold the proportion of the property value that was purchased using the superannuation would then return to the superannuation balance. This makes it more like an equity financing scheme rather than just eating into your superannuation balance. The politics? The policy has a few roadblocks. The ALP is against it, and the prime minister and finance minister are both on the record as having been against the plan when it was raised by Hockey. Malcolm Turnbull at the time said it was a \u201cthoroughly bad idea\u201d. That\u2019s a pretty tough road to walk back \u2013 but if the policy is different enough it\u2019s a road he might be able to travel. Stamp duty The Victorian government has recently instituted a policy of axing stamp duty for first-home buyers of properties under $600,000, and a sliding scale to $750,000. The hope is that it will help first-home buyers compete with investors or non-first-home buyers. Stamp duty is a tax paid when buying a home, so potentially having to pay $15,535 less upfront on $600,000 property certainly is an advantage. But it\u2019s an advantage sellers will be aware of. It\u2019s why Saul Eslake for example suggests all it will do is raise the price of properties paid for by first-home buyers \u2013 because sellers (and buyers) will know they now have up to $15,535 more dollars to play with. It in effect means just transferring the money from the government to sellers and doing little to make it the cost of a first-home cheaper. But what it would do is at least reduce the upfront cost. The problem with stamp duty isn\u2019t so much that it is a burden for first-home buyers, but that it is a disincentive to selling. It is a tax you avoid if you don\u2019t move. So it creates an incentive to buy a home that is too big for your current needs so you don\u2019t have to sell and buy a bigger home later in life. Similarly it is a disincentive to sell your home and move into something smaller. That reduces the supply of homes \u2013 and crucially in areas that are closer to the CBD. That is why the major recommendations for stamp duty are not about exempting first-home buyers, but getting rid of it completely. A much more efficient tax is a broad based land tax that taxes ownership and not the transfer of ownership. The politics? It\u2019s a big ask. Only the ACT has gone down the land tax route. Stamp duty is a big money spinner for state governments, but it is a tax that you choose to pay. A land tax hits everyone and even if done in a staggered manner as is the case in the ACT, it\u2019s a tough political sell. Equity financing The Victorian government has also announced a plan to allow 400 first-home buyers to go into partnership with the state government when buying their home. Rather than buy 100% ownership of a home, the buyer would purchase (and thus pay) only 75% of the value of the property with the government picking up and holding the rest. This means that when the house is sold, the owners would only receive 75% of the sale \u2013 the government would get the rest. The plan is limited to couples earning up to $95,000, and singles earning up to $75,000, who will need to have a 5% deposit. Unlike the stamp duty policy, this does have the approval of the federal government, with Scott Morrison being quite positive about it \u2013 although preferring the private sector (ie banks). Is it a solution? Well yes and no. Western Australia South Australia already have such schemes place, but there is a risk of having too much of a good thing. The key is keeping it very tightly means tested; as soon as you broaden it, it will just fuel demand. The politics? It\u2019s a pretty easy sell. Increasing the supply of public housing If the issue is housing affordability for the poorest, then one area that could be address is public housing supply, which has fallen to next to bugger all. Prior to the 1990s public sector houses accounted for never less than 4% of all houses built; now they make up just 1.2%. Scott Morrison is proposing a scheme whereby the government raises finance (or bonds) that it then loans to either the community sector or private sector to build low-cost housing. This won\u2019t have a great impact on the ability for people to buy homes per se, but 30% of households are renters, so we\u2019re talking an important segment. The politics? Politically it is a pretty easy sell. The Greens have had a similar, but more expansive policy. And as it is loan it doesn\u2019t add to the budget deficit. Cut negative gearing and capital gains tax Ahh the big one. Negative gearing allows investors to claim a loss and use it to reduce their taxable income. It\u2019s not a new policy, but one that was axed in the 1980s, before political heat saw the Hawke government reinstate it despite the cabinet papers stating that it was \u201ca generally recognised tax shelter\u201d. The big criticism is getting rid of negative gearing will push up rental prices. The old canard is that this happened in the 1980s. It didn\u2019t. Rents in Sydney and Perth rose, but nowhere else. As the cabinet papers at the time noted, \u201clocal influences [rental vacancy rates] rather than tax measures dominate in metropolitan rental markets\u201d: One suggestion is that getting rid of negative gearing caused drop in the building of houses \u2013 and thus a reduction in the supply, which in turn could hurt affordability: And while there was a drop during the period in which negative gearing was abolished, economic activity during that period also fell off \u2013 GDP growth fell from 5.7% in the quarter it was abolished to just 1.1% in September 1986 \u2013 so it wasn\u2019t a period particularly conducive to building activity. One difference is that at the time half of investor financing went into the construction of new homes, now less than 10% does so it\u2019s not like people negative gearing are doing so to build. But even if you love negative gearing, the real issue was in the change of the capital gain tax discount in 1999. The shift from taxing capital gains by accounting first for inflation to providing a straight 50% discount made negative gearing suddenly very attractive. You could buy a property, negative gear it, and then sell it and pay 50% less tax than you would for your income. Very quickly people went from investing in rental properties to make a profit, to instead run a loss for tax purposes: Either reducing the discount, as proposed by the ALP, or getting rid of it completely, as the Greens want to, would take out a great deal of demand in the market even if negative gearing were retained. The politics? There was a time when mucking about with either negative gearing or capital gains tax was political poison. But the ALP nearly won an election with their policy, and given it is the most visible tax policy related to housing, the political hit is less scary than it once was. It\u2019s almost reached the point where not doing anything on this is seen as failing to address the issue in any meaningful way. But given the statements by Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison on the issue last year it would be a great shock to see any changes in the May budget. Zoning changes In the past, new housing developments were much easier because the size of the cities were smaller \u2013 there was more free land to play with, and the outskirts of the city were closer to the CBD than now. This brings with it a couple issues. The new developments need much more infrastructure than previously because of the distances involved and the need to attract businesses to those parts of the city. And secondly those areas nearer to the CBD that could be used for housing development \u2013 such as car parks \u2013 remain undeveloped due to zoning laws, which restrict high and medium density housing. As Matt Cowgill wrote some years ago on the issue, \u201cyou can\u2019t restrict rising density in established suburbs, prevent sprawl on the urban fringes, and prevent housing from being unaffordable\u201d \u2013 you have to pick two. But to increase housing density in areas near where the jobs are, you have to overcome zoning laws that in effect protect the housing values of the current residents. The politics? The politics of Nimbys is tough and local. It\u2019s not just opening up blocks of housing development that is an issue \u2013 increased density brings with it a requirement for better infrastructure and, not surprisingly, not everyone wants an expressway going past their house. It\u2019s one area federal politicians are very happy to comment on, and equally happy to not have any control over. Foreign ownership/immigration There are those who see this as the big issue \u2013 arguing that our increased migration intake has caused demand to outstrip supply and that foreign buyers are pushing up prices. The NSW government, for example, is looking at increasing the stamp duty paid by foreigners purchasing properties. But according to the RBA, the Chinese demand is a small part of the market, and most concentrated in off-the-plan apartments. The issue is less about housing affordability than it is stability \u2013 the worry is that this has fuelled a glut in apartment building in Melbourne and Brisbane. The politics You might argue that immigration has an impact on housing prices, but cutting immigration as a housing policy is a pretty silly way to go in my opinion, and the politics is completely awful. The slope towards racism is incredibly slippery, and it doesn\u2019t take long before you find yourself standing next to Pauline Hanson \u2013 never a good sign that your policy is worth championing. Far better to acknowledge that migration and an increasing population requires governments to address these issues of demand and supply and of infrastructure, and steer clear of the xenophobia.",

      "body": "<p>Housing affordability is battling with energy and penalty rates to be the hot-button issue in Australian politics. There was a time rising house prices was seen as a political win, but now the issue is big enough that the government is making noises about making it a key part of the May budget. </p> <p>The latest housing finance figures served to highlight that the issue of housing affordability remains unsolved. After a period of relative easing of investor borrowing, the past six months has seen an explosion in investors getting loans.</p> <p>Investor lending has grown by more in the past year than it has since September 2014. Such growth invariably leads to increases in house prices, so any a cooling in the market appears a ways off:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of housing finance and house prices\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ecqXo/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So what to do? As with any policy there is no one solution but here are a few of the proposals around at the moment. </p> <h2><strong>Let first-home buyers access superannuation for a deposit</strong></h2> <p>This idea was giving a push by Joe Hockey back in 2015, and it is now being <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-14/government-wont-rule-out-first-home-buyers-accessing-super/8352482\">mooted as a possibility</a> in the May budget. Back in 2015 I suggested it was pretty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/mar/12/allowing-first-home-buyers-to-access-their-superannuation-is-another-harebrained-hockey-idea\">harebrained</a>, and nothing has made me change my mind. </p> <p>A big problem with housing affordability is there is too much demand for houses \u2013 from first-home buyers, people looking to buy a bigger house and by investors. This just adds to the demand. </p> <p>It will invariably raise house prices, as it is designed to allow first-home buyers more capital with which to compete with investors \u2013 effectively just putting more money into the hands of more buyers. </p> <p>The measure only makes sense if you view housing as part of a retirement policy and that you are better off owning a home \u2013 and then selling it once you have retired \u2013 than building up your superannuation. </p> <p>That might be true, but is a different issue to housing affordability.</p> <p>The government is reportedly considering a tweak on the policy of allowing people to use their superannuation, but as part of equity \u2013 so when/if the property is sold the proportion of the property value that was purchased using the superannuation would then return to the superannuation balance. </p> <p>This makes it more like an equity financing scheme rather than just eating into your superannuation balance.</p> <p><strong>The politics? </strong> </p> <p>The policy has a few roadblocks. The ALP is against it, and the prime minister and finance minister are both on the record as having been against the plan when it was raised by Hockey. Malcolm Turnbull at the time said it was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/11/malcolm-turnbull-first-home-buyers-using-super-a-thoroughly-bad-idea\">thoroughly bad idea</a>\u201d. That\u2019s a pretty tough road to walk back \u2013 but if the policy is different enough it\u2019s a road he might be able to travel.</p> <h2><strong>Stamp duty</strong></h2> <p>The Victorian government has <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/moves-for-more-efficient-taxes-go-into-the-toohard-basket-20161020-gs6het\">recently instituted a policy</a> of axing stamp duty for first-home buyers of properties under $600,000, and a sliding scale to $750,000. </p> <p>The hope is that it will help first-home buyers compete with investors or non-first-home buyers. </p> <p>Stamp duty is a tax paid when buying a home, so potentially having to pay $15,535 less upfront on $600,000 property certainly is an advantage.</p> <p>But it\u2019s an advantage sellers will be aware of.</p> <p>It\u2019s why <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/real-estate/victorias-stamp-duty-cut-a-transfer-of-wealth-to-vendors-20170305-gurdug\">Saul Eslake</a> for example suggests all it will do is raise the price of properties paid for by first-home buyers \u2013 because sellers (and buyers) will know they now have up to $15,535 more dollars to play with. </p> <p>It in effect means just transferring the money from the government to sellers and doing little to make it the cost of a first-home cheaper. </p> <p>But what it would do is at least reduce the upfront cost.</p> <p>The problem with stamp duty isn\u2019t so much that it is a burden for first-home buyers, but that it is a disincentive to selling. It is a tax you avoid if you don\u2019t move. So it creates an incentive to buy a home that is too big for your current needs so you don\u2019t have to sell and buy a bigger home later in life. Similarly it is a disincentive to sell your home and move into something smaller. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/22/housing-affordability-scott-morrisons-solution-leaves-us-with-more-questions-than-answers\">Housing affordability?

The latest flurry of excitement was caused when Kristin Forbes broke ranks with her monetary policy committee colleagues and said something should be done about rising inflation. The 8-1 vote was a surprise, as was the evidence that Forbes was not alone in her concerns. Minutes of the MPC meeting said that it wouldn\u2019t take a lot more inflationary pressure for some members to join her in pressing for a tighter stance.

Coming less than 24 hours after the Federal Reserve raised US rates, dealers started to question when the Bank of England would follow suit. The simple answer is not at any time soon.

      "bodyText": "Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has set a new closing high. Relief over the Dutch election result, and the dovish comments from America\u2019s Federal Reserve last night, drove shares higher in London today. The news of a split at the Bank of England over interest rates didn\u2019t spoil the party either. So the Footsie ended the day up 47 points at 7415, beating the previous closing high of 7382 set on March 1st. Mining stocks led the risers, showing optimism for global growth. The pound is also up today -- trading 0.75 of a cent higher at $1.236. That pulled the FTSE 100 back from this morning\u2019s intraday high of 7,444 points (set before the Bank of England revealed that policymaker Kristin Forbes had voted to raise interest rates). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Though Forbes\u2019 decision doesn\u2019t mean that the BoE will be raising rates anytime soon, especially since she leaves the institution in June, with inflation creeping ever higher it does perhaps nudge the MPC closer to a hawkish position. The pound certainly thought so, at least, rising half a percent against the dollar to a 2 week high having been in the red by the same amount earlier in the day after the Queen gave her Royal Assent for the triggering of Article 50. Other European markets have also romped ahead, helping the Stoxx 600 index to close 0.6% higher. The Amsterdam market closed at its highest level since December 2007. The AEX index finished 0.4% higher tonight as traders digested the news that prime minister Mark Rutte\u2019s VVD party had beaten far-right Geert Wilders to first place in Wednesday\u2019s election. Steve Ruffley, chief market strategist at InterTrader, points out that the markets have defied predictions of sharp losses if Britain voted to leave the EU, or if Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Nine months ago, we were warned that Brexit may knock the markets by 10%, if Trump became president maybe they may fall 20%, yet here we stand at record levels. The explanation for this is easy. The world has gone mad. Last night we saw the Fed finally start the path of normalisation on rate with a hike. Predicted to be 1 of 4 but most likely 3. In traditional economic models hikes in rates send markets down. Not in the new exciting world of \u2018no news is bad news for stocks\u2019. On the serious side investors, with a lack of alternatives (interest on cash) have forgotten stocks are a risky investment. What goes up will come down. Ruffley added that 7,500 points is the new \u2018psychological testing point\u2019 for the FTSE 100, suggesting it will continue to rise. Selling new highs is not the strategy in this new \u2018stocks at any cost\u2019 mentality.\u201d And on that note, I\u2019m wrapping up for the night. Thanks for reading and commenting. See you tomorrow. GW With 30 minutes to go, the FTSE 100 is on track to end the day at a new closing high. The jump in the pound at noon today, when the Bank of England interest rate decision hit the wires, has pulled down share prices a little. The blue-chip index is currently up 37 points at 7,406. That\u2019s down on this morning\u2019s intraday high of 7,444 points, but still above the previous record close. Greek counter-terrorism officials are investigating whether the letter bomb sent to the IMF was dispatched from a post office in the Greek capital, insiders say. One tells us: \u201cAll post offices have been ordered to go back through their files,\u201d The blast occurred a day after the Greek urban guerrilla group Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for a parcel bomb sent to the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on Wednesday. The suspicious parcel laced with the sort of explosive used in fireworks was intercepted by German authorities before it reached its recipient. A message posted on the Indymedia Athens anarchist site says: \u201cWe take responsibility for sending the booby trapped parcel to the Germany finance minister.\u201d Greek intelligence officials are working on the assumption that today\u2019s blast may have been orchestrated by the same group. Greek anarchist groups have recently racheted up criticism of the demands made of Greece by the IMF. Security is tight outside the IMF offices near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris this afternoon, as police investigate today\u2019s exploding letter. Over in New York, animal rights campaigners are protesting outside the stock exchange. They\u2019re unhappy that Canada Goose, the retail chain that uses fur on some of its winter coats, has floated on the stock exchange today. There\u2019s rather less action inside the stock exchange, though. After jumping last night, the Dow Jones index is becalmed this morning, down just 0.07%. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has confirmed that one of her colleagues was injured in an explosion at its Paris offices (seemingly caused by a letter bomb). She says: \u201cI have been informed about the explosion in the IMF\u2019s Paris office, which caused injuries to one of our staff. I have been in touch with the office, and my compassion goes to the colleagues there. \u201cI condemn this cowardly act of violence and reaffirm the IMF\u2019s resolve to continue our work in line with our mandate. We are working closely with the French authorities to investigate this incident and ensure the safety of our staff.\u201d Adam Chester, head of economics at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, points out traders now expect the first UK interest rate rise to come a little sooner than before: Early reaction has seen the pound and UK government bond yields spike higher. The pound has rallied back above $1.2350 and \u20ac1.15, and 10-year government bond yields have risen around 7bp to 1.26%. In the money markets, expectations are now fully priced to a rise in UK interest rates by the end of 2018, compared with early 2019 before today\u2019s announcement. Despite today\u2019s split, City economists don\u2019t expect UK interest rates to rise anytime soon. Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, points out that Kristin Forbes\u2019s term on the MPC soon expires: \u201cAs expected, the Bank of England have left policy unchanged. GDP growth in the first quarter looks to have been close to their forecast, with some signs of a slowdown in household spending. \u201cA reduction in the equilibrium unemployment rate, supported by a softening in wage pressures in the latest Labour Market Report, suggests interest rates will remain on hold for now. \u201cThe dissenting vote by Kristin Forbes will have come as a surprise to some, although she is a well-known hawk on the committee, who will be leaving this summer.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, warns savers to expect little help from the BoE: \u2018The Bank of England is showing no signs of blinking in the course it has charted for monetary policy. Inflation may be starting to rise, but interest rates are staying put for the foreseeable future, which is going to cause further pain for cash savers. Households face a currency crunch this year, as weaker sterling feeds through into consumer prices, pushing up the cost of living, while pay growth still looks anaemic. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, says a rate hike would have hurt struggling families: \u201cToday\u2019s interest freeze is no surprise, the Bank of England won\u2019t budge on interest rates for a while yet. With our world thrown into uncertainty by Brexit, wage growth stalling and inflation creeping up they need to tread carefully even with the drop in unemployment. A rate rise today would have put extra pressure on household finances and queued up trouble by stopping stretched households spending at a time when it\u2019s important they continue.\u201d Kallum Pickering of Berenberg predicts that interest rates will stay on hold for at least another year: As our base case, we look for a 25bp first rate hike in the second quarter of 2018, with a 30% chance the BoE raises the bank rate earlier.\u200e After the first hike, the BoE will likely continue to proceed with extra caution, with small and infrequent rate hikes signalled far in advance, and with a strong bias toward remaining in neutral as and when risks to growth surface. The pound has hit a two-week high, on the back of the split at the Bank of England. Sterling jumped nearly a cent when the results of this month\u2019s meeting hit the wires, to $1.235 for the first time since 28 February. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says Professor Forbes\u2019 decision to push for a rate hike has driven the pound up. Like the Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England decided to keep its monetary policy unchanged. BUT it wasn\u2019t a unanimous decision as Kristin Forbes voted for a 25 basis point rise amid concerns over inflation. This caused the pound to jump across the board. Today\u2019s minutes show that eight members of the MPC voted to leave interest rates on hold because they don\u2019t think the UK economy is strong enough to stomach a rate hike. Pay growth had remained subdued, consistent with the Committee\u2019s view that some slack remained in the labour market, and there had been some signs that the squeeze in households\u2019 real income growth was feeding through into spending, as expected. In this context, the conditioning assumption that had underpinned the February projections \u2013 that there would be some modest withdrawal of monetary stimulus over the course of the forecast period \u2013 remained appropriate. The potential for uncertainty over future trading arrangements to affect materially economic decision making remained, posing a downside risk to the activity outlook, to which the Committee could respond if necessary. On the other hand, with inflation rising sharply, and only mixed evidence on slowing activity domestically, some members noted that it would take relatively little further upside news on the prospects for activity or inflation for them to consider that a more immediate reduction in policy support might be warranted. But they also show that Kristin Forbes is rather concerned about inflation; with unemployment at a joint 42-year low, she argued that a rate hike was justified. For one member, the monetary policy trade-off had evolved to justify an immediate increase in Bank Rate. Inflation was rising quickly and was likely to remain above target for at least three years. Measures of domestically generated inflation had also increased notably and, combined with global reflation and minimal labour market slack, posed upside risks to inflation. On the other side of the trade-off, the weakness in activity expected since the referendum had not materialised. Unemployment showed no signs of increasing. Although consumer spending appeared to be softening, as expected, growth was likely to be supported by other components of demand, such as net exports. Therefore, for this member, there was less justification for tolerating inflation above the target for an extended period, although monetary policy should remain nimble. The Bank of England has warned that inflation is likely to smash over its target this summer, partly thanks to higher energy bills. The minutes of this month\u2019s MPC meeting show that policymakers are bracing for the consumer prices index to hit its 2% soon (possibly even next week), and keep rising. The BoE says: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 1.8% in January, fractionally below Bank staff\u2019s expectation at the time of the February Inflation Report, in part owing to weaker clothing and footwear prices, which were typically volatile. Since the time of the previous Report, a number of domestic utility providers had announced increases in gas and electricity prices that were somewhat in excess of the baseline assumptions factored into the February forecast. The net result of the news in the January CPI outturn, recent utility price announcements, and the decline in the sterling oil price was to leave the staff\u2019s expectation for CPI inflation broadly similar to the February projection. CPI inflation was expected to rise to around the 2% target over the next month or so, and, given the impact of sterling\u2019s depreciation, to exceed the target materially by the summer. Here\u2019s some snap reaction from City experts: Kristen Forbes is the first MPC member to vote to raise UK interest rates in over a year. The previous lone hawk was Ian McCafferty in January 2016. It\u2019s worth remembering that Forbes leaves the BoE in June - so she won\u2019t have many more opportunities to vote for a hike. From the Bank of England, my colleague Katie Allen writes: The Bank of England has held interest rates at their record low but its policy committee was split on the decision with one member, Kristin Forbes, voting to raise borrowing costs immediately. Eight members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) felt that the current 0.25% base rate and electronic money-printing programme were appropriate to support the post-referendum economy amid signs that slower pay growth and rising inflation was dampening consumer spending. But Forbes, who leaves the committee at the end of June, felt inflation \u201cwas rising quickly\u201d and was likely to remain above the Bank\u2019s 2.0% target for at least three years. Minutes from this week\u2019s policy meeting showed Forbes also felt \u201cthe weakness in activity expected since the referendum had not materialised\u201d and that unemployment \u201cshowed no signs of increasing\u201d. As such, she voted against the rest of the committee and advocated an increase in the base rate back to 0.5%. It is the first split on the MPC since the aftermath of the Brexit vote in July 2016, when Jan Vlieghe had voted for a cut in interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. The rest of the MPC opposed him but then voted for a cut in August 2016. Here\u2019s the official tweet: Breaking! The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at their current record low of just 0.25%. But in a major surprise, one member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Kristin Forbes, has voted to raise interest rates back to 0.5%. Forbes was outvoted by the other eight members of the committee, though. The Bank has also left its asset purchase scheme (quantitative easing) unchanged at \u00a3435bn. More to follow! Newsflash: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s takeover bid for Sky being referred to media regulator Ofcom. The UK government has asked regulators to investigate whether the \u00a311.7bn deal, launched last December, would give the media mogul too much influence over the UK news landscape. Ofcom must now also judge whether Murdoch family are \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners of the company, following the phone-hacking scandal. Here\u2019s the full story: Brexit continues to loom over the UK economy today. Supermarket chain Sainsbury has warned that sterling\u2019s weakness since last June\u2019s referendum continues to create uncertainty: And Toyota accompanied its new \u00a3240m investment in the UK with a call for \u201continued tariff- and barrier-free market access\u201d with Europe. Newsflash: there are reports of an explosion at the offices of the International Monetary Fund in Paris. In less than 40 minutes, we\u2019ll know the Bank of England\u2019s decision on interest rates. The City widely expects the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee to leave borrowing costs at the current record low of 0.25%. However, the minutes of the meeting may show some more hawkish policymakers making noises about reversing last August\u2019s rate cut, following the Brexit vote. With the Dutch election over, City traders are now refocusing their attention on the French polls in late April. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, Caxton FX\u2019s currency market analyst, says the euro isn\u2019t ou of the woods yet: \u201cThe incumbent candidate, Mark Rutte, was victorious in the Dutch elections. While Wilders\u2019 party secured second place, he is unlikely to be part of the coalition government. The euro strengthened on the results. Markets had feared that a victory for Wilders\u2019 party could lend support to populist candidates in other European elections. A turn to populism in Europe could call into question the strength of the EU and the euro. Traders will be closely watching the French and German elections. Any causes for concern could test euro\u2019s recent lows. French centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron is extending his lead in the betting market -- but votes in the ballot boxes are what counts. Alex Edwards, currency analyst at OFX, says last night\u2019s US interest rate rise is still moving the markets today: \u201cAs far as the markets were concerned, the Dutch election result was somewhat of a relief, and damp squib. The euro has reacted positively to Rutte\u2019s win, or at least it\u2019s been well supported since the result. The Fed decision and statement last night got more of a reaction - Yellen was a lot less hawkish than investors were expecting. If you missed it...the key news was that the Federal Reserve still expects to raise interest rates three times in 2017 (including last night\u2019s hike), rather than getting aggressive and hiking four times. Newsflash: Japanese carmaker Toyota has announced plans to invest \u00a3240m in its UK operations. Despite the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, the Japanese carmarker is planning to upgrade the Burnaston plant near Derby. The money will improve the plant\u2019s competitiveness and promote UK supply chain efficiencies, it says. Here\u2019s Capital Economics on the Dutch election: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is continuing to hit record levels. It\u2019s now up a stonking 69 points at 7438, up nearly 1% today. Plenty of City experts are commenting on the Dutch elections, and what it means for the eurozone. Darren Ruane, Head of Fixed Income at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says Mark Rutte\u2019s first place is boosting share prices today: \u201cThe results of the Dutch election helped to buoy investment markets following a better-than-expected outcome for mainstream parties. In particular, current Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u2019s Liberal Party is projected to take 33 seats in the 150 seat lower house of parliament. \u201cThe anti-Islam Freedom Party, led by Geert Wilders, is seen as a relative loser from the election. Prior to the election, the Freedom Party was a frontrunner in the polls in early January. Given that there is a lack of interest in both the Freedom party to form a coalition with other parties and vice-versa, the party\u2019s policy influence should be limited. \u201cIn investment markets, European equities have risen by around 1% in early trade, although some of the optimism is follow-through from an expected US interest rate decision last night. Government bond yields in Europe are trading only marginally lower from overnight levels. Bond markets were forecasting a benign outcome from the Dutch elections, with a very strong gain for Wilder\u2019s Freedom party required to disrupt markets in a meaningful way.\u201d Anna Stupnytska, Global Economist at Fidelity International, says it could be a \u201cturning point\u201d in the popularity of populist parties \u201cThe poorer than expected performance of Geert Wilders\u2019 Freedom Party is good news for the eurozone, with the euro gaining as the results pointed to a clear victory for Mark Rutte\u2019s centre right VVD party. This is a market positive result, although with a three party coalition looking unviable, a long negotiating period to form a government is likely. This is not helpful for a Greek bailout review. \u201cMarkets will of course now turn their attention to France, where the candidacy of the far right Marine Le Pen arguably poses greater risks. To whatever extent this vote is a signal on France, the high turnout and rally around towards the mainstream centre look bad for her. The structure of the French presidential election also create additional obstacles to any far right victory in France. As such, the Dutch result may be remembered as the turning point in the popularity of populism for 2017.\u201d Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer of TD Direct Investing, says fears that the Netherlands could follow Britain out of the EU have abated. \u201cMark Rutte\u2019s win for the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy today dramatically reduces the likelihood of a referendum to leave the EU. \u201dDespite today\u2019s outcome, there are still other European elections taking place later this year, and undoubtedly continued political uncertainty in the region. But instead of focusing on politics, we should probably concern ourselves more with the fundamentals.\u201d \u201cRising employment continues to propel the eurozone region towards 2% growth. Add in inflation and operational gearing, and growth at a company level starts to look interesting. There are some selected good structural growth stories across Europe. What we\u2019ve learnt from Brexit is that no one knows how key political events are going to transpire, and what the stock markets\u2019 reaction to those events will be. As investors, it is better to stick to what you do know and focus on a long-term investment horizon.\u201d But Pepijn Bergsen of the Economist Intelligence Unit argues that mainstream parties still face a battle against populist rivals: Here\u2019s a handy summary of today\u2019s roaring markets, from the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham: European stock markets have hit their highest level in 15 months, as the Dutch election results calm fears over the region\u2019s stability. Amsterdam\u2019s stock exchange is romping ahead, hitting its highest level since the start of the financial crisis in 2007. And in London, the FTSE 100 is keeping climbing. It\u2019s now up over 50 points at 7423 for the first time ever. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital say \u201cRisk appetite returns in spades\u201d to the markets. The FTSE 100 index hit a record intra-day high as equity markets responded to last night\u2019s decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Despite policymakers being more firmly agreed on three hikes this year rather than just two, markets took it as a dovish signal that the Fed is going to only cautiously tighten as the economy improves. The message was that the economy is firing but inflation is not going to be an issue. It\u2019s in no hurry to raise rates and that is good news for equities. There\u2019s a bit of relief too as the Dutch elections showed no strong support for populists \u2013 helping send the euro to a 5-week high and lifting European equities. A softer dollar is also supporting the risk rally, particularly commodities. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index, made up of shares in medium-sized companies, has also just hit a record high. It gained 97 points in early trading to hit 19,061 points, up over 0.4%. Newsflash: Switzerland\u2019s central bank has held interest rates unchanged at minus 0.75%, and warned that the global economy faces \u201cconsiderable risks\u201d - including Brexit. The SNB says: Chief among these are political uncertainty with respect to the future course of economic policy in the US, upcoming elections in Europe, and the complex exit negotiations between the UK and the EU. Mining stocks are leading the rally in London this morning. That\u2019s typically a sign that investors are more optimistic about the global economy (more growth = more demand for iron ore, copper, coal and nickel). Anglo American, the resource giant, is the top riser - after Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal announced he\u2019s taking a \u00a32bn stake in the company. A \u201crather more palatable Dutch election result than feared\u201d has helped boost risk appetite in the markets, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Markets are being allowed to ponder the potential for less populist French and German political outcomes in the months to come while further US stimulus supports both US growth and Fed policy normalisation, in turn helping global growth. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new record high at the start of trading. The blue-chip index of leading shares gained 40 points to hit 7411 points for the first time ever, up over 0.5% this morning. Other European stock markets are also jumping, as relief over the Dutch elections sweeps trading floors in Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Madrid. And the Amsterdam stock market has gained 0.8% to its highest level since December 2007. RBC Capital Markets says that the Dutch election result is bolstering hopes that a mainstream candidate will win the French presidential elections this spring The electoral spotlight now moves to France where the first round of voting in the presidential election takes place on Sunday April 23rd with the focus on the prospects of Marine Le Pen. Already markets have begun to take some signals (see above) from last night\u2019s Dutch result that the electoral prospects of anti-EU populist parties may be checked. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities says investors are also buying shares on relief that the US Federal Reserve sounded cautious on interest rate policy last night: Investors were looking for Yellen to hint on either 4 rate hikes in total this year or a rate hike sooner than expected, possibly in June in order to further fuel the Dollar rally. On the contrary, the Fed Chief mentioned neither of these possibilities and instead said that the central bank didn\u2019t \u201cdiscuss in detail potential policy changes\u201d The euro hit a five-week high this morning, touching $1.0746 against the US dollar. That\u2019s partly because the dollar is weaker across the board, after the US Federal Reserve was more cautious than expected about future interest rate hikes yesterday. But the Dutch election is also a factor. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: It is all over and public has put an end to the nonsense populist concept which started with Brexit. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has comfortably beaten the anti-Islam Freedom party. We have a moment of calm and this has helped the euro to rally as everyone breathes a sigh of relief. Mr Wilders\u2019 victory could have provided a tailwind for Marine Le Pen\u2019s presidential campaign in France, which could have put the future of the euro in jeopardy. European government bonds are strengthening this morning, following Geert Wilder\u2019s failure to claim first place in the Dutch election. French debt is in demand, as investors take it as a sign that Marine Le Pen might be thwarted in her bid to win the presidency. Reuters has the details: France\u2019s government bond yields hit a one-week low in early trade on Thursday after results of Wednesday\u2019s Dutch parliamentary elections suggested that populist party PVV would come a distant second to the current ruling party. Dutch centre-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte scored a resounding victory over anti-Islam and anti-EU Geert Wilders in an election on Wednesday. French government bonds were seen as vulnerable to a potential victory for PVV, as France faces its own presidential elections in April and May, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen in with a chance to win the keys to Elysee Palace. France\u2019s 10-year government bond yield fell 5 basis points to one-week low of 0.99%. Most other euro zone bond yields were also lower on the day. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Bank of England Day! Over in Threadneedle Street, in the heart of the City, Britain\u2019s central bank is putting the finishing touches to this month\u2019s decision on monetary policy. We don\u2019t expect a change on interest rates, which are currently at a record low of just 0.25%. But the minutes of the meeting will be poured over for signs that the Bank may be considering whether to tighten policy in response to rising inflation. The decision comes at noon. Analysts at PNC believe that yesterday\u2019s unemployment figures, which showed falling pay growth and a rise in self-employment, will encourage the Bank to sit tight for several months. Lower wage growth and a shift to self-employment (possibly a disguised form of underemployment) reinforces our view that slack has increased in the British labor market since the June 2016 Brexit referendum, making a bank rate hike unlikely in 2017. Another reason not to expect a rate hike is that the BoE\u2019s MPC believes Brexit will be a headwind to British output over the medium term, for example by reducing market access for British services exports to EU end-markets which account for 5 percent of the UK\u2019s GDP. We\u2019ll also be mopping up reaction to last night\u2019s US interest rate rise. As we blogged, the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs to 1%, but maintained a cautious approach to normalising monetary policy. That sparked a rally on Wall Street last night, and Europe is likely to follow suit his morning. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says: \u201cThank you, Janet Yellen,\u201d this is today\u2019s market message to the U.S. Fed Chair. The greenback [US dollar] is falling while everything else is in green today after the Federal Reserve delivered on its promise to hike rates by 25 basis points. While this move was widely expected, many market participants were positioned for a more hawkish language and an upgrade in economic projections which didn\u2019t happen City traders believe the FTSE 100 could hit a new record high! European investors are also digesting the results of the Dutch election. Far-right populist Geert Wilders has failed to claim first place, claiming just 20 seats - behind Mark Rutte\u2019s centre-right VVD party which is set to win 33. That appears to leave VVD clear to form a new coalition; it may take a few weeks, but fears of another populist shock victory can now recede. Here\u2019s what you need to know:",

In particular, current Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u2019s Liberal Party is projected to take 33 seats in the 150 seat lower house of parliament.</p> <p> \u201cThe anti-Islam Freedom Party, led by Geert Wilders, is seen as a relative loser from the election. Prior to the election, the Freedom Party was a frontrunner in the polls in early January. Given that there is a lack of interest in both the Freedom party to form a coalition with other parties and vice-versa, the party\u2019s policy influence should be limited. </p> <p> \u201cIn investment markets, European equities have risen by around 1% in early trade, although some of the optimism is follow-through from an expected US interest rate decision last night. Government bond yields in Europe are trading only marginally lower from overnight levels. Bond markets were forecasting a benign outcome from the Dutch elections, with a very strong gain for Wilder\u2019s Freedom party required to disrupt markets in a meaningful way.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Anna Stupnytska, Global Economist at Fidelity International, says it could be a \u201cturning point\u201d in the popularity of populist parties</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe poorer than expected performance of Geert Wilders\u2019 Freedom Party is good news for the eurozone, with the euro gaining as the results pointed to a clear victory for Mark Rutte\u2019s centre right VVD party. This is a market positive result, although with a three party coalition looking unviable, a long negotiating period to form a government is likely. This is not helpful for a Greek bailout review.</p> <p>\u201cMarkets will of course now turn their attention to France, where the candidacy of the far right Marine Le Pen arguably poses greater risks. To whatever extent this vote is a signal on France, the high turnout and rally around towards the mainstream centre look<em> </em>bad for her. The structure of the French presidential election also create additional obstacles to any far right victory in France. As such, the Dutch result may be remembered as the turning point in the popularity of populism for 2017.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer of TD Direct Investing, says fears that the Netherlands could follow Britain out of the EU have abated.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cMark Rutte\u2019s win for the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy today dramatically reduces the likelihood of a referendum to leave the EU.</p> <p>\u201dDespite today\u2019s outcome, there are still other European elections taking place later this year, and undoubtedly continued political uncertainty in the region. But instead of focusing on politics, we should probably concern ourselves more with the fundamentals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRising employment continues to propel the eurozone region towards 2% growth. Add in inflation and operational gearing, and growth at a company level starts to look interesting. There are some selected good structural growth stories across Europe. What we\u2019ve learnt from Brexit is that no one knows how key political events are going to transpire, and what the stock markets\u2019 reaction to those events will be. As investors, it is better to stick to what you do know and focus on a long-term investment horizon.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But Pepijn Bergsen of the Economist Intelligence Unit argues that mainstream parties still face a battle against populist rivals:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pbergsen/status/842282317611728896\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ Some first thoughts on the morning after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DutchElection?src=hash\">#DutchElection</a> .

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn takeover bid for Sky is to be investigated by the media regulator to see if it gives him too much control of news output in the UK and whether the Murdoch family are \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners following the phone-hacking scandal. The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, has referred 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own to Ofcom to investigate potential public interest issues on two grounds. Ofcom, which will now have up to 40 working days, to 16 May, to report back to Bradley on the public interest concerns, will kick off its own concurrent review of whether Fox is \u201cfit and proper\u201d to take control of Sky\u2019s broadcasting licence. Bradley, who had previously said she was \u201cminded\u201d to refer the deal to Ofcom, told MPs she had issued a European intervention notice on the grounds of \u201cmedia plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards\u201d linked to the bid from Murdoch\u2019s company. Bradley, who confirmed the decision in a statement to MPs in the Commons on Thursday, said she had received more than 700 representations about the deal from third parties, \u201cthe vast majority of which supported intervention\u201d. Ofcom will look at whether Fox\u2019s takeover will raise issues of UK media plurality and concentration in Murdoch\u2019s control. The deal will give him full control of Sky News, as well as the Times, Sunday Times and Sun newspapers and the radio group TalkSport, through a separate company News Corp. The second issue is whether Fox is committed to the required editorial standards, such as accuracy and impartial news coverage. In parliament, Tom Watson, shadow culture secretary, questioned whether Bradley\u2019s referral on broadcasting standards grounds would give Ofcom the power to investigate issues including phone hacking and corporate governance failures Bradley said: \u201cNone of the representations [made by Fox] have led me to dismiss the concerns I have regarding the two public interest grounds I previously specified.\u201d She added: \u201cI was clear in my original \u2018minded to\u2019 letter and statement made to the House [of Commons] on 6 March that corporate governance was one of the issues I was referring the matter to Ofcom [about]. I would expect them to look at that. Ofcom is an independent regulator. It is for Ofcom to decide what evidence they want to look at. They are open to look at whatever evidence they feel is appropriate to enable them to make their decision.\u201d Both Watson and fellow Labour MP Ed Miliband raised concerns that Ofcom\u2019s 40-day time limit is not long enough to conduct a \u201cfit and proper\u201d review. Miliband, the former Labour leader, said Ofcom\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d review conducted during Murdoch\u2019s last aborted bid for full control of Sky in 2010 took many months. \u201cCan [Bradley] assure us that if during this period Ofcom seek more time or powers she will grant that request?\u201d Miliband asked in parliament on Thursday. Watson said: \u201cA comprehensive \u2018fit and proper\u2019 test will take time, so that all of the Murdochs\u2019 failures of corporate governance during the phone-hacking scandal and elsewhere can be properly investigated.\u201d Bradley responded: \u201cOfcom have assured me they have the time and powers they need.\u201d She also rejected calls for the fit and proper test to be made a standard part of the public interest criteria in the Enterprise Act, and not sit with Ofcom. \u201cI did very carefully consider the representations made,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important an independent regulator looks at \u2018fit and proper\u2019 and the government has grounds to intervene under the Enterprise Act. Those two have to be kept separate and we should not see government stepping into where the regulator should quite rightly sit.\u201d However, if the regulator cites problems she must decide whether to accept an undertaking from Fox to address them. Opponents of the bid have raised concerns that Murdoch, who also owns the rightwing Fox News, will use his influence to drive the news agenda, thereby risking the \u201cFoxification\u201d of Sky News. Murdoch critics have called for the bid to be blocked. Rival broadcasters are expected to lodge complaints and make representations in the UK and Europe \u2013 the European commission is also examining the deal \u2013 after expressing concerns that a Fox/Sky combination will dominate bidding for top-flight sport, TV shows and movies. Fox News, which is also broadcast in the UK, has fallen foul of the regulator a number of times through editorial lapses. Last year, Ofcom criticised a Fox News programme for breaching the UK code when a guest said Birmingham was a city \u201cwhere non-Muslims just simply don\u2019t go\u201d. Ofcom has already said that Fox taking over Sky\u2019s licence would warrant a \u201cfit and proper review\u201d. During its investigation following Murdoch\u2019s previous attempt to takeover Sky in 2010, it found that Sky remained a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of a broadcast licence, despite the phone-hacking affair that embroiled the now-defunct News Corporation, then parent of Fox and Murdoch\u2019s UK newspapers. However, it published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch \u2013 then chief executive of his father\u2019s UK newspaper group and chairman of Sky: \u2013 it found that his conduct repeatedly fell short of the standards expected. The political fallout ultimately resulted in Rupert Murdoch withdrawing his bidand James standing down as chairman of Sky and quitting the UK newspaper business to run Fox, the film and TV operation, from the US. Rupert Murdoch subsequently spun off the publishing and newspaper assets into a separate company, News Corp, and film and TV into 21st Century Fox, with independent boards, in part a corporate governance measure to facilitate another tilt at Sky. James Murdoch, chief executive of Fox, was reappointed last year as chairman of Sky. In October, he had to rely on the support of Fox, Sky\u2019s largest shareholder, to win approval for his return after more than 50% of independent shareholders voted against his reappointment. At the time of the last bid, the Murdochs agreed a deal to spin off Sky News to allay media plurality concerns. This time James Murdoch has said he does not believe any \u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d will need to be made to get the deal through. In a letter to Bradley during the 10-day period she has had to review whether to refer the bid to Ofcom, Fox argued that in the six years since the aborted bid, the media landscape had changed beyond recognition. Fox said media plurality was flourishing with the rise of digital rivals such as Google and Facebook and news distributors and new outlets such as Vice, Buzzfeed and Huffington Post, while newspaper sales declined. Fox also argues that splitting the publishing and TV and film operations into two companies solves corporate governance, competition and plurality issues. Opponents argue, however, that the Murdoch family will still be the ultimate owner of both newspaper and TV assets in the UK and that that will give them too much control over UK news media. Fox has also pledged to keep Fox News at arm\u2019s length and \u201ccontinue to broadcast news under the Sky brand maintaining its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom broadcasting code\u201d. \u201cWe are confident that a thorough review of our track record over 30 years will underscore our commitment to upholding high broadcast standards, and will demonstrate that the transaction will not result in there being insufficient plurality in the UK,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Fox. \u201cThe media market has changed dramatically in recent years, as has our business. We believe our proposed \u00a311.7bn investment will benefit the UK\u2019s creative industries. We look forward to continuing to work with all stakeholders and are confident that the transaction will be approved.\u201d Ofcom has set a deadline of 30 March for submissions relating to the Fox/Sky takeover. Nick Pollard, an Ofcom board member and former Sky News chief, has excused himself from the Fox investigation process. Pollard, who led the inquiry into the failure of BBC2\u2019s Newsnight to broadcast an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse against Jimmy Savile, worked at Sky from 1996 to 2006. \u201cNick Pollard is recused from any involvement in the public interest test or fit and proper assessment to avoid any perceived conflicts of interest,\u201d said an Ofcom spokesman. The remaining eight members of Ofcom\u2019s board will make the final decision on the public interest test and fit and proper assessment.",

The deal will give him full control of Sky News, as well as the Times, Sunday Times and Sun newspapers and the radio group TalkSport, through a separate company News Corp.</p> <p>The second issue is whether Fox is committed to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/rupert-murdochs-sky-takeover-pass-public-interest-test\">required editorial standards, such as accuracy and impartial news coverage</a>. </p> <p>In parliament, Tom Watson, shadow culture secretary, questioned whether Bradley\u2019s referral on broadcasting standards grounds would give Ofcom the power to investigate issues including phone hacking and corporate governance failures </p> <p>Bradley said: \u201cNone of the representations [made by Fox] have led me to dismiss the concerns I have regarding the two public interest grounds I previously specified.\u201d </p> <p>She added: \u201cI was clear in my original \u2018minded to\u2019 letter and statement made to the House [of Commons] on 6 March that corporate governance was one of the issues I was referring the matter to Ofcom [about]. I would expect them to look at that. Ofcom is an independent regulator. It is for Ofcom to decide what evidence they want to look at. They are open to look at whatever evidence they feel is appropriate to enable them to make their decision.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Both Watson and fellow Labour MP Ed Miliband raised concerns that Ofcom\u2019s 40-day time limit is not long enough to conduct a \u201cfit and proper\u201d review.</p> <p>Miliband, the former Labour leader, said Ofcom\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d review conducted during Murdoch\u2019s last aborted bid for full control of Sky in 2010 took many months. \u201cCan [Bradley] assure us that if during this period Ofcom seek more time or powers she will grant that request?\u201d Miliband asked in parliament on Thursday.</p> <p>Watson said: \u201cA comprehensive \u2018fit and proper\u2019 test will take time, so that all of the Murdochs\u2019 failures of corporate governance during the phone-hacking scandal and elsewhere can be properly investigated.\u201d</p> <p>Bradley responded: \u201cOfcom have assured me they have the time and powers they need.\u201d</p> <p>She also rejected calls for the fit and proper test to be made a standard part of the public interest criteria in the Enterprise Act, and not sit with Ofcom. \u201cI did very carefully consider the representations made,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important an independent regulator looks at \u2018fit and proper\u2019 and the government has grounds to intervene under the Enterprise Act. Those two have to be kept separate and we should not see government stepping into where the regulator should quite rightly sit.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p>However, if the regulator cites problems she must decide whether to accept an undertaking from Fox to address them.</p> <p>Opponents of the bid have raised concerns that Murdoch, who also owns the rightwing Fox News, will use his influence to drive the news agenda, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/08/murdoch-sky-bid-threat-democracy-karen-bradley-media\">thereby risking the \u201cFoxification\u201d of Sky News</a>.</p> <p>Murdoch critics have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/08/murdoch-sky-bid-threat-democracy-karen-bradley-media\">called for the bid to be blocked</a>. Rival broadcasters are expected to lodge complaints and make representations in the UK and Europe \u2013 the European commission is also examining the deal \u2013 after expressing concerns that a Fox/Sky combination will <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/16/murdoch-sky-bid-competition-complaints-rights-deals\">dominate bidding for top-flight sport, TV shows and movies</a>.</p> <p>Fox News, which is also broadcast in the UK, has fallen foul of the regulator a number of times through editorial lapses. Last year, Ofcom criticised a Fox News programme for breaching the UK code when a guest said Birmingham was a city <a href=\"http://https//www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/21/ofcom-criticises-fox-news-for-calling-birmingham-no-go-zone-for-non-muslims\">\u201cwhere non-Muslims just simply don\u2019t go\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Ofcom has already said that Fox taking over Sky\u2019s licence <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2017/update-on-fit-and-proper-assessment-of-sky\">would warrant a \u201cfit and proper review\u201d. </a> During its investigation following Murdoch\u2019s previous attempt to takeover Sky in 2010, it found that Sky remained a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/sky-fit-and-proper-rules-ofcom\">\u201cfit and proper\u201d</a> owner of a broadcast licence, despite the phone-hacking affair that embroiled the now-defunct News Corporation, then parent of Fox and Murdoch\u2019s UK newspapers.</p> <p>However, it published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch \u2013 then chief executive of his father\u2019s UK newspaper group and chairman of Sky: \u2013 it found that his conduct repeatedly fell short of the standards expected.</p> <p>The political fallout ultimately resulted in Rupert Murdoch withdrawing his bidand James standing down as chairman of Sky and quitting the UK newspaper business to run Fox, the film and TV operation, from the US.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch subsequently spun off the publishing and newspaper assets into a separate company, News Corp, and film and TV into 21st Century Fox, with independent boards, in part a corporate governance measure to facilitate another tilt at Sky.</p> <p>James Murdoch, chief executive of Fox, was reappointed last year as chairman of Sky. In October, he had to rely on the support of Fox, Sky\u2019s largest shareholder, to win approval for his return after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/sky-shareholders-revolt-against-james-murdoch-appointment-chairman-agm\">more than 50% of independent shareholders voted against his reappointment</a>.</p> <p>At the time of the last bid, the Murdochs agreed a deal to spin off Sky News to allay media plurality concerns. This time James Murdoch has said he does not believe any <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/murdoch-sky-bid-uk-takeover-ofcom-21st-century-fox-eu\">\u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d</a> will need to be made to get the deal through.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.21cf.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/investors/21cf_response_to_dcms_letter_of_3_march_2017_for_publication.pdf\">In a letter to Bradley</a> during the 10-day period she has had to review whether to refer the bid to Ofcom, Fox argued that in the six years since the aborted bid, the media landscape had changed beyond recognition. Fox said media plurality was flourishing with the rise of digital rivals such as Google and Facebook and news distributors and new outlets such as Vice, Buzzfeed and Huffington Post, while newspaper sales declined.</p> <p>Fox also argues that splitting the publishing and TV and film operations into two companies solves corporate governance, competition and plurality issues.</p> <p>Opponents argue, however, that the Murdoch family will still be the ultimate owner of both newspaper and TV assets in the UK and that that will give them too much control over UK news media.</p> <p>Fox has also pledged to keep Fox News at arm\u2019s length and \u201ccontinue to broadcast news under the Sky brand maintaining its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom broadcasting code\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are confident that a thorough review of our track record over 30 years will underscore our commitment to upholding high broadcast standards, and will demonstrate that the transaction will not result in there being insufficient plurality in the UK,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Fox. </p> <p>\u201cThe media market has changed dramatically in recent years, as has our business. We believe our proposed \u00a311.7bn investment will benefit the UK\u2019s creative industries. We look forward to continuing to work with all stakeholders and are confident that the transaction will be approved.\u201d</p> <p>Ofcom has set a deadline of 30 March for submissions relating to the Fox/Sky takeover.</p> <p>Nick Pollard, an Ofcom board member and former Sky News chief, has excused himself from the Fox investigation process.</p> <p>Pollard, who led the inquiry into the failure of BBC2\u2019s Newsnight to broadcast an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse against Jimmy Savile, worked at Sky from 1996 to 2006. \u201cNick Pollard is recused from any involvement in the public interest test or fit and proper assessment to avoid any perceived conflicts of interest,\u201d said an Ofcom spokesman.</p> <p>The remaining <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/how-ofcom-is-run/ofcom-board\">eight members of Ofcom\u2019s board</a> will make the final decision on the public interest test and fit and proper assessment.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has held interest rates at their record low amid signs of an internal split emerging about how to tackle rising inflation. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee was divided on the rates decision, with Kristin Forbes voting to raise borrowing costs immediately. Other members also indicated that they could join her at future meetings if they felt inflation was rising too quickly. But for now, minutes of the latest policy meeting showed eight members of the MPC felt that the current 0.25% base rate and electronic money-printing programme were appropriate to support the post-referendum economy amid signs that slower pay growth and rising inflation were damping consumer spending. The decision to hold rates in the UK comes a day after the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, raised interest rates to 1% and indicated that further increases this year were likely to keep rising inflation in check. Forbes, who leaves the committee at the end of June, felt that inflation \u201cwas rising quickly\u201d and was likely to remain above the Bank\u2019s 2.0% target for at least three years. Minutes from this week\u2019s policy meeting showed Forbes also felt that \u201cthe weakness in activity expected since the referendum had not materialised\u201d and that unemployment \u201cshowed no signs of increasing\u201d. As such, she voted against the rest of the committee and advocated an increase in the base rate to 0.5%. It is the first split on the MPC since the aftermath of the Brexit vote in July 2016, when Jan Vlieghe voted for a cut in rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. The rest of the MPC opposed him but then voted for a cut in August 2016. The MPC, under the leadership of the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has maintained that it is happy to let inflation rise some way above its target as it trades-off the need to support growth and jobs with keeping price rises in check. But it has repeatedly said there are limits to how much overshoot in inflation it will tolerate. There were hints in the latest set of minutes that other policymakers could join Forbes this year in voting for a rate rise. The minutes said: \u201cWith inflation rising sharply, and only mixed evidence on slowing activity domestically, some members noted that it would take relatively little further upside news on the prospects for activity or inflation for them to consider that a more immediate reduction in policy support might be warranted.\u201d The pound strengthened after news of the split decision as traders took it as a sign that interest rates could be raised sooner than previously thought. Sterling hit a two-week high of $1.235 immediately after the announcement. Inflation has been rising in recent months, hitting its highest level in more than two years in January at 1.8% on the back of higher oil prices and as the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote raises the cost of imports to the UK. The MPC expects inflation to rise to about the 2% target it has been set by the government \u201cover the next month or so\u201d, the minutes said. The committee expects inflation to \u201cexceed the target materially by the summer\u201d. On the other hand, the minutes also noted signs of softness in the economy and justifications to keep ratesdown. The MPC said pay growth, which has been slowing in recent months, had turned out to be \u201cnotably weaker\u201d on the latest figures than the Bank had been expecting in its latest set of economic forecasts in February. Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Markit, said that despite Forbes\u2019s vote for a rate rise there was little chance borrowing costs would go up soon. \u201cWe maintain the view that the Bank of England is highly likely to sit tight on interest rates through 2017 and 2018 \u2013 and very possibly beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we believe the next move in interest rates will be up, we do not see this happening before 2019 and it could well be delayed further by prolonged economic and political uncertainties. \u201cHowever, given major uncertainties over the UK economic outlook, nothing can be ruled out on the interest rate front.\u201d Economists at Barclays also see rates staying on hold for the foreseeable future and said the committee appeared broadly united. \u201cApart from Kristin Forbes, who will be leaving the Bank at the end of June, we believe clear diverging views still need to be articulated and expressed by individual members to upset the status quo,\u201d Barclays said in a research note. The vote was the first, and will be one of the last, for the Bank\u2019s deputy governor Charlotte Hogg, who resigned this week after it emerged she had failed to disclose that her brother works for Barclays, which is regulated by the Bank of England. Her departure was announced after MPs concluded that she was not up to the role she was promoted into barely two weeks ago. A departure date has not been agreed for Hogg but she is likely to stay on for up to three months.",

      "bodyText": "Toyota is to invest \u00a3240m into modernings its car plant in Derbyshire in a major boost for the automotive industry after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The Japanese carmaker will upgrade the plant in Burnaston with new equipment, technology and systems with the help of \u00a321.3m from the government. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said Toyota\u2019s investment demonstrated its faith in employees at the site. However, the European boss of Toyota warned tariff-free access from the UK to the continent was vital to the future success of the plant. Johan van Zyl, president and chief executive of Toyota Motor Europe, said: \u201cContinued tariff- and barrier-free market access between the UK and Europe that is predictable and uncomplicated will be vital for future success.\u201d Bosses in the automotive industry have consistently warned the government that leaving the EU and the single market could have a damaging impact on UK plants because of the number of cars that are exported and the high proportion of car parts that are imported. On average just 41% of the parts in a car assembled in the UK are made in this country, meaning leaving the single market could add time and cost to production. 80% of vehicles assembled in the country are exported. There are concerns that General Motors\u2019 Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port, Merseyside, and Luton, Bedfordshire, could be downsized or even closed after the business was bought by Peugeot. BMW has also warned it could make the new electric Mini in Germany rather than its factory in Oxford. However, since the referendum last June Nissan has committed to expanding its factory in Sunderland while Jaguar Land Rover has also pressed ahead with investments in its factories. Toyota said it will look to source more components from the UK, which could offset the impact of currency fluctuations and soften the blow of tariffs. The company builds the Auris hatchback and Avensis family car in Burnaston. It also has an engine plant in north Wales and employs more than 3,000 people in Britain. Van Zyl said: \u201cThis upgrade of Toyota Motor UK is a sign of confidence in our employees and suppliers and their focus on superior quality and greater efficiency. We welcome the UK government funding contribution for this activity. \u201cOur investment demonstrates that, as a company, we are doing all we can to raise the competitiveness of our Burnaston plant in Derbyshire.\u201d The support from the government is far more transparent than it was for Nissan. The government has been heavily criticised for not revealing the details of what reassurances it offered Nissan before the company committed to investing in its Sunderland. However, it is know that Clark sent a letter to the company. The government backing for Toyota is subject to an independent assessment and due diligence. It is designed to support training and research and development. Clark said: \u201cOur automotive sector is one of the most productive in the world and Toyota\u2019s decision to invest \u00a3240m upgrading its Burnaston plant is a further boost to the UK auto sector. \u201cToyota is one of the world\u2019s largest car producers and this inward investment underlines the company\u2019s faith in its employees and will help ensure the plant is well positioned for future Toyota models to be made in the UK. \u201cAs we prepare to leave the EU, this government is committed through our industrial strategy to ensuring the UK remains one of the best places in the world to do business and we are able to help businesses seize on economic opportunities.\u201d Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the investment was welcome news. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that investment continues in plants across the UK to maintain our global competitiveness and put us in the best position to secure new models in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a decline in investments in the sector last year, government must continue to collaborate with industry and, as we leave the EU, deliver a deal that safeguards as many of the trading benefits we currently enjoy.\u201d However, experts warned that Toyota\u2019s investment was far smaller than how much it is spending in other parts of the world. Nigel Driffield, professional of international business at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cToyota\u2019s announcement may be considered \u2018business as usual \u2013 for now\u2019. The \u00a3240m investment is dwarfed by the proposed $10bn that the company intends to invest in the US over the next five years, and is an amount that is not much more than \u2018ticking over\u2019. \u201cHowever, this announcement by Toyota is further evidence that the car industry is confident that even in the event of a hard Brexit it will get the type of support that it needs from the Government to remain competitive.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has warned that the impact of cost pressures from the post-Brexit vote decline in the pound remains uncertain as it reported a slight fall in sales at its supermarkets. The UK\u2019s supermarket chains are facing higher import costs following the fall in the pound against the dollar and the euro since the June referendum, as well as some commodity price rises. According to Kantar, food inflation doubled last month to 1.4% year on year as the cost of everyday staples such as butter and tea rose, suggesting that household budgets will come under more pressure this year. Sainsbury\u2019s posted a 0.5% fall in like-for-like supermarket sales, excluding fuel, in the three months to 11 March, down from a rise of 0.1% in the previous quarter. However, 4.3% like-for-like sales growth at the catalogue retailer Argos, bought by Sainsbury\u2019s last year in a \u00a31.4bn deal, helped offset the decline in supermarkets. Combined Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos sales excluding fuel, at stores open at least a year, were up by 0.3%. Sainsbury\u2019s share price fell 3% in early trading after it reported the quarterly figures on Thursday, before recovering and were later 0.6% down. Rivals Tesco and Morrisons also slipped. \u201cThe market remains very competitive and the impact of cost price pressures remains uncertain,\u201d said Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe entered the quarter with deflation and exited the quarter with inflation in the business.\u201d He insisted Sainsbury\u2019s had done a \u201cremarkable job\u201d riding out the storm since the Brexit vote. He said that while some of the cost rises caused by the weak pound had been passed on to customers, the group was working hard with suppliers to keep prices down. \u201cThere are cost price pressures in the supply chain but we have done a good job of mitigating them ... to minimise the impact on consumers.\u201d He saw little evidence of worsening consumer sentiment, so far. \u201cConsumer incomes are still growing, albeit slightly slower than before Christmas.\u201d About 5% of Sainsbury\u2019s workforce hails from the EU, \u201can important part of our organisation,\u201d Coupe said, when asked about Theresa May\u2019s triggering of article 50 to start the Brexit process, expected by the end of the month. \u201cWe are still in a very uncertain phase; as ever we\u2019ll deal with whatever comes our way.\u201d The company blamed the dip in supermarket sales on the later timing of Easter and Mother\u2019s Day this year, saying sales would have been up 0.1% otherwise \u2013 matching the 0.1% rise reported over the Christmas period, Sainsbury\u2019s first sales growth since March 2016. The timing depressed sales of household goods, gifts and other general merchandise, down by 4%. Argos enjoyed strong sales of mobile phones, video games, wearable tech and sports equipment in the latest quarter, boosted by the launch of the Nintendo Switch console and sim-free mobile phones. The company plans to put 250 Argos outlets into Sainsbury\u2019s stores over the next three years, up from 41 at present, with another 25 concessions planned for the next quarter. This will involve some Argos high-street closures. Coupe described the group\u2019s food performance as solid and said its Tu clothing brand had again beaten the market, with sales up 5%. He was confident of achieving City forecasts for the full year, a pretax profit of about \u00a3578m. Sainsbury\u2019s has extended its pre-prepared vegetable range with products such as butternut squash waffles and sweet potato tagliatelle. It has also reduced promotions \u2013 favouring lower regular prices instead \u2013 as well as lowered operating costs and cut food waste. Sainsbury\u2019s is expanding its \u201cWaste less, save more\u201d initiative to more than 140 city boroughs, towns and villages across the UK. Coupe strongly denied suggestions that the target to get consumers to halve household waste had been ditched. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at broker ETX Capital, said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s did very well when Tesco and others were struggling but is now facing its own challenges. It will be tough going for Sainsbury\u2019s in 2017 as in addition to tough competition it must contend with all the sector-wide problems like falling margins and the sterling squeeze from suppliers. Falling margins and profits don\u2019t look great when the market is growing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The cost of supporting new windfarms and nuclear power stations to meet the UK\u2019s carbon targets will add nearly \u00a3100 to the average household energy bill by the end of the next decade, according to a government adviser. But the Committee on Climate Change said it expected the increase to be more than offset by savings as people switched to more efficient fridge freezers, LED bulbs and better boilers. The committee, a body of experts set up under the Climate Change Act to advise the government, found that a rise of \u00a3105, or 9%, to the average \u00a31,160 dual fuel bill in 2016 was down to green policies. These included subsidies for windfarms and solar power through schemes such as the Renewables Obligation. A report by the committee predicts that meeting the UK\u2019s carbon targets would see the cost of the subsidies rise to \u00a3200 of an average bill of \u00a31,350 by 2030. However, other factors were involved in the net increase. The committee also calculated that rising wholesale energy costs and other issues will add more than \u00a3200 a year to bills, while an ongoing switch to more energy-efficient appliances and gadgets is expected to save \u00a3150. Matthew Bell, chief executive of the committee, told the Guardian that he thought it was worth spending the money on climate policies. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re acting to reduce our emissions is climate change poses real risks, real risks to the UK as well as round the world.\u201d The cost was relatively modest, he said, adding: \u201cWhat our analysis says quite clearly is that as a proportion of total energy costs, climate costs are a small minority portion. The vast majority of your energy bill is accounted by other things, like wholesale costs and transmission costs.\u201d Five of the big six energy suppliers have announced price hikes over the winter, sparking calls for a cap on bills. Three energy companies outside of the major supplier group, including Bristol-based Ovo, which has 680,000 customers, and smaller suppliers Octopus and Utility Warehouse, signalled their support on Thursday for a relative price cap. The cap has been proposed by the Conservative MP John Penrose and would limit the gap between the best and worst deals on the market. About 50 MPs have backed a motion to be debated in parliament on Thursday, on the need to protect consumers on standard variable tariffs, which are the most common deal for British households. Some of the energy companies, such as German-owned E.ON, laid the blame for their rises partly on the cost of supporting green policies. But the Committee on Climate Change said that such policies had in fact shaved \u00a3290 a year off the average household energy bill between 2008 and 2016, because they had encouraged a shift to A-rated fridge freezers, condensing boilers and a swing away from incandescent lightbulbs to energy-saving ones. Bell said that future progress on more energy-efficient appliances was slowing slightly, but there was still potential for huge savings. \u201cWe\u2019re still seeing only 1% of lighting being LEDs. And what we\u2019ve not factored in at all is what IT will do for how we manage energy in our homes.\u201d The committee said British households\u2019 energy costs are not high compared to the rest of Europe. Residential electricity prices are below average, and gas prices the third lowest among 15 EU countries. Despite the government recently announcing a review into energy costs for businesses, the committee said climate policies were adding relatively little to companies\u2019 bills and had not affected UK plc\u2019s competitiveness. Rebecca Williams, energy specialist at WWF, said: \u201cThis report shows that energy companies are wrong to blame the increase in energy bills solely on UK government policies. It is clear that the main driver here is rising fossil fuel costs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australian cricketing greats Ian and Greg Chappell have signed an open letter calling on Indian billionaire Gautam Adani to abandon his company\u2019s proposed Queensland coalmine. The Chappells, well-known through their sporting exploits in India where the Australian team is currently playing, joined 90 prominent Australians in the letter, which will be delivered to Adani\u2019s head office on Thursday. Signatories include former Labor federal environment minister Peter Garrett; authors Richard Flanagan, Tim Winton and Helen Garner; Telstra chair John Mullen; investment banker Mark Burrows; and former Australian of the Year, Prof Fiona Stanley. The letter will be hand-delivered by Geoff Cousins, the businessman, environmental activist and former adviser to then Australian prime minister John Howard, who hopes to appeal to the Adani family\u2019s concern for their business reputation. The move was ridiculed by federal government MP George Christensen, who railed against the signatories as \u201celitist wankers\u201d trying to wipe out job opportunities for struggling regional Queenslanders. Christensen said in a statement: \u201cStyling themselves as \u2018prominent Australians\u2019, these elitist wankers include investment bankers, CEOs of major corporations such as Telstra, pretentious literati, professional activists and has-been celebrities. \u201cI\u2019d love for just one of them to come down to the Larrikin Hotel in Bowen and explain to the locals there who have been suffering from a stalled economy for years on end, why they think the jobs from the Carmichael Mine and Abbot Point coal port expansion should not be created.\u201d Ian Chappell told the ABC that opposition to the mine in Australia could affect sporting ties with India. \u201cCricket has a bit to do with the feeling between India and Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thought that this [mine] could affect the relationship, hopefully that\u2019ll get through.\u201d Cousins is leading an \u201calternate delegation\u201d to India, where the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and six regional Queensland mayors are on a trade mission to build support for Adani\u2019s mine. \u201cThe Queensland premier and mayors are on a dangerous junket to promote a damaging project. We are in India to tell Adani that Australians do not want this coalmine and will continue to fight it tooth and nail,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cWe would welcome Adani\u2019s investment in solar instead.\u201d Cousins told the ABC that \u201cthe Adani family, one can see from all their published material, is very proud of their reputation.\u201d \u201cWhat often makes the coin turn is [if] the company can see the project will have such a bad influence on their reputation.\u201d His delegation includes a Great Barrier Reef tourism operator, a grazier near Adani\u2019s mine site and an Australian Marine Conservation Society campaigner, who all warn of the damaging impacts of what would be one of the world\u2019s largest coal projects. The AMCS campaigner Imogen Zethoven said the mine would put the reef in peril in coming decades, as it suffers another mass bleaching event after its worst-ever bleaching in 2016 which killed nearly a quarter of its coral. One of Australia\u2019s foremost experts on the reef, Terry Hughes, has also called for the scrapping of the Adani mine, saying it could potentially compound risks to the reef in its weakened state. Palaszczuk said last month the meeting in India with the mining company would be \u201ccritical ahead of Adani making its final investment decision in April\u201d. She said the mine proposal was closely scrutinised and \u201coffered the potential for thousands of new jobs across regional Queensland\u201d. Palaszczuk said her government had remained true to its 2015 election commitment to protect the reef and sensitive wetlands from dredging as part Adani\u2019s planned port expansion. It had also delivered on its promise not to use taxpayer funds to subsidise Adani\u2019s infrastructure. However, the state government holds veto power over Adani\u2019s application for a $1b federal government loan to build a railway to link the mine to its port hundreds of kilometres away. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility says it \u201cwill not proceed with making an investment decision, and further consideration of an investment proposal will cease if at any time the relevant state or territory government provides written notification that financial assistance should not be provided to the project\u201d. Cousins said that \u201cpolls show the majority of Australians are appalled that Adani [would get] a $1bn handout of public money to finance a project banks won\u2019t touch\u201d. The rail company Aurizon has lodged a rival bid for NAIF funding for a railway line to the Galilee basin, it was reported on Thursday. Aurizon\u2019s proposal rail line would cost up to $1b less than Adani\u2019s, the Courier-Mail reported.",
