      "bodyText": "Joe Hockey has sought to reassure Australians about the strength of the local and global economies after sharp falls on China\u2019s main share market triggered jitters on other markets around the world. Australia\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 and All Ordinaries indices fell more than 4% on Monday \u2013 their largest one-day drop since January 2009 \u2013 and further losses were expected on Tuesday. Traders around the world were influenced by an 8.5% drop in the value of the Shanghai Composite Index, the biggest one-day decline since 2007, prompting China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, to declare it \u201cBlack Monday\u201d. On Tuesday, the Australian treasurer sought to reassure people worried about the market falls. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely confident, absolutely confident, that the fundamentals of the Australian economy and the global economy are still good, are still good. Without doubt, that is the situation.\u201d Hockey told the Nine network\u2019s Today Show. He said countries did not have the same \u201cfirepower\u201d \u2013 or the capacity to cut interest rates and engage in stimulatory spending \u2013 as they did at the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, but added: \u201cIn fact there is no crisis now. It is a correction.\u201d The treasurer said China \u2013 Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner \u2013 had a plan to ensure strong economic growth. Hockey met last week with a senior Chinese economic figure who \u201creassured us, from his lips to our ears, that China would use whatever tools it has available to make sure that it grows relatively strongly this year\u201d. Hockey said despite the falls, the Chinese stockmarket was still 40% higher than it was 12 months ago \u201cand there has been a lot of flighty money in the Chinese stock market, so that\u2019s part of the equation\u201d. In an interview on 3AW, Hockey said the Chinese stock market was \u201cquite irrational\u201d. \u201cThere are going to be gyrations, there is going to be volatility, so we\u2019ve got to come back to the core business of the economy. In Australia last month 38,000 new jobs were created,\u201d he said. The same jobs figures showed the unemployment rate in Australia increased to 6.3% in July in seasonally adjusted terms. Hockey said he would travel to Turkey next week to meet with G20 finance ministers and central bank governors and \u201cthe world is coming together to deal with these sorts of issues\u201d. Last month, Hockey stood by his budget forecasts, outlined in May, for China\u2019s economic growth after the country experienced sharemarket volatility.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Female managers earn 22% less than their male counterparts and \u201cwork for free\u201d for nearly two hours a day, research shows. According to a survey of more than 72,000 managers in the UK, the difference in pay equates to one hour and 40 minutes of unpaid labour a day by women, or 57 working days a year. The gender pay gap across management professions now stands at \u00a38,524, with male earnings averaging \u00a339,136 compared with \u00a330, 612 for female managers, according to the survey, carried out by the Chartered Management Institute and the pay analysts XPertHR. Although the gender pay gap has narrowed, from 23% in 2014, the researchers highlighted the stubbornness of the difference since equal pay legislation was introduced in 1970. Mark Crail, content director of XpertHR, said: \u201cAn entire generation has now worked its way through from school leaver to retirement since the first equal pay legislation came into effect in 1970, yet the gender pay gap persists. Many employers still prefer not to know just how bad it is in their organisation rather than getting to grips with the data and doing something about it.\u201d Next year the government will introduce new rules forcing companies with more than 250 workers to disclose the pay gap in their workplaces, despite fierce resistance from employers. David Cameron has vowed to end the gender pay gap within a generation and has said the new rules would create the pressure needed to drive up women\u2019s wages. The CMI\u2019s chief executive, Ann Francke, said transparency would be a powerful driver to close the gender pay gap. \u201cThe government\u2019s new reporting legislation is a welcome step forward and will be good news for business. Clearer employee data, improved recruitment and a reinvigorated focus on business culture will help unblock the talent pipeline and support more women to become senior managers and leaders.\u201d But Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, the UK\u2019s trade union body, said the government needed to do more. \u201cThe government\u2019s move to require companies to publish pay gap information is positive, but it doesn\u2019t go far enough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need pay transparency and equal pay audits, and a requirement on companies to act on the data to close the gap. \u201cThe UK will never really address the problem of unequal pay until there are systems in place to expose and tackle the huge gap between what men and women doing similar jobs in the same workplaces are paid.\u201d Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, said employers needed to take down barriers that prevented women from progressing and maintain the pipeline of talent. \u201cOne way forward would be to ensure that senior roles are advertised on a part-time basis or as a job-share unless there is a good business case for not doing so.\u201d The national gender pay gap \u2013 reflecting average pay across all workplaces \u2013 is now at its lowest level since records began. The difference was 9.4% in 2014, compared with 10% a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics, but researchers say this reflects a larger drop in men\u2019s wages compared to women\u2019s, rather than an advance in female pay. The latest CMI/XPertHR survey underscores how the pay gap widens at the top of organisations, with men more likely to be promoted to the most senior roles. Although women outnumber men in entry-level and junior management jobs, they are not progressing to the most senior and lucrative roles. Women made up 67% of the management workforce in entry-level roles, but only 43% of senior managers and 29% of directors. Those women who do smash the glass ceiling are also likely to earn lower pay and a smaller bonus than their male counterparts. While men in director roles earned \u00a3138,699 on average, their female equivalents took home \u00a3123, 756. The average male bonus was almost twice as high, at \u00a34,898, compared with \u00a32,531 for women. The executive pay gap reflects the fact that women are less likely to occupy the most powerful positions in British companies. Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, the government championed getting more women on to company boards, but progress has been slower when it comes to promoting women into the most powerful decision-making jobs in the boardroom: the roles of chief executive, chief finance officer and chair. Women now hold 23.5% of FTSE 100 directorships, almost double the number in 2011, when the target was set. But they still account for only 8.6% of all executive roles in FTSE 100 companies \u2013 still an all-time high that compares with 5.5% in 2011. Francke said: \u201cHaving more women in senior executive roles will pave the way for others and ensure they\u2019re paid the same as their male colleagues at every stage of their careers.\u201d The national management salary survey is based on poll responses from 72,206 employees working in 317 private and public-sector organisations in the UK, including manufacturing, finance and IT.",

      "bodyText": "It was a tumultuous Monday on Wall Street, as the US stock market suffered its biggest one-day fall since 2011 over fears of a collapse in the Chinese economy. The Dow Jones Industrial average lost 586 points, or 3.56%, recovering slightly from when it plunged 1,089 points on Monday morning. The S&amp;P 500 lost about 3.9%, closing at a seven-month low, and Nasdaq lost 3.8%. Markets across the rest of the world suffered some of the biggest one-day falls this year, which greatly reduces the chance of the US Federal Reserve moving to increase interest rates in September \u2013 a move economists had expected. Despite the rollercoaster of stocks plunging, recovering and diving again, business seemed to be moving on Wall Street itself, as tourists snapped pictures of the New York stock exchange and traders rushed outside to grab a quick bite to eat or pick up delivery, saying they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the press. Those not working for the stock exchange offered candid viewpoints on the drama on Wall Street, with most advising against panic or worry because the numbers will sort themselves out. Two Deutsche Bank employees having lunch outside the stock exchange were unsurprised the events of the morning, and said they thought the fall was \u201ceasily predictable\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not unexpected so we move forward,\u201d said one employee, declining to give his name. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for these kind of things.\u201d The White House issued a statement to reassure worried investors that the US economy would be able to withstand the global economic slowdown better than it did in 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a near-meltdown of the global banking system. \u201cThere is no doubt the global economy is more interconnected that it ever has been,\u201d Josh Earnest, Barack Obama\u2019s chief spokesman, said. \u201cWhat I would encourage people to evaluate is the ongoing strength and resilience of the US economy.\u201d Two attorneys going about their days on Wall Street agreed with Earnest\u2019s sentiment. Jon Werner, an attorney at Lyons and Flood, said in terms of long-term trends, there wasn\u2019t too much to worry about. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a sort of natural consequence to the repeated message that\u2019s been given by the Federal Reserve that we\u2019re going to end this era of low interest rates,\u201d Werner said. \u201cThat message has fallen on deaf ears for such a long time, so it finally seems to be getting some traction, with people feeling some uneasiness.\u201d Frank Stone, also an attorney for a private law firm who works with people involved in the stock exchange, said not to panic because the fall is an adjustment from which the market can bounce back. \u201cPeople are panicking because when you lost a lot of money, it\u2019s a very traumatic experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may take some time but it\u2019s going to come back. Hold tight and hold your breath.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China has been a major contributor to economic growth and low global inflation for more than two decades. But tonight, investors around the globe are catching their breath after one of the worst day\u2019s trading in many years. They\u2019re now pondering whether today marks the start of a new and alarming phase of the crisis which began some eight years ago. Mohamed El-Erian, former CEO of Pimco, believes today\u2019s rout has sunk any prospect of US interest rates being raised next month. But he doesn\u2019t believe we\u2019re heading into a major crisis. El-Erian told Bloomberg TV tonight: \u201cI\u2019m not a buyer that this is the crisis of all crises. Yes, this is a very unpleasant repricing, very unpleasant. And it\u2019s going to go quite deep, but it\u2019s not going to derail the economy in a major way.\u201d And while today\u2019s losses are sizeable, they\u2019re not among the worst losses in market history. For all the talk of Black Monday in China, and gloomy photos to match, this was more of a correction in Western markets. One to remember for years to come, though. In a few hours, Asian markets will reopen; investors could drive a recovery, or send markets deeper into the red. We\u2019ll have a new liveblog up and running to cover the action. In the meantime, here\u2019s a short summary: The US stock market has suffered its biggest sell-off in four years. The Dow Jones ended the day down 588 points, having shed more than 1,000 points in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are both in correction territory tonight, down 10% on their recent peaks. In London, almost \u00a374bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 index, in a rout led by mining giants. European stock markets suffered their worst days trading since 2011. The selloff began in Asia 19 hours ago, where Australia\u2019s market suffered its biggest fall since 2009 and Japan\u2019s Nikkei slumped over 4%. But China was the worst hit, with the Shanghai composite index dropping 8,5% in the biggest selloff since 2007. These photos show how the mayhem unfolded Thanks for reading, and for all the comments. Goodnight! GW Today\u2019s drama dominates the front pages of Tuesday\u2019s UK newspapers: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, argues that today\u2019s crash isn\u2019t just about China; it\u2019s about fears that central banks are preparing to reduce their stimulus measures: Financial markets in the west have been booming for the past six years at a time when the real economy has been struggling Recovery from the last recession has been patchy and weak by historical standards, but that has not prevented a bull market in equities. The reason for this is simple: the markets have been pumped full of stimulants in the form of quantitative easing, the money creation programmes adopted by central banks as a response to the last crisis.... More here: Today\u2019s selloff isn\u2019t just about share prices. Commodity prices have also been hit by worries over China; oil tumbled 6%, platinum is down 3.5%, and palladium suffered a 6.5% slide. There are many reasons why world stocks slumped today, but the underlying fear is that central bankers lack the ammunition to prevent a major crash. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s take: Potential disruption to the iron ore trade; the sudden exposure of the South African rand; the incompatibility of Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-corruption drive with that Wild East entrepreneurial spirit which has powered decades of Chinese growth. Watching panic spread from Shanghai and Shenzhen to London and New York, western analysts grabbed for straws of understanding in unfamiliar fields, reflecting not only a professional need to look as if they know what\u2019s going on, but a psychological yearning to impose order on a wild, mercurial swing in the mood. There may be no single reason why August 2015 proved the moment for the world\u2019s investors to take collective fright about the People\u2019s Republic. What there is however, lurking under all the anxiety, is a single question for governments everywhere. Namely, what\u2019s left in the locker?..... More here: Chinese flu, and the west\u2019s empty medicine cabinet The VIX \u2018fear index\u2019 has closed for the night too, at its highest level since October 2011. This graph of the Dow Jones industrial average since 2010 underlines the scale of the selloff tonight: I believe the 588 point drop is the eighth-biggest one-day points decline in the Dow\u2019s history (the 3.57% percentage decline is less dramatic, though) It\u2019s all over on Wall Street after a day in which stocks plunged, rallied, hovered, and then took a late dive deeper into the red. The Dow Jones has ended the day down 588 points, or 3.5%, at 15,871. The 16,000 point mark proved a hurdle too far. The S&amp;P 500 lost around 3.9%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 3.8%. That\u2019s the biggest one-day percentage falls for all three indices since 2011, Reuters reports. It also means the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are both in correction territory, down more than 10% on their recent highs. Bloomberg\u2019s Alix Steel is calling it \u201cone of the craziest trading sessions\u201d she\u2019s seen in years. And we\u2019re not arguing. Brian Bolan, equity strategist for Zacks Investment Research, agrees too: The Dow\u2019s back below 16,000 points,a drop of around 540 points, as the final few trades flash across the markets. Can it claw its way back?..... You could have made a lot of money by trading the Dow today. And you could also have lost a lot. The US stock market is ending the day as it began, with some wild swings. The Dow is now down *just* 390 points (-2.2%), having been down 580 half an hour ago. Huge volumes of US-listed shares have changed hands today, making it the busiest day of 2015. FastFT has the details: More than 11.6bn shares have traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE MKT by 3:30pm on Monday afternoon, the highest level of the year with roughly 30 minutes before markets close for the day. More here: With 30 minutes to go until Wall Street closes, the Dow Jones is down 670 points or over 4%. Better than its opening slump (1000 points down!), but rather worse than its early afternoon recovery. It\u2019s been a pretty crazy day on Wall Street today, says Max Wollf, chief economist for Manhattan Venture Partners. Despite the Dow\u2019s wobbles, Wollf reckons this isn\u2019t a rerun of 2008, but investors must stop treating risky assets as risk-free. You can watch the interview here: Wall Street has entered its final hour of trading, after a turbulent day. And markets appear to losing ground again. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 3.6%, a drop of 580 points to 15,872, erasing some of its earlier recovery. The Nasdaq is down by 3.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 -- the broadest US index - has lost 4.2% at pixel time. New York traders are feeling the jitters again; perhaps worrying about Tuesday\u2019s Asian market open.... It has been a topsy-turvy day on US markets and few companies have experienced the ups and downs as much as Apple. The smartphone maker saw its share price slide by 13% on US stock markets, before springing back into positive territory. Apple CEO Tim Cook took the unusual step of commenting on the help of Apple\u2019s business halfway through a financial quarter, via CNBC. I get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August. Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks, and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last 2 weeks. Obviously I can\u2019t predict the future, but our performance so far this quarter is reassuring. Additionally, I continue to believe that China represents an unprecedented opportunity over the long term. Apple shares are now 0.7% down on market opening, while the Dow Jones has slipped 3.4%. If everyone knew the Chinese economy was slowing down, why are markets falling so much. It\u2019s worth remembering that many traders are at the beach or the golf course, meaning that market moves are amplified at a time when fewer people are involved. Demetrios Efstathiou at Standard Bank says the sell off has been been amplified by a number of factors, none of which relate to China. We start with the August holiday season that finds many risk takers on holidays, followed by the breaching of technical support levels, then the strong presence of computer algorithms trading in such illiquid times. Over on Wall St, market watchers are calling the sharp early decline on New York stock markets as \u201cmore shakeout\u201d than cut and run by investors. Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Utah, blamed early losses on \u201cindiscriminate selling\u201d - automatic trading, rather than a considered decision to get out of the market. We are unlikely to be going into a bear market . There are a number of positive things happening under the surface of all this chaos and it is easy to forget those things when you see these types of moves. Quotes via Reuters The German chancellor Angela Merkel has sought to offer reassurance to panicky investors, after the country\u2019s main stock index crashed into bear-market territory. Speaking at a press conference with French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, she said: China will do everything it can to stabilise the economic situation. She also referred to the fact the International Monetary Fund sees the sell-off in China as an \u201cadjustment\u201d, not a crisis. A senior IMF officials said at the weekend \u201cit was totally premature\u201d to speak of a crisis in China. President Hollande also put in his words of reassurance. [China] will find responses within itself and the world economy is sufficiently solid to have growth perspectives that are not solely linked to the situation in China The third person in the picture is Ukraine\u2019s president Petro Poroshenko, who was meeting the French and German leaders in Berlin. While the stock markets in Europe and Asia fall into panic mode, the ceasefire in Ukraine is falling apart. I think US investors are recognising that all is not well in the world A US analyst explains what is happening on US markets. The White House has reason to be sounding confident. The three major US stock indices are all down by less than 2%, not such a bad performance compared to the market panic in Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones is the biggest faller, down 1.93% at 16, 140 points The Nasdaq is down 1.8% at 4,621 points The S&amp;P 500 index is off 1.49% at 1,941 points The White House has played down fears that volatility in international stock markets, particularly in China, will have any significant knock-on impact on the US economy, writes the Guardian\u2019s Washington correspondent Paul Lewis. \u201cThere is no doubt the global economy is more interconnected that it ever has been,\u201d Josh Earnest, the president\u2019s chief spokesperson, told reporters on Monday. What I would encourage people to evaluate is the ongoing strength and resilience of the US economy. Earnest said the US was experiencing the longest period of sustained private sector job increases in American history, with unemployment is at the lowest level in seven years. \u201cThe US economy is far stronger now than it was in 2008,\u201d he said. Earnest added that Wall Street reforms ushered in since the financial crisis mean that major US financial institutions have added more than $600bn in capital since 2009. That means banks are less reliant on unstable short-term funding, and that they are better able to withstand short-term volatility in the financial markets. Market panic was too much to measure on US markets today. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index - a gauge of market turbulence - failed to update for 30 minutes after trading started, according to data seen by Blooomberg. Here are more details, courtesy of Bloomberg: The gauge reflects the cost of options on the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 Index that are used, among other things, to protect against losses in shares, so its level is viewed to gauge how cautious investors are toward equities. Today, they started out very cautious. The Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 Index plunged more than 5% in the first minutes of trading as a global rout in risk assets circled the globe for a third day... More here Market watchers have also been counting the cost of losses across Europe. The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 has lost \u20ac450bn (\u00a3286bn) today, its worst performance since November 2008, as it ended the day 5.4% lower. This brings total losses since the start of the month to \u20ac1 trillion. A painful, but perhaps necessary, return of common sense. This is the verdict of London-based market analysts Baker Tilly on the Chinese stock market rout. Rob Donaldson, head of M&amp;A and private equity at Baker Tilly Corporate Finance, said: Over the last few years, tens of millions of individual investors in China - who vastly outweigh institutional investors (80/20 versus the other way around in the developed markets) - have been encouraged by the State apparatus to plough their money into shares. This has pushed prices up far beyond their fundamental value and what we are now seeing is a painful, but perhaps necessary, return of common sense. What is perhaps more surprising is the degree of knock-on effects to share prices on the FTSE and across European markets, but we should perhaps be wary of undue panic. Fundamentally, the Chinese economy was always going to slow... One likely outcome could be that Chinese investors are even more likely to be looking for tasty investments outside China. Chinese firms have already been snapping up western brands, from breakfast cereals to super yachts as well as splashing cash on big infrastructure projects. Donaldson says: As capital flight continues and hot money heads for the exit, a possible side effect is that investors will now be more likely than ever to look to make their money work for them elsewhere \u2013 including in the UK. The FTSE Group has confirmed that \u00a373.9bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 today, as the London stock market suffered its biggest tumble in over six years. A further \u00a313bn was wiped off the FTSE 250 index of smaller companies, showing the extend of the rout (my colleague Graham Ruddick reports) Around \u00a374bn has been wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 by today\u2019s selloff, according to Sky\u2019s financial analyst, Guy Harding. The 4.6% slump on the blue-chip index today looks to be the biggest one-day fall since March 2009. And it means that the FTSE 100 has just posted its longest losing streak since 2003. Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: \u201cThe summer slump continued into its third week as global stock markets sold off once again. Here in the UK the Footsie has been decimated in ten days, as fears over global growth have gripped international investors. China and commodities are still dominating proceedings, with oil and mining companies once again bearing the brunt of poor sentiment, though the banks aren\u2019t far behind. It was just five months ago investors cheered as the Footsie broke through the 7,000 mark for the first time; it now looks like a very long climb back.\u201d Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has plunged to its lowest level since the start of 2013, after the worst day\u2019s trading in several years. The FTSE 100 finished the day down 288 points, or 4.67%, at 5898, as China\u2019s market crash rippled through the markets. By my reckoning, that means more than \u00a370bn has been wiped off the index -- we\u2019re trying to get that confirmed now. That\u2019s 17% off its recent record high, meaning the Footsie is close to a bear market (a 20% decline). Mining shares plummeted through the day, as fears grew that China\u2019s economy is in trouble. Commodity trader Glencore slumped 13% to a new record low, while Anglo American and BHP Billiton lost over 9%. It\u2019s the 24th biggest percentage drop since the blue-chip index was created in the deregulation of the City in 1984, according to RBS: This is the worst day\u2019s trading for many of European stock markets since 2011. And the pan-Europan Stoxx 600 had its worse day since the end of 2008, according to Marketwatch. It was a day to forget for Frankfurt traders. That\u2019s it! European stock market have closed, with heavy losses across the board. The pan-European FTSeurofirst300 has provisionally closed down 5.4%, which is its lowest level this year. That includes a 5% tumble on the German DAX, while France\u2019s CAC shed 5.6% and Spain\u2019s IBEX lost 5.7%. The FTSE 100 index was down over 4.5% as trading ended, a very heavy selloff. More on that in a moment.... Here\u2019s a reason to worry. The VIX index, commonly known as the Fear Index, hit its highest level since January 2009 earlier today. VIX surged by 67% today to 53 - a level not seen since the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse. It then dipped back to 37.4, below the level when the US lost its AAA credit rating in 2011 (updated). The VIX tracks the prices of options on the S&amp;P 500, which are often used to hedge against potential losses. So a jump in the VIX shows that investors are getting scared..... Cheer up, readers in the City. Europe\u2019s stock markets close in just 20 minutes, and then you can have a well-earned rest (and perhaps a small sherry). Savers shouldn\u2019t be too alarmed by today\u2019s market selloff, argues Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon UK (the life insurance and pension firm). His advice is to sit tight, and ride the volatility (even if you can\u2019t actually enjoy the journey): \u201cIf pension savers don\u2019t need to access their fund for many years, they needn\u2019t be alarmed by short term volatility. Stock markets are in for a bumpy ride over the coming weeks, but if savers can stomach the ups and downs, equities are likely to provide superior returns over the medium and long term. With a FTSE-100 dividend yield of circa 4%, equities should deliver good value for savers with a five year plus investment horizon. Undoubtedly, there will be volatility along the way, but this shouldn\u2019t faze individuals with a long term investment strategy.\u201d Markets may not pay much attention to Donald Trump\u2019s views on the selloff, but Larry Summers is another matter entirely. Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, has suggested that the Federal Reserve could be forced to ease monetary policy, rather than hiking interest rates in the next few months. Summers has spent the last few years warning that developed economies are stuck in \u2018secular stagnation\u2019, requiring more vigorous government action (ie: spending) to lift us out of the mire. Many policymakers have disagreed; we may soon find out who was right.... Here\u2019s the scene on the New York stock exchange today, as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 1,000 points at the start of trading before rebounding (a little) Across the globe, traders have been gripped by the selloff since Asian markets opened around 15 hours ago, as these photos show: And here\u2019s where it all began, in China, with the Shanghai stock market suffering its biggest fall since 2007. World stock markets are not a pretty picture right now, even as the Dow Jones claws its way back from its worst losses. The FTSE 100 is still down 5%, and on track to hit its lowest level since December 2012. That would wipe around \u00a380bn off the value of the index, I reckon. And across Europe, the main indices have been hit just as hard. More than \u20ac500bn has been wiped off the FTSeurofirst 300 index, with just over an hour\u2019s trading to go. Here\u2019s the situation right now: Our Wall Street correspondent, Rupert Neate, reports: US stock markets collapsed on Monday continuing a global stock market rout that has wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off shares across the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 6.4%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 4%, and the Nasdaq lost 8.5% raising fears that a fresh tech bubble has burst. The drops followed already-heavy falls last week. Technology stocks were the hardest hit with Facebook losing 14% at one point and Apple off 11%..... More here: Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, fears that US stocks will keep falling until policymakers get a grip on the situation. Luschini says (via Reuters): \u201cUntil we have some sign that China and the emerging markets aren\u2019t being sucked into some vortex from which they can\u2019t recover ... it is unlikely this selloff will stem.\u201d US presidential hopeful Donald Trump claims he\u2019s the man to get the financial markets into better shape: British journalist Paul Mason puts the blame elsewhere: European stock markets slumped by 7.8% as traders watched the Dow Jones index shed 1,000 points in early trading (and who can blame them?). They\u2019re now clawing back some losses, but are still on track for their biggest losses since the early days of the financial crisis. The Dow Jones index is now below 16,000 for the first time since February 2014. It\u2019s now 14% below its record peak, putting the Dow firmly into correction territory. After plunging 1000 points (!) at the start of trading, America Dow Jones index appears to be stabilising. But it\u2019s very early days. Fifteen minutes into trading, the Dow is currently down 632 points at 15831. That\u2019s a 3.8% slump, adding to the heavy losses we\u2019ve already seen in Europe and Asia over the last 12 hours. That is the biggest opening fall on Wall Street that I can remember since the dramatic days after Lehman Brothers, when the world\u2019s financial market was really creaking. Amazing scenes in New York - the Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell by over 1000 points, or over 6%, in frenzied early trading. More US stocks are being hit by the selloff triggered by China\u2019s slump overnight. The market may calm down a little in a few minutes.... But right now, it\u2019s a serious rout and Europe is being hit by the backwash. The S&amp;P 500 index has fallen into correction territory -- down over 4%. The Dow Jones index has fallen 485 points at the open of trading in New York.... make that 502 points.... ....it\u2019s still falling, now down over 900 points, or more than 5%. Now it\u2019s down 950 points! And the Nasdaq index had plunged by 8.3%..... It\u2019s going to take a few minutes to get a clear picture.... DING DING DING. That\u2019s the sound of the Wall Street opening bell being rung. Now for the selloff...... Brace yourselves. Here comes the opening of Wall Street, with shares expected to tumble sharply..... Wall Street authorities have invoked a rarely-used regulation called Rule 48, in an effort to speed up and smooth trading when trading begins in a few minutes. CNBC explains: The rule allows NYSE to open stocks without indications. \u201cIt was set up for situations like this,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderich Securities. It was last used in the financial crisis. Here\u2019s a good explanation of why markets are tanking today, from Thomas Thygesen, SEB\u2019s head of cross-asset strategy, (via Bloomberg) \u201cGDP growth in the U.S. and euro zone economies just isn\u2019t strong enough to prevent a global disinflationary shock from accumulating.\u201d \u201cPeople have realized there could be further weakness in the Chinese currency. They don\u2019t seem in control of the situation and we could see feedback loops that haunt the U.S.\u201d European markets are wobbling as we approach the opening of Wall Street. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is now down by 5.5%, or 343 points, at 5844. And the FTSeurofirst 300 index has fallen by 6.2%, on track for its worst one-day decline since 2008. Why? Because the Dow Jones industrial average is expected to suffer a very serious selloff - around 800 points, or over 5%. A former adviser to Gordon Brown, UK prime minister during the 2007-08 crisis, reckons the Chinese stock market crash means catastrophic times are ahead. Damian McBride warned that the next financial crisis will be worse than seven years ago, and urged followers to take action now. Here\u2019s his alarming (alarmist?) tweets: For the record, I don\u2019t think the global market selloff means the economic system is about to totally seize up. It\u2019s certainly serious, and we don\u2019t know the ramifications for some time. But I suspect policymakers will avoid a complete meltdown. Feel free to quote that back at me in a few months, though, if I find myself life-blogging the collapse of the banking sector..... US stock market authorities have been forced to suspend the futures market on the Nasdaq index. Panicking traders have driven it down 5% - the maximum allowed under Wall Street rules before a circuit-breaker is triggered. Here\u2019s our updated news story on today\u2019s market mayhem: George Osborne, the UK\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer, has warned that China\u2019s stock market volatility is a \u201creal concern\u201d. Speaking during a trip to Sweden, Osborne also predicted that Europe would not suffer \u2018immediate\u2019 problems from China, despite the heavy losses across global markets today. Over to Reuters for the story: British finance minister George Osborne said on Monday he did not expect the slump in Chinese share prices, which has hit financial markets around the world, to pose a threat to Europe\u2019s economy. \u201cI am reasonably confident, although I don\u2019t think that we can be unaffected by what happens in China, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to cause immediate sharp problems in Europe,\u201d Osborne said in response to a question from a reporter during a visit to Sweden. While the volatility in China\u2019s market was \u201ca cause of real concern,\u201d the main issue was the underlying growth of the country\u2019s economy and officials in Beijing were focused on reforms to ensure consumption-led growth, he said. [end] ----- Osborne is touring the Nordic area, discussing issues including Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of the EU. Yesterday he met with Finland\u2019s finance minister Alex Stubb: It\u2019s a fast-moving situation, but the FTSE 100 currently is on track to lose roughly \u00a370bn of value today, if it closes down around 4.5%. Wall Street is going to be, err, rather lively when trading begins, given the latest forecasts from the futures markets: It gets worse and worse.... More than \u20ac400bn has been wiped off the value of Europe\u2019s three hundred largest companies today, according to Reuters data, as the selloff continues. The FTSeurofirst300 index has now plunged by 4.5%, as stock markets in London, Paris, Frankfurt and beyond suffer heavy selling. FTSeurofirst300 is now on track for its biggest one-day decline since March 2009, Reuters says. The Stoxx 600 index, which includes smaller European firms, is taking even more of a pounding. This is triggered by alarming signals from Wall Street, where the Dow Jones index is now forecast to plunge by 4% as fears over China\u2019s crash ripple through global markets. This is turning into a major selloff -- the FTSE 100 is now down a whopping 275 points, or almost 4.5%, at 5914 points. The rout is deepening. The FTSE 100 just fell below the 6000 point-mark again, as traders react to predictions of a heavy selloff on Wall Street. The blue-chip index is now down over 220 points or 3.5% at 5964 points, its lowest level since January 2013. If it finishes there, then more than \u00a350bn would have been wiped off the collective value of the 100 companies on the index (we\u2019ll get the official verdict after 4.30pm BST, when the market closes). Anyone exposed to the resources sector has taken heavy losses. Commodity trader Glencore is down 6.7%, while mining giants Anglo American (-6.6%) and BHP Billiton (6.2%) are also leading the fallers. Update: Traders are now calling the Dow Jones index down more than 400 points - a very chunky selloff, after China\u2019s market tumbled by 8.5% earlier today. At its heart, today\u2019s market panic shows that investors are losing faith in central banks\u2019 ability to keep the show on the road. So argues Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets, who writes: The People\u2019s Bank of China has spectacularly failed to stimulate the Chinese economy, Europe\u2019s whole recovery is based on a lower euro which was just undermined by the yuan devaluation and the US is experiencing its slowest post-recession recovery on record, despite huge stimulus. Those stimulus measures involved ultra-low interest rates and massive bond-buying through quantitative easing. That drove many world stock markets to record highs in recent years, but didn\u2019t resolve the underlying problems in the global economy. Time for a recap, for anyone just tuning in on this dramatic day. European stock markets have posted heavy falls this morning, after China\u2019s stock market suffered its biggest plunge since the start of the financial crisis. In London, the FTSE 100 fell as low as 5995 points this morning, the first time it\u2019s been below 6000 since the first trading day of 2013. The Footsie is currently down 2.7%, or 169 points, at 6018, wiping more than \u00a340bn off its value. Mining companies are worst hit, with many losing more than 5%. Other European stock markets are also in retreat, with Germany\u2019s DAX entering a bear market this morning. And Wall Street is expected to follow suit in three hours (at 9.30am local time, not 8.30am as I wrote earlier, sorry) Earlier, China\u2019s stock market plunged 8.5% in another wave of selling, as concern grows that the country\u2019s economy is weakening. Local media swiftly dubbed it \u201cBlack Monday\u201d. One fund manager called it a \u201cdisaster\u201d, which could drive many firms under. City analysts believe the People\u2019s Bank of China will soon take action to pump more liquidity into the economy. The scale of the crash, though, is raising fears that Beijing is losing its grip on the crisis -- which Bloomberg says has wiped $5 trillion from global markets this month. Asian markets were left reeling by the selloff in Shanghai, as they were dragged downwards in a wave of selling. Japan\u2019s Nikkei tumbled by 4.6%, it\u2019s biggest one-day decline since June 2013 Australia was worse hit - suffering its biggest one-day fall in six years. and Hong Kong\u2019s market tumbled over 5%. China\u2019s slowdown, the fall in commodity prices, and uncertainty over when the US Federal Reserve might raise US interest rates are all fuelling the selloff, according to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s Kit Juckes. The oil price was hit too, hitting its lowest level since early 2009. US crude is now changing hands at just $38.85 per barrel, down 4% today. Brent crude is down 3.8%, at $43.70 per barrel. It\u2019s shaping up to be a rough day on Wall Street. The Dow Jones index is predicted to shed 300 points, or 1.8%, when the New York stock market opens at 2.30pm BST ( 8.30am 9.30am on the east coast). That follows a nasty selloff on Friday, in which the Dow tumbled by 530 points. August is often a cruel month for investors, but this year has been particularly grim. According to Reuters, it\u2019s on track to be the worst month since the height of the crisis. This morning\u2019s selloff has wiped more than \u00a340bn off the value of Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index since trading began less than three hours ago. The FTSE 100 is currently down 145 points, a slump of 2.4%, with mining stocks continuing to be hit hardest. Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton are all still down at least 5% [see earlier chart for more details]. That\u2019s on top of the \u00a346bn fall suffered on Friday, helping to send Europe\u2019s stocks down \u20ac230bn today alone. The 15% decline in the FTSE 100 since April is obviously a blow to pensions funds, asset managers and speculators. But this selloff is also hitting small investors, perhaps those with an ISA, or even a Child Trust Fund exposed to the stock market. Chris Towner, director of FX advisory services at foreign currency firm HiFX, says China\u2019s Black Monday is spreading alarm worldwide: \u201cRisk aversion is back in the financial markets. A combination of threats of tightening monetary policy in the US and UK with China slowing has created nervousness and this nervousness is now spreading to panic.\u201d Here\u2019s a remarkable fact - more than $5 trillion has been wiped off the value of global stock markets since Beijing devalued the yuan a fortnight ago. The yuan devaluation was the trigger for the current market mayhem, as it fuelled fears that China\u2019s economy was in worse shape than authorities admitted. Analysts at ING believe the Chinese central bank will soon be forced to take new steps to shore up confidence, after seeing the Shanghai stock market plunge 8.5% today. While today\u2019s market rout is obviously alarming, the big fear among policymakers is that capital is flowing out of China as its economy deteriorates. This would trigger a damaging liquidity shortage in the country\u2019s financial sector. The People\u2019s Bank of China took action last week to address this issue, and ING predicts it will soon slash lending requirements. They write: We infer from last week\u2019s double-barrel PBOC liquidity injection that capital outflows are big and may persist. There is nothing on the horizon but another round of the PBOC easing that could stem capital outflows. We believe a 50-100bp RRR cut is imminent. China\u2019s RRR, or reserve requirement ratio, limits how much money banks are forced to hold onto rather then lending it on. So lowering the RRR would effectively pump more money into the economy. Around \u20ac230bn has been wiped off the value of Europe\u2019s 300 largest companies this morning, calculates Tara Cunningham of the Daily Telegraph. The market turbulence is likely to make it impossible for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month, predicts Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro. He says: The prospects of an increase in rates from the Fed in September look very slim indeed at this point in time. Uncertainty over the Fed\u2019s next move has been a contributing factor to the recent falls in global stock markets. The FTSE 100 has now lost 15% since hitting a record high of 7104 points in April. Another 5% and it will be a Bear Market: Over in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index has just closed down 5.2% at 21,251.57 points, its lowest point since March 2014. That\u2019s the Hang Seng\u2019s seventh daily fall in a row, reflecting market worries over China\u2019s slowing economy....and Beijing\u2019s ability to handle it. Alarm over the global economy has driven the oil price down to its lowest level since the global recession began. A barrel of US crude oil now costs just $39.33 per barrel, the cheapest since early 2009. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote, reckons oil has further to fall: We consider that the decline in the oil prices will continue. Fears of oversupply cause plunge of oil to continue. Fraser Howie, the co-author of Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China\u2019s Extraordinary Rise, said Beijing\u2019s handling of the stock market calamity raised real questions about the leadership of president Xi Jinping and prime minister Li Keqiang. Our colleague Tom Phillips reports: \u201cI think there is now growing realisation \u2013 domestically and offshore - that the Chinese leadership are not in control of the situation. Not only are they not in control of it, they don\u2019t even seem to grasp the problems at times,\u201d Howie said. \u201cThe real casualty over the summer is the government\u2019s credibility. When you look at the stock market intervention, when you look at the FX botch as I would call it a couple of weeks ago, and then you look at the Tianjin blasts, you see a government that is most certainly not in control. You look at this and it sends a very poor picture about China\u2019s competency at the leadership level. Who else is responsible here? Xi Jinping seems invisible.\u201d \u201cThere are no short term fixes for what China is going through,\u201d Howie added. \u201cThis is ultimately a painful unwinding of imbalances and leverage in the system and those processes are always tough and sore. It\u2019s a bit like saying what\u2019s a quick solution to my hangover? And that is exactly where China is at the moment. There are no quick solutions.\u201d The \u201cfog of fear\u201d over the state of the Chinese economy is thickening over European stock markets, warns Connor Campbell of City firm Spreadex. Here\u2019s a flavour of his morning research note. The Shanghai Composite, the continual epicentre of the markets\u2019 recent woes, fell by over 8.5% this morning, setting off a chain of losses that included the biggest one-day sell off in over 2 years for the Nikkei and over 6 years for the Australian Securities Exchange. The People\u2019s Bank of China remains in \u2018see what sticks\u2019 mode, and so far nothing has been able to provide an adequate tourniquet for the market-wide bloodshed that has only intensified this Monday. The latest move by the PBOC saw the central bank announce that local government-managed pension funds will be able to invest in the markets for the first time, in an attempt to pour billions of yuan into an equity market that is currently drowning in losses. However this move only inspired panic not peace, and the fervent selling, with investors fleeing in droves, infected the Western indices from the moment the bell rang.... Stock markets are gripped by a \u201cdeep funk\u201d, says Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Kit identifies three key factors behind today\u2019s rout: further economic weakness in China, further pain in global commodity markets Uncertainty over how the central banks - US Federal Reserve and the People\u2019s Bank of China - will react. Commodity prices have hit their lowest levels in 16 years, thanks to the Chinese slowdown. And that is making traders very worried, as Kit explains: The divergence between global commodity prices and equities is not a new theme but the danger now is that they begin to re-correlate - as they did when the dotcom bubble burst in 2000 and what had previously been an emerging market crisis became a US recession. Shares in mining companies are being hammered this morning, taking the brunt of this morning\u2019s selloff in the City. Anglo America, which produces iron ore, copper, manganese, nickel and coal, has slumped by 6%. Glencore, the commodity trading giant, is close behind, along with silver producer Fresnillo and then BHP Billiton. The mining sector is clearly exposed to China\u2019s slowing economy. But today\u2019s sell-off has spread much wider -- every company on the FTSE 100 has fallen this morning. Tony Cross, market analyst of Trustnet, says: Any hopes that the last week of August would pass off in unremarkable fashion for equity traders has been dashed as the London market opened for business.... Panic is genuinely gripping the mining stocks which collectively have dumped \u00a35bn of value already this morning. Investors in Beijing can finally take a breather after the worst day\u2019s trading since the start of the global financial crisis eight years ago. After a dramatic day\u2019s trading, the Shanghai Composite index has just closed down a jaw-dropping 8.5%, at 3209 points. That\u2019s its biggest one-day slump since 2007, explaining why Chinese media were quick to dub today Black Monday. The Shanghai stock market has now lost all its gains this year. Umpteen stocks were suspended today after falling 10% - the maximum allowed under Beijing\u2019s rules. And there could be worse days ahead, analysts predict, as fears grow that the Chinese economy is heading for a hard landing. Bloomberg reports: \u201cThis is a real disaster and it seems nothing can stop it,\u201d said Chen Gang, Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Heqitongyi Asset Management Co. \u201cIf we don\u2019t cut holdings ourselves, the fund faces risk of forced closure. Many newly started private funds suffered that recently. I hope we can survive.\u201d The FTSE 100 just slumped below the 6,000 point mark for the first time since the start of 2013, in rather choppy trading: Germany\u2019s stock market appears to have crashed into bear market territory, down more than 20% from its recent high. Across Europe, stock markets are deep in the red. Spain\u2019s IBEX is down 3.3%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 3.%% and the Portuguese PSI 20 has shed 4.4%. Germany\u2019s DAX index has fallen by 3%, dropping below the 10,000 point mark for the first time since January. Trading is underway in the City, and shares are falling fast. The FTSE 100 index tumbled 2.8%, shedding 175 points to hit a low of 6012 points. It\u2019s now settling around 6030 points as traders flood the market with sell orders. I\u2019m now handing over to Graeme Wearden in London. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Thank you. Just five minutes until the European stock markets open... Thailand\u2019s stock exchange has been hit by the global selloff, dropping 3.84%, or 52.43 points, to 1,313.18. The stock exchange in Thailand also suffered last week following a bomb attack at a Hindu shrine in the capital that killed 20, including tourists. The Thai economy is dependent on tourism revenues, accounting for up to 10% of GDP. Here\u2019s the official ASX 200 closing figure. Some $70bn has been lost from the market\u2019s overall value, AAP reports, in the index\u2019s worst one-day trading for six years. And it\u2019s now at a two-year low. Australian Stock Report head of research Chris Conway says the market could go lower if it drops below 5,000 points. Right now, there is clearly some panic selling occurring and there is little in the way of technical support below the current market price. More strong comments from Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for IHS Global Insight, who has been speaking to our man in Beijing. He says that the problem for investors is that the authorities in Beijing aren\u2019t making a very good fist of dealing with this market business. As our the Guardian\u2019s economics guru Larry Elliott wrote last week, it\u2019s as if everyone is realising that China might not have all the answers. Anyway, here\u2019s what Rajiv has said: We have seen quite big corrections ever since the middle of June and it has created some policy responses from the Chinese government but up to they have been piecemeal. There hasn\u2019t been any consolidated effort. It is almost as if they don\u2019t really know what to do. That is adding to the negative sentiment. That is playing out in the stock market and it is also playing out in the commodities markets because as people fear Chinese growth is slowing down more, we are seeing the commodities sector also taking a further [move] downwards. There were dark faces across brokerage houses in Beijing today as small investors watched shares tumble, dragging the Shanghai Composite index down over 8% in late trading. It\u2019s closing time elsewhere. The Philippines\u2019 stock market has slumped over 7% today to a 14-month low, amid the global stock market rout. The ASX 200 index was down 213.3 points, or 4.09% lower at 5,001.3. The broader All Ordinaries index was down 210.6 points, or 4.03%, at 5,014.2. Money is surging into German government debt, or bunds, this morning, as nervous investors brace for trouble ahead. Buying bunds is a classic safe-haven trade \u2013 they don\u2019t offer a very good interest rate, but you\u2019re pretty well certain to get your money back. The Aussie dollar has been sold heavily today. it\u2019s currently buying US72.28c having dropped just over 1% since friday. And it could get worse, some people think. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index has suffered its biggest one-day sell-off in over two years, after a day of hectic selling sparked by growing fears over China. The Tokyo stock market just closed with the Nikkei down 4.61%, its biggest one-day fall since June 2013. The Topix index, which includes more smaller Japanese companies, slumped by 5.8%. That puts the Topix into \u2018correction territory\u2019, down more than10% since its recent peak. More reaction via our man Tom Phillips in Beijing. Rajiv Biswas, the chief Asia economist for IHS Global Insight, said Black Monday was one of the strongest signals yet that Beijing was not doing enough to tackle the crisis. The private money is all trying to get out of the market and what is holding up the market is only the government intervention. It\u2019s been piecemeal efforts through the course of the year with several small cuts in interest rates, some fiscal stimulus measures scattered around in recent months. But you haven\u2019t seen any decisive action and there is no sense of determination coming out of policy makers that they want to turn the economy around. For you Simpsons fans. The Australian market has had a shocker. The ASX 200 has closed down nearly 4% for its worst day for four years. It\u2019s now at a two-year low. Traders in Europe are bracing for a heavy sell-off when the stock markets open, in one hour\u2019s time. The FTSE 100 is currently expected to tumble below the 6000-point mark for the first time since the start of January 2013. Other European markets are heading for a bath \u2013 having already tumbled on Friday. The slowdown in China, and the surprise devaluation of the Chinese yuan this month, has forced investors into a sharp rethink. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt, the City stockbrokers, explains: Earnings-based valuations have retreated dramatically from their previous extended levels; the issue now is the extent to which concerns over global growth hamper the corporate profits outlook. Important again to remember that the Chinese market had more than doubled in value in the 18 months or so leading up to June. A 30% fall in recent weeks is not much when measured against a rise of 150% and you could argue it\u2019s a natural correction. The respected Australian economist Saul Eslake believes the concerns about China, which are reflected in the sell-off there and overseas, are slightly overdone. He told Guardian Australia that the country\u2019s growing service industry is gradually overtaking the manufacturing sector as a share of GDP. He also noted that the property market in the biggest cities is \u201cstabilising\u201d although the smaller cities were \u201cstill weak\u201d. And he believed that the recent devaluation of the yuan was not an attempt to stimulate flagging exports but was a genuine attempt to reform the forex regime and to try to get ahead of any possible rate cut by the US Fed. It\u2019s a move to be more flexible ahead of a Fed rate cut. The yuan is up 20% in trade-weighted terms so they wanted wriggle room if the Fed cuts rates and the US dollar rises. He adds: As investors see more selling they also want to get out. He said the continued panic reflected a lack of faith in Beijing\u2019s attempts to prop up the stock market. I think the sell down is probably going to continue for the next few sessions. More reaction from my colleague Tom Phillips in Beijing, who\u2019s been talking to market experts. Bernard Aw, a market analyst from IG in Singapore, has used the \u201cP\u201d word. Risk sentiment is really on the verge of panic which is why we are seeing plenty of red screens. Despite reasons for optimism, the authorities in Beijing are struggling to keep things under control. The Shanghai Comp is now down 8.7% at 3202. If it closes anywhere below 3233 points, it will have lost all its gains for the year. Angus Nicholson of IG again: A disastrous result for China, after working so hard to breathe life back into domestic equities after the 2007 crash and having spent hundreds of billions of dollars propping up the market since June. But as Angus Nicholson points out, you could argue that the world economic situation doesn\u2019t really warrant this panic selling. The current global economic environment does not seem to warrant such a dramatic sell-off. Volumes in global markets are famously thin in August, possibly leading to these outsized moves. Investors will be looking to major news announcements this week that may change sentiment in global markets and provide a floor to these downward moves. Thursday will see the release of US GDP and PCE inflation data, the beginning of the Jackson Hole symposium, and the release of Japanese CPI data. Although if markets continue to decline at this rate until then, we could be seeing an even more serious correction than in 2010 or 2011. Angus Nicholson, of IG Markets, has an interesting take on the day\u2019s turmoil. He says the recent annual meeting of the country\u2019s top leadership must have seen some pretty heavy chat about the economy with the country facing a momentous fork in the road. It is a key moment for China. The equity market in free fall, the banking system increasingly starved of liquidity, rising capital outflows, and a rapidly slowing economy. The annual meeting of the top leadership at Beidaihe has ended (one of the reasons Li Keqiang was delayed in visiting Tianjin), and no doubt there were very serious discussions over how the 7% growth target is going to be met. That target is now looking overly ambitious, and the most sensible way forward would seemingly involve further currency devaluation, further RRR cuts, and stepped up fiscal stimulus. It\u2019s been a torrid day so far on financial markets across the Asia- Pacific on what Chinese media are calling \u201cBlack Monday\u201d, in an echo of the infamous global stock market meltdown of 1987. But the main points are these: The Chinese market has plunged 8.45% Beijing poised to respond by \u201cflooding the market with cash\u201d Markets in Britain, Europe and US set for heavy losses again Australian share market suffering worst day in four years Taiwan market has had its worst day ever Nikkei in Japan down 4.25% Oil and copper also hit by sell-off to new six-year lows Stock futures for today\u2019s trading in Europe and the US point to heavy losses again. The FTSE is pointing to lose more than 200 points and the Dow Jones 400. It\u2019s Black Monday with good reason. The Shanghai Composite is down 8.45% today. Takako Masai, the head of research at Shinsei Bank in Tokyo, said: Markets are panicking. Things are starting look like the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Speculators are selling assets that seem the most vulnerable. This could be significant. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Chinese authorities have cracked and are about to flood the market with cash to halt the alarming fall in the country\u2019s main stock markets and end jitters about its slowing economy. This \u2013 if it happens \u2013 will be the cut in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) that investors expected to come at the weekend. The expected move to free up more funds for lending \u2013 by reducing the deposits banks must hold in reserve \u2013 is directly aimed at countering the effects of a weaker currency, which could send more funds away from Beijing\u2019s shores. Not surprisingly, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is also having a torrid day, down more than 4%. In South Korea, another country very exposed to any slowdown in China, the benchmark Kospi index is down by nearly 3%. Last week South Korea said exports to China fell nearly 12% in the first 20 days of August from a year ago. Gold is doing OK, though, as people seek some shelter from the storm. It\u2019s close to a seven-week high at $1160.80 an ounce but traders think it could rally to $1200 an ounce, a level last seen in June. ... and copper. It\u2019s not just shares and currencies that are struggling, of course. Commodities are taking a real pounding as expectations of less demand from China weigh on investors. Oil ... More from the other markets around Asia in a minute, but just a quick one on the Australian dollar, which is trading at US72.55 cents, down from 73.02 cents on Friday. Stephen Innes, of Oanda Australia and Asia Pacific, said the Aussie was again being hit by concerns about a weaker Chinese economy having a knock-on effect on Australian exports. Away from the markets \u2013 but still with China \u2013 and the Australian steel producer BlueScope says it might have to shed 500 jobs because weakening demand from the world\u2019s second biggest economy had created massive oversupply. The Port Kembla-based company said the future of the steel works was \u201con a knife-edge\u201d. The chief executive, Paul O\u2019Malley, said demand in China had grown nearly six-fold in 15 years but had recently plateaued, moving the country\u2019s producers to treble exports on 2010-14 levels. He said prices had fallen 46% in that time and a third of global capacity was sitting unused. When there\u2019s oversupply and a shortage of demand \u2013 and the equivalent of an extra 50 Port Kemblas on the market globally \u2013 you know you have to respond to international competitive pressures. One of the biggest fallers has been Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals Group. Its shares have plunged 12.79% after the company announced a 88% fall in profits this morning on the back of plunging iron ore prices. That\u2019s an ugly figure and while the company expects things to look up in the current year when the benefits of hefty cost-cutting kicks in, FMG\u2019s huge exposure to China does not help. Not long ago Forrest was talking gamely about how China\u2019s demand for iron ore felt limitless. Australian Mining reported him last year as saying: A bet against China is the only guarantee of loss I\u2019ve seen for a long time ... 400m people still have to be urbanised. That view is obviously being quite strenuously tested now as assumptions about growth in China are reassessed. It\u2019s the biggest one-day fall since September 2011 on the Australian market, according to AAP, and it\u2019s taken a whopping $60bn off the overall market value. For a good summary of where we\u2019re at across the region today, my colleague Justin McCurry has sent this dispatch from Tokyo. Here\u2019s how he starts: Fears of a slowdown in the Chinese economy sent Asia-Pacific stocks plummeting on Monday, days after Wall Street suffered its biggest one-day loss in almost four years. Worth remembering, though, that the Chinese stock market had risen a massive 150% in the past 18 months. In that context a drop of 30% in the past couple of months is nothing to be worried about. After all, the optimists say, the country is still growing by as much as 7% (maybe 4% if you don\u2019t believe the figures), the service sector is beginning to make up for an admittedly weakening manufacturing sector and there are still millions of people to bring out of poverty. As the American economist Nicholas Lardy told the Australian: The sceptics have taken insufficient notice of China\u2019s progress in transitioning to its new model of economic growth, one less dependent on expanding industrial output, investment and exports and more dependent on expanding private consumption expenditure. An analyst in Shanghai, Qi Yifeng, at consultancy CEBM, put it quite pithily to Reuters: The market is in a downtrend. There\u2019s no good news, stocks are still expensive, and there\u2019s no fresh money coming in. With no RRR [reserve requirement] cut over the weekend, the market will directly head south. After starting to devalue the yuan two weeks ago caused further selling on its main stock exchanges, investors expected Beijing to introduce some more calming measures at the weekend. But despite new rules allowing pension funds to invest in the stock market \u2013 quite a good idea on the face of it and another step towards reforming the financial system in China \u2013 the market has been sold heavily today and is down 7.92%. Seems sensible to look first in more depth at what\u2019s happening in China this morning given that most people agree that\u2019s where the problems are stemming from. For an expert analysis of the background I can point you to the Guardian\u2019s economics brains trust of Larry Elliott and Philip Inman who wrote at the weekend about how concerns about China\u2019s slowing economy will spread to other emerging markets. Here\u2019s a snippet. The problem is a relatively simple one. In the post-great recession world, the tendency has been for all countries to try to export their way out of trouble. But this model works only if the exports can find a home, as they did when China was growing at double-digit rates. But in the past 18 months, the Chinese economy has slowed, causing problems for two distinct groups of emerging-market economies: the east Asian countries that sell components and finished goods to their big neighbour, and countries that supply China with the fuel and raw materials to keep its industrial machine going. It\u2019s pretty grim out there so I\u2019ll set out the main points so far: The ASX200 in Australia fell 2.4% at the opening. It\u2019s now down 2.89%. The Shanghai Composite is down 8.6%. The Nikkei in Japan is down more than 3%. In commodities, Brent and US crude are at new six-year lows. Copper and aluminium also at six-year lows. The yuan was weaker at the opening, despite a firmer setting for the day. The Malaysian ringgit down 0.9% at a 17-year low against the US dollar. Gold has continued its comeback though and is at a seven-week high. Hold on to those hats. Good afternoon and welcome to the markets live blog. It\u2019s been a very lively morning across the Asia-Pacific region following on from last week\u2019s China-inspired heavy selling here and on Wall Street and in Europe on Friday. Stock markets, commodities and currencies are being smashed.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off global stocks on Monday as a panic that started in China spread across the world on a day dubbed by China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, as \u201cBlack Monday\u201d. The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 586 points, or 3.56%, to 15,871 \u2013 a drop of more than 13% from its record high reached in May. When the markets opened the Dow plunged 1,089 points \u2013 the index\u2019s largest ever intra-day decline - before staging a slight recovery. It was the second consecutive trading session in which the Dow has lost more than 500 points. After the Dow reached that record high just three months ago, August is on track to be the its worst month since February 2009. The S&amp;P 500 closed down 3.9% and Nasdaq lost 3.82% \u2013 both ending the day at 10-month lows. Monday saw the biggest one-day percentage falls for all three indices since 2011, according to Reuters. Markets in most of the rest of the world also suffered some of the biggest one-day falls so far this year. The White House reassured worried investors that the US economy would be better able to withstand a China-induced slowdown in the global economy than it had been in 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers lead to a near-meltdown of the global banking system. \u201cThere is no doubt the global economy is more interconnected that it ever has been,\u201d Josh Earnest, Barack Obama\u2019s chief spokesman, said. \u201cWhat I would encourage people to evaluate is the ongoing strength and resilience of the US economy.\u201d Nick Kounis, head of financial markets research at investment bank ABN Amro, said: \u201cThe potent and self-reinforcing cocktail of worries about China, emerging markets and commodities has triggered a global rout in equity markets. Against this background all eyes are now on the Chinese authorities. We think they will deliver with further monetary easing sooner rather than later.\u201d The falls were triggered by a collapse in the Chinese stock market, which dropped 8.5% \u2013 a fall dubbed \u201cBlack Monday\u201d by China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua. It was the biggest one-day drop on the Shanghai exchange since 2007. The pan-European FTSeurofirst300, which comprises Europe\u2019s 300 biggest companies, closed down 5.4% to its lowest level this year, taking around \u20ac450bn ($521bn) off its combined value. Germany\u2019s Dax lost 5%, France\u2019s Cac shed 5.6% and Spain\u2019s Ibex lost 5.7%. The FTSE100 in London closed down 4.67% to 5,899 points, wiping more than \u00a373.9bn ($116.3bn) off the index of leading UK shares. It was the first time the index had dropped below the 6,000 mark since early 2013, with almost all companies in the red, and fresh off a week of declines. A total of almost $10tn has been wiped off global stock market since June. \u201cThere is a lot of fear in the markets,\u201d said Bernard Aw, a market strategist at IG in Singapore. \u201cThe risk sentiment is really on the verge of panic, which is why we are seeing plenty of red screens. The Chinese stock market fell really spectacularly.\u201d The tumultuous day on the markets greatly reduces the chance of the US Federal Reserve moving to increase interest rates in September, something that had been widely expected by economists. Lawrence Summers, a former US Treasury secretary, said raising rates soon would be a \u201cserious error\u201d. \u201cA reasonable assessment of current conditions suggests that raising rates in the near future would be a serious error that would threaten all three of the Fed\u2019s major objectives: price stability, full employment and financial stability,\u201d he said in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal. He also posted on Twitter to warn that \u201cwe could be in the early stage of a very serious situation\u201d. Barclays economists on Monday pushed back their forecast for a rate rise from next month to March in the wake of the high volatility in global markets. \u201cGiven the uncertainty around the current global outlook, the timing of the rate hike seems more uncertain than usual,\u201d they said in a note to clients. \u201cShould this episode of financial market volatility prove transitory, the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] could raise rates in December. On the other hand, if the volatility proves durable or reveals greater than expected weakness in global activity, the FOMC may push the first rate hike beyond March. We see a delay past mid-2016 as a relatively low probability at this point given our views on US labor markets.\u201d Not even the personal intervention of Apple chief executive Tim Cook could prevent a slide in the company\u2019s stock due to concerns about its future performance in China, which it has identified as a major growth area. Apple shares, which dropped 13% at the opening bell, recovered to end the day 1.7% off after Cook emailed CNBC host Jim Cramer to say he wasn\u2019t overly worried about the apparent crisis in China. \u201cI get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August,\u201d Cook said in an email to CNBC host Jim Cramer. \u201cObviously I can\u2019t predict the future, but our performance so far this quarter is reassuring.\u201d Oil prices, which have been falling for a week, tumbled 6% to a fresh six-and-a-half-year low. Brent October crude fell $2.77, or 6.1%, to settle at $42.69 a barrel, after plunging to a contract low of $42.51, the lowest front-month price since March 2009.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has played down fears that European economies will be derailed by the dramatic stock market slide in China that triggered some of biggest swings at bourses around the world since the 2008 financial crisis. The UK chancellor said the volatility in China, where the main Shanghai Composite index on Monday had its biggest one-day drop since 2007, was \u201ca cause for real concern\u201d. But underlying economic growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy was more important than stock market moves, said Osborne, adding that officials in Beijing were focused on trying to transform the manufacturing powerhouse into a consumption-led economy. \u201cI am reasonably confident, although I don\u2019t think that we can be unaffected by what happens in China, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to cause immediate sharp problems in Europe,\u201d he told reporters during a visit to Sweden. As worries grow about a hard landing for China, the country\u2019s stock market has fallen sharply from a seven-year peak hit in mid-June, prompting Beijing\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, to admit that the country was facing a \u201cBlack Monday\u201d as another wave of selling hit investors. Shares had soared in the previous 12 months \u2013 the Shanghai index climbing 150% in the that period \u2013 as individual investors were encouraged by cheaper borrowing costs to pile into the rising market. There had already been warnings that China\u2019s stock markets were overheating and no longer reflected true company values, nor the outlook for the Chinese economy, when heavy selling set in two months ago. Since then the market has tumbled 38%, further rattled this month by China\u2019s surprise devaluation of its currency, the yuan. The sell-off intensified on Monday on disappointment that China\u2019s authorities had provided little in the way of fresh support over the weekend, with the Shanghai Composite sinking by nearly 9%. That sent shockwaves through global marketsalready jittery on the back of more weak Chinese manufacturing figures last week, lingering concerns about near-bankrupt Greece and the prospect of an interest rate rise in the US. On stock markets, analysts talked about \u201cpanic selling\u201d as the big share indices experienced falls reminiscent of 2008. Almost \u00a374bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 index as it tumbled 4.7% to 5,898.9, the lowest for almost three years. The index posted its longest losing streak since 2003 as it fell for a 10th successive session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 fell more than 5%, wiping about \u20ac450bn (\u00a3331bn) off its combined market value in the worst one-day loss since late 2008 after the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers. Underscoring market unease, the Vix volatility index, commonly viewed as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, hit its highest level since January 2009 at one point. \u201cToday we have witnessed carnage as equity indices the world over fell like dominoes including the Dow Jones, falling a staggering 1,000 points shortly after opening,\u201d said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor. \u201cFurthermore, China will have to brace itself for more pain with the dollar being pummelled beyond recognition as any chance of a rate hike this year goes out the window.\u201d Fears of waning demand from China, a vast consumer of energy and raw materials, also sent oil, copper and other commodities to multiyear lows. Emerging Asian currencies, including Malaysia\u2019s embattled ringgit and Indonesia\u2019s rupiah, were also at their lowest for years as investors dumped riskier assets. \u201cAnything tied to commodities or emerging markets has been slapped to fresh multiyear or record lows as market participants shift to the havens of the euro, Japanese yen and Swiss franc,\u201d said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company World First. Analysts said the sharp sell-off on world markets was not merely down to China and cited concerns that the global economy was losing momentum \u2013 while investors also braced for the first hike in US interest rates since they were slashed to near zero during the last financial crisis. But few were ready to say a fresh crisis loomed. \u201cThere was no single catalyst for the brutal sell-off,\u201d said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at institutional investor BlackRock. \u201cThe spike in volatility is consistent with two trends: slower economic growth and deteriorating credit market conditions. \u201cThat said, we don\u2019t think this is a prelude to another 2008-style cataclysm. Leading indicators are still positive and lower oil prices and interest rates should help stabilise growth.\u201d Although there are questions over how much the China\u2019s stock market reflects its real economy, the latest turmoil still raises important long-term questions about economic policy, experts said. \u201cIt is important not to overreact to stock market fluctuations, and China is likely to continue to grow at rates most European economies, including Britain, can only dream of,\u201d said Jonathan Perraton, senior lecturer in economics at the University of Sheffield. \u201cNevertheless, this may be one sign that the Chinese model that has been so successful since the late 1970s needs to adapt to new global economic circumstances.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What has happened in China? China\u2019s stock market has fallen sharply over recent weeks despite measures by officials in Beijing aimed at calming investors\u2019 jitters and shoring up global confidence in the country\u2019s slowing economy. Shares in China had soared 150% in the 12 months to mid-June as individual investors piled into the rising market, often borrowing heavily to do so. But chiming with warnings that shares were overvalued and the signs of an economic slowdown, the momentum came to a shuddering halt when shares hit a seven-year peak. Following another plunge on what was dubbed \u201cBlack Monday\u201d, China\u2019s stock markets have now given up all their gains for the year. China\u2019s shock move to devalue its currency, the yuan, this month only served to intensify worries about the world\u2019s second-largest economy. What has happened on other markets? Shares around the world followed China\u2019s stock markets lower. About \u00a374bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped by a record of more than 1,000 points at one stage. Commodities such as crude oil and copper have also tumbled to multi-year lows as investors take fright over signs of waning demand in the world\u2019s leading consumer of raw materials. The currencies of emerging Asian economies have weakened as investors drop those assets seen as riskier to hold. But investments perceived as safe havens in times of trouble, such as gold and some government bonds, are in demand. Is this a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis? Some of the falls on stock markets are certainly reminiscent of the swings seen around the time of the collapse of the US bank Lehman Brothers. The FTSEurofirst 300, a pan-European share index, suffered its biggest one-day drop since late 2008, losing 5.4%. For Shanghai\u2019s composite index, Monday\u2019s 8.5% slump was the biggest since February 2007. But some economists say the parallels stop there. They see limited risk to China\u2019s real economy from the stock market turmoil and little to be worried about beyond China. Julian Jessop, the chief global economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe current panic is essentially \u2018made in China\u2019. The recent data from other major economies, including the US, eurozone and Japan, has generally been good ... Aside from the bad news from China, there is very little to support fears of a major global downturn.\u201d But others are less sanguine. They point out that China\u2019s slowdown is just one of many factors worrying investors alongside lingering political problems in the eurozone, signs of weaker global growth and vast sums flowing out of fragile emerging markets such as Brazil. Furthermore, policymakers apparently have few tools left to help. Should I be worried? George Osborne, the UK chancellor, suggests not and believes China\u2019s stock market woes will not have much impact on European economies. But there are plenty of other voices saying this could get a lot worse. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, has suggested that the US Federal Reserve may be forced to ease monetary policy, rather than hiking interest rates in the next few months as had been expected. Furthermore, experts say policymakers do not have many tools available to shore up the global economy this time around. Interest rates are already at record lows and central banks have spent years printing electronic cash in quantitative easing (QE) programmes, cheap money that many blame for the latest market troubles. Stephen King, the HSBC economist, warned back in May: \u201cThe world economy is sailing across the ocean without any lifeboats to use in case of emergency.\u201d Damian McBride, Gordon Brown\u2019s former spin doctor, spelled out his advice for an impending crash on Twitter. Another tweet posted later on Monday: What if I have money tied up in stocks? Individuals with money invested in shares should not worry too much for now, financial market experts have said. Nick Dixon, an investment director at the asset management company Aegon UK, said: \u201cIf pension savers don\u2019t need to access their fund for many years, they needn\u2019t be alarmed by short term volatility. \u201cStock markets are in for a bumpy ride over the coming weeks, but if savers can stomach the ups and downs, equities are likely to provide superior returns over the medium and long term.\u201d What does it mean for interest rates? There had been widespread expectation that the US Federal Reserve would start the gradual process of hiking interest rates as soon as next month. Signs of a potential hard landing for China could well stay the central bank\u2019s hand. The same goes for the UK, where the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, recently hinted that a rate hike could happen around the turn of the year. In China, meanwhile, the country\u2019s central bank is widely expected to ease monetary policy further to shore up growth and confidence. What will this mean for inflation? A silver lining economists highlight for those countries that rely on imports of oil and other commodities is that this global sell-off will keep prices low. Oil has more than halved from a peak of $115 per barrel last summer to a Brent crude price of less than $44 per barrel now. At least some of that will be passed on to drivers in lower fuel prices. Philippe Waechter, the global chief economist at Natixis Asset Management, said: \u201cOn the upside, the fall in the oil price will be positive news for European economies as consumer purchasing power will be increased.\u201d What happens next? Officials in Beijing are under pressure to step in with more measures to restore stability to China\u2019s stock markets. The trouble they face is that every action is also perceived as a further sign of quite how worried they are about the slide in shares and the wider economy. Bill O\u2019Neill, the head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said: \u201cThere will be some form of additional stimulus over the next few days and weeks. \u201cThat is likely to be combined with supportive words from developed economy central bankers aimed at offering reassurance that accommodative policies will remain in place regardless of when interest rates start to rise.\u201d From Thursday, investors will be looking to the US and a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for signs of how this new bout of market volatility may influence their interest rate decisions.",

      "body": "<h2>What has happened in China?</h2> <p>China\u2019s stock market has fallen sharply over recent weeks despite measures by officials in Beijing aimed at calming investors\u2019 jitters and shoring up global confidence in the country\u2019s slowing economy. </p> <p>Shares in China had soared 150% in the 12 months to mid-June as individual investors piled into the rising market, often borrowing heavily to do so. But chiming with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/china-stock-market-crisis-explained\">warnings that shares were overvalued</a> and the signs of an economic slowdown, the momentum came to a shuddering halt when shares hit a seven-year peak. <br></p> <p>Following another plunge on what was dubbed \u201cBlack Monday\u201d, China\u2019s stock markets have now given up all their gains for the year.</p> <p>China\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/12/china-yuan-slips-again-after-devaluation\">shock move to devalue its currency</a>, the yuan, this month only served to intensify worries about the world\u2019s second-largest economy.<br></p> <h2>What has happened on other markets?</h2> <p>Shares around the world <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/24/black-monday-chinese-stock-market-loses-all-gains-since-start-of-year\">followed China\u2019s stock markets lower</a>. About \u00a374bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped by a record of more than 1,000 points at one stage.</p> <p>Commodities such as crude oil and copper have also tumbled to multi-year lows as investors take fright over signs of waning demand in the world\u2019s leading consumer of raw materials. <br></p> <p>The currencies of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/21/global-market-turmoil-in-six-charts\">emerging Asian economies have weakened</a> as investors drop those assets seen as riskier to hold. But investments perceived as safe havens in times of trouble, such as gold and some government bonds, are in demand.<br></p> <h2>Is this a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis?</h2> <p>Some of the falls on stock markets are certainly reminiscent of the swings seen around the time of the collapse of the US bank Lehman Brothers. The FTSEurofirst 300, a pan-European share index, suffered its biggest one-day drop since late 2008, losing 5.4%. For Shanghai\u2019s composite index, Monday\u2019s 8.5% slump was the biggest since February 2007. </p> <p>But some economists say the parallels stop there. They see limited risk to China\u2019s real economy from the stock market turmoil and little to be worried about beyond China. </p> <p>Julian Jessop, the chief global economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe current panic is essentially \u2018made in China\u2019. The recent data from other major economies, including the US, eurozone and Japan, has generally been good ... Aside from the bad news from China, there is very little to support fears of a major global downturn.\u201d</p> <p>But others are less sanguine. They point out that China\u2019s slowdown is just one of many factors worrying investors alongside lingering political problems in the eurozone, signs of weaker global growth and vast sums flowing out of fragile emerging markets such as Brazil. Furthermore, policymakers apparently have few tools left to help.</p> <h2>Should I be worried?</h2> <p>George Osborne, the UK chancellor, suggests not and believes China\u2019s stock market woes will not have much impact on European economies. </p> <p>But there are plenty of other voices saying this could get a lot worse. Larry Summers,<strong> </strong>the former US Treasury secretary, has suggested that the US Federal Reserve may be forced to ease monetary policy, rather than hiking interest rates in the next few months as had been expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LHSummers/statuses/635814574374170624\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As in August 1997, 1998, 2007 and 2008 we could be in the early stage of a very serious situation.</p>&mdash; Lawrence H.

Signs of a potential hard landing for China could well stay the central bank\u2019s hand. </p> <p>The same goes for the UK, where the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, recently hinted that a rate hike could happen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/uk-interest-rate-rise-new-year\">around the turn of the year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/24/china-stock-market-panic-stimulants-sell-off-financial-markets-quantitative-easing\">China stock market panic shows what happens when stimulants wear off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In China, meanwhile, the country\u2019s central bank is widely expected to ease monetary policy further to shore up growth and confidence.</p> <h2>What will this mean for inflation?</h2> <p>A silver lining economists highlight for those countries that rely on imports of oil and other commodities is that this global sell-off will keep prices low. Oil has more than halved from a peak of $115 per barrel last summer to a Brent crude price of less than $44 per barrel now. At least some of that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/aug/21/uk-supermarkets-cut-petrol-prices-crude-oil-cost-slides\">will be passed on to drivers</a> in lower fuel prices.</p> <p>Philippe Waechter, the global chief economist at Natixis Asset Management, said: \u201cOn the upside, the fall in the oil price will be positive news for European economies as consumer purchasing power will be increased.\u201d</p> <h2>What happens next?</h2> <p>Officials in Beijing are under pressure to step in with more measures to restore stability to China\u2019s stock markets. The trouble they face is that every action is also perceived as a further sign of quite how worried they are about the slide in shares and the wider economy. </p> <p>Bill O\u2019Neill, the head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said: \u201cThere will be some form of additional stimulus over the next few days and weeks. <br></p> <p>\u201cThat is likely to be combined with supportive words from developed economy central bankers aimed at offering reassurance that accommodative policies will remain in place regardless of when interest rates start to rise.\u201d</p> <p>From Thursday, investors will be looking to the US and a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for signs of how this new bout of market volatility may influence their interest rate decisions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Financial markets have gone cold turkey. For the past seven years, they have been given regular doses of strong and dangerous narcotics. The threat that the drugs will no longer be available has resulted in severe withdrawal symptoms. Unlike in 2007, the crash could be seen coming. Wall Street and the City were taken completely by surprise by the subprime crisis, but have had plenty of warning that something nasty might be brewing in China. Anybody caught unawares really hasn\u2019t been paying attention. But this is about more than China. Financial markets in the west have been booming for the past six years at a time when the real economy has been struggling. Recovery from the last recession has been patchy and weak by historical standards, but that has not prevented a bull market in equities. The reason for this is simple: the markets have been pumped full of stimulants in the form of quantitative easing, the money creation programmes adopted by central banks as a response to the last crisis. On the day that QE was launched in the UK, 9 March 2009, the FTSE 100 stood at 3542 points. Its recent peak on 27 April this year was 7103 points, a gain of 100.5%. There is a similar correlation between the three rounds of QE in the US and the performance of the S&amp;P 500, which was up more than 200% during the same period. But there were always doubts about what might happen when central banks decided it was time to remove some of the stimulus they have been providing for the past seven years. Now we know. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England halted their QE programmes and started to muse publicly about the timing of the first increase in interest rates. At that point, financial markets merely needed a trigger for a big selloff. China has provided that, because the world\u2019s second biggest economy has shown distinct signs of slowing. What was inevitably dubbed \u201cBlack Monday\u201d began in east Asia where there was disappointment that Beijing did not provide fresh support for shares in Shanghai overnight. Having been accused of acting like quacks dispensing dodgy remedies on previous stock market rescue missions, China\u2019s leaders decided they would tough it out. Big mistake. The stimulus junkies needed a fix and when they didn\u2019t get one they had a bad dose of the shakes. Beijing will not make that mistake again. Policy will be eased and it will be eased quickly. The People\u2019s Bank of China has plenty of scope to cut interest rates and will use it. In the current circumstances, the long-term plan to rebalance the economy away from a reliance on exported manufactured goods, infrastructure and property speculation will be temporarily abandoned in favour of growth of any sort. Whether it halts the stock market slide is another matter. Chinese policymakers have lost their aura of invincibility and are now in the awkward position of being damned if they do act and damned if they don\u2019t. Investors have started to scrutinise the Chinese economy in a far more forensic fashion and do not especially like what they see. Taking advantage of a more liberalised regime, capital is leaving the country. Dominic Rossi, of Fidelity Worldwide Investments, says what is happening in China and other emerging markets represents the third wave of of deflation for the global economy following the financial crash of 2008-09 and the eurozone crisis in 2011-12. Rossi says the deflation will be a double-sword: imports in the west will be cheaper but exports to emerging markets will be lower. Following the six-year bull market, shares in London and New York do not look especially cheap. Corporate profitability will be hurt as companies are forced to match the price of cheaper imported goods. Larry Summers, a former US Treasury secretary, underlined fears that the crash could led to recession on Monday when he said the Fed might need to provide more stimulus. But, unlike in 2008, interest rates are already zero. Budget deficits mean governments have less scope to cut taxes or raise spending. China\u2019s total debt is four times what it was seven years ago. Central banks have pulled all the conventional policy levers and a few unconventional ones as well. They could shelve plans for interest rate rises and contemplate further rounds of QE, even though that amounts to doubling the dosage for drugs that become less effective every time they are administered.",

      "bodyText": "US stock markets staged a stunning recovery on Monday after plunging to dramatic lows earlier in the day as markets across the world went into meltdown over ongoing fears of a collapse in the Chinese economy. The Dow Jones Industrial average was down 200 points, or 1.2%, at 16,257 points at 1pm on Monday, a huge recovery from a more than 1,000-point (6%) drop as the markets opened. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also recovered to be down 1.1% and 0.55% after falling of 5% and 8% earlier. However, while US markets recovered, those in most of the rest of the world suffered some of the biggest one-day falls so far this year, which greatly reduces the chance of the US Federal Reserve moving to increase interest rates in September, something that had been widely expected by economists. Lawrence Summers, a former US Treasury secretary, said raising rates soon would be a \u201cserious error\u201d. \u201cA reasonable assessment of current conditions suggests that raising rates in the near future would be a serious error that would threaten all three of the Fed\u2019s major objectives: price stability, full employment and financial stability,\u201d he said in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal. He also posted on Twitter to warn that \u201cwe could be in the early stage of a very serious situation\u201d. Barclays economists on Monday pushed back their forecast for a rate rise from the next month to March in the wake of the highly volatility markets. \u201cGiven the uncertainty around the current global outlook, the timing of the rate hike seems more uncertain than usual,\u201d they said in a note to clients. \u201cShould this episode of financial market volatility prove transitory, the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] could raise rates in December. On the other hand, if the volatility proves durable or reveals greater than expected weakness in global activity, the FOMC may push the first rate hike beyond March. We see a delay past mid-2016 as a relatively low probability at this point given our views on US labor markets.\u201d The White House has played down fears that volatility in international stock markets, particularly in China, would have any significant knock-on impact on the US economy. \u201cThere is no doubt the global economy is more interconnected that it ever has been,\u201d Josh Earnest, the president\u2019s chief spokesperson, told reporters on Monday. \u201cWhat I would encourage people to evaluate is the ongoing strength and resilience of the US economy.\u201d Earnest said the US was experiencing the longest period of sustained private sector job increases in American history, with unemployment is at the lowest level in seven years. \u201cThe US economy is far stronger now than it was in 2008,\u201d he said. Earnest added that Wall Street reforms ushered in since the financial crisis mean that major US financial institutions have added more than $600bn in capital since 2009. \u201cThat means banks are less reliant on unstable short-term funding, and that they are better able to withstand short-term volatility in the financial markets,\u201d he said. The global rout was sparked by a 9% fall in Chinese markets hit by \u201cBlack Monday\u201d \u2013 the biggest one-day fall since 2007 \u2013 which intensified already-heightened fears about the health of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. The pan-European FTSeurofirst300, which compromises Europe\u2019s 300 biggest companies, closed down 5.4%, to its lowest level this year. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 5%, France\u2019s CAC shed 5.6% and Spain\u2019s IBEX lost 5.7%. The FTSE 100 in London closed down 4.67% to 5,899 points, wiping more than \u00a373.9bn ($116.3bn) off the index of leading UK shares. It was the first time the index had dropped below the 6,000 mark since early 2013, with almost all companies in the red, and followed a week of declines last week. \u201cThere is a lot of fear in the markets,\u201d said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG in Singapore, said. \u201cThe risk sentiment is really on the verge of panic, which is why we are seeing plenty of red screens. The Chinese stock market fell really spectacularly.\u201d Connor Campbell, an analyst at the spread betting firm Spreadex, said: \u201cThe fog of fear over the state of the Chinese economy is only thickening, and with little in the way of non-Chinese news to come this Monday, the markets are going to struggle to escape today without some fairly ugly scars. And the worrying thing is it could all worsen this afternoon with \u2026 the US markets.\u201d The oil price, which has already fallen dramatically, fell more than 5% to a 6-1/2-year low. US tech stocks, including Apple, Facebook and Netflix, which had suffered bruising declines of as much as 14% in the morning, were in positive territory by 1pm. Apple\u2019s recovery \u2013 from a 11% drop to 2% gain by 1pm \u2013 came after chief executive Tim Cook sought to reassure investors. In a very unusual mid-quarter intervention, Cook said Apple\u2019s performance has been \u201creassuring\u201d and he was not overly worried about the Chinese concerns. \u201cI get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August,\u201d Cook said in an email to CNBC host Jim Cramer. \u201cObviously I can\u2019t predict the future, but our performance so far this quarter is reassuring.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of npower has quit less than two weeks after the energy supplier was forced to warn of another unexpected drop in performance following persistent problems with its billing systems. The departure of Paul Massara follows months of speculation about his position because of the steadily weakening outlook for npower, the UK division of German energy group RWE. This month RWE confirmed npower\u2019s profit for the first six months of 2015 fell by almost two-thirds, to \u00a338m, after the UK business was deserted by many customers over problems with its bills. Some households had reportedly received multiple bills for varying amounts, not matched to meter readings. In other instances the names on bills have been incorrect, or bills have been arriving late or not at all. The business was also hit by lower energy consumption in Britain and higher grid fees. But it was the failure to swiftly resolve billing issues in particular that reflected badly on Massara. Persistent problems are believed to have contributed to an exodus of more than 300,000 customers in the UK. Npower customers had been switched to a new billing system in 2013. Problems became apparent last year but the full impact of the shortcomings was only laid bare this year. RWE boss Peter Terium said on Monday: \u201cAt this time we need a chief executive who will focus on fixing the basic process improvements and has a track record of implementing operational process changes.\u201d Earlier this month RWE told investors in Germany that full-year figures for its UK arm would be \u201csignificantly below\u201d the already disappointing levels achieved in 2014. Facing questions about continued teething problems with UK bills, Massara said this month: \u201cThe challenges that we have faced were tougher than we expected but we know what the problems are and are taking the right steps to fix them.\u201d He pointed out that complaints had fallen to the lowest level since December 2011. But RWE admitted it had often only been able to retain customers with expired contracts by offering them new deals with more favourable conditions. RWE said the departure of Massara, together with that of his chief financial officer, Jens Madrian, was \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d. But in a statement the German parent group also described the management reshuffle at npower as RWE\u2019s response to \u201cthe unexpectedly negative\u201d performance of its UK unit. Massara had been running npower, one of the UK\u2019s big six energy suppliers, for two years. RWE would not disclose what severance terms he is to receive. Rolf Martin Schmitz, RWE\u2019s chief operating officer, said: \u201cThe UK remains an important market for us. We will do everything in our power to overcome the operational and technical difficulties in the UK supply business.\u201d Massara is to be replaced by Paul Coffey, who joined as an npower director in April having previously served as chief operating officer of the group\u2019s renewable energy division, RWE Innogy. He had been tipped as a likely successor for months. In its statement, RWE said of the departing Massara and Madrian: \u201cWe would like to thank them for their contribution toward moving npower from sixth to fifth in customer service.\u201d According to analysts at RBC Capital Markets, the half-year figures had cemented RWE as the worst performer in the energy sector. For the first six months of 2015, RWE\u2019s operating profit fell 11% to \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.5bn). The group has made heavy cuts to its capital expenditure budget and shed more than 1,000 jobs.",

      "bodyText": "European stocks tumbled and US equity markets prepared for steep falls after Chinese shares had their worst day since 2007 \u2013 intensifying a stock market rout driven by fears about the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. In lunchtime trading local time, the FTSE 100 had fallen almost 4.5% to 5,914 points, wiping more than \u00a360bn off the index of leading UK shares. It was the first time the index had dropped below the 6,000 mark since early 2013, with almost all companies in the red, and followed a week of declines last week. The biggest fallers were mining companies that rely on demand from Chinese manufacturers for their coal, iron ore and other metals. Glencore, the giant commodities trader and miner, fell 8% and Anglo American and BHP Billiton each lost more than 7% of their value. Germany\u2019s Dax index fell more than almost 5%, dropping into bear market territory after losing 20% of its value since April. The French CAC index was also down almost 5%. In the US, traders expected the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index to fall by 3% and the Dow Jones by 4% when trading starts at 2:30pm UK time. European and US shares tumbled after turmoil returned to haunt the Chinese stock market on Monday. Shares plunged and the country\u2019s benchmark stock index lost all its gains since the beginning of this year. Connor Campbell, an analyst at the spread betting firm Spreadex, said: \u201cThe fog of fear over the state of the Chinese economy is only thickening, and with little in the way of non-Chinese news to come this Monday, the markets are going to struggle to escape today without some fairly ugly scars. And the worrying thing is it could all worsen this afternoon with the opening of the US markets.\u201d As the Shanghai Composite Index sank by nearly 9% - its biggest one-day drop since 2007 - Xinhua, Beijing\u2019s official news agency, admitted China was facing a \u201cBlack Monday\u201d. By lunchtime, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index had fallen by almost 5% and the Shenzhen Composite Index was down more than 7.5%. The Chinese rout sparked an Asia-wide selloff, with Taipei shares plunging nearly 7.5 %, their worst ever one-day drop. \u201cThe private money is all trying to get out of the market and what is holding up the market is only the government intervention,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, the chief Asia economist for IHS Global Insight. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of volatility in the Shanghai market with big swings. But clearly this kind of fall is substantial. It is a big event when a market falls by that amount in one day.\u201d Fraser Howie, the co-author of Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China\u2019s Extraordinary Rise, said Beijing\u2019s handling of the stock market calamity raised real questions about the leadership of president Xi Jinping and the prime minister, Li Keqiang. \u201cI think there is now growing realisation \u2013 domestically and offshore - that the Chinese leadership are not in control of the situation. Not only are they not in control of it, they don\u2019t even seem to grasp the problems at times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real casualty over the summer is the government\u2019s credibility. When you look at the stock market intervention, when you look at the FX botch as I would call it a couple of weeks ago, and then you look at the Tianjin blasts, you see a government that is most certainly not in control. You look at this and it sends a very poor picture about China\u2019s competency at the leadership level. Who else is responsible here? Xi Jinping seems invisible.\u201d \u201cThere are no short-term fixes for what China is going through,\u201d Howie added. \u201cThis is ultimately a painful unwinding of imbalances and leverage in the system and those processes are always tough and sore. It\u2019s a bit like saying what\u2019s a quick solution to my hangover? And that is exactly where China is at the moment. There are no quick solutions.\u201d Bernard Aw, a market analyst from IG in Singapore, said, \u201cThe risk sentiment is really on the verge of panic which is why we are seeing plenty of red screens. The Chinese stock market fell really spectacularly.\u201d Alex Kwok, an analyst at China Investment Securities in Hong Kong, told Channel News Asia: \u201cThis is already a small-scale stock market disaster. Any rebound, if there is any, could be just technical.\u201d China\u2019s Communist party leaders have launched an unprecedented push to prop up shares since June, injecting trillions of dollars into the stock market and setting up a market \u201cstabilisation\u201d fund. But yet another day of stock market chaos suggests investors have little faith in such measures and the wider prospects of the Chinese economy. Shanghai\u2019s Composite Index has now lost more than 35% of its value since June. Biswas, from IHS Global Insight, said the dramatic events of Black Monday underlined how Beijing\u2019s response to the continuing crisis had been timid and inadequate. \u201cIt has been piecemeal efforts through the course of the year with several small cuts in interest rates and some fiscal stimulus measures scattered around in recent months,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen any decisive action and there is no sense of determination coming out of policy makers that they want to turn the economy around. \u201cWhat would need to be seen to be convincing is substantial further monetary policy easing. They don\u2019t have an inflation problem right now, therefore there is a lot of room to cut rates further and to use monetary policy stimulus \u2013 like cutting policy rates and by cutting the reserve requirement ratio \u2013 combined with fiscal policy stimulus measures. \u201cI think if they use a combination of those and also back that up with leadership at the economic policy level \u2013 by giving a convincing delivery of a stimulus package \u2013 then that might help to reassure not only Chinese domestic markets but also global markets, because increasingly the global outlook has been starting to deteriorate because of what is happening in China.\u201d In a research note UBS analysts warned: \u201cWorries that the world economy is losing momentum caused many investors to seek safety in government bonds and money markets. Investors should brace for further volatility.\u201d The latest rout came just a day after Beijing announced it would allow pension funds to invest in the stock market with immediate effect. The move was widely seen as an attempt to divert billions of dollars into the market to shore up prices. China\u2019s state-run media has repeatedly vowed that the country\u2019s leaders will not allow such huge losses to continue. \u201cIn the future the market will not fall off a cliff,\u201d an editorial in the Shanghai Securities Daily said last month. \u201cThe government will not allow such a situation to happen again.\u201d The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has attempted to put a brave face on the economic situation. \u201cWe should be confident that economic growth still enjoys promising prospects,\u201d he told officials in north-east China last month. Yet in the wake of a slew of poor economic data in recent weeks , Biswas said there were \u201cno particularly strong fundamentals that would support any recovery in the stock market\u201d. \u201cWhere [we go from] here will be very much dependent on what the government can do with the real economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rout in the market was temporarily stopped [by government intervention] but there are limits to how much you can prop up the market indefinitely. We are just seeing that unfold now. The bubble has burst and the private money is flowing out of the market.\u201d Aw, from IG, said he expected losses to continue: \u201cI think the sell-down is probably going to continue for the next few sessions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, is putting a great deal of effort into projecting an image as the country\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Much of Beijing shut down over the weekend as scores of troops, tanks and other military vehicles streamed into the country\u2019s capital to rehearse for an impending military parade. But just a day after images of the country\u2019s immense state power flooded Chinese social media, they were filled with news of a staggering plummet on the country\u2019s stock exchanges. The government\u2019s efforts to prop up stock prices in the world\u2019s second largest economy hit a brick wall on Monday, as stocks suffered their biggest fall since 2007, when state intervention into the country\u2019s bourses failed. The CSI 300 index breached the 3,500 mark \u2013 seen by many local investors as a red line the government would not allow it to fall through \u2013 and closed down nearly 9% at 3,275. Xinhua, the Chinese state-owned news agency, called the rout \u201cBlack Monday\u201d on Twitter. The V-Day celebrations, due to occur on 3 September, are designed to be a showcase of Xi\u2019s power and credibility and are clearly aimed at a domestic audience. But increasingly, when it comes to the economy, his and the government\u2019s credibility are taking a hammering. Beijing\u2019s reputation as skilful and competent economic managers \u2013 built up over years of breakneck economic growth \u2013 is in tatters after a two-month long stock market rescue operation has faltered. More so than anywhere else, China\u2019s stock market is disconnected from the economic fundamentals of the country, experts say, but nonetheless the rapid decline shows that market sentiment has fallen off a cliff. \u201cIt is a key moment for China. The equity market in freefall, the banking system increasingly starved of liquidity, rising capital outflows, and a rapidly slowing economy,\u201d Angus Nicholson, of IG Group, wrote in a note on Monday. Global markets were already reeling from last week\u2019s data, which showed the country\u2019s manufacturing output had dipped to its lowest point since the global economic crisis. Experts say there\u2019s a sense that it no longer matters what the government says or does, as the market is now adjusting to what it believes the reality is. An announcement over the weekend that Chinese pension funds would invest 30% of their capital in the domestic equity markets failed to prevent the rout, revealing to some analysts the government\u2019s complete desperation. Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University, said the move had an \u201cobvious political nature\u201d that made it extremely risky. \u201cUsing pension fund capital to try and prop up stock prices runs the very real risk of turning a stock market bubble into a pensions crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe policy response appears poorly thought through and managed and this latest policy initiative appears desperate to prop up prices regardless of consequences.\u201d But despite the policy change, the market\u2019s latest slide has wiped out the entire gains for the year to date. According to Nicholson, that\u2019s \u201ca disastrous result for China, after working so hard to breathe life back into domestic equities after the 2007 crash and having spent hundreds of billions of dollars propping up the market since June\u201d. Anyone listening to the president would be left wondering what on earth there is to be worried about. In a speech to provincial leaders in the north-eastern province of Jilin last month, Xi told local officials that the economic growth outlook was still promising. Xinhua reported: \u201cXi pointed out the Chinese economy is in good condition with unchanged factors, including sound economic fundamentals, remarkable flexibility, huge potential and room to growth. We should be confident that economic growth still enjoys promising prospects.\u201d And indeed, not all the latest economic indicators have been dire. While the Caixin flash PMI last week was the lowest since March 2009, the services sector showed strength in July climbing to an 11-month high. And e-commerce, perhaps the country\u2019s most dynamic sector, continues to boom. But the country\u2019s transition from an investment-led, heavy industry model, towards a services and consumer-led economy is proving to be a bumpy one. Andrew Hordern, regional economist with IMA Asia, says the world will need to get used to a \u201cslower growing, more up-and-down China\u201d. \u201cTransitions of this size are difficult. Firstly GDP growth will be slower than before even at the best of times. Secondly, there will be times, such as now, where the economy falters significantly,\u201d he said. Jie Gan, professor of finance at Cheung Kong graduate school of business in Beijing, said that based on the economic data so far, it\u2019s unlikely there will be a hard landing. \u201cIt will be \u2018under control\u2019. But the key is not to sacrifice long-term policy for short term \u2018control\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is true that fully solving the fundamental problems can be a painful process, for example getting rid of excess and obsolete capacity.\u201d What the market is making clear now is a lack of confidence among investors in what have seemed to be fairly erratic government\u2019s policy announcements. This month\u2019s unexpected currency devaluation \u2013 the biggest in over two decades \u2013 was a sign to some of the government\u2019s increasing anxiety, though it got the thumbs-up from the IMF. The authorities\u2019 failure to step in to stop Monday\u2019s market tumult seems to suggest the government has given up after throwing everything at the problem. There are signs now that the country\u2019s transition to a \u201cnew normal\u201d is coming up against some stubborn roadblocks. Last week, state media ran an unexpectedly frank commentary describing the fierce resistance that Xi\u2019s reforms were meeting within the Communist party. \u201cThe in-depth reform touches the basic issue of reconfiguring the lifeblood of this enormous economy, and making it healthier,\u201d it said. \u201cThe scale of the resistance is beyond what could have been imagined.\u201d",

Much of Beijing shut down over the weekend as scores of troops, tanks and other military vehicles streamed into the country\u2019s capital to rehearse for an impending military parade. </p> <p>But just a day after images of the country\u2019s immense state power flooded Chinese social media, they were filled with news of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/24/black-monday-chinese-stock-market-loses-all-gains-since-start-of-year\">a staggering plummet on the country\u2019s stock exchanges.</a> The government\u2019s efforts to prop up stock prices in the world\u2019s second largest economy hit a brick wall on Monday, as stocks suffered their biggest fall since 2007, when state intervention into the country\u2019s bourses failed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/aug/24/global-stocks-sell-off-deepens-as-panic-grips-markets-live\">Stock market rout wipes another \u00a340bn off FTSE 100 in China panic - live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The CSI 300 index breached the 3,500 mark \u2013 seen by many local investors as a red line the government would not allow it to fall through \u2013 and closed down nearly 9% at 3,275. Xinhua, the Chinese state-owned news agency, called the rout \u201cBlack Monday\u201d on Twitter.</p> <p>The V-Day celebrations, due to occur on 3 September, are designed to be a showcase of Xi\u2019s power and credibility and are clearly aimed at a domestic audience. But increasingly, when it comes to the economy, his and the government\u2019s credibility are taking a hammering. Beijing\u2019s reputation as skilful and competent economic managers \u2013 built up over years of breakneck economic growth \u2013 is in tatters after a two-month long stock market rescue operation has faltered.</p> <p>More so than anywhere else, China\u2019s stock market is disconnected from the economic fundamentals of the country, experts say, but nonetheless the rapid decline shows that market sentiment has fallen off a cliff.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a key moment for China. The equity market in freefall, the banking system increasingly starved of liquidity, rising capital outflows, and a rapidly slowing economy,\u201d Angus Nicholson, of IG Group, wrote in a note on Monday.</p> <p>Global markets were already reeling from last week\u2019s data, which showed the country\u2019s manufacturing output had dipped to its lowest point since the global economic crisis. Experts say there\u2019s a sense that it no longer matters what the government says or does, as the market is now adjusting to what it believes the reality is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/24/black-monday-chinese-stock-market-loses-all-gains-since-start-of-year\">European markets slide after China's 'Black Monday'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> An announcement over the weekend that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/china-to-allow-pension-fund-to-invest-in-stock-market-for-first-time\">Chinese pension funds would invest 30% of their capital in the domestic equity markets</a> failed to prevent the rout, revealing to some analysts the government\u2019s complete desperation.</p> <p> Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University, said the move had an \u201cobvious political nature\u201d that made it extremely risky. \u201cUsing pension fund capital to try and prop up stock prices runs the very real risk of turning a stock market bubble into a pensions crisis,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe policy response appears poorly thought through and managed and this latest policy initiative appears desperate to prop up prices regardless of consequences.\u201d But despite the policy change, the market\u2019s latest slide has wiped out the entire gains for the year to date.</p> <p>According to Nicholson, that\u2019s \u201ca disastrous result for China, after working so hard to breathe life back into domestic equities after the 2007 crash and having spent hundreds of billions of dollars propping up the market since June\u201d.</p> <p>Anyone listening to the president would be left wondering what on earth there is to be worried about.

We should be confident that economic growth still enjoys promising prospects.\u201d</p> <p>And indeed, not all the latest economic indicators have been dire. While the Caixin flash PMI last week was the lowest since March 2009, the services sector showed strength in July climbing to an 11-month high. And e-commerce, perhaps the country\u2019s most dynamic sector, continues to boom. But the country\u2019s transition from an investment-led, heavy industry model, towards a services and consumer-led economy is proving to be a bumpy one.</p> <p>Andrew Hordern, regional economist with IMA Asia, says the world will need to get used to a \u201cslower growing, more up-and-down China\u201d. \u201cTransitions of this size are difficult. Firstly GDP growth will be slower than before even at the best of times. Secondly, there will be times, such as now, where the economy falters significantly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jie Gan, professor of finance at Cheung Kong graduate school of business in Beijing, said that based on the economic data so far, it\u2019s unlikely there will be a hard landing. \u201cIt will be \u2018under control\u2019. But the key is not to sacrifice long-term policy for short term \u2018control\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is true that fully solving the fundamental problems can be a painful process, for example getting rid of excess and obsolete capacity.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/china-to-allow-pension-fund-to-invest-in-stock-market-for-first-time\">China to allow pension fund to invest in stock market for first time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What the market is making clear now is a lack of confidence among investors in what have seemed to be fairly erratic government\u2019s policy announcements. This month\u2019s unexpected currency devaluation \u2013 the biggest in over two decades \u2013 was a sign to some of the government\u2019s increasing anxiety, though it got the thumbs-up from the IMF.</p> <p>The authorities\u2019 failure to step in to stop Monday\u2019s market tumult seems to suggest the government has given up after throwing everything at the problem. There are signs now that the country\u2019s transition to a \u201cnew normal\u201d is coming up against some stubborn roadblocks.</p> <p>Last week, state media ran an unexpectedly frank commentary describing the fierce resistance that Xi\u2019s reforms were meeting within the Communist party. \u201cThe in-depth reform touches the basic issue of reconfiguring the lifeblood of this enormous economy, and making it healthier,\u201d it said. \u201cThe scale of the resistance is beyond what could have been imagined.\u201d</p>",

Ofwat said Bazalgette Tunnel Ltd, a company formed to lead the project, would build the Thames tideway tunnel. The 16-mile (25km) sewer is designed to reduce the 39m tonnes of untreated sewage that flows into the river Thames each year. The government gave the final order last September for the tunnel, which will run from west to east, along the Thames. Residents and green campaigners have opposed the project and experts have said it will be a waste of money. The sewer will be paid for by the 15 million customers of Thames Water, which is owned by a consortium led by the Australian bank Macquarie. Earlier forecasts had put the extra cost at up to \u00a380 for the average customer. But Ofwat said customers would now pay no more than \u00a325 extra a year by the middle of the next decade and that \u00a37 of that figure was already included in bills. Ofwat said that instead of setting a minimum return for investors in the project, it had let Thames Water conduct a competition between bidders to get the best value. The bidding process brought down the expected cost to customers, the regulator said. Cathryn Ross, Ofwat\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOnce the tunnel had been confirmed as the best solution to the problem of sewage in the Thames, our job at Ofwat was to work with government and the project to make sure that Thames Water\u2019s customers got a fair deal.

Balfour Beatty, the infrastructure company, said Bazalgette Tunnel had awarded its joint venture with Morgan Sindall and BAM Nuttall a \u00a3416m contract to build the four-mile west section of the tunnel.

      "bodyText": "More than $70bn has been wiped from the Australian share market as fears about China\u2019s economy sparked its heaviest fall in six-and-a-half years and prompted warnings that the rout could continue. A disastrous day on China\u2019s main share market \u2013 dubbed \u201cBlack Monday\u201d by the state news agency Xinhua \u2013 has added to fears that Australia\u2019s top trading partner is faltering. European markets also plunged on Monday morning as the global sell-off which started when China devalued the yuan two weeks ago accelerated in China with the Shanghai composite index shedding 8.5%. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 and All Ordinaries indices fell more than 4% \u2013 their largest one-day drop since January 2009. They are now clinging to 5,000 points, levels not seen since July 2013. The indices had been close to breaching 6,000 points just four months ago. With more losses expected on Wall Street overnight, investors were braced for more heavy selling in the days to come. The Australian dollar also hit a fresh six-year low of US72.01c as the continued fall in the price of key industrial commodities darkened the outlook for the resource-led Australian economy. A barrel of US crude oil now costs just $39.33 per barrel, the cheapest since early 2009 while copper and aluminium were also testing the lows last reached in the tailend of global financial crisis in June/July 2009. Australian Stock Report head of research Chris Conway warned that the stock market falls could continue if it drops below 5,000 points. \u201cRight now, there is clearly some panic selling occurring and there is little in the way of technical support below the current market price,\u201d he said. IG market analyst Angus Nicholson says this is now a key moment for China \u2013 its equity markets are in free fall, its banking system is short of liquidity and forecasts of 7% economic growth are now looking ambitious. \u201cThe most sensible way forward would seemingly involve further currency devaluation ... and stepped up fiscal stimulus,\u201d he said. The Australian market\u2019s losses were felt across the board \u2013 the energy sector dropped 6.2%, financials fell 4.6% and retailers shed 3.5%. But the respected Australian economist Saul Eslake said the concerns about China were overdone. The country\u2019s growing service industry was gradually overtaking the manufacturing sector as a share of GDP, he told Guardian Australia. The property market in the biggest cities was \u201cstabilising\u201d, he said, although the smaller cities were \u201cstill weak\u201d. And he believed that the recent devaluation of the yuan was not an attempt to stimulate flagging exports but was a genuine effort to reform the currency regime and to try to get ahead of any possible rate cut by the US Fed. \u201cIt\u2019s a move to be more flexible ahead of a Fed rate cut. The yuan is up 20% in trade-weighted terms so they wanted wriggle room if the Fed cuts rates and the US dollar rises. Despite attracting a lot of criticism for their handling of the crisis, the Chinese authorities might still have some policy levers left to pull. Any stimulus from Beijing would be a huge boost for Australian companies buffetted by the headwinds from the China slowdown. Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals group was one of the biggest fallers on the ASX200 on Monday, with its shares plunging 14.62% after it announced annual profits were down 88%. However, chief executive Nev Power was counting on the Chinese government\u2019s stimulus measures to boost demand for iron ore. He said China still had a lot of growth ahead and the central government\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy would boost demand for steel. \u201cThere are about 300 million people still to urbanise and China\u2019s economy is probably back where the US economy was back in the early 1900s or 1920s so to bring it up to 75% or 80% urbanised is going to take a lot of steel yet to come,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of signs of stimulus coming into the market. I think there is a recognition that they need to stimulate the economy and that will flow through to steel demand.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fears of a slowdown in the Chinese economy sent Asia-Pacific stocks plummeting to three-year-lows on Monday, days after Wall Street suffered its biggest one-day loss in almost four years. China\u2019s main Shanghai composite index lost up to 8.6% as investors, shaken by last week\u2019s sell-off in America, unloaded shares across the board. Taipei shares plunged 7.49% in that market\u2019s worst ever drop inside a single day. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sank over 4.6% to a three-year low. Hours before the turmoil was expected to continue after European markets opened, share prices were falling dramatically elsewhere in Asia: Japan\u2019s Nikkei shed nearly 900 points, or more than 4 percent, in the early afternoon. The Shanghai composite index fell 8% in early trading; Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index fell 4.2%, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi lost 0.5%. In Australia the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 and the All Ordinaries indices fell more than 2.4% in the first 20 minutes of trade on Monday. Banks and mining companies were among the worst hit. Markets have been reeling since China\u2019s shock currency devaluation almost two weeks ago. \u201cMarkets are panicking. Things are starting to look like the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Speculators are selling assets that seem the most vulnerable,\u201d said Takako Masai, the head of research at Shinsei Bank in Tokyo. Chinese shares fell 11% last week after manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level since 2009. The trading day was barely under way when the Nikkei benchmark index briefly fell more than 500 points from Friday. Concern over the health of the global economy sent investors flocking to the yen \u2013 considered a \u201csafe haven\u201d \u2013 driving the US dollar to a six-week low against the Japanese currency. At noon, the dollar fetched 120.86-87 yen in Tokyo compared with 122.89-90 yen last Friday. The dollar\u2019s slide against the yen hit Japanese automakers and other exporters, which have benefitted from a steadily weakening yen over the past two years. Sony shares had fallen by 7.4% by midday, while Toyota\u2019s shares dropped 5.8%. After five weeks of losses, the Asia-Pacific region had been bracing itself for another tumultuous start to the week, with investor concern centred on China. Fears that China could drag down the global economy sparked the steepest one-day drop in nearly four years on Wall Street on Friday, and left the Dow Industrial Index more than 10% below its May record. Emerging economies that are highly dependent on exports to China are suffering from the Chinese manufacturing slowdown, analysts said. \u201cInvestors are taking a safety first approach to the stock market given the potential for instability related to capital flight from emerging economies,\u201d Ric Spooner, a market strategist for CMC Markets, said in a commentary. Eiji Kinouchi, chief technical analyst at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said: \u201cChina could be forced to devalue the yuan even more should its economy falter, and the equity markets are dealing with the prospect of a weaker yuan amplifying the negative impact from a sluggish Chinese economy.\u201d Nader Naeimi, the Sydney-based head of dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital Investors, told Bloomberg: \u201cThings are probably going to get worse before they get better. You really need rate cuts and more policy easing in China. In the meantime, things can get worse.\u201d But Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, warned against overreacting to China\u2019s woes and to growing uncertainty over Greece\u2019s ability to implement austerity measures and reforms agreed as part of its recent bailout package. \u201cAt present, we would view the global share market correction as a correction we had to have \u2013 a situation that will be beneficial in injecting more value into markets,\u201d he said.",
