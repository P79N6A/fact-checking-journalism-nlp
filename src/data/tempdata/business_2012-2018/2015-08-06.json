      "bodyText": "The UK high street has endured its worst summer in six years, as volatile weather and the lure of restaurants and holidays kept shoppers away. Underlying sales, which exclude new store openings, slipped by 1.1% in July according to accountants BDO, meaning stores have seen three consecutive months of decline for the first time since 2009. Sales fell by 0.9% in May and 2% in June. Fashion retailers suffered the worst problems, according to the survey of 85 mid-sized retailers including French Connection, Oasis and Hobbs, with sales at high street stores down by 1.4%. Homewares sales fell by 1.1%, a surprise given the buoyant housing market. Sophie Michael at BDO said some fashion retailers had tried to cope with the chilly start to the summer by launching their summer sales earlier than normal, only to be hit by a slump in consumer confidence with the economic chaos in Greece. But those who chose to delay until August did not fare much better. \u201cConsumers remain cautious with regard to spending: the political landscape is still cooling after the election, and speculation over interest rate rises continues to create uncertainty,\u201d Michael said. She said shoppers were indulging in \u201cselected spending\u201d at restaurants and bars, rather than on homewares and fashion. The figures are disappointing for retailers who endured a tough autumn last year when the weather was unseasonably warm and a tricky start to the spring, which was much cooler this year than last. Shoppers\u2019 continued caution comes despite an increase in disposable income this year. Some are choosing to spend money on \u201cbig-ticket\u201d items such as cars or holidays, that they may have previously held back on. But the chancellor\u2019s changes to tax credits and other benefits, announced last month, as well as expectations that the Bank of England must raise interest rates before too long are also thought to be weighing on consumers\u2019 minds. The BDO figures reflect a big dip in consumer confidence last month, according to the regular GFK survey, while the number of shoppers visiting the high street slid by 1.1% between April and June, according to the British Retail Consortium. Jamie Merriman, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said fashion retailers were less likely to benefit from any improvement in the economy because they had not suffered as much as other businesses during the recession. \u201cWhat we have heard from retailers so far is that summer has been a bit mixed. When we have volatile weather it\u2019s never a surprise to have clothing sales,\u201d she said. However, Merriman said retailers that had a flexible supply chain and had made the right calls on trends and discount activity were still likely to have done well. Next, for example, increased its profit expectations for the year by 2% last month after warm weather helped to boost sales in July. \u201cGood retailers will outperform in this situation. They are not immune to the weather but tend to do better,\u201d said Merriman. Mike Shearwood, chief executive of Karen Millen, said fashion retailers were also fighting to deal with a dramatic change in the way people shop. Whereas in the past, people would visit several stores and try on a variety of outfits before making their choice, increasingly shoppers pick what they want online and head straight for a particular shop \u2013 cutting down the opportunities for retailers to entice them to buy other things. \u201cThere has been a huge change in shopping habits,\u201d said Shearwood. He added that retailers had also tried to cut back on discounting this summer, and this had not paid off for every chain. \u201cThis season has been mixed,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "As the first chapter of a possible defence document, RSA\u2019s first-half results read very well. After 18 months of cutting costs and flogging small units overseas, chief executive Stephen Hester has something to shout about. Unlike a year ago, the company achieved the basic requirement for a general insurer of making an underwriting profit. Throw in a reasonable investment result, and RSA smashed City forecasts at the level of operating profits \u2013 \u00a3259m was about \u00a350m better than expected. Hester\u2019s boast that RSA is \u201ca company that is getting more valuable\u201d is plainly correct. So what\u2019s a fair price if Zurich, or anybody else, wishes to bid? There are several ways to approach the question. All suggest a bidder would have to offer at least 550p per share just to be taken seriously. Consider that RSA, on current form, should be able to boost earnings per share from a projected 30p this year, according to City estimates, to 40p in 2017. The task doesn\u2019t look terribly demanding. RSA\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 claims versus income from premiums \u2013 was 97% in the half year. But Aviva\u2019s general insurance business, which has been through the restructuring wringer for rather longer, achieves 93%. If RSA could match Aviva\u2019s performance by 2017, underwriting profits would more than double. In the meantime, the reappearance of rising interest rates would improve all insurers\u2019 investment income. So 40p of earnings in 2017 is a reasonable target. At 13 times earnings, a \u201cfair\u201d value for RSA\u2019s shares would then be 520p; at 14 times, it would be 560p. There is, of course, a risk that those earnings never materialise. Insurance is volatile and setbacks happen \u2013 that\u2019s why the industry exists, after all. But if there is a sporting chance of RSA, which was trading at 440p before Zurich appeared, getting to 550p under its own steam within 18 months, why sell for anything less today? Shareholders can only sell their company once, after all. Another way to digest the valuation conundrum is cruder. The stock market thought RSA was worth 440p before Zurich said it was contemplating a bid. Where would the share price be today if the Swiss had been silent? Call it 460p after yesterday\u2019s encouraging numbers, add a traditional 30% takeover premium, and you get about 600p. At that sort of price, RSA would probably be obliged to surrender. Is Zurich prepared to go that high? Possibly not. Zurich\u2019s own half-year results on Thursday were weak, suggesting its shareholders might kill a \u00a35.5bn offer and tell management to concentrate on fixing what they own already. But that\u2019s not Hester\u2019s problem. RSA, in the very long run, will probably be swept up in the consolidation wave. But the short-term objective is to make independence seem a credible alternative. On yesterday\u2019s evidence, RSA is getting there. Rio Tinto\u2019s Sam Walsh can afford to hike dividends Has Rio Tinto chief executive Sam Walsh noticed that a still-raging storm in commodity prices has just reduced the miner\u2019s half-year earnings by 43%? In the face of such destruction in the profit line, Walsh hiked the company\u2019s half-year dividend by 12% and committed to spend another $1bn buying back shares. Typical mining machismo? Actually, no. Rio is one of the few big miners that can afford to be generous to its shareholders these days. As Walsh was at pains to point out, Rio\u2019s numbers add up even in a colder climate for miners. The company generated $4.4bn of cash in the first half of the year, enough to cover the $2.2bn cost of the dividend plus $1.2bn of maintenance capital expenditure. Nor is the debt burden heavy, relatively speaking. Net debt was $13.7bn at the half-year but this is a large company. The arithmetic would look less robust if commodity prices were to take another lurch downwards. But, at the moment, one can understand why Rio \u2013 controversially \u2013 wants to keep digging. Iron ore was the world\u2019s greatest product a couple of years ago, when China\u2019s steel mills couldn\u2019t get enough of the stuff and were willing to pay $150 (\u00a397) a tonne. But even at today\u2019s $57 (\u00a337) a tonne, margins for low-cost producers like Rio are attractive. The company can dig the product out of the Australian desert for $15.20 (\u00a310) a tonne and land it in China for an all-in cost of $29 (\u00a319) a tonne. Not bad. Rio, and iron ore twin BHP Billiton, would surely have invested less in iron ore in recent years if they had sniffed the coming weakness in China. For that, they can be blamed. But it is yesterday\u2019s story. Right now, keeping iron ore production at high volumes and waiting for high-cost rivals to close capacity is the correct strategy, even if Ivan Glasenberg at Glencore disagrees.",

Families looking for a treat,\u201d he says, standing inside the first British branch to offer table service. On a Thursday lunchtime in Mottram, Greater Manchester, this particular fast-food outlet wants people to take their time for once. \u201cI really enjoyed the experience,\u201d says Steve Mitchell, 57, an account manager from Shrewsbury who ordered his lunch through the new system. Customers tap their order into a touchpad, pay for it by card, then go to a table and await delivery by a member of staff. \u201cI\u2019d ordered a chilli chicken meal and it arrived in five minutes.

      "bodyText": "Dairy farmers are telling consumers not to buy milk at Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl and Asda as the battle over prices spills on to the high street for the second time in three years. Farmers have been protesting in UK supermarkets this week, with more action planned on Thursday night, after three major milk processors \u2013 Arla, First Milk and Dairy Crest \u2013 all said at the weekend they would cut the price they pay farmers. David Handley, a farmer from south Wales who has led farmer protests, said shoppers should avoid Morrisons, Asda, Aldi and Lidl. \u201cNone of them have got a formula in place that\u2019s paying a sustainable price to dairy farmers,\u201d he said. He added that, of the major chains, only Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose paid a sustainable price for all their milk products \u2013 including cheese and cream \u2013 and that otherwise shoppers should try and buy from farm shops or their local milkman. Global dairy prices have been falling for months as good weather helped boost production just as a Russian ban on importing dairy goods from Europe and a decline in sales to China dents demand. However, farmers in the UK say they have been suffering particularly because of a supermarket price war in which basics such as milk and butter have had prices slashed. Farmers were paid an average 23.66p per litre for milk in June, down 10% since January and 25% lower than a year ago, according to AHDB Dairy, the British dairy organisation. Farmers say they need to be paid at least 30p to produce each litre. Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, M&amp;S and Waitrose all promise to pay fairly under specific contracts. But only 7% of milk produced in the UK is sold under such terms. Handley said: \u201cTesco has been very clever. All you\u2019ll ever see is that they pay a sustainable price for milk, but what they don\u2019t say is that they don\u2019t pay a sustainable price for yoghurt or cheese.\u201d On Thursday, Farmers for Action, the group which Handley leads, is planning to protest outside Morrisons\u2019 distribution centres and carry out a number of \u201ctrolley dash\u201d protests, in which farmers clear supermarkets\u2019 shelves of milk and give it to charities. A nationwide day of action is planned on Friday. The Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers has warned that the latest price cuts will force more farmers into bankruptcy. Around 1,000 dairy farmers have left the industry over the past two years, with three to four farmers giving up each week, saying that they can no longer make milk production work financially, the association said. The current price at Tesco for a two-pint (1.136 litre) carton of milk is currently 75p. It charged 89p in 2012. Asda is selling its four-pint cartons for 89p this week. Back in 2012, when protests last hit the headlines, the price for a four-pint carton was on promotion at \u00a31. Aldi also currently charges 89p for four pints. Milk Q&amp;A So what can consumers who want UK farmers to survive do? Can your spending power make a difference? Are all the supermarkets the same? Not all all. The best big stores have agreements in place to buy milk with guaranteed prices \u2013 at around the 30p per litre deemed the minimum \u2013 but this only covers around 14% of milk sold for drinking/consuming in the home. Who are the good \u2013 or at least, the better \u2013 guys? Waitrose, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and M&amp;S, because 100% of their own-label milk is bought under fair trade deals. Waitrose pays 32.08p per litre, while Tesco pays 30.93p per litre \u2013 but the fair trade deals they have in place only cover their own brands of milk. Other milk products are not covered. M&amp;S on 1 June cut the price it paid suppliers from 34.265ppl on a standard litre to 32.818. Sainsbury\u2019s pays 30.87p per litre and said this covers 97% of the milk it buys. Who is the best? In May 2014, Booths launched a Fair Milk scheme, pledging to always pay the highest market price to farmers. Now the chain, which has more than 30 stores across Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cumbria, Cheshire and Greater Manchester, pays 33p per litre, the highest price among the big retailers, 10p per litre more than Asda and Morrisons. What about the Co-op? The big player in the convenience sector raised prices for farmers in 2012. Since 1 August, it pays 28.32ppl to its 200 dedicated farmer suppliers, which is better than the worst offenders, but behind its rivals and still less than the 30p that farmers demand. Which shops should I avoid? Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl and Asda have been singled out by farmers as not paying a fair price \u2013 or hiding behind the fact that they buy their milk from one of the big producers who pay significantly less than the 30p fair price. Arla, a milk co-operative, which is owned by farmers, cut the price it pays for milk to 23.01p. It supplies a number of stores and has its own brand of milk. Is buying from the milkman better? Yes and no. You can find a local home delivery provider at findmeamilkman.net. But as home delivery has declined in the UK, the market has consolidated into a few players, dominated by Dairy Crest. Last week, Dairy Crest, the UK\u2019s biggest milk processor, cut its price by 1.4p to just under 22p, way below the 30p guide. Are there still independent milkmen? Yes \u2013 look on the internet for one. Sutton Coldfield Dairies, which serves part of Birmingham, was set up by Phil Mitchell, who quit Dairy Crest, saying he was fed up with their methods. He buys all his milk from the Cotteswold Dairy in Tewkesbury, which he said pays farmers a decent rate. \u201cWe pay 43p a litre and deliver to around 1,400 customers in the north Birmingham area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe price to customers is \u00a31.05 a litre, which is slightly more expensive than the supermarkets, but it is delivered to your door. I reckon the supermarkets are selling it too cheaply anyway \u2013 it\u2019s a loss leader for them.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Super Thursday: Pound falls as Bank signals no imminent rate rise \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "So Super Thursday came and went, and although there was still some uncertainty about when the Bank of England would raise interest rates, a move this year now seems less likely. For the first time the Bank issued its latest inflation report and the minutes of its monetary policy committe meeting at the same time as its latest decision on rates and quantitative easing. To no one\u2019s surprise it left rates on hold at 0.5%, but unexpectedly the minutes showed an 8 to 1 vote in favour of no change. Traders had forecast that at least two members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee would vote for a rate rise, so this was more dovish than predicted. So with all the signs suggesting that dearer borrowing costs could now be delayed until next year, the pound lost ground, down 0.75% against the dollar immediately after the news. But Bank governor Mark Carney sounded a more hawkish tone in his press conference, saying the timing of the next rate rise was getting closer, and so sterling recovered some of its losses. Hence the uncertainty. Elsewhere the Athens market closed 3.65% higher with the banking sector recovering after three days of heavy losses. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund said it would not decide whether to participate in a new bailout package for Greece until the autumn. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Greece and talks between the Greek government and its lenders are set to continue into the weekend. Earlier the European Commission said the discussions were progressing in a satisfactory way, and there would be a teleconference on Friday to take stock of the situation. Shares ended the day on a downbeat note across Europe, with the UK market dominated by the release of the latest Bank of England rate decision and inflation report. The pound fell from around $1.5632 to the current $1.5521 as the Bank of England hinted that although a rate rise was getting closer, it may not come this year as some had been expecting. The closing levels on stock markets were: The FTSE 100 slipped 5.32 points or 0.08% to 6747.09 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.44% to 11,585.10 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.09% at 5192.11 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.42% to 23,811.09 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.23% lower at 11,253.6 But the Athens market added 3.65% to 666.68 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 138 points or 0.79% lower ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. It is now down around 5% since its recent high in May. Hope the closing figure in Athens isn\u2019t ominous. Speaking of Greece, the Athens stock market has ended the day 3.65% higher. The beleaguered banking sector moved higher for the first time since the market reopened on Monday, with the banking index rising 17.8% after falling 63% in the previous three days. Among the individual banks, National Bank of Greece added 27% and Attica Bank rose 23%. Over in Portugal, and the International Monetary Fund has said the country\u2019s economic recovery remained on track but more still needs to be done. In a report at the end of a second monitoring programme, it said: Portugal\u2019s economic recovery remains on track in 2015, boosted by rising exports and consumption, together with a recent upturn in investment. Real GDP expanded by 1.5 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter, and is projected to increase 1.6 percent for the full year. Fiscal adjustment has slowed, meanwhile, with a structural loosening likely this year. Employment has declined in recent quarters, after increasing sharply from early-2013 through mid-2014, and the unemployment rate was at 13.7 percent at the end of March. The banking system as a whole remains adequately capitalized, with decreasing reliance on Eurosystem financing, but loan performance has continued to deteriorate. Non-performing loans increased to 12.3 percent at the end of March, putting further pressure on already weak profitability as banks absorb large impairment expenses and high operating costs. Recent market volatility related to Greece has had limited impact on Portugal, reflecting the country\u2019s improving fundamentals in addition to the overall supportive external environment. Portugal has benefitted from favorable commodity prices, low interest rates and a weaker euro. Growth is projected to moderate over the medium term, however, as these supportive cyclical factors weaken and still high public and private debt constrain the pace of recovery. But it added: With increased financial market volatility in the context of developments in Greece, it is crucial to ensure that investors retain confidence in the direction of economic policies. The authorities have made progress in improving the profile of public debt, but medium-term financing needs remain large, and rising bond market volatility implies significant risks around the baseline financing plan. The authorities should continue to retain a large cash buffer in order to maintain flexibility in implementing their borrowing program. Further fiscal adjustment is needed to further reduce vulnerabilities from high public debt, particularly given the increased risk of financial market turbulence. More decisive steps to improve banks\u2019 balance sheets are desirable. Weak profitability provides little cushion for banks to absorb further losses, in the context of still-rising non-performing loans. More concerted efforts are needed to reduce operating costs in order to improve financial performance and accelerate the process of balance sheet repair; banks should not rely on economic growth alone to mend their balance sheets. It will be essential to regain momentum on structural reforms when a newly elected government is formed. The current economic recovery and beginning of a new political cycle presents a favorable opportunity to press ahead with reforms, particularly in the areas of labor market and public sector reform. Moving forward, it is critical to ensure that product market reforms introduced in recent years are fully implemented as intended, to achieve tangible results on the ground. It will also be important to ensure that the difficult reforms that have been undertaken, such as to contain the rise in energy costs, are not reversed. The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the three months to July, according to the latest estimates from the National Institute of Economic Research. It said: Our monthly estimates of GDP suggest that output grew by 0.7% in the three months ending in July after growth of 0.7% in the three months ending in June 2015. Compared to the same three month period in 2014, this implies a year-on-year growth rate of 2.7%. This is consistent with our recently released quarterly forecast in which we expect an average rate of growth of 2.5% for 2015 as a whole. The Bank of England\u2019s torrent of documents has not really helped clarify its thinking, says Guardian financial editor Nils Pratley: \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d didn\u2019t quite live up to the grand billing. The moment of the first hike in interest rates is getting closer, said the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, but it is also clear that this song could remain the same for some time. Only one member of the monetary policy committee, not the expected two, voted for a rate hike. It is now highly unlikely that interest rates will rise this year. Despite Carney\u2019s many references to \u201crobust momentum\u201d in the economy, next May is viewed by financial markets as the most likely moment the Bank increases the cost of borrowing... The other question here is whether the slew of simultaneous-released documents \u2013 a rate decision, the supporting minutes, and a quarterly inflation report \u2013 actually improves the market\u2019s understanding. That, after all, is meant to be the point of Super Thursday \u2013 less noise, and less confusing signals. A proper judgment is impossible on day one. But one can\u2019t say on Thursday that the new era of greater transparency has aided understanding. We still have a Bank governor who sounds increasingly hawkish on rates \u2013 but lacks a cast-iron case for moving soon. The timing of the decision on when to move rates will move into \u201csharper relief\u201d around the turn of the year, Carney repeated on Thursday. Well, it might. But it\u2019s also possible that the real world \u2013 a blow-up in Greece, a steeper slowdown in China or more wobbly unemployment data \u2013 intervenes. The full comment is here: Here\u2019s a graph showing sterling\u2019s performance against the dollar so far today. As the Bank\u2019s statements were released it fell sharply, since the comments were more dovish that expected and only one member of the monetary policy committee voted for a rate rise. But with governor Mark Carney showing a more hawkish tone during the press conference, the pound has regained some of its lost ground: Foreign exchange business Foenix Partners reckons the Bank\u2019s statements and press conference have not really made things any clearer. Managing director Richard de Meo, said: Just one voting member in favour of a rate hike within the MPC delivered a conflicted message during today\u2019s unprecedented Bank of England session, with Carney\u2019s press conference leaving currency and fixed income traders little clearer on the timings of policy action. The new meeting structure strives for transparency, yet efforts to get markets on side included generic and at times cryptic comments, with the overall tone very mixed: an upbeat assessment of UK growth and productivity, a dismissal of the impact of sterling strength, and then obvious caution around employment growth and the inflation outlook. With wording borrowed from Janet Yellen, the \u201cdata-dependant\u201d stance ensures heighted scrutiny of inflation data, despite the likelihood of upcoming negative readings. We see the range of timings for the first rate hike unchanged, to occur between October and February 2016, with the only major adjustment to the house view being that Carney is no longer boring. Nordic bank SEB also expects the first UK rate rise to be delayed until February next year. Economist Mattias Bru\u00e9r said: While the UK economy has momentum, there is no CPI inflation at all which is an argument against rate hikes...With respect to annual inflation averages, the Bank of England forecast that inflation will only average 0.3% in 2015 compared to 0.6% in May and increasing to 1.5% in 2016. As such, the outlook for inflation is not suggesting that rate hikes are imminent and does not change our view of a February 2016 lift-off. \u201cDovish surprise, but not a dovish report\u201d \u2013 says Alan Clarke at Scotiabank. While the minutes of the August MPC meeting showed that one member voted for an immediate rate hike, expectations had been for two dissents and possibly more. As such, this represents a baby step closer to a rate hike rather than a stride. There was a grudging downward revision to the inflation projection \u2013 down two years ahead from 2.08% y/y to 2.03% y/y. In the context of monetary policy, a rate hike before the end of the year is still possible, but it would require some positive surprises on the data front. Meanwhile, a hike in early-2016 seems more likely unless the data disappoints substantially.\u201d James Knightley, UK economist at ING, and others reckon the tone of Carney\u2019s comments was a bit more hawkish than the earlier triple release. Mark Carney clarified the much quoted \u201cthe decision as to when to start that process of raising interest rates will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year\u201d he used on July 21st. He said that he was speaking from a personal perspective and was not reflecting the general view of the MPC, which implies he is on the more hawkish end of the spectrum of views within the committee. Other than that, the tone is perhaps marginally more hawkish than the triple whammy of announcement, minutes and inflation report. Lots of emphasis on the tightening labour market and the implications for wages. Carney also suggests that the strength of the pound is doing some of the work to tighten monetary conditions, but there is uncertainty as to how much this will feed through into lower CPI [inflation]. Moreover, the needs of rate hikes over the coming year reflects domestic inflation pressures and the decision to hike will, of course, be data dependent. To recap our view. We look for a 25bp hike in February 2016, to be followed by two more in mid-2016 leaving Bank Rate at 1.25% for end 2016. We think that wage growth will continue to edge higher as companies increasingly worry about staff retention and the central bank will respond to the threat this poses for CPI missing its target over the medium term. Nonetheless, policy tightening will be slow and gradual reflecting high debt levels and the currency implications feeding back into CPI. Brexit concerns as the vote approaches on the UK\u2019s ongoing membership of the EU and its implications for consumer and business confidence and spending will also likely lead to caution from the BoE. The press conference is over. Towards the end Carney reiterated the MPC\u2019s plan not to unwind quantitative easing by selling off gilts until rates start to rise, saying We want to use interest rates as the marginal instrument of monetary policy.\u201d Here are Carney\u2019s earlier comments on sterling in full: There\u2019s no question the persistent strength of sterling is having an influence on policy, and it\u2019s one of the factors, but it has to persist. We will take it into account. But even taking it into account... we see robust private sector growth here and consistent with that is a need to begin to increase interest rates. Sterling hasn\u2019t taken away that requirement.\u201d The pound has recouped some of its earlier losses and is now trading at $1.5526, down 0.46% on the day. The TUC, on the other hand, has applauded the Bank for keeping borrowing costs unchanged. TUC assistant general secretary Paul Nowak said: The Bank is right to keep rates on hold and recognise the ongoing risks to our weak economic recovery. Given the chancellor\u2019s plans for severe spending cuts, putting interest rates up too soon would hit growth hard, choking off recent gains in employment and earnings for working-age people.\u201d Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at foreign exchange specialist Monex Europe, says: Today\u2019s releases from the Bank of England were not so super after all, as caution still reigns supreme at the Bank of England. This is the same old ultra-cautious Bank of England we\u2019ve had for years, and yet today\u2019s releases came as a surprise. Although the inflation report is still being picked apart, sterling is being sold off across the board and gilt yields are going down, suggesting that the markets were expecting a far more hawkish set of minutes. Now the MPC, along with the markets, will be watching wage growth data even more intently. Should the spike recently seen in wages extend over the coming months, the balance of votes could quickly swing in favour of hikes. For now however, the core dynamic that has kept the Bank in wait-and-see mode for years remains very much in play, as uncertainty around labour market slack and a murky international outlook keep the majority of the MPC on the dovish side.\u201d Carney has reiterated that the Bank is \u201cmildly encouraged\u201d by the recent pick-up in UK productivity. But, he added We haven\u2019t run to the other side of the boat as a consequence of a few good reports. We have taken about half of that improvement in productivity into the forecasts.\u201d Carney highlighted the UK\u2019s current account deficit as a major risk to financial stability. The Bank\u2019s deputy governor Ben Broadbent added that the economic recovery is driven as much by business investment as consumer spending. Carney said: This is not a debt fuelled consumer recovery... Households are consuming out of income [rather than savings]. There is absolutely a sustainability to that aspect of the recovery particularly as productivity starts to fill in. You can watch the press conference live here. The Bank of England governor denied suggestions that he said in a speech in July that borrowing costs would rise around the turn of the year. He said he was speaking in a personal capacity, rather than representing the MPC as a whole. The central bank has kept its base rate at a record low of 0.5% for more than six years, after slashing rates at the height of the global financial crisis like other central banks around the world. In response to a question from the Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart about how the stock market crash in China and the Greek crisis have influenced the MPC\u2019s rate decision, Carney said: These were not factors that were weighing on the committee\u2019s decision in any form\u201d except in terms of how they impacted on the economic fundamentals. He said the \u201csituation in Greece was a steady feed of news about an important situation\u201d and it showed that some of the defences that had been put in place by the European authorities were holding. Events in China are important, but they\u2019re important first and foremost from a perspective of global demand. The financial links to China are nowhere near as strong as the scale of that economy would suggest. China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Carney said the Bank will be closely monitoring economic developments, in particular wage growth, productivity, core inflation, import prices and risks to the international environment. He stressed that interest rate increases will be \u201cgradual and limited,\u201d adding that the \u201cpath is more important than the likely timing of the first increase\u201d. The likely timing of the first bank rate increase is drawing closer. However the exact timing of the first move cannot be predicted in advance. It will be the product of economic developments and prospects. In short it will be data dependent.\u201d Set against that, UK private domestic demand has been robust and is expected to remain so, the Bank\u2019s governor said. Demand growth can return inflation to its 2% target within two years. Carney said the most striking development in the UK over the past year has been the fall in inflation, which hit zero in June. The press conference is under way: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is reading out the opening statement. The FTSE 100 index has turned positive: it is now trading nearly 7 points higher at 6759.25, a 0.1% gain. Before the Bank of England\u2019s release, it was drifting lower, trading down nearly 0.4%. Housebuilding and property shares have been lifted as the prospects of an interest rate rise before the end of the year receded after the Bank\u2019s reports. Taylor Wimpey is up 3%, while Persimmon, Barratt Developments and Bovis Homes are all up nearly 2%. Property website Zoopla has risen nearly 1%, as has estate agency Countrywide. The British Chambers of Commerce warned that a \u201cpremature\u201d rate hike could derail Britain\u2019s economic recovery. John Longworth, the group\u2019s director general, said: The MPC has shown composure and sound judgement in keeping rates unchanged. It would have been imprudent to push through a rate rise at this moment when our economic recovery remains in need of care and encouragement. Rates will eventually have to rise and when they do it should be done slowly and steadily. Until that moment, the Bank of England is right to keep interest rates at current levels.\u201d David Kern, the BCC\u2019s chief economist, added: Those who advocate higher interest rates, underestimate the fragility of the economic recovery, especially in the face of a highly uncertain international backdrop. The MPC will be watching increases in earnings closely. But any adverse inflationary pressures will be mitigated by the declines in oil and commodity prices and by the strength of sterling seen over recent months. Our view remains that inflation will remain below the 2% target until well into 2016. That being the case, the MPC should keep interest rates at current levels for the foreseeable future and, in doing so, it will not take any undue risks.\u201d Sterling has fallen by 0.75% to $1.5484 after the minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee meeting showed only one member (out of 9) voted for a rate rise this month. Most of the members thought that inflation will rise more slowly than previously thought, due to lower oil prices and a rise in the value of sterling in recent months. The minutes said: For most members, the outlook for inflation described in the August Inflation Report meant that it was not necessary to change the policy stance at this meeting. In light of the reduction in oil prices and appreciation of sterling over the past three months, it appeared that the increase in inflation over the following year would be more gradual than had previously been supposed.\u201d At the same time, UK economic growth is now expected to be slightly stronger than previously thought, at 0.7% in the third quarter, and 2.6% for this year as a whole, against a 2.5% forecast in May, as cheap energy costs and rising wages underpin consumer spending. James Knightley, UK economist at ING, has taken a closer look at the BOE releases. We are now waiting for the press conference from governor Mark Carney who will provide more colour on the MPC\u2019s thinking\u2026 it is due to start at 12:45 UK time The minutes showed that the Bank is concerned about the effects of sterling strength weighing on inflation, but that these were offset by rising wage pressures, which \u201csurprised significantly to the upside over the past quarter\u201d. Consequently, \u201csome members saw upside risks to the inflation forecast\u201d, citing stronger demand, less spare capacity in the economy and higher wages. For McCafferty, these risks were sufficient to justify tighter policy. We also get the Inflation Report, which shows that in the collective judgement of the Bank inflation will be fractionally above 2% in 2 and 3 years\u2019 time (2.03% and 2.14% respectively) based on market expectations for Bank Rate of 0.9% in 3Q 16 and 1.7% in 3Q18. The near term inflation profile is lower than what they had predicted three months ago, reflecting stronger sterling, but then the higher wage story leads to inflation pushing back to 2%. All in all this is perhaps a slightly more dovish combination that the market was probably anticipating. Nonetheless, it doesn\u2019t lead us to alter our view that the first rate hike is most likely to come in 1Q15. Two weeks ago Mark Carney had suggested \u201cthe decision as to when to start that process of raising interest rates will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year\u201d. November seems too early to us given that the annual rate of inflation will still be well below 1% at that time and it may create presentational difficulties for the BoE in justifying tighter monetary policy to the broader public. We also expect the political noise in Europe to become louder given the December Spanish elections and the likelihood that Greece/EU tensions will be rising after a summer lull. With headline YoY inflation likely to rise reasonably swiftly in early 2016 as the sterling/energy effects fade from the annual comparison of prices, we favour February as the start point for the tightening cycle.\u201d Peter Cameron, of EdenTree Investment Management says: Amongst today\u2019s deluge of data, perhaps the most significant piece of information \u2013 while just from one member - is the widely anticipated MPC split over rate hikes. For the first time in 2015, the committee is divided. While the dissenter remains in the minority, today\u2019s results are yet another nod that the first hike could be just around the corner, after six years of record low rates. The waters have been muddied of late - on the one hand oil prices are falling again, but countering that is stronger than expected wage growth. These conflicting inflation trends are adding an extra layer of complexity to the rates outlook, but today\u2019s vote count indicates an incrementally more hawkish stance by the Committee as we approach the end of the year.\u201d Some instant reaction from Samuel Tombs, senior UK Economist at Capital Economics, who says the triple release of rate decision, minutes and inflation report suggests a rate hike this year is still unlikely. Today\u2019s \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 releases from the UK Monetary Policy Committee suggest that an interest rate rise is still not imminent. Contrary to widespread expectations of a 7-2 split, only Ian McCafferty broke ranks and voted for a rate rise. And the Committee revised down its forecast for CPI inflation over the next twelve months and still expects it to only just return to the 2% target at the two year policy horizon. This suggests that most MPC members see the market expectations on which the forecast is based \u2013 for interest rates to start rising in spring 2016 \u2013 as broadly correct. It would not be surprising if one or two more MPC members joined Ian McCafferty in the coming months \u2013 the minutes emphasised that \u201csome members\u201d saw upside risks to the inflation forecast. But we doubt that rates will rise until the Governor changes his view \u2013 note that interest rates have never risen without the Governor voting to hike. And in his speech last month, Mark Carney stated that he wanted to see core inflation and growth in unit wage costs pick up before voting to raise rates. The recent strengthening of the pound and rebound in productivity suggest that those pick-ups are unlikely to be seen in the data for some time. So while the Governor\u2019s previous capriciousness means that a 2015 hike cannot be entirely ruled out, today\u2019s releases support our view that a majority will vote to keep interest rates on hold until the second quarter of next year.\u201d Here is a quick first take on the Bank of England\u2019s Super Thursday, from Heather Stewart on our economics desk, who is at the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street. Here are the famous fan charts which illustrate the Bank of England\u2019s latest growth and inflation forecasts. The Bank downgraded its near-term forecasts for inflation, after a renewed drop in global oil prices, which are below $50 a barrel. Sterling continues to fall and is now down 0.67% on the day, to $1.5491. Here is a link to the Bank of England\u2019s rate decision. You can find its quarterly inflation report here. City economists had expected two or even three members of the monetary policy committee to back a rate rise this month. Minutes of the meeting, which were for the first time published at the same time as the the monthly monetary policy decision, said: The near-term outlook for inflation is muted. The falls in energy prices of the past few months will continue to bear down on inflation at least until the middle of next year. The Bank now expects inflation to remain at around zero for at least the next two months, before rising to its 2% target at the end of the monetary policy committee\u2019s two-year forecast period, if interest rates are increased in line with the market\u2019s expectations. That would imply the first rate rise coming in mid-2016, with borrowing costs climbing to 1.5% by the end of 2017, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Bank of England policy makers voted 8-1 to keep interest rates unchanged. Ian McCafferty was the lone dissenter, who backed a quarter-point rate hike to take the base rate to 0.75%. This came as a surprise to financial markets. The pound dipped to $1.552, from $1.5610 just before the announcement. The triple release from the Bank of England is now just over half an hour away. On markets, Brent crude has dipped back below $50 a barrel, although it is up 0.1% on the day, amid a supply glut. New York light crude has slipped 0.5% at $44.92 a barrel. Carsten Fritsch, an oil analyst at Commerzbank, said: Prices are likely to consolidate or weaken further. The perception is that over-supply will be there for much longer.\u201d European stock markets are slightly down. Athens is the exception, up 3.2% after heavy losses in the last three days. Some banking shares have bounced back (National Bank of Greece and Attica) while others are still deep in the red (Alpha Bank, Piraeus Bank). UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.45% at 6721.85 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.1% at 1625 France\u2019s CAC down 0.15% at 5188.95 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.3% at 23842.43 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.07% at 11271.3 Returning to the Bank of England\u2019s Super Thursday, which kicks off at midday, Keith Froud, partner and markets expert at law firm Eversheds, said: Concerns around data overload every Super Thursday seem somewhat overstated. The reality is, we now live in a world of instant information. Whilst the intrigue of the MPC minutes will doubtlessly draw its usual attention, one would hope that the market is sophisticated enough to extract the relevant data and sentiment from each of the information sources.\u201d Encouragingly, Greece\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen: to 25% in May from 25.6% the previous month, marking the lowest reading since June 2012, according to statistics agency ELSTAT. Unemployment has come down from record highs of 27.9% in September 2013 as the economy stabilised last year \u2013 but is still more than double the average rate of 11.1% in the eurozone. However, Greece\u2019s economy shrank by 0.2% in the first quarter. Finally, some news on Greece: the International Monetary Fund will not decide whether to participate in a new bailout package for Greece until the autumn, Sweden\u2019s representative to the fund\u2019s executive board told a newspaper. There is \u201cstrong\u201d support at the IMF for joining the third bailout (which could total some \u20ac86bn), said Thomas \u00d6stros, a director on the fund\u2019s 24-member board \u2013 \u201cbut it will take time\u201d. He told Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter: There is going to be a discussion during the summer and autumn and then the board will make a decision during the autumn.\u201d He also noted that Greece must adopt wide-ranging reforms first. It cannot be something that is forced on them [Greece]. Greece must own the problem. The Greek government is not there yet. They have an inefficient public sector, corruption is a relatively big problem and the pension system is more expensive than other countries.\u201d House prices in the UK dipped 0.6% in July following a surprise jump of 1.6% in June, according to the Halifax. The annual rate of house price inflation retreated to 7.9% in the three months to July, the lowest since the three months to December 2014, after hitting 9.6% in the three months to June. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: The Halifax data have been notably more volatile than other house price measures in recent months and stronger overall than most. Indeed, despite July\u2019s retreat, annual house price inflation on the Halifax\u2019s measure at 7.9% in the three months to July is still more than double the Nationwide\u2019s rate of 3.5% in July. This highlights the need to not pin too much weight on one particular house price survey or measure, but to try and take an overall view from the data.\u201d Other UK data this morning showed British new car sales rose by 3.2% in July year-on-year, with small family cars and super-mini models particularly popular. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said 178,420 new vehicles were registered. The industry body forecasts that new car sales will rise nearly 4% this year from last year, hitting 2.57m thanks to a mix of cheap credit and improving confidence among consumers. However, the slower pace of growth in July compared to previous months suggests demand will level off in coming months, after a bumper first half of the year, the SMMT said. Economists at Royal Bank of Scotland have produced this interesting chart that shows all 15 OECD countries which hiked interest rates since the financial crisis in 2008 have since reversed their decisions. Britain\u2019s industrial output unexpectedly fell in June as the oil and gas and mining sectors cut back. Official figures showed industrial production dropped 0.4%, disappointing economists who had pencilled in a 0.1% rise, and following a 0.3% increase in May. Manufacturers, however, increased production by 0.2%, following a 0.6% decline in May. The Office for National Statistics said oil and gas production fell by 5.8%, the biggest monthly drop since January 2014, partly due to maintenance in a major oil field. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: June\u2019s industrial production figures highlight that the strong pound and weak overseas demand held back the manufacturing sector\u2019s recovery in the second quarter. Given that the oil price has fallen by 19% since the end of Q2, it looks unlikely that oil and gas extraction will make another punchy contribution to overall production in Q3. What\u2019s more, with the pound having risen further recently and overseas demand still weak, it is doubtful the manufacturing sector will pick up the slack. Indeed, business surveys such as this week\u2019s Markit/CIPS PMI suggest that the sector saw continued contraction at the start of Q3. Thankfully, however, the services sector is still performing strongly, so we expect the economic recovery to maintain a healthy degree of momentum over the rest of this year and forecast GDP to rise by 2.7% or so.\u201d Pfizer has come under fire from Britain\u2019s competition watchdog, which said the US company breached UK and EU competition law by ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug that is used by more than 50,000 British patients. The Competition and Markets Authority said its provisional view was that Pfizer, which makes Epanutin capsules, and Flynn Pharma, which distributes the drug, abused their dominant position by charging \u201cexcessive and unfair\u201d prices. Pfizer \u2013 which made an unsuccessful, hugely controversial takeover bid for Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca last year \u2013 said it was cooperating fully with the CMA and noted that the watchdog had not yet made a final ruling. You can read the CMA\u2019s statement in full here. The Athens stock exchange has opened higher, bringing some relief after three days of losses. Banking shares took a further tumble but are now now up, mostly. The Greek market has gained 0.9%. The banking sector index, which lost 63% in the past three days, fell a further 7.8% before recovering and is now trading 2.8% higher. The country\u2019s biggest bank, National Bank of Greece, has bounced back 14% while Attica Bank is 19% ahead. By contrast, Alpha Bank is down nearly 17% and Piraeus Bank has lost 11.6%. The pound has climbed 0.15% to $1.5628 this morning and is trading at 69.75p against the euro, close to a two-week high, amid expectations that UK interest rates will go up soon from their record low of 0.5%. The Bank of England\u2019s triple data release from midday will set out the central bank\u2019s thinking on the state of the economy. German industrial orders have come in much stronger than expected thanks to strong demand from abroad. Contracts for German goods rose 2% in June, Germany\u2019s economy ministry said, versus expectations of of a 0.2% gain. German factories received 4.8% more orders from abroad, while domestic orders fell 2%. In the insurance world, RSA boss Stephen Hester said the ball is in Zurich\u2019s court as far as its potential bid for the UK insurer is concerned. RSA, which owns the More Than brand, reported better than expected half-year results, which contrasted with the disappointing numbers released by its Swiss suitor Zurich on Thursday. Europe\u2019s third-largest insurer said last week that it was considering making a bid for RSA but is yet to put a formal offer on the table. The news sent shares in RSA up 18% to 518p, and they maintained this level until Thursday. Shares in Zurich fell nearly 4% in early trading. The Swiss company\u2019s comments that it won\u2019t overpay for RSA sent the UK insurer\u2019s shares down 1.3% to 517p. Analysts think a bid will come in at about 550p a share, valuing RSA at \u00a35.5bn. The Daily Telegraph reported that Zurich could be planning to lower its bid to about 525p a share. Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes says: Whilst we think that an offer by Zurich is likely, given comments by Zurich today that any offer would have to meet its investment hurdle rates, we believe that it would be prudent to tactically \u2018take some money off the table\u2019 in case a deal is not agreed.\u201d You can read the full story here. Another big insurance company, Aviva, which bought Friends Life in the spring, beat City forecasts with half-year profits. Chief executive Mark Wilson said the company is now in a \u201ctransforming and growing phase\u201d. The news sent the shares 1.3% higher to 534.3p, making Aviva one of the top gainers on the FTSE 100 index. We have done a Q&amp;A that helps explain why Super Thursday is important. Both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are on the cusp of raising interest rates for the first time in almost a decade, and the Fed is widely expected to go first, possibly in September. Another thing to look out for on Super Thursday are the Bank\u2019s famous fan charts on the inflation and GDP growth outlook two years out. Inflation, which has dipped to zero, has been well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target for some time. You could be forgiven for being a bit puzzled: why should rates go up when there\u2019s no inflation? The argument has been that low inflation is temporary and that is has been artificially depressed by the crash in energy and raw materials prices late last year. But it now looks as though low headline inflation could persist for some time. However, both the Fed and the Bank of England are eager to \u2018normalise\u2019 interest rates, as the economic recovery gathers steam. The Bank will point to the outlook for inflation two years out. Inflation expectations have risen among households and in financial markets and are above the 2% target further out. As usual, the tone of Carney\u2019s comments at the press conference will be just as important as the voting outcome of the policy meeting. Analysts at Capital Economics say the Bank\u2019s governor may steal the hawks\u2019 limelight on Super Thursday: Although another no-change decision is likely, we expect the minutes to reveal that at least two of the nine Committee members have begun to vote to raise rates. The minutes of July\u2019s meeting showed that a number of members thought that the risk that CPI inflation would overshoot its 2% target in the medium term was growing and suggested that only the Greek crisis was holding them back from switching their votes. Last week\u2019s news that GDP growth sped up from 0.4% in Q1 to 0.7% in Q2 is likely to have reinforced these members\u2019 concerns about the medium-term inflation outlook. We would, however, caution against placing much weight on the minutes until the governor has commented at the subsequent Inflation Report press conference at 12.45 BST. While he is just one member among nine, governors have rarely been outvoted in the past and internal members of the MPC often take their steer from him. And we think that he is likely to sound quite dovish again. In his speech last month, the Governor outlined three developments that he would like to see before raising rates \u2013 above trend GDP growth, a pick-up in core inflation and stronger growth in unit wage costs. The last two criteria have not been met yet and we doubt they will before the end of the year. The recent appreciation of sterling is likely to keep core inflation below 1% until next year. Meanwhile, wage growth has picked up, but it has still not recovered to rates that would push annual growth in unit wage costs back towards 2% since productivity growth has also risen. Accordingly, we think that markets are right to think that there is less than a 50% chance of a rate rise this year. Indeed, since CPI inflation is likely to remain below 1% until the spring, we concur with the markets that the first rate rise is not likely to come until the second quarter of next year. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at UK online broker FxPro, thinks the \u2018data dump\u2019 could lead to more volatility for the pound. Today is likely to mark the first steps towards the commencement of the interest rate tightening cycle for the Bank of England. The markets can rest assured there won\u2019t be any rate hike at this meeting and in the past we would not know how the MPC had voted for another two weeks, but going forward those minutes and voting patterns will be released along with the decision. Whilst the premise of this change to the BOE\u2019s procedures may have good intentions, it could lead to greater short term volatility both over the release and after it, before investors have enough time to absorb all the information and get a better understanding of what the BOE\u2019s thinking is. Throw into the mix the Inflation Report and sterling could see considerable volatility. This morning sterling is a little higher against the dollar at $1.5635. But today\u2019s meeting could be academic as the BOE is highly unlikely to move before the US\u2019s Federal Reserve. Whilst it will be important to see the latest two year inflation projections and decipher whether Mr Carney is edging towards a move hawkish stance, really the bigger question remains if the FOMC will move in September, November or December, with the market pricing in a higher chance of a September rate hike following hawkish comments from Fed voting member Lockhart earlier in the week.\u201d Super Thursday: Bank of England transparency or information overload? asks the Guardian\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott. Instead of the previous drip-feed of information, there is now going to be a data dump... This looks suspiciously like a super-charged version of forward guidance, the big initiative of Mark Carney when he became the Bank\u2019s governor two years ago. Forward guidance proved to be a bit of a dud, not because of the way it was communicated but because of the Bank\u2019s inability to forecast the economy accurately.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Super Thursday has arrived \u2013 the day when we get three big releases from the Bank of England that will shed light on its thinking on the state of the economy. For the first time in its 321-year history, the central bank will announce its monthly decision on interest rates, publish the minutes of its policy meeting where the decision was made, and present the quarterly inflation report at the same time. The idea is that bundling everything together will make the Bank\u2019s decision-making process more transparent and predictable, helping households and businesses to plan ahead. The Bank of England releases are due at noon, and governor Mark Carney will hold a press conference to explain the Bank\u2019s policy stance at 12.45 BST. While we aren\u2019t expecting any change to rates from the Bank today, we will get the minutes of the meeting immediately, rather than having to wait two weeks for the voting outcome and details of the discussions. Markets are expecting a shift from the 9-0 unanimity seen on the monetary policy committee since the start of this year, with at least two members (Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, who both supported higher rates last year) likely to call for a small rise in the base rate. It is possible that a third member, for example David Miles, may join the hawkish camp. This should give a further boost to the pound, which has been strengthening lately on mounting expectations of a rate hike. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, asks: Will governor Carney be as adept at managing market expectations about the potential glide path of rates, as ECB President Mario Draghi has proved to be in his tenure as head of the ECB, or will he live up to his moniker as the \u201cunreliable boyfriend?\u201d",

Real GDP expanded by 1.5 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter, and is projected to increase 1.6 percent for the full year. Fiscal adjustment has slowed, meanwhile, with a structural loosening likely this year. Employment has declined in recent quarters, after increasing sharply from early-2013 through mid-2014, and the unemployment rate was at 13.7 percent at the end of March.</p> <p>The banking system as a whole remains adequately capitalized, with decreasing reliance on Eurosystem financing, but loan performance has continued to deteriorate. Non-performing loans increased to 12.3 percent at the end of March, putting further pressure on already weak profitability as banks absorb large impairment expenses and high operating costs.</p> <p>Recent market volatility related to Greece has had limited impact on Portugal, reflecting the country\u2019s improving fundamentals in addition to the overall supportive external environment. Portugal has benefitted from favorable commodity prices, low interest rates and a weaker euro. Growth is projected to moderate over the medium term, however, as these supportive cyclical factors weaken and still high public and private debt constrain the pace of recovery.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With increased financial market volatility in the context of developments in Greece, it is crucial to ensure that investors retain confidence in the direction of economic policies. The authorities have made progress in improving the profile of public debt, but medium-term financing needs remain large, and rising bond market volatility implies significant risks around the baseline financing plan. The authorities should continue to retain a large cash buffer in order to maintain flexibility in implementing their borrowing program.</p> <p>Further fiscal adjustment is needed to further reduce vulnerabilities from high public debt, particularly given the increased risk of financial market turbulence.</p> <p>More decisive steps to improve banks\u2019 balance sheets are desirable. Weak profitability provides little cushion for banks to absorb further losses, in the context of still-rising non-performing loans. More concerted efforts are needed to reduce operating costs in order to improve financial performance and accelerate the process of balance sheet repair; banks should not rely on economic growth alone to mend their balance sheets.</p> <p>It will be essential to regain momentum on structural reforms when a newly elected government is formed. The current economic recovery and beginning of a new political cycle presents a favorable opportunity to press ahead with reforms, particularly in the areas of labor market and public sector reform. Moving forward, it is critical to ensure that product market reforms introduced in recent years are fully implemented as intended, to achieve tangible results on the ground. It will also be important to ensure that the difficult reforms that have been undertaken, such as to contain the rise in energy costs, are not reversed.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55c36d1de4b0c7b961a3d655\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-06T14:27:54.402Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK economy grew by 0.7% in three months to July - NIESR</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the three months to July, according to <a href=\"http://niesr.ac.uk/media/august-2015-gdp-estimates-gdp-growth-07-cent-3-months-ending-july-2015-12186#.VcNuIGbd79L\"><strong>the latest estimates</strong></a> from the National Institute of Economic Research.

The moment of the first hike in interest rates is getting closer, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2015/irspnote060815.pdf\">said the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney</a>, but it is also clear that this song could remain the same for some time. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/06/super-thursday-interest-rates-bank-of-england\">Only one member of the monetary policy committee, not the expected two, voted for a rate hike</a>. It is now highly unlikely that interest rates will rise this year.</p> <p>Despite Carney\u2019s many references to \u201crobust momentum\u201d in the economy, next May is viewed by financial markets as the most likely moment the Bank increases the cost of borrowing...</p> <p>The other question here is whether the slew of simultaneous-released documents \u2013 a rate decision, the supporting minutes, and a quarterly inflation report \u2013 actually improves the market\u2019s understanding. That, after all, is meant to be the point of Super Thursday \u2013 less noise, and less confusing signals. A proper judgment is impossible on day one. But one can\u2019t say on Thursday that the new era of greater transparency has aided understanding.

He said that he was speaking from a personal perspective and was not reflecting the general view of the MPC, which implies he is on the more hawkish end of the spectrum of views within the committee.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Other than that, the tone is perhaps marginally more hawkish than the triple whammy of announcement, minutes and inflation report. Lots of emphasis on the tightening labour market and the implications for wages. Carney also suggests that the strength of the pound is doing some of the work to tighten monetary conditions, but there is uncertainty as to how much this will feed through into lower CPI [inflation]. Moreover, the needs of rate hikes over the coming year reflects domestic inflation pressures and the decision to hike will, of course, be data dependent.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>To recap our view. We look for a 25bp hike in February 2016, to be followed by two more in mid-2016 leaving Bank Rate at 1.25% for end 2016. We think that wage growth will continue to edge higher as companies increasingly worry about staff retention and the central bank will respond to the threat this poses for CPI missing its target over the medium term. Nonetheless, policy tightening will be slow and gradual reflecting high debt levels and the currency implications feeding back into CPI. Brexit concerns as the vote approaches on the UK\u2019s ongoing membership of the EU and its implications for consumer and business confidence and spending will also likely lead to caution from the BoE.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/heatherstewart3/statuses/629268830351716352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Carney <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland\">@bankofengland</a>: the market&#39;s path for rates &quot;does not deliver a sustainable return of inflation to target&quot;: hawkish</p>&mdash; Heather Stewart (@heatherstewart3) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heatherstewart3/status/629268830351716352\">August 6, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-06T12:58:23.462Z\">at 1.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55c356b8e4b0572b561f1c3b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-06T12:50:03.818Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The press conference is over.

We are now waiting for the press conference from governor Mark Carney who will provide more colour on the MPC\u2019s thinking\u2026 it is due to start at 12:45 UK time</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The minutes showed that the Bank is concerned about the effects of sterling strength weighing on inflation, but that these were offset by rising wage pressures, which \u201csurprised significantly to the upside over the past quarter\u201d. Consequently, \u201csome members saw upside risks to the inflation forecast\u201d, citing stronger demand, less spare capacity in the economy and higher wages. For McCafferty, these risks were sufficient to justify tighter policy.</p> <p>We also get the Inflation Report, which shows that in the collective judgement of the Bank inflation will be fractionally above 2% in 2 and 3 years\u2019 time (2.03% and 2.14% respectively) based on market expectations for Bank Rate of 0.9% in 3Q 16 and 1.7% in 3Q18. The near term inflation profile is lower than what they had predicted three months ago, reflecting stronger sterling, but then the higher wage story leads to inflation pushing back to 2%.</p> <p>All in all this is perhaps a slightly more dovish combination that the market was probably anticipating. Nonetheless, it doesn\u2019t lead us to alter our view that the first rate hike is most likely to come in 1Q15. Two weeks ago Mark Carney had suggested \u201cthe decision as to when to start that process of raising interest rates will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year\u201d. November seems too early to us given that the annual rate of inflation will still be well below 1% at that time and it may create presentational difficulties for the BoE in justifying tighter monetary policy to the broader public. </p> <p>We also expect the political noise in Europe to become louder given the December Spanish elections and the likelihood that Greece/EU tensions will be rising after a summer lull. With headline YoY inflation likely to rise reasonably swiftly in early 2016 as the sterling/energy effects fade from the annual comparison of prices, we favour February as the start point for the tightening cycle.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63676f6017b32210ccde0c8d5a5920e9c2ef5bc4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/6/1438860523443/051408e1-1397-4627-b6bd-957725dda0ea-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ian McCafferty\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian McCafferty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55c343c3e4b0572b561f1be0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-06T11:24:41.596Z\">12.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Peter Cameron, of EdenTree Investment Management says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong> </strong>Amongst today\u2019s deluge of data, perhaps the most significant piece of information \u2013 while just from one member - is the widely anticipated MPC split over rate hikes.

These conflicting inflation trends are adding an extra layer of complexity to the rates outlook, but today\u2019s vote count indicates an incrementally more hawkish stance by the Committee as we approach the end of the year.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55c34338e4b0572b561f1bd8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-06T11:23:12.069Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some instant reaction from Samuel Tombs, senior UK Economist at Capital Economics, who says the triple release of rate decision, minutes and inflation report suggests a rate hike this year is still unlikely.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 releases from the UK Monetary Policy Committee suggest that an interest rate rise is still not imminent. Contrary to widespread expectations of a 7-2 split, only Ian McCafferty broke ranks and voted for a rate rise. And the Committee revised down its forecast for CPI inflation over the next twelve months and still expects it to only just return to the 2% target at the two year policy horizon. This suggests that most MPC members see the market expectations on which the forecast is based \u2013 for interest rates to start rising in spring 2016 \u2013 as broadly correct.</p> <p>It would not be surprising if one or two more MPC members joined Ian McCafferty in the coming months \u2013 the minutes emphasised that \u201csome members\u201d saw upside risks to the inflation forecast. But we doubt that rates will rise until the Governor changes his view \u2013 note that interest rates have never risen without the Governor voting to hike. And in his speech last month, Mark Carney stated that he wanted to see core inflation and growth in unit wage costs pick up before voting to raise rates. The recent strengthening of the pound and rebound in productivity suggest that those pick-ups are unlikely to be seen in the data for some time. So while the Governor\u2019s previous capriciousness means that a 2015 hike cannot be entirely ruled out, today\u2019s releases support our view that a majority will vote to keep interest rates on hold until the second quarter of next year.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong> <br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55c34246e4b0b17b3cd1cd8b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-06T11:18:49.242Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a quick <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/06/super-thursday-interest-rates-bank-of-england\">first take on the Bank of England\u2019s Super Thursday</a>, from Heather Stewart on our economics desk, who is at the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/heatherstewart3/statuses/629247467725434880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MPC voted 8-1 for unchanged interest rates, with Ian McCafferty the sole hawk.

Inflation, which has dipped to zero, has been well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target for some time.</p> <p>You could be forgiven for being a bit puzzled: why should rates go up when there\u2019s no inflation? The argument has been that low inflation is temporary and that is has been artificially depressed by the crash in energy and raw materials prices late last year. But it now looks as though low headline inflation could persist for some time.</p> <p>However, both the Fed and the Bank of England are eager to \u2018normalise\u2019 interest rates, as the economic recovery gathers steam.

Analysts at Capital Economics say the Bank\u2019s governor may steal the hawks\u2019 limelight on Super Thursday:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although another no-change decision is likely, we expect the minutes to reveal that at least two of the nine Committee members have begun to vote to raise rates. The minutes of July\u2019s meeting showed that a number of members thought that the risk that CPI inflation would overshoot its 2% target in the medium term was growing and suggested that only the Greek crisis was holding them back from switching their votes. Last week\u2019s news that GDP growth sped up from 0.4% in Q1 to 0.7% in Q2 is likely to have reinforced these members\u2019 concerns about the medium-term inflation outlook.</p> <p><strong>We would, however, caution against placing much weight on the minutes until the governor has commented at the subsequent Inflation Report press conference at 12.45 BST. While he is just one member among nine, governors have rarely been outvoted in the past and internal members of the MPC often take their steer from him. And we think that he is likely to sound quite dovish again.</strong></p> <p>In his speech last month, the Governor outlined three developments that he would like to see before raising rates \u2013 above trend GDP growth, a pick-up in core inflation and stronger growth in unit wage costs. The last two criteria have not been met yet and we doubt they will before the end of the year. The recent appreciation of sterling is likely to keep core inflation below 1% until next year. Meanwhile, wage growth has picked up, but it has still not recovered to rates that would push annual growth in unit wage costs back towards 2% since productivity growth has also risen.</p> <p><strong>Accordingly, we think that markets are right to think that there is less than a 50% chance of a rate rise this year.</strong> Indeed, since CPI inflation is likely to remain below 1% until the spring, we concur with the markets that the first rate rise is not likely to come until the second quarter of next year.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd4c0c36b1126e9acf2870a3515a624c655e4f62\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/6/1438845741944/24cf89ed-c4e0-4ad6-85f9-bea5dedb3f5c-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"UK borrowing costs\" width=\"372\" height=\"255\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK borrowing costs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg, Capital Economics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-06T07:22:24.890Z\">at 8.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55c30621e4b0ca97cf3d4ef2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-06T07:03:43.963Z\">8.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Angus Campbell, senior analyst at UK online broker FxPro, thinks the \u2018data dump\u2019 could lead to more volatility for the pound.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today is likely to mark the first steps towards the commencement of the interest rate tightening cycle for the Bank of England.

      "bodyText": "Fears that the Bank of England is poised to start raising interest rates have receded, after news that just one of the nine members of its policy committee voted to increase borrowing costs from their record low of 0.5% this month. City analysts pushed their forecasts for the first rate rise since 2007 into next year after the Bank revealed that Ian McCafferty, former chief economist at business group the CBI, cast the sole vote for higher rates when the monetary policy committee met on Wednesday. Andrew Goodwin, of consultancy Oxford Economics, said: \u201cThe chances of a 2015 rate rise, which in our opinion were already low, have receded further.\u201d On a day dubbed \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d, the Bank broke with tradition to publish the MPC\u2019s August rates decision, the minutes of the meeting, and its quarterly inflation report, alongside Bank governor Mark Carney\u2019s regular press conference. The new approach is aimed at ending the \u201cdrip-feed\u201d of news from Threadneedle Street. Some analysts had expected the Bank to use the flood of information to send a strong signal that the era of ultra-low borrowing costs is coming to an end. But while Carney himself struck a hawkish tone in his remarks, the Inflation Report downgraded the MPC\u2019s near-term forecasts for inflation, after a renewed drop in global oil prices, and warned of signs that a business hiring spree is fading. \u201cThe near-term outlook for inflation is muted. The falls in energy prices of the past few months will continue to bear down on inflation at least until the middle of next year,\u201d the MPC said in the minutes of its rate-setting meeting. The Bank now expects inflation to remain at around zero for at least the next two months, before rising to its 2% target at the end of the monetary policy committee\u2019s two-year forecast period. While a rate rise appears more distant, Jane Tully, of the Money Advice Trust, the charity which runs National Debtline, warned mortgage-holders to start preparing themselves. \u201cSigns that interest rates will not rise until next spring give borrowers a little more time \u2013 but we should not take false comfort from this news. There remains only a relatively short window for households to prepare for the impact that higher interest rates will have on their finances,\u201d she said. Economic growth is expected to be slightly stronger than previously thought, at 0.7% in the third quarter, and 2.6% for this year as a whole, against a 2.5% forecast in May, as cheap energy costs and rising wages support consumer demand. Carney also stressed that the strong pound in recent months, which tends to bear down on inflation by making imports cheaper, has done some of the MPC\u2019s work for it. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the persistent strength of sterling is having an influence on policy,\u201d the governor said. Howard Archer, an analyst at consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cIt does appear that the recent falling back in oil prices and sterling\u2019s strength has markedly reduced the MPC\u2019s perceived need to tighten monetary policy in the near term.\u201d. The MPC appeared to have become more confident about the outlook for productivity, which has remained a bugbear of Britain\u2019s post-crisis recovery. \u201cPrivate domestic demand growth in the United Kingdom is expected to remain robust. Household spending has been supported by the boost to real incomes from lower food and energy prices. Wage growth has picked up as the labour market has tightened and productivity has strengthened,\u201d it said. Nevertheless, a series of factors, including a slowdown in the labour market, persuaded eight of its nine members to stay their hand. McCafferty was joined by fellow external MPC member Martin Weale in voting for a rate rise throughout the second half of 2014, before they withdrew their support for tighter policy in January as inflation plunged. In the quarterly Inflation Report, the Bank suggested that the rapid growth in jobs \u2013 which was one of the proudest boasts of the chancellor, George Osborne, during the recent general election campaign \u2013 appeared to be petering out. \u201cThe pace at which unemployment can fall further is likely to be somewhat slower than in the past few years and Bank staff expect unemployment to change little in the next few months,\u201d the report said. However, Carney played down fears that the recovery is unsustainable, because it is too dependent on consumer spending. He pointed to strong recent growth in business investment, and stressed: \u201cThis is not a debt-fuelled consumer recovery \u2026 households are consuming out of income.\u201d Separate news on Thursday, that industrial production expanded at a relatively robust pace of 0.7% in the second quarter of the year, supported the MPC\u2019s relatively upbeat outlook for growth, although manufacturing output declined by 0.3%, underlining the impact of the strong pound on exporters. Lee Hopley, economist at manufacturers\u2019 body EEF, said: \u201cWhile parts of manufacturing at least are still on the march, an improved outlook in export markets and oil and gas investment is need to turn a modest growth outlook into something more significant.\u201d Interest rates have now remained at 0.5% for more than six years, after being slashed at the height of the global financial crisis to contain the recession. In a recent speech, Carney suggested the decision to raise rates could come \u201caround the turn of the year\u201d; but he stressed on Thursday that this was a personal view, not the collective opinion of the MPC.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Quindell, the troubled insurance claims handler, have fallen 28% on their first day of trading since they were suspended in June. The shares fell as much as 40% in early trading and closed down by more than a quarter, leaving the company valued at just under \u00a3400m. Quindell, which was briefly viewed as a star stock, was valued at \u00a32.9bn in February 2014 before Gotham City Research, a US hedge fund, published a report attacking its business model. Quindell suspended its shares on 24 June when it announced an investigation into its past acquisitions. The scandal enveloping the company intensified on Wednesday when the Serious Fraud Office announced a criminal investigation into its accounts. The Financial Conduct Authority is also investigating Quindell, and the accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, is looking into the conduct of two of Quindell\u2019s past auditors, KPMG and RSM Tenon, now part of Baker Tilly. Quindell\u2019s annual results, delayed from the end of June, revealed on Wednesday that the company had suffered a \u00a3238m pretax loss last year as costs, including \u00a3157m of impaired assets, jumped to \u00a3278m from \u00a344m a year earlier. Quindell, originally a golf club in Hampshire, used acquisitions of technology businesses to present itself as a company that would revolutionise insurance claims handling. As investors sought out the next big technology business success story last year, Quindell\u2019s shares surged. But the company\u2019s fortunes never recovered after Gotham City Research, an aggressive US hedge fund that bets against companies\u2019 shares, issued a scathing report that said Quindell was a \u201ccountry club built on quicksand\u201d. Quindell sold its main claims handling division for \u00a3637m in March to Slater and Gordon, a law firm listed on the Australian stock exchange. The deal left Quindell with an array of technology businesses bought during its rapid expansion. Slater and Gordon\u2019s shares have also been affected by the chaos at Quindell, losing more than half of their value since early April. Slater and Gordon said it had conducted its own examination of Quindell\u2019s books before agreeing the deal and had not relied on the company\u2019s own accounting. The law firm said it believed it had no liability for the various investigations into Quindell. \u201cIt is critical to separate issues associated with Quindell\u2019s historical statutory accounts from Slater and Gordon\u2019s assessment of the professional service division\u2019s value and go-forward performance,\u201d the firm said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.",

      "bodyText": "Adidas has put its golf division, which includes the world\u2019s biggest golf brand, TaylorMade, up for sale as the popularity of the sport wanes. The German sportswear company has instructed an unnamed investment bank to explore options for the business, and announced on Thursday that golf sales fell 26% in the second quarter. The decline of the game has been particularly marked in the US, Adidas\u2019s biggest market. Although America has 45% of the world\u2019s golf courses, the number has fallen in recent years from 16,000 to 15,300 in what the National Golf Foundation describes as a \u201cgradual, but steady, market correction\u201d. A turnaround plan attempted to improve its golf pricing and promotions and make big cost savings, particularly in the TaylorMade brand, which it bought in 1997 along with Salomon. The company also bought the Ashworth golf brand for $72.8m (\u00a347m) in 2008 and Adams for $70m in 2012. Adidas tried restructuring the golf business last year and brought in a new chief executive, David Abeles, for the unit in March. Zuzanna Pusz, an analyst at Berenberg, said Adidas was trying to offload the part of its golf business that made clubs, where sales are falling, while retaining footwear and apparel. However, it was not clear whether the company would be able to find a buyer given the poor growth prospects for the hardware business, she said. Despite the German company\u2019s woes on the fairway, overall sales rose by 5% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter as the Adidas and Reebok brands continued to prove popular with consumers globally. Excluding the impact of currency movements, sales were up 15% to \u20ac3.9bn compared with the same period in 2014 \u2013 \u20ac100m better than expectations. For the half year, group sales rose 7%. Herbert Hainer, the Adidas chief executive, said: \u201cI am pleased to see how well Adidas and Reebok are resonating with their respective consumers. We are very confident that the robust momentum of our core brands Adidas and Reebok will continue throughout the second half of the year.\u201d In currency-neutral terms, second-quarter sales in North America were flat, while jumping 19% in greater China and plunging 14% in Russia. Pusz said the momentum at Adidas was continuing but it was spending a considerable amount to achieve it. The company spent 14% of revenue on marketing in the second quarter, she said, compared with an average of between 10% and 11% for competitors such as Nike and Under Armour. Adidas has also benefited from the weak euro this year, Pusz said. Its sourcing costs, which are denominated in US dollars, are still hedged at last year\u2019s exchange rates, when the euro was stronger. Net profit for the second quarter rose 1% to \u20ac146m, just short of expectations. Gross margin fell 0.9 percentage points to 48.3% in the quarter, mainly due to lower margins in the golf business.

      "bodyText": "\u201cSuper Thursday\u201d didn\u2019t quite live up to the grand billing. The moment of the first hike in interest rates is getting closer, said the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, but it is also clear that this song could remain the same for some time. Only one member of the monetary policy committee, not the expected two, voted for a rate hike. It is now highly unlikely that interest rates will rise this year. Despite Carney\u2019s many references to \u201crobust momentum\u201d in the economy, next May is viewed by financial markets as the most likely moment the Bank increases the cost of borrowing. The mildly dovish message was echoed in the currency markets: the pound fell 0.75%. Three factors explain the still-strong vote for unchanged rates at Threadneedle Street. First, the Bank can be less robustly confident that 0% inflation is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear quickly. Commodity prices are still falling and energy suppliers\u2019 price cuts will still be feeding into the data until the middle of next year. The MPC expects inflation to remain close to zero for at least the next few months. It\u2019s the job of the MPC to look beyond \u201cone-off\u201d effects in the inflation data and identify underlying trends but the key line in the minutes was this: \u201cIt appeared that the increase in inflation over the following year would be more gradual than had previously been supposed.\u201d Second, the pound is 3.5% stronger than it was in May, applying a slight brake on the economy, at least the part targeted at exports. Carney argued that growth in the private sector is strong and that there\u2019s a need to increase interest rates \u201cat some point\u201d, but he also conceded: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the strength of sterling is having an effect on policy.\u201d The third factor is trickiest for the Bank: the mixed message in the labour market. On one hand, wages are finally growing reasonably strongly \u2013 weekly earnings were 3.2% higher than a year earlier, according to the latest statistics. Yet employment fell by around 67,000 in the three months to May, defying expectations and supporting the case of doves who argue that the recovery remains fundamentally fragile. The Bank\u2019s official view is that the last employment figures were probably a blip in an encouraging three-year trend. It still regards the labour market as tightening, as seen in the slight pick-up in productivity. The data is always volatile, said Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor. Yet another weak jobs report would put the cat among the pigeons. It\u2019s another reason to wait and see, especially as the Bank spectacularly failed to predict the sharp improvement in employment from mid-2013. The other question here is whether the slew of simultaneous-released documents \u2013 a rate decision, the supporting minutes, and a quarterly inflation report \u2013 actually improves the market\u2019s understanding. That, after all, is meant to be the point of Super Thursday \u2013 less noise, and less confusing signals. A proper judgment is impossible on day one. But one can\u2019t say on Thursday that the new era of greater transparency has aided understanding. We still have a Bank governor who sounds increasingly hawkish on rates \u2013 but lacks a cast-iron case for moving soon. The timing of the decision on when to move rates will move into \u201csharper relief\u201d around the turn of the year, Carney repeated on Thursday. Well, it might. But it\u2019s also possible that the real world \u2013 a blow-up in Greece, a steeper slowdown in China or more wobbly unemployment data \u2013 intervenes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The RSA boss, Stephen Hester, said the ball was in Zurich\u2019s court over any potential bid for the UK insurer as he reported better-than-expected half-year results. But shares in RSA dropped as Zurich warned it would not overpay. With Zurich considering whether to make a formal offer which could value RSA at \u00a35.5bn, Hester said: \u201cThe prospects for RSA as an independent company are strong but we will be professional in examining in other alternatives should they occur.\u201d Hester, who took the helm 18 months ago in the midst of accounting irregularities at RSA\u2019s Irish arm, said his was \u201ca company that is getting more valuable\u201d and it was up to the Swiss rival to make its intentions clear. Zurich has until 25 August to table a bid for RSA and Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at brokers Shore Capital, said the \u201cgloves have come off and the bidding process can start in earnest\u201d. Flanagan listed the major continental European insurers Allianz and Generali as potential bidders. Zurich\u2019s interest was flushed out last week, bolstering RSA\u2019s share price amid expectations that it could table 550p a share. However, Zurich\u2019s boss, Martin Senn, expressed caution about the value of any offer. \u201cAny capital deployment would need to meet the same hurdles that we apply to any other investment,\u201d Senn said, as Zurich disappointed investors with its half-year results. However, RSA could \u201cbring significant benefits to us and to our investors\u201d, Senn said. RSA\u2019s shares jumped almost 20% to518p on hopes of the bid approach, although they dipped 2.6% to 510p on Thursday afternoon. The Telegraph reported that Zurich could be planning to lower its bid to about 525p a share, although Zurich would not comment on any potential price. The stockbroking firm Panmure Gordon said: \u201cWhilst we think that an offer by Zurich is likely, given comments by Zurich today that any offer would have to meet its investment hurdle rates, we believe that it would be prudent to tactically \u2018take some money off the table\u2019 in case a deal is not agreed.\u201d RSA\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 a measure of payouts compared with premiums \u2013 came in at 96.9%, better than the 100.3% recorded for the same period last year. Pre-tax profits in the first six months of the year were \u00a3288m, much higher than the \u00a369m for the same period last year and better than the \u00a3235m expected by analysts. Hester said they were \u201cexcellent results\u201d and that RSA had moved from the bottom to the middle of the class, although there was still room for improvement. \u201cThe dunce\u2019s cap can be passed to someone else,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel we are back in respectable territory with our financial results.\u201d The RSA boss pointed to the combined ratio of 93.1% posted on Thursday by rival Aviva as the direction in which he wanted the company to travel. Hester said RSA was running ahead of schedule with its drive to cut costs by \u00a3250m by 2017. Results had also been aided by better weather in the UK compared with 2014. The UK accounted for \u00a3144m of the \u00a3259m group operating profit, which was up by \u00a3118m, or 84%, on the back of sharply higher underwriting profits and stable investment income. Profits for Canada were \u00a392m and \u00a355m in Scandinavia. RSA reinstated the interim dividend at 3.5p. Hester joined RSA in February 2014, six months after leaving Royal Bank of Scotland abruptly as the bailed-out bank geared up for privatisation. The first sale of the government\u2019s 79% stake took place this week, reducing the stake to below 73% but securing a \u00a31bn loss on the shares sold. Hester said he was thrilled for his former colleagues. \u201cIn a sense we had started this some years ago but I\u2019m also realistic that the obstacle was a political one and it needed a change in the political strength of the government to take the step of selling below the in price,\u201d he said. RBS would fare better with less government involvement, he said. Zurich reported a second-quarter business operating profit of $943m (\u00a3604m), which analysts at Citi said was 18% lower than estimated. Citi said a worse-than-expected general insurance result was not helped by higher than usual large and attritional losses in the UK and other markets. \u201cThese are clearly disappointing results. However, for us the key driver remains the potential RSA bid and the possible synergies this may entail,\u201d Citi said.",

However, Zurich\u2019s boss, Martin Senn, expressed caution about the value of any offer. \u201cAny capital deployment would need to meet the same hurdles that we apply to any other investment,\u201d Senn said, as Zurich disappointed investors with its half-year results.</p> <p>However, RSA could \u201cbring significant benefits to us and to our investors\u201d, Senn said.</p> <p>RSA\u2019s shares jumped almost 20% to518p on hopes of the bid approach, although they dipped 2.6% to 510p on Thursday afternoon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/insurance/11785771/Zurich-homes-in-on-lower-price-for-possible-RSA-bid.html\">The Telegraph reported</a> that Zurich could be planning to lower its bid to about 525p a share, although Zurich would not comment on any potential price.<br></p> <p>The stockbroking firm Panmure Gordon said: \u201cWhilst we think that an offer by Zurich is likely, given comments by Zurich today that any offer would have to meet its investment hurdle rates, we believe that it would be prudent to tactically \u2018take some money off the table\u2019 in case a deal is not agreed.\u201d </p> <p>RSA\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 a measure of payouts compared with premiums \u2013 came in at 96.9%, better than the 100.3% recorded for the same period last year.<br></p> <p>Pre-tax profits in the first six months of the year were \u00a3288m, much higher than the \u00a369m for the same period last year and better than the \u00a3235m expected by analysts.<br></p> <p>Hester said they were \u201cexcellent results\u201d and that RSA had moved from the bottom to the middle of the class, although there was still room for improvement. </p> <p>\u201cThe dunce\u2019s cap can be passed to someone else,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel we are back in respectable territory with our financial results.\u201d</p> <p>The RSA boss pointed to the combined ratio of 93.1% posted on Thursday by rival Aviva as the direction in which he wanted the company to travel. </p> <p>Hester said RSA was running ahead of schedule with its drive to cut costs by \u00a3250m by 2017. Results had also been aided by better weather in the UK compared with 2014.</p> <p>The UK accounted for \u00a3144m of the \u00a3259m group operating profit, which was up by \u00a3118m, or 84%, on the back of sharply higher underwriting profits and stable investment income. Profits for Canada were \u00a392m and \u00a355m in Scandinavia. RSA reinstated the interim dividend at 3.5p.</p> <p>Hester <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/04/stephen-hester-rsa-insurance-ceo-rbs\">joined RSA</a> in February 2014, six months after leaving Royal Bank of Scotland abruptly as the bailed-out bank geared up for privatisation. The first sale of the government\u2019s 79% stake took place this week, reducing the stake to below 73% but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/rbs-sell-off-george-osborne-defends-1bn-loss\">securing a \u00a31bn loss on the shares sold</a>. </p> <p>Hester said he was thrilled for his former colleagues. \u201cIn a sense we had started this some years ago but I\u2019m also realistic that the obstacle was a political one and it needed a change in the political strength of the government to take the step of selling below the in price,\u201d he said. RBS would fare better with less government involvement, he said.</p> <p>Zurich reported a second-quarter business operating profit of $943m (\u00a3604m), which analysts at Citi said was 18% lower than estimated. Citi said a worse-than-expected general insurance result was not helped by higher than usual large and attritional losses in the UK and other markets.</p> <p>\u201cThese are clearly disappointing results. However, for us the key driver remains the potential RSA bid and the possible synergies this may entail,\u201d Citi said.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Productivity Commission\u2019s draft report on workplace relations is a weird document that seems at odds with itself. It suggests things are going well and then tries to find reasons to justify making changes. The report is not really a savage attack on workers\u2019 rights, but it certainly has the potential to be the starting point for such an attack. Perhaps its best short review was by Scott Steel, an economist for Queensland\u2019s public sector union, who said it showed the \u201cnaivety of the technocrat\u201d. Rather humorously, the Productivity Commission acknowledges that it\u2019s incongruous for a commission focused on productivity to examine workplace relations. It notes that \u201cthere is little robust evidence that the different variants of WR systems over the last 20 years have had detectable effects on measured economy-wide productivity\u201d. This certainly is the case. You only need to look at the average productivity growth under WorkChoices, the Fair Work Act and the pre-WorkChoices systems: Annual productivity growth under WorkChoices was a mere 0.76%, well below the 1.73% average growth achieved under the Fair Work Act (FWA), or in the similar period before the introduction of WorkChoices. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean WorkChoices was a dud. You could easily argue productivity growth needs a longer-term period than WorkChoices had, or that perhaps growth was declining and WorkChoices turned it around and the FWA reaped the benefits. Either way, you\u2019re hard pressed to find any evidence that the great levels of \u201cflexibility\u201d under WorkChoices provided any great benefit to Australia\u2019s productivity. At this point the Productivity Commission could have ended its report, noting that workplace relations is really a political fight in which sides battle over who gets the lion\u2019s share of income, and that arguing for changes to the current system on the basis of economic evidence is pretty difficult. Instead the report argues that the lack of any link between workplace relations and productivity \u201cdoes not mean there are no effects\u201d but just that they can\u2019t prove them because of \u201cthe myriad of other factors shaping productivity\u201d. That kind of reasoning underpins a fair bit of the report. For example, it notes at the outset that \u201ccontrary to perceptions, Australia\u2019s labour market performance and flexibility is relatively good by global standards, and many of the concerns that pervaded historical arrangements have now abated\u201d. It then lists off the relevant \u201cconcerns\u201d: \u201cstrike activity is low, wages are responsive to economic downturns and there are multiple forms of employment arrangements that offer employees and employers flexible options for working\u201d. It cites, for example, the drop in hours worked rather than actual employment during downturns as evidence that the labour market has become more flexible: But then almost like a consultant brought into review a workplace, it begins making recommendations that smack of self-justification. Not all of them are logically coherent, either. For example, when looking at removing Sunday penalty rates for those in the retail and hospitality industries it argues that \u201cweekend work is now common ... More than one in three in the workforce work at least a Saturday or Sunday each week.\u201d This is true: Nevertheless, the level of people working at least one day at the weekend hasn\u2019t shifted at all in the past 15 years. It is actually not more common now. And yet when the report refers to casual labour, it downplays the issue by suggesting that \u201csecurity of work appears to have changed relatively little in recent years. While the proportion of casual jobs increased throughout the 1990s, this trend tapered off during the 2000s, particularly for women.\u201d Certainly this is true, to an extent. For prime-aged workers aged 25 to 54, the incidence of casual work hasn\u2019t increased since the turn of the century, but for younger workers it certainly has: Thus the report ignores the lack of change in Sunday work while highlighting the lack of change in casual work. It is when it begins to make recommendations about penalty rates and industrial disputes that the confusing logic \u2013 and lack of understanding about real-world interactions between employers and employees \u2013 enters the fray. For example, when it discusses individual contracts, the report notes that \u201cstatutory individual arrangements have also been used to reduce union influence over the setting of employment terms and conditions, or to de-unionise the workforce\u201d. It further referred to surveys that found that \u201csome employers saw individual contracts as an important device for reducing union influence\u201d. And yet it then argues that non-enterprise agreements \u201care unlikely to significantly reduce collective bargaining power\u201d, and that as a result it should be illegal for agreements to include anything that \u201chave the effect of limiting the hiring of subcontractors, labour hire workers or casuals\u201d. It also gives little real reasoning for why it recommends making Sunday penalty rates equal to Saturday rates for workers only in the hospitality, entertainment, retail, restaurants and cafe industries. It does rather bizarrely suggest that employers in such industries are \u201cnot likely to have the same level of bargaining power over their employees as in many other industries\u201d. This must be great news to all the wait-staff in restaurants to know that they hold the whip hand in negotiations better than workers in other (more highly unionised) industries! There is also little explanation of how lowering penalty rates (or wages) will improve productivity, which is the amount of work done per hour, not per dollar. Cheaper labour is actually unlikely to be more productive. It may, however, be more profitable. But this report was not written by the \u201cprofit commission\u201d. The report also argues that \u201cindustrial disputes do not appear to be a major problem in Australia\u2019s workplace relations framework\u201d. This is also true \u2013 days lost to strikes are down at near-record lows: And yet the report then suggests that the data misses certain types of industrial action. This is also the case \u2013 and has been acknowledged by the Bureau of Statistics \u2013 but the commission makes no argument that these missed actions are higher than they were in the past. It then suggests that \u201cthere is insufficient evidence for sweeping changes\u201d but also recommends changing the law, such that industrial disputes could be halted where \u201csignificant economic harm to the employer or the employees who will be covered by the agreement, rather than both parties (as is currently the case)\u201d. Doing as such would make the threshold for stopping industrial disputes much lower. Confusion also reigns with regards to unfair dismissal claims. It found that, contrary to claims by employer groups that unfair dismissal laws dissuade employers from hiring people for fear of not being able to fire them, the laws are actually \u201cnot playing a major role in hiring and firing decisions\u201d. And yet the report recommends the law be changed to \u201cremove the emphasis on reinstatement as the primary goal of the unfair dismissal provisions\u201d. In effect, the commission asserts that when a person is unfairly dismissed a fine or penalty would be enough to compensate them for being sacked. Such a situation would certainly be beneficial for any employer wishing to get rid of someone agitating for higher pay or better safety conditions. Perhaps the most confused part of the report regards flexibility and the commission\u2019s proposed \u201centerprise contract\u201d. These individual contracts would operate outside the award framework, would not have to satisfy the \u201cbetter off overall test\u201d but rather just a \u201cno disadvantage test\u201d, and would \u201cavoid the costs\u201d of enterprise bargaining for small employers by \u201cnot requiring negotiation with each party to the contract, either individually or as a group\u201d. The contract would be a take-it-or-leave-it offer, with no requirement for it to be reviewed by unions or the Fair Work commission. And while employees would have \u201cthe right to revert to the award\u201d they could only do so after 12 months. What\u2019s more, as the AFR reports, \u201cemployees would not be back paid if they were found to have not been paid their proper entitlements\u201d. Gee, and you wonder why business groups like the idea! Flexibility, it seems, is only good when the employer has it. Who knows, perhaps these measures will prompt a cafe-led economy boom for Australians. But it\u2019s clear what the commission in the end is recommending is that this occur through lower wages and less job security, and certainly not through greater productivity.",

It suggests things are going well and then tries to find reasons to justify making changes. </p> <p>The report is not really a savage attack on workers\u2019 rights, but it certainly has the potential to be the starting point for such an attack. Perhaps its best short review was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pollytics/status/628394454555197440\">by Scott Steel</a>, an economist for Queensland\u2019s public sector union, who said it showed the \u201cnaivety of the technocrat\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/04/workers-sunday-penalty-rates-should-be-cut-says-productivity-commission\">Workers' Sunday penalty rates should be cut, says Productivity Commission</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rather humorously, the Productivity Commission acknowledges that it\u2019s incongruous for a commission focused on productivity to examine workplace relations. </p> <p>It notes that \u201cthere is little robust evidence that the different variants of WR systems over the last 20 years have had detectable effects on measured economy-wide productivity\u201d.</p> <p>This certainly is the case. You only need to look at the average productivity growth under WorkChoices, the Fair Work Act and the pre-WorkChoices systems:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0P0nt/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Annual productivity growth under WorkChoices was a mere 0.76%, well below the 1.73% average growth achieved under the Fair Work Act (FWA), or in the similar period before the introduction of WorkChoices. </p> <p>That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean WorkChoices was a dud. You could easily argue productivity growth needs a longer-term period than WorkChoices had, or that perhaps growth was declining and WorkChoices turned it around and the FWA reaped the benefits.</p> <p> Either way, you\u2019re hard pressed to find any evidence that the great levels of \u201cflexibility\u201d under WorkChoices provided any great benefit to Australia\u2019s productivity.</p> <p>At this point the Productivity Commission could have ended its report, noting that workplace relations is really a political fight in which sides battle over who gets the lion\u2019s share of income, and that arguing for changes to the current system on the basis of economic evidence is pretty difficult. </p> <p>Instead the report argues that the lack of any link between workplace relations and productivity \u201cdoes not mean there are no effects\u201d but just that they can\u2019t prove them because of \u201cthe myriad of other factors shaping productivity\u201d.</p> <p>That kind of reasoning underpins a fair bit of the report. </p> <p>For example, it notes at the outset that \u201ccontrary to perceptions, Australia\u2019s labour market performance and flexibility is relatively good by global standards, and many of the concerns that pervaded historical arrangements have now abated\u201d. </p> <p>It then lists off the relevant \u201cconcerns\u201d: \u201cstrike activity is low, wages are responsive to economic downturns and there are multiple forms of employment arrangements that offer employees and employers flexible options for working\u201d. </p> <p>It cites, for example, the drop in hours worked rather than actual employment during downturns as evidence that the labour market has become more flexible:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7NPIu/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But then almost like a consultant brought into review a workplace, it begins making recommendations that smack of self-justification. Not all of them are logically coherent, either.</p> <p>For example, when looking at removing Sunday penalty rates for those in the retail and hospitality industries it argues that \u201cweekend work is now common ... More than one in three in the workforce work at least a Saturday or Sunday each week.\u201d </p> <p>This is true:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Txpbz/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, the level of people working at least one day at the weekend hasn\u2019t shifted at all in the past 15 years. It is actually not more common now. </p> <p>And yet when the report refers to casual labour, it downplays the issue by suggesting that \u201csecurity of work appears to have changed relatively little in recent years. While the proportion of casual jobs increased throughout the 1990s, this trend tapered off during the 2000s, particularly for women.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly this is true, to an extent. For prime-aged workers aged 25 to 54, the incidence of casual work hasn\u2019t increased since the turn of the century, but for younger workers it certainly has:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HSuOv/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Thus the report ignores the lack of change in Sunday work while highlighting the lack of change in casual work.</p> <p>It is when it begins to make recommendations about penalty rates and industrial disputes that the confusing logic \u2013 and lack of understanding about real-world interactions between employers and employees \u2013 enters the fray. </p> <p>For example, when it discusses individual contracts, the report notes that \u201cstatutory individual arrangements have also been used to reduce union influence over the setting of employment terms and conditions, or to de-unionise the workforce\u201d. It further referred to surveys that found that \u201csome employers saw individual contracts as an important device for reducing union influence\u201d.</p> <p>And yet it then argues that non-enterprise agreements \u201care unlikely to significantly reduce collective bargaining power\u201d, and that as a result it should be illegal for agreements to include anything that \u201chave the effect of limiting the hiring of subcontractors, labour hire workers or casuals\u201d. </p> <p>It also gives little real reasoning for why it recommends making Sunday penalty rates equal to Saturday rates for workers only in the hospitality, entertainment, retail, restaurants and cafe industries. </p> <p>It does rather bizarrely suggest that employers in such industries are \u201cnot likely to have the same level of bargaining power over their employees as in many other industries\u201d. </p> <p>This must be great news to all the wait-staff in restaurants to know that they hold the whip hand in negotiations better than workers in other (more highly unionised) industries!</p> <p>There is also little explanation of how lowering penalty rates (or wages) will improve productivity, which is the amount of work done per hour, not per dollar. </p> <p>Cheaper labour is actually unlikely to be more productive. It may, however, be more profitable. But this report was not written by the \u201cprofit commission\u201d.</p> <p>The report also argues that \u201cindustrial disputes do not appear to be a major problem in Australia\u2019s workplace relations framework\u201d. This is also true \u2013 days lost to strikes are down at near-record lows:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/inFFf/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And yet the report then suggests that the data misses certain types of industrial action. This is also the case \u2013 and has been acknowledged by the Bureau of Statistics \u2013 but the commission makes no argument that these missed actions are higher than they were in the past. </p> <p>It then suggests that \u201cthere is insufficient evidence for sweeping changes\u201d but also recommends changing the law, such that industrial disputes could be halted where \u201csignificant economic harm to the employer or the employees who will be covered by the agreement, rather than both parties (as is currently the case)\u201d. Doing as such would make the threshold for stopping industrial disputes much lower.</p> <p>Confusion also reigns with regards to unfair dismissal claims. It found that, contrary to claims by employer groups that unfair dismissal laws dissuade employers from hiring people for fear of not being able to fire them, the laws are actually \u201cnot playing a major role in hiring and firing decisions\u201d. </p> <p>And yet the report recommends the law be changed to \u201cremove the emphasis on reinstatement as the primary goal of the unfair dismissal provisions\u201d. </p> <p>In effect, the commission asserts that when a person is unfairly dismissed a fine or penalty would be enough to compensate them for being sacked. Such a situation would certainly be beneficial for any employer wishing to get rid of someone agitating for higher pay or better safety conditions. </p> <p>Perhaps the most confused part of the report regards flexibility and the commission\u2019s proposed \u201centerprise contract\u201d. </p> <p>These individual contracts would operate outside the award framework, would not have to satisfy the \u201cbetter off overall test\u201d but rather just a \u201cno disadvantage test\u201d, and would \u201cavoid the costs\u201d of enterprise bargaining for small employers by \u201cnot requiring negotiation with each party to the contract, either individually or as a group\u201d. </p> <p>The contract would be a take-it-or-leave-it offer, with no requirement for it to be reviewed by unions or the Fair Work commission. And while employees would have \u201cthe right to revert to the award\u201d they could only do so after 12 months. What\u2019s more, as <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/industrial-relations/business-pleased-with-workplace-blueprint-but-pm-wary-20150804-gir5io\">the AFR</a> reports, \u201cemployees would not be back paid if they were found to have not been paid their proper entitlements\u201d.</p> <p>Gee, and you wonder why business groups like the idea!

      "bodyText": "What is Super Thursday? Thursday is the day the Bank of England will announce three major pieces of information: its decision on interest rates; the minutes of the monetary policy committee\u2019s meeting at which that decision was reached; and the quarterly inflation report, its latest view on the state of the UK economy. All this will be announced at noon, and at 12.45pm Bank of England governor Mark Carney will hold a press conference to explain the decisions and outline the Bank\u2019s view on the inflation and economy. Why is this day different from the past? Previously, all three announcements were spread over two weeks. The minutes, for example, have traditionally been published a fortnight after the rate-setting committee\u2019s meeting. The Bank of England is the only one of the world\u2019s 10 leading central banks that still publishes its rate decision without any accompanying explanation. Why is the Bank doing this? Carney wants to make the bank\u2019s decision-making process more transparent. When he first took office two years ago, he tried to achieve this with his \u201cforward guidance\u201d policy. However, the bank\u2019s forecasts proved so unreliable, and Carney was forced to spend so much timing explaining himself, that forward guidance was quietly abandoned. Eventually, 28 separate monetary announcements from the Bank will be shoehorned into eight announcements over the course of the year. What does the City make of all this? The City is in a state of high excitement \u2013 the timing of the first rise in interest rates for eight years will have an impact on sterling and foreign exchange dealers will be glued to their screens at midday when the information is released.

    "webTitle": "Penalty rates: Tony Abbott backs hospitality employers' push for cuts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott has given qualified support to employers seeking to cut weekend penalty rates in some industries, and accused the former government of trying \u201cto restore the church Sunday by closing the shops on Sunday\u201d. The prime minister played down the prospects of the government taking active steps to reduce penalty rates, but said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d for employers to put their case to the Fair Work Commission (FWC) and for the independent umpire to consider the need to boost employment. His comments followed the release of a draft report by the Productivity Commission that recommended reducing Sunday penalty rates to Saturday levels in the hospitality, entertainment, retail, restaurant and cafe industries. \u201cI certainly think there are some industries that are doing it very tough because of the changes that the former government made to bring back with a vengeance penalty rates on Sundays and public holidays,\u201d Abbott told Radio 3AW on Thursday. \u201cThere are parts of our country where it\u2019s very hard to find anything open on a Sunday now. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the former government wanted to restore the church Sunday by closing the shops on Sunday. I think there is a case for looking again at this issue but I stress this: as far as this government is concerned these are matters for the Fair Work Commission. \u201cIf people want to bring applications to the Fair Work Commission along the lines that it would help boost employment, help create a more dynamic economy if penalty rates were looked at again in this sector or that sector, fair enough, let them do that, but these things should be considered by the Fair Work Commission.\u201d The former Labor government\u2019s Fair Work Act 2009 requires the FWC to review modern awards every four years. Various employer groups have been pushing for changes to penalty rates and the FWC is reviewing the issue in the context of retail and hospitality industry awards. Abbott said the government wanted to \u201cmaximise jobs and maximise economic activity and plainly if a business is closed on Sunday there are no jobs and if a town is shut down on Sunday there is no economic activity there\u201d. \u201cWe are very happy for people to go before the Fair Work Commission and put in a submission and let\u2019s hope the Fair Work Commission is alert to the need to maximise employment and maximise economic activity,\u201d he said. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), Dave Oliver, said Abbott was \u201ctargeting those who can least afford it with another unfair cut\u201d. \u201cThere is no evidence to show cutting penalty rates improves employment or productivity \u2013 it\u2019s a line trotted out by employers to cut wages and the prime minister has sold out millions of hardworking Australians by supporting this myth,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cLooking after business lobby groups is more important to the Abbott government than the lives of millions of hardworking Australians who keep the country running.\u201d Labor\u2019s workplace relations spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said Abbott was trying \u201cto influence and prejudice the decision-making of the independent umpire\u201d to cut low-paid workers\u2019 wages. \u201cLabor believes that these matters should be subject to consideration by the Fair Work Commission where empirical evidence is submitted and the commission makes a decision after hearing all relevant parties\u2019 views,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. Business groups have been lobbying the government to make major changes to workplace relations laws, but unions and the opposition have warned they will campaign strongly against any attempts to return to the Howard-era WorkChoices laws. An Essential poll taken last month showed penalty rates retained strong public support. About 81% of respondents agreed that people should receive a higher hourly rate of pay if they were required to work outside normal hours such as night shifts, weekends or public holidays, whereas 13% disagreed with the assertion. The poll also examined people\u2019s views about the likely result of cutting penalty rates for hospitality and retail workers, with 61% favouring the option \u201cbusinesses will make bigger profits\u201d and just 20% accepting the other suggestion that \u201cbusinesses will employ more workers\u201d. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, said he did not envisage legislation to change penalty rates, but called on business to \u201cbe more proactive in their engagement with the Fair Work Commission\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to get to the point of legislating at the moment,\u201d he told Sky News. Hockey said there was a need to \u201caccommodate changing behaviour from consumers\u201d including the rise of online shopping \u201c24 hours a day, seven days a week\u201d. He said if regulators made it harder for people to walk into a shop and talk to an assistant \u201cthey\u2019ll buy goods online\u201d. Hockey said the hospitality industry had been disadvantaged by the award modernisation process. On Tuesday the Productivity Commission published 46 draft recommendations spanning a range of politically contentious areas including unfair dismissal, the minimum wage, penalty rates and workplace flexibility. The commission also suggested a new type of statutory contract that would allow businesses to offer jobs with alterations to award conditions on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis. The Coalition, which commissioned the review as a basis for possible changes to present to voters at the next election, emphasised it was only a draft report whose recommendations may not necessarily be adopted. The Australian Mines and Metals Association, a resource industry employer group, said on Thursday it was disappointed the Productivity Commission\u2019s draft report had \u201cfallen short of the systematic reform we so desperately need\u201d.",

I think there is a case for looking again at this issue but I stress this: as far as this government is concerned these are matters for the Fair Work Commission.</p> <p>\u201cIf people want to bring applications to the Fair Work Commission along the lines that it would help boost employment, help create a more dynamic economy if penalty rates were looked at again in this sector or that sector, fair enough, let them do that, but these things should be considered by the Fair Work Commission.\u201d</p> <p>The former Labor government\u2019s Fair Work Act 2009 requires the FWC to review modern awards every four years.</p> <p>Various employer groups have been pushing for changes to penalty rates and <a href=\"https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/decisionssigned/html/2014FWC9175.htm\">the FWC is reviewing the issue</a> in the context of retail and hospitality industry awards.</p> <p>Abbott said the government wanted to \u201cmaximise jobs and maximise economic activity and plainly if a business is closed on Sunday there are no jobs and if a town is shut down on Sunday there is no economic activity there\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are very happy for people to go before the Fair Work Commission and put in a submission and let\u2019s hope the Fair Work Commission is alert to the need to maximise employment and maximise economic activity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), Dave Oliver, said Abbott was \u201ctargeting those who can least afford it with another unfair cut\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no evidence to show cutting penalty rates improves employment or productivity \u2013 it\u2019s a line trotted out by employers to cut wages and the prime minister has sold out millions of hardworking Australians by supporting this myth,\u201d Oliver said.</p> <p>\u201cLooking after business lobby groups is more important to the Abbott government than the lives of millions of hardworking Australians who keep the country running.\u201d</p> <p>Labor\u2019s workplace relations spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said Abbott was trying \u201cto influence and prejudice the decision-making of the independent umpire\u201d to cut low-paid workers\u2019 wages.</p> <p>\u201cLabor believes that these matters should be subject to consideration by the Fair Work Commission where empirical evidence is submitted and the commission makes a decision after hearing all relevant parties\u2019 views,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.</p> <p>Business groups have been lobbying the government to make major changes to workplace relations laws, but unions and the opposition have warned they will campaign strongly against any attempts to return to the Howard-era WorkChoices laws.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.essentialvision.com.au/penalty-rates-3\">Essential poll taken last month</a> showed penalty rates retained strong public support. About 81% of respondents agreed that people should receive a higher hourly rate of pay if they were required to work outside normal hours such as night shifts, weekends or public holidays, whereas 13% disagreed with the assertion.</p> <p>The poll also examined people\u2019s views about <a href=\"http://www.essentialvision.com.au/likely-result-of-cutting-penalty-rates-2\">the likely result of cutting penalty rates</a> for hospitality and retail workers, with 61% favouring the option \u201cbusinesses will make bigger profits\u201d and just 20% accepting the other suggestion that \u201cbusinesses will employ more workers\u201d.</p> <p>The treasurer, Joe Hockey, said he did not envisage legislation to change penalty rates, but called on business to \u201cbe more proactive in their engagement with the Fair Work Commission\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to get to the point of legislating at the moment,\u201d he told Sky News.</p> <p>Hockey said there was a need to \u201caccommodate changing behaviour from consumers\u201d including the rise of online shopping \u201c24 hours a day, seven days a week\u201d. He said if regulators made it harder for people to walk into a shop and talk to an assistant \u201cthey\u2019ll buy goods online\u201d.</p> <p>Hockey said the hospitality industry had been disadvantaged by the award modernisation process.</p> <p>On Tuesday the Productivity Commission published 46 draft recommendations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/04/workers-sunday-penalty-rates-should-be-cut-says-productivity-commission\">spanning a range of politically contentious areas</a> including unfair dismissal, the minimum wage, penalty rates and workplace flexibility. The commission also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/04/productivity-commissions-proposals-are-worse-than-workchoices-unions-say\">suggested a new type of statutory contract</a> that would allow businesses to offer jobs with alterations to award conditions on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis.</p> <p>The Coalition, which commissioned the review as a basis for possible changes to present to voters at the next election, emphasised it was only a draft report whose recommendations may not necessarily be adopted.</p> <p>The Australian Mines and Metals Association, a resource industry employer group, said on Thursday it was disappointed the Productivity Commission\u2019s draft report had \u201cfallen short of the systematic reform we so desperately need\u201d.</p>",
