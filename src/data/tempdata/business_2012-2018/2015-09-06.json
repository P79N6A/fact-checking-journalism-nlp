      "bodyText": "The economic downturn in China has compounded pressures on UK manufacturers and hit their output and exports, a leading business group will warn on Monday as it slashes its outlook for the sector. Sales to the domestic consumer market and booming car production have not been enough to make up for a drop in overseas demand, says the manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF. Those manufacturers making mechanical equipment have been particularly hard hit as waning orders from China coincide with flagging demand from the oil and gas sector, itself hit by a plunging oil price. The trade group is halving its growth forecast for manufacturing this year to 0.7% from 1.5%, citing a \u201crollercoaster of risks\u201d that include renewed eurozone tensions and a slowdown in emerging markets, particularly China. EEF chief economist Lee Hopley said that while the overall UK economy looked set for \u201csolid\u201d growth this year, manufacturers were contending with a lower oil price, fragile eurozone growth, and now the blow to global investor confidence from turmoil in China. \u201cWhile UK data has continued to point to solid growth, UK manufacturing is having to contend with a rollercoaster of risks from the rest of the world and the white-knuckle ride is starting to take its toll,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the future of the eurozone on the line once again, turbulence and uncertainty over China and Greece and, of course, oil and gas are still a concern. Against this backdrop, it\u2019s no surprise that confidence is faltering and UK manufacturers are feeling less optimistic about their growth prospects for next year.\u201d The gloomier outlook for manufacturing this year reflects signs of falling production and orders in EEF\u2019s latest survey of businesses, as well as a string of other weak indicators in the sector, including official figures showing it contracted in the second quarter. For the first time in more than two years, there were more companies reporting a drop in output than a rise, according to the EEF survey, published with law firm DLA Piper. Output falling The poll of 442 manufacturers showed that export orders fell to a six-year low in the past three months. Domestic orders were also down, hurt largely by weakness at those manufacturers reliant on the oil and gas sector. Looking ahead, more than a third of companies reported signs of improving demand in Europe \u2013 the UK\u2019s biggest export market \u2013 but the proportion of companies eyeing growth opportunities in Asia had fallen. Orders down The survey suggested there were still more companies planning to raise investment and employment rather than cut them, but only by a slim margin. Hopley said the extent of any further fallout from China\u2019s slowdown would be key for both employment and investment in the months ahead. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t something more persistent happening in China at the moment, companies feel they will wash through it. But clearly we are on amber alert for these [employment and investment] balances in the next quarter,\u201d she said. Economists point out China\u2019s slowdown has mixed effects on the UK. The downward pressure on oil prices is keeping inflation low and should boost household budgets. Meanwhile, the market turmoil could prompt the Bank of England to keep interest rates at their record low for longer. But for exporters, waning demand is another blow, on top of a stronger pound, that makes UK goods more expensive to overseas buyers. Manufacturers say that while direct UK exports to China are relatively small, it has been a growing market in recent years. China is the largest foreign market for British cars. China shock The EEF has analysed what would happen to the UK economy if there was a 12% drop in China\u2019s imports, which is equivalent to the decline during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Such a fall would weigh on UK GDP, manufacturing output and, most notably, on manufactured exports, the group found, using its economic model. A separate report on the outlook for small businesses also flags deteriorating confidence, but points to domestic pressures. The Federation of Small Businesses says its members are more cautious after George Osborne\u2019s summer budget announced changes including taxes on dividends and a \u201cnational living wage\u201d. \u201cThe reaction to these changes is reflected in the evidence we present today, which shows confidence levels amongst members cooling markedly,\u201d said FSB national chairman John Allan. The group\u2019s survey of 1,580 small businesses showed they continued to hire new workers over the last three months, but at a slower rate than the previous quarter. Nearly six-in-10 small businesses, or 58.7%, plan to grow in the next 12 months, down from 65.3% in a poll three months ago. The poll also pointed to improving access to finance, a pickup in productivity and modest growth in exports.",

BA said the changes were intended to create a \u201csustainable and competitive\u201d operation and that it was trying to minimise the financial impact on crew, after failing to agree a deal with their union, Unite. Unite accused BA of \u201cholding a gun\u201d to employees, some of whom fear they would lose up to a quarter of their earnings under the new structure. The most senior crew, with more than 20 years\u2019 experience, can earn \u00a333,000, but the customer service manager salary is expected to be capped at about \u00a324,000 before possible bonuses. Cabin crew members who anonymously posted their stories online at the weekend claim they face pay cuts of up to \u00a39,000 a year. Beyond their personal financial struggles, some query how the new structure would work on premium longhaul services without affecting customers. Anger has been further stoked among staff by the timing of the changes, which come as the airline targets record profits and after the parent company IAG\u2019s chief executive, Willie Walsh, was paid \u00a36.4m last year.

Unite national officer Oliver Richardson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve put forward a number of different options to BA, but instead they are ploughing on with changes.

Cabin crew at BA went on strike at the turn of the decade but could not stop the creation of a new, lower-paid \u201cmixed fleet\u201d for new staff, while Iberia pilots and crew saw salaries and thousands of job cut, as IAG attempted to curb losses at the Spanish airline. BA employs about 1,450 crew at Gatwick, and around 360 will be affected.

      "bodyText": "Berkeley Group Tony Pidgley, the top beneficiary of Berkeley Group\u2019s executive pay scheme with \u00a323.2m, has become one of the top-earning business executives in the UK, second only to Sir Martin Sorrell, the boss of marketing services group WPP, who earned \u00a343m last year. Five executives at Berkeley shared \u00a342m this year in the first of a series of payouts from an incentive scheme based on the group\u2019s return on equity. The scheme was agreed many years ago in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The managing director, Rob Perrins, was the second highest earner with \u00a312.3m. Persimmon Executives at Persimmon, the UK\u2019s largest housebuilder, will award the first tranches of bonus shares to its senior executives in December. The scheme was agreed a couple of years ago and could be worth more than \u00a3600m by 2021. Unlike the Berkeley scheme, which applies to just five executives, Persimmon\u2019s embraces 160 of the top team. The chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, who received a pay package worth \u00a31.9m for last year, stands to receive the largest number of shares and could eventually be in forcumulative windfalls of \u00a3100m. Barratt Mark Clare, the former chief executive of Barratt Developments, received \u00a36.03m last year, thanks to a \u00a34.1m payment from a long-term incentive scheme. The group, which reports its results on Tuesday, has been a beneficiary of the government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme. Earlier this year Clare, who stepped down in July after nine years, cashed in nearly \u00a312m worth of shares. This story was corrected on 7 September after Persimmon confirmed that the number of employees involved in its bonus scheme is now 160, rather than 135.",

      "bodyText": "Two of Britain\u2019s largest housebuilders, Berkeley Group and Persimmon, could hand out about \u00a31bn to their top executives and managers in pay and bonuses over the next six years, boosted by strong UK house prices and government-subsidies for home-buyers. Tony Pidgley, founder and executive chairman at Berkeley, is expected to face tough questions on Tuesday at the group\u2019s shareholder meeting near its headquarters in leafy Cobham, Surrey, after it emerged last month that his pay package last year was worth \u00a323.3m. The bumper payout looks set to pale next to annual rewards he is on track to receive for the year to April 2016 and future years up to 2021. Together with four other Berkeley executives, Pidgley could share future payouts worth about \u00a3500m, based on the group\u2019s current share price. Meanwhile, executives at Persimmon, the UK\u2019s largest housebuilder, also have a Berkeley-style incentive scheme that is one of the most generous to be found at a London stock market-listed firm. Persimmon, which makes 40% ofits sales under the government\u2019s help-to-buy subsidy programme for home-buyers, is about to award the first tranches of bonus shares to its senior executives in December. The details were agreed a couple of years ago and some say the remuneration deal could pay out \u00a3600m-plus by the time it ends in 2021. The Persimmon pay plan, however, is spread across 160 of the top team rather than just five executives. To land the maximum amount, the group must hit a series of profit forecasts as well as return \u00a31.9bn to shareholders. Chief executive Jeff Fairburn stands to receive the largest number of shares and could be in for a \u00a3100m windfall eventually. Asked about the group\u2019s pay plan, a spokesman said: \u201cThe point of this scheme is to incentivise management to smooth the traditional boom and bust cycle ... The incentives are aligned in order to protect shareholders so instead of chasing up land prices there will be times when the company will stand back.\u201d Pirc, the shareholder advisory group, says Berkeley directors\u2019 performance rewards last year were \u201cexcessive\u201d. Despite Berkeley strong share price performance, Pirc considered Pidgley\u2019s pay \u2014 in particular performance bonus worth 27 times his salary \u2014 to be disproportionate. The advisory group suggested it was \u201cnot considered approporate\u201d that Pidgley\u2019s pay package was worth 39 times that of the average employee at the firm. It has recommended investors vote against the company\u2019s remuneration report and against Pidgley\u2019s real. Berkeley focuses on upmarket homes in London and the south-east of England, building one in ten of all new homes in the capital. Over the past couple of years it has benefited from low interest rates and the huge demand for housing in the most prosperous region of the country. The government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme has also provided a boost- albeit only marginally - with around 2% if its homes being part of the scheme. Berkeley\u2019s share price has risen more than 40% since the election of a Conservative government in May, effectively removing the prospect of a mansion tax on higher-value homes. Pidgley, who has given to the Conservative party in the past, put his name to an open letter from business leaders in the run up to the poll calling for voters to back the Tories. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Berkeley shareholder meeting Manifest, a voting advisory agency, joined Pirc in criticising Berkeley Group\u2019s executive pay strategy. It considers overall director remuneration to be excessive given the company\u2019s size and scale and its performance. It also maintains that there is weak alignment between the key performance indicators and incentive pay. \u201cThe group has a substantial list of key performance indicators but it\u2019s only the return on equity measure that is counted towards executive pay,\u201d Manifest argues. It says incentive pay, which makes up the bulk of directors\u2019 earnings, is \u201centirely based on short-term performance\u201d. Manifest doesn\u2019t make any recommendations to investors over which way they vote at the shareholder meeting but it is clearly concerned by aspects of the Berkeley Group pay scheme. Last year Berkeley Group saw 8.4% of investors vote against its remuneration report and the year before that it was 10%, not insignificant revolts but not enough to encourage directors to change behaviour. Pidgley and his team retain the support of many investors who remember how Berkeley, unlike many of its peers, steered its way through the financial crisis of 2008 in comparative strong health, building a much-envied land bank that has propelled it to success in recent years. In its annual report Berkeley claimed that it has outperformed its peers in the sector when measured on return on equity over the last seven years. It said that its pay policy aims to encourage, reward and retain its executives with a mixture of near-term and long-term targets. Its shares have rocketed since 2011 when they traded at under \u00a310. Now trading at more than \u00a334 a share, the group is set to join the FTSE 100. Housebuilders\u2019 shares were given a further lift last week on the back of a report from Barclays which is predicting that house prices will keep on rising. This story was corrected on 7 September after Persimmon confirmed that the number of employees involved in its bonus scheme is now 160, rather than 135.",

    "webTitle": "Sir Adrian Cadbury obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That Sir Adrian Cadbury\u2019s 1992 report on corporate governance is still recognised around the world as the starting point on how companies should be managed is no surprise. It bore his hallmarks \u2013 clarity of analysis, attention to detail, moral certainty and an expectation that people will behave well if properly encouraged \u2013 which marked out an exceptional business career which turned a family chocolate business into a worldwide empire. Cadbury, who has died aged 86, kept close to his roots, fostering Midlands industry and commerce, promoting local charities in the family\u2019s Quaker tradition and, as a long-serving chancellor, helping build the new Aston University into a rival of its older neighbour in Birmingham. He was the grandson of George Cadbury, who had built the factory and model dwellings of Bournville, and second son of Joyce (nee Mathews) and Laurence Cadbury. His father was chairman both of the chocolate business and the News Chronicle, which Cadbury\u2019s owned, as well as a director of the Bank of England. The family business was packed with his relations. Adrian had the classic establishment upbringing: Eton, national service in the Coldstream Guards, and King\u2019s College, Cambridge, where he read economics and won a rowing blue. It took him to the 1952 Helsinki Olympics where the Cambridge Eight represented Britain and came fourth. \u201cThe greatest thing that ever happened to me,\u201d he said. Then he joined the family firm. Though he had been initiated as a teenager, working in the postroom in his holidays, family plans had envisaged him more likely to find his niche in publishing. However, the death of his older brother in an accident now made him first choice. He briefly considered, and rejected, an offer to become a solicitor. His first 18 months were spent in different departments, even handpainting the chocolate boxes. It taught him the importance of teamwork. \u201cYou listen, learn, get to know and work together. It is one of the biggest lessons.\u201d A succession of posts followed before, inevitably, the board. Members of the Cadbury family, he believed, should always have the opportunity to join the firm; progress was then according to their ability. He was chosen as chairman in 1965 ahead of longer serving family members when it was still unthinkable that the job would go to anyone but a Cadbury. He moved decisively. An early decision to bring in the consultancy firm McKinsey\u2019s created shockwaves inside and outside the company. His five-man executive committee had a 3-2 non-Cadbury majority, and he relied heavily on non-family members, and saw they were promoted to the board earlier in their careers, rather than as a reward for long and faithful service. Initially he still believed in the magic of the family name in human resources and sales, though insisting that when two equal candidates presented themselves, the non-Cadbury got preference. He would remain absorbed by the working of family businesses throughout his life, pointing out that they represented the majority of British businesses. The big change came in 1969. The firm was mulling ways of breaking into the American market and he was approached , about a merger by Lord Watkinson, of Schweppes, the soft-drinks firm which already had US operations. The match seemed tailor-made. Cadbury became managing director and then chairman with the difficult job of making the integration work. Later, Cadbury would observe that, of the big mergers at the time, Cadbury Schweppes was the only one to have survived largely intact for the next 40 years. By the time he retired in 1989, a turnover of \u00a3262m in 1969 had multiplied 10 times and profit margins had increased. But he had also seen the numbers of British employees halve from 35,000 to fewer than 17,000, with two-thirds of the staff now outside the UK. The expansion of Cadbury Schweppes swallowed the apple-juice processors Mott\u2019s in 1982, Canada Dry in 1986 and the English sweetmakers Trebor and Bassetts in 1989, and merged UK bottling operations with Coca-Cola in 1987. But it was not all onwards and upwards. Cadbury\u2019s confectionery business underperformed in the US. In the mid-80s, the company sold its US confectionery manufacturing to its rival Hershey. It pruned its general foods and hygiene sector, getting rid of household names such as Typhoo Tea and Jeyes in 1986. There were persistent rumours that it was a takeover target. But when Cadbury handed over the chairmanship to his younger brother Dominic in 1989, insisting on observing the same retirement age as his managers, the transformation from a family fiefdom into a major international player was recognised. By 1993 market capitalisation was eight times what it had been a decade before. Cadbury was knighted in 1977. A key figure in the CBI\u2019s attempts to make business more central to the political agenda in the 70s, he was a conscientious chairman of its economics committee admired for the way he could harmonise the high-calibre intellectual output of the staff with the preoccupations of beleaguered company chairmen. He had followed his father as a director of the Bank of England in 1970, and was on the board of IBM, but resisted repeated offers of the presidency of the CBI. From 1984 to 1995 he chaired ProNed, which promoted the appointment of non-executive directors. So it was no surprise that when a series of corporate scandals questioned standards of financial reporting and accountability and brought pressure for legislation on directors\u2019 pay, the Stock Exchange and the Financial Reporting Council turned to Cadbury to chair the committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. He described it as his toughest assignment. But \u201cCadbury\u201d, as its conclusions became known, remains the first port of call for any study of corporate governance. Authoritative but permissive, they reflected Cadbury\u2019s own beliefs. By the time the report appeared, BCCI (the Bank of Credit and Commerce International) and the Maxwell empire had collapsed and Cadbury commented coolly: \u201cUnexpected though this attention may have been, it reflects a climate of opinion which accepts that changes are needed and it presents an opportunity to raise standards.\u201d From the start of the inquiry he set himself publicly against compulsion, arguing that making the existing system work better could be done more quickly and \u2013 a typical Cadburyism \u2013 would set people\u2019s sights higher than regulation. \u201cWe should try to establish a set of standards and structure that will give the best protection against the wayward, but there is no absolute protection. That\u2019s part of life.\u201d Key recommendations included clear division of responsibilities at the head of a company so that no one individual had unfettered powers (but stopped short of mandatory separation of chairman and chief executive), sufficient independent non-executive directors of high calibre and full and clear disclosure of directors\u2019 emoluments. It stated its belief that a \u201cvoluntary code coupled with disclosure will prove more effective than a statutory code\u201d. Mild as it now sounds, it met deep business distrust, with talk of a \u201cdraconian remedy\u201d and even a CBI criticism that it could lead to \u201ctwo-tier boards\u201d. But its clearly enunciated principles became the foundation of subsequent discussion, reflected in a string of international awards to Cadbury. A decade on, in Corporate Governance and Chairmanship \u2013 a Personal View (2002), he lamented the way that trust in business had continued to be eroded and set out his own advice on running a company. He was recognised as a man not afraid of difficult choices. \u201cShelving hard decisions\u201d, he said, \u201cis the least ethical course.\u201d The same clarity was applied to the family tradition of corporate social responsibility. \u201cYou should not feel you should do something because of pressures from outside. You should be absolutely clear that this will be a benefit to the company as well.\u201d He refused to pull Cadbury\u2019s out of South Africa during apartheid, insisting that its operations were a benefit to its employees and argued with Friends of the Earth on environmental grounds over Schweppes\u2019s switch away from reusable bottles. His own non-executive posts were few but remarkably long-lasting. His report suggested that non-executives should be appointed for specific terms with reappointment not automatic. But he remained a director of the Bank of England for 24 years and of IBM for 19. He was chancellor of Aston University from 1979 to 2004. After retirement, he wrote and spoke extensively on corporate governance and devoted much attention to Aston University, even dipping into his own pocket to fund student activities. He was active in managing family trusts and charitable activity such as the Birmingham Settlement. He retained his interest in family companies and spent time collating family papers. With family control past, he and Dominic were unable to prevent the controversial takeover of Cadbury by the American food group Kraft in 2010. But they made their feelings and the Cadbury credo plain in a letter to the Daily Telegraph. \u201cA bidder can buy a business,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhat they cannot acquire is legitimacy over the character, values, experience and traditions on which that business was founded and flourished.\u201d The respect in which Cadbury continued to be held was recognised by his appointment as a Companion of Honour in January this year. Cadbury\u2019s first wife, Gillian (nee Skepper), whom he married in 1956, died in 1992. They had two sons and a daughter.

      "body": "<p>That Sir Adrian Cadbury\u2019s 1992 report on corporate governance is still recognised around the world as the starting point on how companies should be managed is no surprise. It bore his hallmarks \u2013 clarity of analysis, attention to detail, moral certainty and an expectation that people will behave well if properly encouraged \u2013 which marked out an exceptional business career which turned a family chocolate business into a worldwide empire.</p> <p>Cadbury, who has died aged 86, kept close to his roots, fostering Midlands industry and commerce, promoting local charities in the family\u2019s Quaker tradition and, as a long-serving chancellor, helping build the new <a href=\"http://www.aston.ac.uk\" title=\"\">Aston University</a> into a rival of its older neighbour in Birmingham.</p> <p>He was the grandson of George Cadbury, who had built the factory and model dwellings of Bournville, and second son of Joyce (nee Mathews) and Laurence Cadbury. His father was chairman both of the chocolate business and the News Chronicle, which Cadbury\u2019s owned, as well as a director of the Bank of England. The family business was packed with his relations. Adrian had the classic establishment upbringing: Eton, national service in the Coldstream Guards, and King\u2019s College, Cambridge, where he read economics and won a rowing blue. It took him to the 1952 Helsinki Olympics where the Cambridge Eight represented Britain and came fourth. \u201cThe greatest thing that ever happened to me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Then he joined the family firm. Though he had been initiated as a teenager, working in the postroom in his holidays, family plans had envisaged him more likely to find his niche in publishing. However, the death of his older brother in an accident now made him first choice. He briefly considered, and rejected, an offer to become a solicitor. His first 18 months were spent in different departments, even handpainting the chocolate boxes. It taught him the importance of teamwork. \u201cYou listen, learn, get to know and work together. It is one of the biggest lessons.\u201d</p> <p>A succession of posts followed before, inevitably, the board. Members of the Cadbury family, he believed, should always have the opportunity to join the firm; progress was then according to their ability. He was chosen as chairman in 1965 ahead of longer serving family members when it was still unthinkable that the job would go to anyone but a Cadbury.</p> <p>He moved decisively. An early decision to bring in the consultancy firm McKinsey\u2019s created shockwaves inside and outside the company. His five-man executive committee had a 3-2 non-Cadbury majority, and he relied heavily on non-family members, and saw they were promoted to the board earlier in their careers, rather than as a reward for long and faithful service. Initially he still believed in the magic of the family name in human resources and sales, though insisting that when two equal candidates presented themselves, the non-Cadbury got preference. He would remain absorbed by the working of family businesses throughout his life, pointing out that they represented the majority of British businesses.</p> <p>The big change came in 1969. The firm was mulling ways of breaking into the American market and he was approached , about a merger by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary--viscount-watkinson-1526794.html\" title=\"\">Lord Watkinson</a>, of Schweppes, the soft-drinks firm which already had US operations. The match seemed tailor-made. Cadbury became managing director and then chairman with the difficult job of making the integration work. Later, Cadbury would observe that, of the big mergers at the time, Cadbury Schweppes was the only one to have survived largely intact for the next 40 years.</p> <p>By the time he retired in 1989, a turnover of \u00a3262m in 1969 had multiplied 10 times and profit margins had increased. But he had also seen the numbers of British employees halve from 35,000 to fewer than 17,000, with two-thirds of the staff now outside the UK.</p> <p>The expansion of Cadbury Schweppes swallowed the apple-juice processors Mott\u2019s in 1982, Canada Dry in 1986 and the English sweetmakers Trebor and Bassetts in 1989, and merged UK bottling operations with Coca-Cola in 1987. But it was not all onwards and upwards. Cadbury\u2019s confectionery business underperformed in the US. In the mid-80s, the company sold its US confectionery manufacturing to its rival Hershey. It pruned its general foods and hygiene sector, getting rid of household names such as Typhoo Tea and Jeyes in 1986. There were persistent rumours that it was a takeover target.</p> <p>But when Cadbury handed over the chairmanship to his younger brother <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/8493484.stm\" title=\"\">Dominic</a> in 1989, insisting on observing the same retirement age as his managers, the transformation from a family fiefdom into a major international player was recognised. By 1993 market capitalisation was eight times what it had been a decade before.</p> <p>Cadbury was knighted in 1977. A key figure in the CBI\u2019s attempts to make business more central to the political agenda in the 70s, he was a conscientious chairman of its economics committee admired for the way he could harmonise the high-calibre intellectual output of the staff with the preoccupations of beleaguered company chairmen. He had followed his father as a director of the Bank of England in 1970, and was on the board of IBM, but resisted repeated offers of the presidency of the CBI. From 1984 to 1995 he chaired <a href=\"http://www.proned.com.au\" title=\"\">ProNed</a>, which promoted the appointment of non-executive directors.</p> <p>So it was no surprise that when a series of corporate scandals questioned standards of financial reporting and accountability and brought pressure for legislation on directors\u2019 pay, the Stock Exchange and the Financial Reporting Council turned to Cadbury to chair the committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. He described it as his toughest assignment. But \u201cCadbury\u201d, as its conclusions became known, remains the first port of call for any study of corporate governance.</p> <p>Authoritative but permissive, they reflected Cadbury\u2019s own beliefs. By the time the report appeared, BCCI (the Bank of Credit and Commerce International) and the Maxwell empire had collapsed and Cadbury commented coolly: \u201cUnexpected though this attention may have been, it reflects a climate of opinion which accepts that changes are needed and it presents an opportunity to raise standards.\u201d</p> <p>From the start of the inquiry he set himself publicly against compulsion, arguing that making the existing system work better could be done more quickly and \u2013 a typical Cadburyism \u2013 would set people\u2019s sights higher than regulation. \u201cWe should try to establish a set of standards and structure that will give the best protection against the wayward, but there is no absolute protection. That\u2019s part of life.\u201d</p> <p>Key recommendations included clear division of responsibilities at the head of a company so that no one individual had unfettered powers (but stopped short of mandatory separation of chairman and chief executive), sufficient independent non-executive directors of high calibre and full and clear disclosure of directors\u2019 emoluments. It stated its belief that a \u201cvoluntary code coupled with disclosure will prove more effective than a statutory code\u201d.</p> <p>Mild as it now sounds, it met deep business distrust, with talk of a \u201cdraconian remedy\u201d and even a CBI criticism that it could lead to \u201ctwo-tier boards\u201d. But its clearly enunciated principles became the foundation of subsequent discussion, reflected in a string of international awards to Cadbury. A decade on, in <a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199252008.do\" title=\"\">Corporate Governance and Chairmanship \u2013 a Personal View</a> (2002), he lamented the way that trust in business had continued to be eroded and set out his own advice on running a company.</p> <p>He was recognised as a man not afraid of difficult choices. \u201cShelving hard decisions\u201d, he said, \u201cis the least ethical course.\u201d The same clarity was applied to the family tradition of corporate social responsibility. \u201cYou should not feel you should do something because of pressures from outside. You should be absolutely clear that this will be a benefit to the company as well.\u201d He refused to pull Cadbury\u2019s out of South Africa during apartheid, insisting that its operations were a benefit to its employees and argued with Friends of the Earth on environmental grounds over Schweppes\u2019s switch away from reusable bottles.</p> <p>His own non-executive posts were few but remarkably long-lasting. His report suggested that non-executives should be appointed for specific terms with reappointment not automatic. But he remained a director of the Bank of England for 24 years and of IBM for 19. He was chancellor of Aston University from 1979 to 2004.</p> <p>After retirement, he wrote and spoke extensively on corporate governance and devoted much attention to Aston University, even dipping into his own pocket to fund student activities. He was active in managing family trusts and charitable activity such as the <a href=\"http://birminghamsettlement.org.uk\" title=\"\">Birmingham Settlement</a>. He retained his interest in family companies and spent time collating family papers.</p> <p>With family control past, he and Dominic were unable to prevent the controversial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/19/cadbury-board-agrees-kraft-sale\" title=\"\">takeover of Cadbury by the American food group Kraft</a> in 2010.

      "bodyText": "One of the statistical touchstones for left-leaning economists is the run of figures showing that US workers have suffered three decades of flat wages. There is no better way to illustrate how capitalism, marching to its own tune, fails most of America\u2019s 160 million workers than wage data that hardly moves from year to year after inflation is taken into account. Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and best-selling economist Thomas Piketty often characterise the 1980s and 1990s, as well as the 2000s until the financial crash, as periods of stellar growth that bypassed the average worker. This story of workers slaving, only for corporations to reap the benefits is allied to Piketty\u2019s history of wealth accumulation, which puts a figure on the astounding riches in property and savings amassed by the most affluent 1% in recent years. But what if a re-reading of the data reveals the Reagan and Clinton years actually boosted the wages of blue collar and middle income households? Would the broader argument that unfettered capitalism always drives down the proportion national income taken in wages be fatally undermined? The answer can be found in the pages of a report for the Brookings Institute that looks for the first time at census data going back to the beginning of the 1980s and examines groups of workers and charts their progress as they age. It is a study that might help us understand the rise of Donald Trump as a populist blue collar hero and, at the other extreme, the left-leaning Vermont senator Bernie Sanders in the upcoming presidential primaries. Not because ordinary workers found themselves stuck in a rut for 30 years when all around them enjoyed the party of the century. The new data shows that many of them had much higher incomes to splash on homes and cars. Instead the anger comes from their gains being wiped out from the 2001 recession onwards. And the only response of George W Bush\u2019s team and the Federal Reserve was to protect the rich with tax cuts and cheer workers with ultra low interest rates that, as we know, underpinned the sub-prime mortgage scandal. Both Trump and Sanders appeal to people who blame the slide in their living standards over the last decade, at least in part, on a political elite that failed to understand their concerns. Until recently, an examination of the labour market relied on the annual publication of average wages. That is how the story of flat wages for the many and super-returns for the few over such a long period has emerged. Each calculation of average wages is a snapshot of all the people in the workforce. Unfortunately, millions of people quit the labour market during the year and others join. It is not the same cohort, and not just at the outer margins. Robert J Shapiro, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton who now runs the Sonecon consultancy in Washington, grabbed the opportunity to look at the raw census data when the US statistical office published it a few years ago. He tracked the median incomes of average households as they travelled through the decades, checking on the progress of men versus women, Hispanic people versus black and white people, college graduates and different age groups. The report presents us with a more nuanced picture of the workforce and how it has fared. He found that the 1980s boom, which gained traction in the middle of the decade, boosted the wages of all but the oldest group of workers. So large, steady income gains characterised the average household whether they were headed by men or women, or by people with high school diplomas or college degrees, whatever their ethnicity. As Shapiro said: \u201cThis evidence contradicts the narrative told by those who track the value of aggregate income from the 1970s to present the claim that most Americans have made little progress for decades.\u201d The momentum dissipated in the first Bush presidency between 1989 and 1993 and accelerated again in the Clinton years before running out of steam in the early 2000s Then came the downturn. The second Bush era, under George W, was painful for almost all but twentysomething college graduates, who even survived the 2008 crash with barely a scratch, and was worst for those without a high school diploma. Shapiro says the least educated saw their incomes \u201cdevastated\u201d after 2001. \u201cAcross the three younger age-cohorts, the median income of households headed by people without high school diplomas fell an average of 1.9% per year as they aged through the 2002-2007 expansion; and over the entire period from 2002 to 2013, their median incomes fell by an average of 1.8% year as they aged,\u201d the report says. Between 2010 and 2013, households where the main earner had been aged 25 to 29 back in 1982 suffered even more if they quit education before going to high school. They lost 7.1% in income in each year as vast numbers either took a cut in pay, in hours or were made unemployed. The rise and fall of the average workers\u2019 wages documented in the report chimes with the business cycle and the trend in Europe, which followed a similar trajectory. The average German worker made income gains through the same period before a deregulation of the labour market under the Social democrat Gerhard Schroeder brought about an effective freeze in wages from 2003. In the UK, the chancellor at the time, Gordon Brown, reacted to the downturn by switching on the government spending taps. He introduced tax credits as an income top-up to offset the trend for flat or falling real wages. It was a policy that insulated British workers from a trend that clobbered Americans and to a lesser extent German workers. Retelling the economic story of the 1980s, Shapiro says the US benefited from a mix of Reagan\u2019s expansionary policies in defence and infrastructure and the collapse of commodity prices after the inflationary oil shocks of the 1970s. George Bush senior was forced to cope with the borrowing hangover from the Reagan years before Clinton assumed the presidency. It\u2019s no surprise Shapiro is a cheerleader for the Clinton years, which he argues developed employment and productivity boosting policies that favoured women, minorities and low-income employees like no other time in recent history. What happened after 2001 and Bush junior\u2019s failure to protect workers from globalisation is something that the next president must address, he says. What he calls \u201cthe dark side of globalisation\u201d, which was driven by China\u2019s over-investment in export industries, sending oil prices soaring while still flooding world markets with cheap goods, is still with us. Beijing\u2019s shift away from export subsidies has sent oil prices dropping again, offering the west an opportunity, but unless government offer workers some insulation, the radical politics of Trump and Sanders will only gain ground.",

      "bodyText": "When engineer and Shortcut Labs co-founder Joacim Westlund wanted to track his tobacco consumption, he developed an app for it. But pulling out his phone and navigating through multiple apps to find the right one proved frustrating, so he decided to create a shortcut through the process. From that niche frustration has come Flic, a silicone button the size of two pound coins stuck together that triggers specific functions on a smartphone. It has an adhesive back so it can be stuck on a wall or cupboard, or attached with a clip to a belt, jacket or a bag strap. The Flic has been developed as a bridge between the increasing number of functions that can be achieved on a phone \u2013 from turning on the lights and the stereo to ordering a taxi \u2013 and the practicalities of everyday life, where people do not want to have to search through apps. It has attracted a large following even before it has been launched. The company raised almost $900,000 (\u00a3590,000) for the button on crowdfunding website Indiegogo this year \u2013 eight times its target. The 60,000 preorders for the product will soon be sent out to customers. One currently costs $34 although the price reduces as the number bought increases. The button has just three different functions but can be used in many situations, from the trivial (taking a selfie) to more serious (as a panic alarm for epileptics). \u201cWe figured out that there are several things that we can do with this button, [like] having a wireless safety button for my girlfriend when she walks home at night,\u201d said Pranav Kosuri, who co-founded the Stockholm-based Shortcut Labs, which has developed the device, along with Westlund and Amir Sharifat. The button is effectively a trigger for a range of actions on the mobile phone, which must be within 150 feet to work. Three functions can be programmed into the button and are activated by pressing it once or twice, or holding it down. Its creators hope it will become a popular interface to navigate around smart devices instead of scrolling through a screen. The device also connects with current commercial products such as Philips Hue lights, which can switch from one colour to another. The Nest smart thermostat \u2013 which \u201clearns\u201d and manages the heating patterns of a house \u2013 can also be programmed to be used via the Flic, as can wireless Sonos speakers, which can be set to play with the press of the button. A click can also take a picture which is then immediately sent to a cloud service such as Dropbox. \u201cI have a button by my door at home. One press and I find my phone. If I tap it twice then I get a message when the next bus is coming. If I hold in the button then it sends a predetermined text message to my colleagues saying that I am 10 minutes late,\u201d Kosuri said. A common reaction to the Flic is that people are underwhelmed by the simplicity of the device. Kosuri said he felt this himself when the idea was first suggested \u2013 until the range of possibilities it could be used for became clear. \u201cMy mother had that reaction \u2013 \u2018why would I need a button?\u2019. I had to go through 30 different use cases before she had that realisation that that is something which [she] would need. The thing that she wanted to have was a \u2018find my phone\u2019 button because she was always struggling to find her phone when she was going out from the apartment and she was stressed,\u201d he said. \u201c[My grandmother] lives in India and has grandkids all around the world so what I did was I put a picture frame of all of her grandkids [with buttons underneath]. She has a smartphone but she is really struggling with it so now it is so convenient. She just presses the button and then it calls that person on Skype. I have a phone next to her night table.\u201d Linking up the internet of things The Flic capitalises on the rapid advancement of the \u201cinternet of things\u201d, the idea that devices in and outside of the home will increasingly communicate with each other. The Flic aims to be \u201ca bridge between the smart world and the physical world\u201d, says Kosuri, meaning that simple interactions between man and machine \u2013 such as the light switch \u2013 can remain but be performed in a smarter and more versatile way.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A government-controlled industry group targeted popular food bloggers, major publications and a celebrity chef as part of its sweeping effort to combat a perceived threat from an egg-replacement startup backed by some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest names, the Guardian can reveal. The lobbyists\u2019 media counterattack, in possible violation of US department of agriculture rules, was coordinated by a marketing arm of the egg industry called the American Egg Board (AEB). It arose after AEB chief executive Joanne Ivy identified the fledgling technology startup Hampton Creek as a \u201ccrisis and major threat to the future\u201d of the $5.5bn-a-year egg market. A detailed review of emails, sent from inside the AEB and obtained by the Guardian, shows that the lobbyist\u2019s anti-Hampton Creek campaign sought to: Pay food bloggers as much as $2,500 a post to write online recipes and stories about the virtue of eggs that repeated the egg lobby group\u2019s \u201ckey messages\u201d Confront Andrew Zimmern, who had featured Hampton Creek on his popular Travel Channel show Bizarre Foods and praised the company in a blog post characterized by top egg board executives as a \u201clove letter\u201d Target publications including Forbes and Buzzfeed that had written broadly positive articles about a Silicon Valley darling Unsuccessfully tried to recruit both the animal rights and autism activist Temple Grandin and the bestselling author and blogger Ree Drummond to publicly support the egg industry Buy Google advertisements to show AEB-sponsored content when people searched for Hampton Creek or its founder Josh Tetrick The scale of the campaign \u2013 dubbed \u201cBeyond Eggs\u201d after Hampton Creek\u2019s original company name \u2013 shows the lengths to which a federally-appointed, industry-funded marketing group will go to squash a relatively small Silicon Valley startup, from enlisting a high-powered public relations firm to buying off unwitting bloggers. One leading public health attorney, asked to review the internal communications, said the egg marketing group was in breach of a US department of agriculture (USDA) regulation that specifically prohibited \u201cany advertising (including press releases) deemed disparaging to another commodity\u201d. Tetrick called for the USDA to clamp down on the food lobby, as thousands of petitioners called on the White House to to investigate the USDA itself for \u201cdeceptive endorsements\u201d. \u201cThis is a product that has been around for a very long time,\u201d the Hampton Creek founder said. \u201cThey are not used to competition and they don\u2019t know how to deal with it.\u201d In statements, AEB\u2019s Ivy and a USDA official denied any wrongdoing. An agriculture department official said that it \u201cdoes not condone any efforts to limit competing products in commerce\u201d. The AEB contracted Edelman, the world\u2019s largest public relations company, to coordinate the attack. One passage within the email tranche suggests that AEB amended its contract with Edelman to include a section called \u201cBeyond Eggs Consumer Research\u201d. \u201cConduct qualitative/quantitative consumer research to pinpoint and prioritize areas of focus. For example, research will, ideally, provide actionable intelligence on what attacks are gaining traction with consumers and which are not so as to help industry calibrate level of communications response (if any) to ensure a consistent response strategy moving forward,\u201d the passage reads. \u201cAds considered disparaging are those that depict other commodities in a negative or unpleasant light via either video, photography or statements,\u201d said attorney Michele Simon, of the law firm Foscolo and Handel, after reviewing the AEB emails. \u201cThe entire contract [amendment] with Edelman violates this rule.\u201d Some of the web\u2019s biggest food blogs were unwittingly paid from the \u201cBeyond Eggs\u201d budget to write supportively about eggs as AEB executives privately expressed mounting frustration about Hampton Creek, whose high-profile backers include the Facebook backer Peter Thiel, billionaire investor Vinod Khosla and other Silicon Valley luminaries. When one Edelman executive, Jamie Singer, advised that the board wait on \u201can eventual and organic balancing of the media narrative\u201d, Kevin Burkum, AEB\u2019s senior vice-president of marketing, shot back: \u201cHelp us understand why the recommended course of action seems to always be sit back and do nothing?\u201d The TV chef, the unwitting bloggers and the bagel quiche recipe More recently, Hampton Creek has in fact faced its own PR woes with allegations of suspect science and hazardous work environments. And last month the US Food and Drug Administration warned the California startup that the name of its flagship product, Just Mayo, was misleading and and should be renamed, insisting an egg-less product should not be described as mayonnaise. The emails reveal how AEB executives had grown increasingly frustrated about coverage of Hampton Creek, hailing the company as providing a high-tech and sustainable alternative to factory-farmed eggs. In an email an AEB executive noted a blogpost by Zimmern \u2013 an influential TV celebrity \u2013 that complimented Hampton Creek and described caged-chicken egg production as \u201cthe poster child for everything farming and food systems shouldn\u2019t be\u201d. The AEB executive complained Zimmern\u2019s post was \u201ca new love letter\u201d to Hampton Creek and suggested sending the TV chef a study underwritten by the AEB to contradict his take. A long exchange discussed whether or not to respond to Zimmern\u2019s offer to host a bake-off between Beyond Eggs and hen eggs. On behalf of the egg group, Edelman contacted high-profile food blogger and Food Network star Drummond, author of several top-selling cookbooks. Drummond did not agree to work on the campaign, the emails indicate. The group also sought out Grandin, another famous figure whose endorsement would have been valuable. Grandin, too, appears to have declined. In 2013, the AEB bought ads from Google against Hampton Creek\u2019s name and other search terms including Tetrick\u2019s name and his chief product, Just Mayo, so that links to egg board-sponsored talking points about industrial farming would pop up alongside links to Hampton Creek. The AEB emailed about how to deal with Buzzfeed\u2019s Rachel Sanders, who reported on the ads, and others who followed up on the campaign, in the emails. The AEB retained at least five bloggers and contacted many more during the period covered by the emails. The bloggers disclosed the egg group\u2019s advertising on their sites. The two bloggers who responded to the Guardian for this article said they were completely unaware that the sponsorships were part of a concerted effort against Hampton Foods. Hemi Weingarten, author of the popular food blog Fooducate and an occasional columnist for the Huffington Post, published a post marked as sponsored by the AEB entitled \u201c10 Reasons to Love Eggs\u201d that including this sentence: \u201cAt just $0.15 each, eggs are the least expensive source of high-quality protein per serving.\u201d This language is consistent with one of the American Egg Board\u2019s most regularly used talking points. Weingarten said he knew nothing of the campaign against Hampton Creek and pointed out that his blog had published positive coverage of the company. \u201cAs part of our ad sales activities we reach out to healthy brands and commodity boards to spend their ad dollars to reach our audience,\u201d Weingarten told the Guardian. Lori Lange, of the popular blog Recipe Girl, is listed by Edelman as receiving a fee of $2,500 for a bagel quiche recipe. Lange disclosed the post was sponsored. The Guardian emailed Lange for comment; she did not respond but did remove an AEB infographic that read in part: \u201cToday\u2019s hens are producing more eggs and living longer due to better health, nutrition and living space.\u201d Blogger Gaby Dalkin was paid $2,000 to include the AEB\u2019s \u201cIncredible Eggs\u201d talking points in a recipe for breakfast burritos, and Susan Whetzel of Doughmesstic included the language in her in her Italian Egg Frittata recipe, according to the emails. Both disclosed the posts were sponsored. Whetzel said she, too, was unaware that the blogpost was considered part of a campaign against Hampton Creek by the AEB, and that she had adhered to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s advertising guidelines by including a disclosure notice. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious it\u2019s a sponsored post,\u201d she wrote in an email to the Guardian. Dalkin did not respond but an email bounceback said she was out of the country. The \u2018balance\u2019 of a lobby, the rise of a startup and the Egg Person of the Year The cache of 600 pages of AEB emails, first reported last week, was obtained by Ryan Shapiro, a Freedom of Information Act (Foia) expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Washington DC-based Foia specialist attorney Jeffrey Light. The messages show Ivy, who is set to leave the AEB at year\u2019s end after being named the industry\u2019s 2015 Egg Person of the Year, received many messages from egg producers and processors who make up the board\u2019s constituent members, are required by law to supply its budget and were evidently unnerved over the rise of Hampton Creek. Ivy expressed a desire to push back at the positive media coverage the company would start to receive, from the pages of Forbes magazine to Buzzfeed and beyond. \u201cWe know that shell egg producers are [...] feeling threatened by the introduction of this product,\u201d she wrote in a September 2013 email. In a statement to the Guardian, Ivy said the AEB\u2019s efforts to \u201cbalance existing media efforts\u201d were \u201ccommon\u201d practice and \u201cpart of a larger business strategy\u201d. \u201cWhile egg replacers have been around for many years, we recognize that the interest in this category has increased recently,\u201d she said. \u201c[I]n response, we bolstered our efforts to increase the demand for eggs and egg products through research, education and promotional activities. \u201cThese activities, which are common within the consumer products industry, include continuing to work with industry thought-leaders, conducting a paid social media strategy to balance existing media efforts and liaising with partner organizations.\u201d However it is the process of targeting a perceived rival that could prove most controversial for the AEB, a statutory body paid for by industry but partly appointed by the US agriculture secretary. Paid-for or \u201csponsored\u201d blogposts are not uncommon, but the notion that a quasi-governmental body funded a campaign to undercut a Silicon Valley food startup could raise eyebrows. Tetrick, the Hampton Creek founder, called for a congressional inquiry on Thursday, saying that the agriculture department should be held responsible for the AEB\u2019s actions. \u201cThey have gone way beyond what they are allowed to do,\u201d Tetrick said of the egg lobbying group. He said the scale of the egg lobby\u2019s retaliation against his company\u2019s rise was \u201chard to wrap your head around\u201d. \u201cThey play the same game over and over again,\u201d he told the Guardian on Friday. \u201cThey say they are doing it to promote eggs, but it\u2019s got nothing to do with competition.\u201d",

A long exchange discussed whether or not to respond to Zimmern\u2019s offer to host a bake-off between Beyond Eggs and hen eggs.</p> <p>On behalf of the egg group, Edelman contacted high-profile food blogger and Food Network star Drummond, author of several top-selling cookbooks. Drummond did not agree to work on the campaign, the emails indicate. The group also sought out Grandin, another famous figure whose endorsement would have been valuable. Grandin, too, appears to have declined.</p> <p>In 2013, the AEB bought ads from Google against Hampton Creek\u2019s name and other search terms including Tetrick\u2019s name and his chief product, Just Mayo, so that links to egg board-sponsored talking points about industrial farming would pop up alongside links to Hampton Creek. The AEB emailed about how to deal with Buzzfeed\u2019s Rachel Sanders, who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelysanders/egg-industry-campaign-against-hampton-creek\">reported on the ads</a>, and others who followed up on the campaign, in the emails.</p> <p>The AEB retained at least five bloggers and contacted many more during the period covered by the emails.

The two bloggers who responded to the Guardian for this article said they were completely unaware that the sponsorships were part of a concerted effort against Hampton Foods.</p> <p>Hemi Weingarten, author of the popular food blog Fooducate and an occasional columnist for the Huffington Post, published a post marked as sponsored by the AEB entitled <a href=\"http://blog.fooducate.com/2014/03/20/10-reasons-to-love-eggs/\">\u201c10 Reasons to Love Eggs\u201d</a> that including this sentence: \u201cAt just $0.15 each, eggs are the least expensive source of high-quality protein per serving.\u201d This language is consistent with one of the American Egg Board\u2019s most regularly used talking points.</p> <p>Weingarten said he knew nothing of the campaign against Hampton Creek and pointed out that his blog had published <a href=\"http://blog.fooducate.com/2014/02/18/egg-replacement-startup-raises-23-million-is-this-the-future-of-food/\">positive coverage</a> of the company. \u201cAs part of our ad sales activities we reach out to healthy brands and commodity boards to spend their ad dollars to reach our audience,\u201d Weingarten told the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4bcc7c083d154dae9d350a8469774ee29f35b4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4bcc7c083d154dae9d350a8469774ee29f35b4c/105_5_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"bagel quiche recipe screenshot\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fee schedule contained in email tranche shows the PR giant Edelman as listing the blog Recipe Girl receiving $2,500 for this bagel quiche recipe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lori Lange, of the popular blog Recipe Girl, is listed by Edelman as receiving a fee of $2,500 for <a href=\"http://www.recipegirl.com/2014/02/07/bagel-quiche/\">a bagel quiche recipe</a>.<strong> </strong>Lange disclosed the post was sponsored.

He insisted: \u201cDevelopments in China are unlikely to change the process of rate increases from limited and gradual to infinitesimal and inert.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the dominoes that have been falling in emerging economies in recent weeks \u2013 with share prices and currencies pummelled, demand for exports hit and growth forecasts slashed \u2013 have been as clear a signal as anyone could hope for that the world is far from ready to withstand tighter monetary policy.</p> <p>And the market gyrations of recent weeks have been a reminder of a lesson the world learned in the crisis of 2008 and beyond: central banks are not the omniscient puppet masters of the global economy they seemed before the crash. Instead, in resorting to trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of quantitative easing, they may have conjured up forces they can barely control.</p> <p>The Fed may yet press ahead with its rate rise later this month; but as the markets continue to fret about the prospects of a Chinese slump, expect to see plenty more evidence that central bankers, unlike that rock-solid Frankfurt tree, are sometimes forced to bend with the wind.</p> <h2>\u2026 and even Waitrose is starting to feel the chill</h2> <p>Waitrose is expected to report its first fall in like-for-like sales for seven years this week when the John Lewis Partnership reveals half-year results. The slide will highlight that the pain for supermarkets is far from over.</p> <p>Waitrose has been one of the top performers, alongside discounters Aldi and Lidl, since the financial crisis in 2007. But with prices falling \u2013 partly due to lower commodity prices and partly due to the \u201cbig four\u201d taking on the discounters \u2013 the value of grocery sales is being dragged down.</p> <p>For Tesco and Morrisons, whose sales and profits have tumbled in the last year, Waitrose\u2019s figures show there is no light at the end of the tunnel.</p> <p>David Potts, Morrisons\u2019s new boss, will lay out his turnaround plans this week. But in a market when even Waitrose is struggling, Potts has a long, hard road ahead.</p> <h2>Some bosses have children. Some are even women</h2> <p>There are times when a boss taking a couple of months off work should give pause for thought. The obvious example came when Lloyds Banking Group had to admit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/02/lloyds-chief-leave-absence-stress\" title=\"\">that its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, needed a break in November 2011 when he was suffering from what he described as fatigue</a>.

Wade-Gery is becoming a first-time mum at 50, while Mayer, although she is expecting twins, is pledging to take only two weeks\u2019 maternity leave.</p> <p>Even so, the fact that two women taking time off can generate such interest reflects the sorry fact there are so few them at the top of the corporate ladder. It was only in 2001 that the stock market had to deal with this for the first time when Belinda Earl, at the time the boss of Debenhams, became the first chief executive of a listed company to take maternity leave. A year Kingfisher felt impelled to announce that Helen Weir \u2013 now also at M&amp;S \u2013 had gone on maternity leave. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/18/davos-2015-fragile-world-leadership-garrett-cox\" title=\"\">Katherine Garrett-Cox</a> was appointed chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management in 2000, eyebrows were raised in some areas of the City when she revealed she was pregnant with her second child and would be off for four months.</p> <p>The fact that, 15 years on, maternity leave for senior women is still a story shows that much more needs to be done to push women up the corporate ladder and change public attitudes to women in high-profile roles.</p> <p>Some women become mothers; some don\u2019t. Some men have their first child at 50; some take two weeks off when they become a father of twins. Only when none of the above is news will there be real equality.</p>",

He insisted: \u201cDevelopments in China are unlikely to change the process of rate increases from limited and gradual to infinitesimal and inert.\u201d Yet the dominoes that have been falling in emerging economies in recent weeks \u2013 with share prices and currencies pummelled, demand for exports hit and growth forecasts slashed \u2013 have been as clear a signal as anyone could hope for that the world is far from ready to withstand tighter monetary policy. And the market gyrations of recent weeks have been a reminder of a lesson the world learned in the crisis of 2008 and beyond: central banks are not the omniscient puppet masters of the global economy they seemed before the crash. Instead, in resorting to trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of quantitative easing, they may have conjured up forces they can barely control. The Fed may yet press ahead with its rate rise later this month; but as the markets continue to fret about the prospects of a Chinese slump, expect to see plenty more evidence that central bankers, unlike that rock-solid Frankfurt tree, are sometimes forced to bend with the wind. \u2026 and even Waitrose is starting to feel the chill Waitrose is expected to report its first fall in like-for-like sales for seven years this week when the John Lewis Partnership reveals half-year results. The slide will highlight that the pain for supermarkets is far from over. Waitrose has been one of the top performers, alongside discounters Aldi and Lidl, since the financial crisis in 2007. But with prices falling \u2013 partly due to lower commodity prices and partly due to the \u201cbig four\u201d taking on the discounters \u2013 the value of grocery sales is being dragged down. For Tesco and Morrisons, whose sales and profits have tumbled in the last year, Waitrose\u2019s figures show there is no light at the end of the tunnel. David Potts, Morrisons\u2019s new boss, will lay out his turnaround plans this week. But in a market when even Waitrose is struggling, Potts has a long, hard road ahead. Some bosses have children. Some are even women There are times when a boss taking a couple of months off work should give pause for thought. The obvious example came when Lloyds Banking Group had to admit that its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, needed a break in November 2011 when he was suffering from what he described as fatigue. Another was when Tim Martin, the boss of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, downed tools for a six-month sabbatical in 2003. But Laura Wade-Gery, head of online operations at Marks &amp; Spencer, and Marissa Mayer, boss of Yahoo have both made headlines by preparing to take maternity leave. True, the two women are a little unusual. Wade-Gery is becoming a first-time mum at 50, while Mayer, although she is expecting twins, is pledging to take only two weeks\u2019 maternity leave. Even so, the fact that two women taking time off can generate such interest reflects the sorry fact there are so few them at the top of the corporate ladder. It was only in 2001 that the stock market had to deal with this for the first time when Belinda Earl, at the time the boss of Debenhams, became the first chief executive of a listed company to take maternity leave. A year Kingfisher felt impelled to announce that Helen Weir \u2013 now also at M&amp;S \u2013 had gone on maternity leave. When Katherine Garrett-Cox was appointed chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management in 2000, eyebrows were raised in some areas of the City when she revealed she was pregnant with her second child and would be off for four months. The fact that, 15 years on, maternity leave for senior women is still a story shows that much more needs to be done to push women up the corporate ladder and change public attitudes to women in high-profile roles. Some women become mothers; some don\u2019t. Some men have their first child at 50; some take two weeks off when they become a father of twins. Only when none of the above is news will there be real equality.",

Frustratingly, however, there\u2019s no central record of the gifts doled out by politicians to businessmen, although one such offering to Pidgley\u2019s trade will be in evidence this week.

However, by the time those gaps were being filled, Morrisons should really have been focusing on its core supermarket business, which was suddenly under attack from the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Which brings us to Morrisons\u2019s interim results announcement this week, where Philips\u2019s successor, David Potts, will get his first major chance to perform in front of the City. There\u2019ll be focus on Potts\u2019s suggested withdrawal from convenience stores, as well as questions about what he reckons to Philips\u2019s efforts at online retailing \u2013 where, after failing to get started as many times as Morecambe in the Grieg sketch, he simply handed the gig to Ocado.

While it did not exactly spoil my holiday, it did make me kick myself that I had not placed a small wager on Corbyn a month or so ago, when the quoted odds were 100-1 against him. I am something of a horseracing man, although I hasten to add that I only bet in tiny amounts. As the presenters of the Today programme\u2019s tips know, the old music-hall joke applies all too often: \u201cI follow the horses. The trouble is that the horses I follow also follow the horses\u2026 \u201d Now, I tried to get through to Paddy Power\u2019s main office to inquire further about their decision. All I can say is that I came up against the usual problems with so many modern switchboards, and gave up. But the obvious conclusion is that they regard a Corbyn victory as a racing certainty. It probably is, but there are times when racing certainties disappoint \u2013 and, to judge from the alarm in senior Labour ranks, there is no shortage of people who want this particular racing certainty to disappoint. You never quite know until that winning post is reached. A few years ago, the hot favourite for the governorship of the Bank of England, Paul Tucker (on whom bookmakers had reportedly stopped taking bets), was defeated by outsider Mark Carney. Ah, my new friend Mark Carney! He too was in the news while we were in sunny Sorrento. In a speech given at the central bankers\u2019 annual jamboree in Jackson Hole, the governor was interpreted by analysts and sections of the financial press as having indicated that events in China would have no bearing on the Bank\u2019s plans to raise interest rates by a small amount in the not too distant future. This was a different gloss from that put on the Chinese slowdown by, for example, Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Management, who said last week: \u201cA Chinese slowdown is disinflationary. It is good for the consumer as it means lower energy prices and lower interest rates\u2026 policy will end up looser than expected in the US and Europe.\u201d Expected? The amount of time and space devoted by analysts and the financial press to the subject of when interest rates may go up fractionally within the (un)foreseeable future these past few years almost beggars belief. Why the obsession, you may well ask? Well from the ordinary mortgage-holder\u2019s point of view, it seems many people have so stretched themselves that the Bank thinks even a small rise could cause hardship, and therefore people should be prepared. Personally I shall believe the long-forecast increase in rates when I see it. Seldom, in my experience, has wolf been cried so often \u2013 although, in the fairy story, the wolf eventually comes. But when one thinks of the heights that interest rates have reached in most decades since 1945, the current preoccupation seems way out of proportion. One talks of small increases, but in the world of casino banking, fortunes can be won or lost in bets on infinitesimal alterations in rates. Hence the outraged reaction to revelations about the skulduggery in the interbank and foreign exchange markets. Talking of which, I note that one of the factors highlighted by Carney is the importance of the exchange rate for both inflation and all those meetings of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee when they look at their inflation target and decide yet again not to raise rates. Import prices, he pointed out, account for a third of the components of the consumer price index. The impact of the Chinese slowdown on demand for commodities may be disinflationary. But a fall in the pound has the opposite effect. Which brings us to an interesting development which may yet prove to upset the apple cart of a chancellor who has been riding nauseatingly high. The fact of the matter is that, while George Osborne is obsessed with shrinking the size of the public sector and causing hardship and misery, the real crisis in this country concerns not the size of the budget deficit, but the record peacetime balance-of-payments deficit of a whopping 6% of GDP. With this in mind, John Llewellyn and Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting have been urging the Bank to encourage the overvalued pound to fall towards more realistic levels, to avoid an almighty sterling crisis when the markets finally wake up to the real crisis in the British economy. Well: it looks as though the governor has got the point. He has several times referred to the high level of the pound and, hey presto, while I was on holiday in the second half of August sterling fell significantly. I may not have backed Corbyn, but for a change I bought my euros in time. But back to Corbyn. Maybe I was right not to risk even a tenner at 100-1. Having failed to get through to Paddy Power, I tried William Hill, whose charming press officer laughed heartily when I raised the subject. He told me his firm was still taking bets, and that morning the odds on Corbyn had narrowed, whereas the odds against Yvette Cooper had come down sharply. I repeat what I said two weeks ago. The arrival of Corbyn, and his forceful opposition to this harmful policy of austerity, has had a salutary effect on the other candidates.
