      "bodyText": "Using drones to transform working practices could boost Britain\u2019s economy by \u00a342bn by 2030, research claims. Increased use of drones, in sectors from construction or defence to energy or logistics, will employ hundreds of thousands of people and lift GDP by almost 2%, according to a report by accountants PwC. While pilots and police have often viewed drones as a problem, the report predicts 76,000 unmanned aerial vehicles will be in UK skies by the end of the next decade for commercial or public use, saving billions in efficiencies. It says many existing jobs will go, with drones able to quickly map, inspect or transport in places that are difficult for people to reach. Drones are likely to replace posts from stock controllers to helicopter pilots as they allow speedier visual access of everything from giant warehouses to power lines. Already used widely in utilities to inspect infrastructure, drones are likely to replace expensive helicopter use in land surveys, the report says, while oil rig inspections have become safer and cheaper using the devices. Remote crop spraying could extend in agriculture to drone monitoring with thermal cameras, to give more data on plant health and irrigation than is visible to the human eye. PwC predicts cost savings of \u00a316bn annually through their use and estimates that in the long run there will be 628,000 people working in the drone economy, potentially in more highly skilled jobs overall, including building and programming the devices. Elaine Whyte, of PwC, said: \u201cDrones have the potential to offer a powerful new perspective for businesses across a variety of industries, delivering both productivity benefits and increased value from the data they collect. \u201cI envisage that the advantages of drone technology will be well established within the decade \u2013 not only for business purposes but also for helping to protect our society, for example, through being used by the emergency services. There is a need for current UK drone regulation to advance to see the estimations in our report become a reality but it\u2019s positive to see the government already taking proactive steps to address this with the draft drones bill.\u201d The draft bill was due to be published this spring. The government said it would pave the way for drone use in business or public service but also help police crack down on their misuse after concerns about privacy and safety, particularly for planes. Last week pilots and air traffic controllers issued new guidelines on drones to their members in response to a growing risk that they said regulation was so far failing to address. Many thousands have been sold for leisure users and pilots have reported dozens of near collisions around airports. In 2017 there were 92 official reports of incidents involving drones and planes, with some near misses on large passenger jets, which the pilots union Balpa said had the potential to cause catastrophic accidents. Whyte conceded that drones were still often seen as toys, adding: \u201cThe immediate focus must be on developing society\u2019s confidence in the technology to help drive acceptance and increase adoption. There is a huge opportunity to help solve some of business and society\u2019s most important problems.\u201d The aviation minister Baroness Sugg said drones would bring significant economic benefits and the government was attempting to harness their potential through its industrial strategy. She added: \u201cThey are already improving people\u2019s lives \u2013 helping the emergency services and keeping key national infrastructure like rail lines and power stations safe. Excitingly this is just the beginning.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "KPMG has quietly abandoned a longstanding practice of making donations in kind to MPs and political parties by providing researchers to help in formulating policy and legislation. The decision by the accounting giant, which has been criticised for its role as auditor to the collapsed construction giant Carillion, comes after figures released by the Electoral Commission in March showed that donations by the big four auditors tumbled by 91% during the 2017 election campaign compared to that of 2015. KPMG told the Guardian that although it had \u201chistorically provided secondees to the three main parties\u201d in non-political and back office roles, it had in 2017 \u201cchanged our policy and no longer offers secondments to political parties\u201d, joining Ernst &amp; Young, which has not done so for years. Donations in kind from KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte were widespread in the 15 years running up to the 2015 election, with KPMG making \u00a3198,093 worth of donations in kind in 2015, falling to \u00a340,575in 2017. The practice has been criticised by outsiders, who argue that it helps secure long-term political influence, although the firms say they are politically neutral. Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting at the University of Sheffield, said: \u201cThe firms don\u2019t make donations. The money is an investment to secure desirable outcomes.\u201d He cited as an example the abolition of the Audit Commission under the coalition government, which allowed the big four firms into the \u00a3100m-a-year local government market for the first time from 2015. However, such political donations have tumbled after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, decided to abandon them. Secondments have traditionally been provided to opposition parties, sometimes in considerable numbers, because they do not have the same access to the civil service as government. In aggregate, KPMG, PwC and Deloitte provided a little over \u00a31m worth of support services and other donations during the 2015 election campaign, falling to just over \u00a3111,000 in the 2017 campaign, according to the Electoral Commission. That followed on from \u00a34.9m of party donations made between 2005 and 2015. Labour took more than \u00a3736,000 of donations in kind from the big four firms during Ed Miliband\u2019s losing 2015 campaign, by far the largest of any party at that time. Individual MPs, including then frontbenchers Ed Balls, Chuka Umunna and Rachel Reeves, shared a further \u00a3614,000 in 2014/15, in the run-up to the election. However, in the 2017 campaign Labour did not take any donations in kind from any of the major accountancy firms. PwC has traditionally been the heaviest donor. The firm provided \u00a3668,369 of donations in kind in the run-up to 2015, mainly to Labour, and \u00a370,075 in run-up to the 2017 election. PwC said it stood by the practice. A spokesman said the firm did consider requests for non-cash support, noting that the demand \u201chas tended to come from opposition parties\u201d. It said it provided junior people in areas where their expertise was relevant but added \u201cwe have no political affiliation and don\u2019t develop policy\u201d. Deloitte said it was appropriate to maintain \u201cconstructive and balanced relationships\u201d with each of the main political parties and that it had in the past made available staff and technical information. It made donations in kind of \u00a3185,765 in the 2015 election campaign. It did not do so at all during the 2017 campaign, although the company did not say it had abandoned the practice. Instead, political donations by the big four firms have become increasingly concentrated on paying former ministers to speak at corporate events. George Osborne, the former chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard, reported in April 2017 that he expected to be paid \u00a365,901 for giving a speech to PwC in Ireland; Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, received \u00a318,000 in December 2016 for giving a speech to PwC. Ken Clarke received \u00a311,500 in fees for giving speeches to KPMG in Leeds and Manchester in May 2016 while Michael Gove collected \u00a35,000 from PwC in December 2016 and \u00a34,000 from Ernst &amp; Young in May 2017, again for speeches. The big four came under fire earlier this month as part of a highly critical report by MPs on the business and work and pensions committees on the collapse of the construction giant Carillion. Rachel Reeves, the business select chair, said they had a \u201cparasitical relationship\u201d with companies, getting paid even if they went under and called for the Competition and Markets Authority to look at breaking them up \u201cto increase competition and deal with conflicts of interest\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A landmark report by the Productivity Commission has slammed the performance and transparency of the $2.6tn superannuation industry. It has made major recommendations directed towards making it easier for workers to choose their default fund, gain better returns and higher retirement balances, and to drive underperforming funds out of the industry. The report, released on Tuesday, is the third stage in the commission\u2019s examination of the superannuation industry, which came out of recommendations from the Murray inquiry into Australia\u2019s financial system, and assesses the industry\u2019s efficiency and competitiveness. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And it finds much wanting. Over a quarter of the 74 funds offering a MySuper product failed to meet benchmark performance returns \u2013 accounting for 1.7 million member accounts and $62bn in assets. And such was the lack of transparency in the system that a mere five funds out of 208 provided the commission with information on their rates of return across all 14 assets classes, and 71% gave no response on the level of fees for related parties. The commission found it to be an industry with little sense of competition or accountability. It aims to change that. It also seeks to lower fees, given it found that they are higher \u201cthan those observed in many other OECD countries\u201d. This is not just some theoretical issue \u2013 the commission estimates that a third of super accounts (about 10 m) are unintended multiple accounts \u2013 joined purely because of taking a different job. It estimates the fees and premiums in these accounts \u201cerode members\u2019 balances by $2.6bn a year.\u201d The commission calculates as well that if members in underperforming MySuper products had instead been moved to the median of the top-10 performing products, \u201cthey would collectively have gained an additional $1.3bn a year.\u201d Early last year the commission\u2019s draft report proposed a shake-up of the way the default superannuation system is organised. Currently the biggest beneficiaries of the default system are industry funds as the fund can be made default as part of an enterprise bargain agreement. The banks of course would love to be able to get their hands on that money, given new entrants each year bring $1bn into the system. But the proposed system should give very little comfort to the retail superannuation sector, which is shown by the commission\u2019s research to be woefully underperforming. It\u2019s no real shock that retail funds on average perform worse than industry or corporate funds (which cover specific employees \u2013 such as Telstra and Qantas). Annual data from the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority has consistently shown this to be the case. In every year since 2007-08, retail funds have on average had the worst five year annualised rates of return. In the five years to 2016-17, retail super funds averaged a return each year of 8.1%, compared with the average of 10.2% for industry funds: On an annual basis, in every year bar one of the past 14, industry super funds have on average outperformed retail funds: But what the Productivity Commission has discovered is that while the averages certainly favour industry funds, that does not mean being in an industry fund guarantees you good performance. The commission found that of the 20 underperforming funds, nine were retail (more than half of retail funds), six were industry, three were corporate and two were for public service. And of the 26 underperforming default products, 12 were retail, 10 industry, three corporate and one public sector products. Of the worst 10, five were retail funds, three were industry and two were corporate. The problem is it is basically just bad luck should your employment mean you end up in one of those dud funds or products. And it is a costly bit of bad luck. The commission estimates that a 21-year-old full-time worker with a salary of $50,000 who is in the median underperforming MySuper product would retire with a balance $375,000 lower than if they were in the median top-10 product \u2013 equivalent to seven and half years\u2019 lost pay. To combat this, the commission proposes that rather than have a default fund, new employees submitting a TFN (tax file number) would be able to choose from a list of up to 10 of the best funds. This list of the \u201cbest in show\u201d would be decided by an independent panel against clearly defined and published criteria, and would be updated every four years. The commission argues the list should be chosen \u201con the basis of achieving the best outcomes for members\u201d and \u201cshould particularly consider long-term net returns and fees, as well as each applicant\u2019s investment strategy, intrafund advice, governance and track record on identifying and meeting member needs\u201d. When starting a job, workers would go to the ATO website, see the list (which would be randomised so as not to give advantage to the first listed fund) and also have \u201csimple and comparable metrics on each product\u2019s features.\u201d The commission found that under such a system young workers would be able to make informed choices and be clear about what they were most concerned about \u2013 namely fees and rates of return. This certainly works in favour of industry funds, given the commission found that fees for such funds \u201con average remain well below the fees charged by retail funds\u201d. The list would no doubt be very contentious \u2013 as would the appointment of panel members by the government of the day. The commission argues that, as the responsible minister would not be able to override their recommendations and the list would be subject to judicial review, the process should not become politicised \u2013 especially as the criteria would be clearly set out. This process would create a massive incentive for funds to perform well \u2013 but brings with it also a greater level of transparency that would have flow-on effects even for those in self-managed super funds and for underperforming funds. The creation of a best in show list would mean, for example, that financial advisers would need to justify why they are recommending a client not join one of those funds \u2013 especially if it is shown to be underperforming against the benchmarks. The commission also recommends giving Apra more teeth. It recommends legislating for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to apply the MySuper outcomes test, and that authorisation (legislation for this is currently before the Senate) and MySuper rules be strengthened so that funds are required to audit-level standard verification of their outcomes test assessment, with comparison against other products in the market, and determination of whether members\u2019 best interests are being promoted, at least every three years. It also recommends that funds report to Apra each year on how many of their MySuper members have switched to a higher-fee choice product within the same fund \u2013 to prevent those funds on the \u201cbest in show\u201d list using it to \u201cupsell\u201d members into weaker-performing and higher-fee paying products. The commission argues that should funds fail to meet these conditions \u2014 or persistently underperform over five or more years \u2013 Apra should repeal their MySuper authorisation. And that would be death for the fund \u2013 something the commission would welcome. Karen Chester, the deputy chair of the Productivity Commission, argues that this process should see underperforming funds either improve, exit the system or merge with a better-performing ones that would provide better outcomes for its members. She argues underperforming funds \u201cneed to be accountable for their performance\u201d and \u201cown the outcome for their members\u201d, asking themselves \u201ccan I lift my game? If the answer to that is no, should I exit or should I arrange a merger? Which of those two options is in the best interests of my members\u201d. She argues such a process is better than the regulator having to step in and decide the fate of the members. The report will no doubt be seen as highly political \u2013 it recommends, for example, the passing of the legislation before the Senate that would see stronger reporting on the outcomes test for MySuper funds, but also that one third of all fund directors be independent \u2013 something that would mostly affect industry funds given their directors are notionally split between employer and employee representatives. But given industry super funds accounted for eight of the top 10 funds and 14 of the 18 top-performing default products, it should not be afraid of this report \u2013 it vindicates their performance. And the best in show list would likely reward industry funds \u2013 and more importantly, bring rewards to workers both current and future. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "Wang Manni, 23, a graduate student in Hangzhou, is a loyal customer of one of the world\u2019s biggest finance companies. However, it is not one of the traditional banking giants that handles her business, rather a four-year-old spin-off from the technology conglomerate Alibaba, Ant Financial. She uses its virtual credit cart, Huabei, to buy groceries, makeup and electronics on Taobao, Alibaba\u2019s massive e-commerce business. Sometimes she puts her monthly allowance from her parents into Ant\u2019s money market fund, Yu\u2019e Bao, to earn a little interest to help repay her shopping debts. \u201cI often don\u2019t know I\u2019ve spent that much money until I see the bills at the end of the month,\u201d she said. It is because of people such as Wang, part of a $13tn mobile payments market, that Ant Financial is one of the world\u2019s most valuable fintech companies. The Hangzhou-based firm, controlled by the Alibaba founder and executive chairman, Jack Ma, is reportedly raising funds that would value it at $150bn. That would make Ant the world\u2019s most valuable startup, larger than Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and several Chinese banks. The company occupies a grey area between an internet company, a bank and a payment platform, underlining the rise of Chinese tech companies and the regulations at home and abroad that are only just catching up to them Ant Financial, established in 2014, grew out of Alipay, an escrow payments service started by Alibaba in 2004 to serve shoppers and merchants on Taobao. In 2011, Ma controversially carved out Alipay from Alibaba and took full control of the company. Ant\u2019s last funding round, from Chinese investors in 2016, put a valuation of around $60bn on the company. Today, it offers credit services such as Huabei, insurance products, micro-loans to online merchants and other small and medium-sized businesses, as well as investment products. Its credit scoring system, Sesame Credit, is one of the largest in the world. Yu\u2019e Bao has $233bn under management as of last year, making it the world\u2019s largest money market fund. Analysts say it is the ubiquity of Ant in the daily lives of Chinese consumers that underpins its valuation. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to define what kind of company Ant Financial is,\u201d Li Chengdong, an independent e-commerce analyst based in Beijing, said. \u201cYou can think of Ant Financial as the water, electricity, and coal in your life. Ant Financial is everywhere in your life, from daily payments, to renting a house to renting a bicycle,\u201d he said. The company has pledged to have 2 billion users worldwide; at the moment it has 870 million, including those through its partners outside China, in India, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and elsewhere. \u201cThe prize at the end is so large that investors are still running in\u201d, Joe Ngai, managing partner of McKinsey\u2019s Greater China practice, said. \u201cThis is essentially a digital wallet, which isn\u2019t new but what is new in China is the fact that so many people are on it and that it\u2019s at such scale.\u201d \u201cIf Facebook started a bank, that\u2019s kind of what it feels like,\u201d he said. The company sees itself more as a \u201clifestyle platform\u201d on which people such as Wang conduct most of their life\u2019s transactions. From ordering food, buying movie tickets, to paying utility bills. \u201cThe idea is people are living their lives through this platform,\u201d an Ant Financial spokesperson said. Between January and October last year, Chinese shoppers spent $12.8tn on mobile payment platforms, dwarfing mobile payments in the US of an estimated $49.3bn, according to data from eMarketer, a market research firm. Yet there is still room to grow. Of the country\u2019s more than 720 million mobile phone users, only about a third use mobile payments, according to China\u2019s Internet Network Information Centre. Young Chinese such as Wang, part of China\u2019s \u201cpost-90s\u201d generation , are a particular force. Analysts call them \u201cempowered\u201d consumers who grew up with Taobao and Alipay and adopt new online products and services confidently and quickly. Companies such as Alibaba and its rival Tencent are giving Chinese consumers and businesses new access to credit. China\u2019s state-owned banks have traditionally focused on the country\u2019s state-owned companies. In 2014, fewer than 10% of Chinese had access to credit through some sort of financial institution, according to the World Bank. Analysts and investors expect Ant to go public within the next two years. The company declined to comment on any possible listing or reports on its valuation. The company has not been without setbacks. US officials in January blocked its purchase of MoneyGram International, a cross-border payment system, for $1.2bn, out of national security concerns. Chinese regulators may have similar concerns: an IPO abroad, such as Alibaba\u2019s in 2014, would give foreigners control over a critical Chinese payments system. Chinese regulators have also been cracking down on online lenders and China\u2019s fast-growing micro-credit market. Ant, which dominates the online credit market, repackages these consumer loans into asset-backed securities (ABS) to be sold on to investors. However, late last year regulators banned microlenders from raising funds via ABS. Ant also faces more competition from Tencent, which owns China\u2019s most used messaging app WeChat. Users can also conduct most of their financial transactions \u2013 paying bills, transferring money and investing on the app, known in China as Weixin. Ant\u2019s greatest advantage may be its trove of data on how people shop, how quickly they pay back their debts and hundreds of other transactions that are analysed to calculate a credit score. Ant is likely to expand into other financial products and move into other emerging markets. The company said it is working on encouraging merchants in the US to accept Alipay to target Chinese tourists travelling there. In China, Ant continues to ingratiate itself into people\u2019s lives.

      "body": "<p>Wang Manni, 23, a graduate student in Hangzhou, is a loyal customer of one of the world\u2019s biggest finance companies. However, it is not one of the traditional banking giants that handles her business, rather a four-year-old spin-off from the technology conglomerate Alibaba, <a href=\"https://www.antfin.com/\">Ant Financial</a>. She uses its virtual credit cart, Huabei, to buy groceries, makeup and electronics on Taobao, Alibaba\u2019s massive e-commerce business. Sometimes she puts her monthly allowance from her parents into Ant\u2019s money market fund, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28d4e100-2a6d-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c\">Yu\u2019e Bao</a>, to earn a little interest to help repay her shopping debts. </p> <p>\u201cI often don\u2019t know I\u2019ve spent that much money until I see the bills at the end of the month,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/cryptocurrencies-fad-money-bitcoin\">Cryptocurrencies have a mysterious allure \u2013 but are they just a fad? | Robert Shiller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is because of people such as Wang, part of a $13tn mobile payments market, that Ant Financial is one of the world\u2019s most valuable fintech companies. </p> <p>The Hangzhou-based firm, controlled by the Alibaba founder and executive chairman, Jack Ma, is reportedly raising funds that would value it at $150bn. That would make Ant the world\u2019s most valuable startup, larger than Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and several Chinese banks.</p> <p>The company occupies a grey area between an internet company, a bank and a payment platform, underlining the rise of Chinese tech companies and the regulations at home and abroad that are only just catching up to them<br></p> <p>Ant Financial, established in 2014, grew out of Alipay, an escrow payments service started by Alibaba in 2004 to serve shoppers and merchants on Taobao. In 2011, Ma controversially carved out Alipay from Alibaba and took full control of the company. Ant\u2019s last funding round, from Chinese investors in 2016, put a valuation of around $60bn on the company.</p> <p>Today, it offers credit services such as Huabei, insurance products, micro-loans to online merchants and other small and medium-sized businesses, as well as investment products. Its credit scoring system, Sesame Credit, is one of the largest in the world. Yu\u2019e Bao has $233bn under management as of last year, making it the world\u2019s largest money market fund.</p> <p>Analysts say it is the ubiquity of Ant in the daily lives of Chinese consumers that underpins its valuation. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to define what kind of company Ant Financial is,\u201d Li Chengdong, an independent e-commerce analyst based in Beijing, said.</p> <p>\u201cYou can think of Ant Financial as the water, electricity, and coal in your life. Ant Financial is everywhere in your life, from daily payments, to renting a house to renting a bicycle,\u201d he said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The company has pledged to have 2 billion users worldwide; at the moment it has 870 million</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The company has pledged to have 2 billion users worldwide; at the moment it has 870 million, including those through its partners outside China, in India, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cThe prize at the end is so large that investors are still running in\u201d, Joe Ngai, managing partner of McKinsey\u2019s Greater China practice, said. \u201cThis is essentially a digital wallet, which isn\u2019t new but what is new in China is the fact that so many people are on it and that it\u2019s at such scale.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf Facebook started a bank, that\u2019s kind of what it feels like,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The company sees itself more as a \u201clifestyle platform\u201d on which people such as Wang conduct most of their life\u2019s transactions. From ordering food, buying movie tickets, to paying utility bills. \u201cThe idea is people are living their lives through this platform,\u201d an Ant Financial spokesperson said.</p> <p>Between January and October last year, Chinese shoppers spent $12.8tn on mobile payment platforms, dwarfing mobile payments in the US of an estimated $49.3bn, according to data from eMarketer, a market research firm.</p> <p>Yet there is still room to grow. Of the country\u2019s more than 720 million mobile phone users, only about a third use mobile payments, according to China\u2019s Internet Network Information Centre.<br></p> <p>Young Chinese such as Wang, part of China\u2019s \u201cpost-90s\u201d generation , are a particular force. Analysts call them \u201cempowered\u201d consumers who grew up with Taobao and Alipay and adopt new online products and services confidently and quickly.</p> <p>Companies such as Alibaba and its rival Tencent are giving Chinese consumers and businesses new access to credit. China\u2019s state-owned banks have traditionally focused on the country\u2019s state-owned companies. In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/02/08/whats-happening-with-chinas-fintech-industry/\">fewer than 10%</a> of Chinese had access to credit through some sort of financial institution, according to the World Bank.</p> <p>Analysts and investors expect Ant to go public within the next two years. The company declined to comment on any possible listing or reports on its valuation. </p> <p>The company has not been without setbacks. US officials in January <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/03/us-blocks-moneygram-sale-chinese-firm-security-concerns\">blocked its purchase of MoneyGram International,</a> a cross-border payment system, for $1.2bn, out of national security concerns. Chinese regulators may have similar concerns: an IPO abroad, such as Alibaba\u2019s in 2014, would give foreigners control over a critical Chinese payments system.</p> <p>Chinese regulators have also been cracking down on online lenders and China\u2019s fast-growing micro-credit market. Ant, which dominates the online credit market, repackages these consumer loans into asset-backed securities (ABS) to be sold on to investors. However, late last year regulators banned microlenders from raising funds via ABS.</p> <p>Ant also faces more competition from Tencent, which owns China\u2019s most used messaging app WeChat. Users can also conduct most of their financial transactions \u2013 paying bills, transferring money <a href=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-09-05/101140985.html\">and investing</a> on the app, known in China as Weixin. </p> <p>Ant\u2019s greatest advantage may be its trove of data on how people shop, how quickly they pay back their debts and hundreds of other transactions that are analysed to calculate a credit score. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ant is likely to expand into other financial products and move into other emerging markets.

The case, which experts said would likely have broad implications about the way mining royalties could be calculated and levied, centres on a 2015 decision by the Queensland Office of State Revenue to hit BHP Billiton with a bill for what it claimed were unpaid royalties and interest. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The bill relates to coal sold by the BHP-Mitsubishi alliance to BHP\u2019s own Singapore-based marketing operation between 2005 and 2012. The state has claimed that royalties should be calculated based on the price coal customers pay to BHP\u2019s marketing hub, and that using that body as middleman had the effect of sidestepping royalties. BHP has previously argued royalties should be calculated when the alliance, a partnership that mines most of the company\u2019s Queensland coal, sells to the BHP marketing hub. The alliance operates seven coalmines in the Bowen basin \u2013 Goonyella Riverside, Broadmeadow, Daunia, Peak Downs, Saraji, Blackwater and Caval Ridge \u2013 and owns and operates the Hay Point coal terminal near Mackay. BHP disputed the state\u2019s 2015 assessment and claim for unpaid royalties and took the treasurer to court (BHP\u2019s action is against the treasurer as a statutory office, not the individual who is the treasurer). A trial, scheduled to begin on Monday, was adjourned after the lawyer for BHP, John Sheahan QC, told the court a settlement was pending. \u201cI\u2019m instructed I can tell Your Honour that an agreement in principle has been agreed between the two parties.
