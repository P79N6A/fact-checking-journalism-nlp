      "bodyText": "Private equity firms, including Guy Hands\u2019 Terra Firma, have emerged as contenders to take over Network Rail\u2019s commercial property business, fuelling further dismay over the forced sale of assets to fund the budget shortfall. The US investment giant Blackstone is understood to be another bidder for the rail property arm, which includes about 5,500 premises across England and Wales and is estimated to be worth \u00a31.2bn. According to Sky News, about 20 parties are expected to table preliminary bids on Friday, including Telereal Trillium, owned by the billionaire Pears family, and also funds linked to the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs. Much of the property is in urban areas under railway arches, and often let to small businesses such as bars, garages and hairdressers. The portfolio generated a large proportion of Network Rail\u2019s total rental income of \u00a3293m in 2017. Network Rail has said existing tenants will retain their leases under the new landlords. The involvement of Guernsey-based Terra Firma was revealed a month after a scathing report from the National Audit Office found the government had lost up to \u00a34.2bn in a previous sell-off to part of Hands\u2019 private equity group. The Ministry of Defence sold 57,400 army homes for military families for \u00a31.66bn in 1997 to Annington Homes, and then rented them, which the public accounts committee chair, Meg Hillier, described as \u201ca rotten deal for taxpayers\u201d. Terra Firma has also attracted attention for its management of the crisis-hit Four Seasons Health Care, whose care homes look after 17,000 elderly people in the UK and which is seeking a rescuer. The sale of Network Rail assets, including some depots but no stations, was agreed as a condition of George Osborne (who was then the chancellor) releasing more funds in 2015 to continue promised infrastructure work. Network Rail hoped to raise \u00a31.8bn towards a \u00a32.5bn shortfall. A host of rail upgrades in a five-year plan from 2014-19 were cancelled after the budget for electrifying the Great Western mainline alone overran by approximately \u00a32bn. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cI regret that the government is forcing Network Rail to sell parts of its property portfolio. It would be much better for the public purse to benefit from the hundreds of millions of pounds of rent from railway arches each year rather than passing this income into the hands of private property investors such as Guy Hands.\u201d Network Rail declined to comment on the sale, which is being handled by Rothschilds. In announcing the decision to sell in November last year, Mark Carne, Network Rail\u2019s chief executive, said the move would bring more investment into the commercial estate to benefit communities, as well as funding the railway. He said: \u201cI hope to see areas around the railway positively transformed with new and refurbished shops, amenities, and extra facilities for local people and passengers.\u201d Unions and campaigners condemned the sale. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said: \u201cThis is the same old bunch of chancers, speculators and asset strippers queuing up to make another killing at the expense of our public services. These property assets make a decent income for Network Rail and once they are gone they are gone, smashing another gaping hole in the rail infrastructure budget.\u201d Cat Hobbs, of the campaign group We Own It, said: \u201cRailway land belongs to all of us \u2013 we don\u2019t want it parcelled up and sold to the highest bidder. This is an asset which generates millions every year, money which should be returned to the public purse not disappear into private profits.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally, European stock markets have closed with losses across the board. Despite the less hawkish tone from Jerome Powell this afternoon, investors picked up the baton from Asia and send shares lower. In London, the FTSE 100 ended 56 points down at 7,175, a fall of 0.8%. Rentokil was the biggest faller, down 9%, after cutting its profit forecasts this morning. WPP, the world\u2019s biggest advertising firm, shed 8% after its own gloomy outlook. David Madden of CMC Markets says: WPP are still suffering at the hands of Google and Facebook as companies are shying away from traditional advertising and are using online targeting to reach their customers. Like-for-like billing declined by 5.4% and 2017 \u2018wasn\u2019t pretty\u2019 according to the CEO Martin Sorrell. The company revealed disappointing figures in August and today\u2019s announcement sent the stock to its lowest level since October 2014. Traders may remain sceptical about the company until it can challenge the tech titans for advertising space. Germany\u2019s DAX lost almost 2%, while France\u2019s CAC lost 1.1% and the pan-European Stoxx 600 fell by 1.4%. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Powell is also making some interesting points about student debt; suggesting it could be wiped away if an individual is made bankrupt. Background: The US Education Department said this week it will review when borrowers can discharge student loans, an indication it could become easier to expunge those loans in bankruptcy. Fed chair Jerome Powell is exhibiting a more dovish plumage to Congress today, having come over as quite the hawk on Tuesday. Jerome Powell\u2019s cautious comments about wage inflation have taken some of the sizzle out of the US dollar. Shares have also pushed higher on Wall Street, as traders shed some of their worries about rate increases. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is testifying to the Senate banking committee. His prepared testimony was the same as Tuesday\u2019s offering to the House, so it didn\u2019t move the markets. But Powell now taking questions....and he\u2019s delivered a dovish-sound comment on wages increases. Perhaps importantly, the new Fed chief says there aren\u2019t any signs of a \u2018decisive\u2019 move in wages. That could dampen expectations of hefty interest rate rises this year. CNBC has the details: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that there are no \u201cdecisive\u201d signs of wage inflation yet. Speaking in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, the central bank head also said more gains can come in the labor market without causing harmful levels of inflation. The remarks are significant in that during Powell\u2019s remarks two days ago before the House Financial Services Committee were interpreted as being more concerned about inflation, leading the Fed to a more aggressive path in interest rate hikes. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.\u201d Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics is impressed by today\u2019s US manufacturing figures: The rise in the ISM manufacturing index in February to 60.8, from 59.1, left it at a 13-year high and suggests that growth is set to pick up following a soft start to the year. On past form, the index is consistent with real GDP growth of more than 5% annualised. Rupert Harrison of BlackRock suggests Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms are helping: James Knightley of ING says the data supports the case for four US interest rate rises this year: Given orders and production are also well above the 60 level \u2013 remember that a reading of 50 notionally means stable output - the report suggests that the manufacturing sector will continue to contribute significantly to economic activity in coming months. However, inflation pressures are also clearly building with prices paid the highest since 2011. As such, this report supports our predictions that the US economy will expand 3% this year and that headline inflation could hit 3% in the summer. With new Fed Chair Jay Powell seemingly backing the case for further policy tightening, we look for a March 21st rate hike with three more to follow later this year. Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners puts today\u2019s data in context: More strong US economic data! Growth among American factories jumped last month, to the highest level in 13 years. That\u2019s according to the Institute of Supply Management. Its monthly manufacturing PMI survey has risen to 60.3 in February, up from January\u2019s 59.1. Economists had expected a small fall. Instead, ISM reports that new orders and employment growth were both strong, keeping activity in the sector bubbling away. In contrast, the UK\u2019s factory PMI fell to 55.2 this morning, while the eurozone posted 58.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Back in the UK, households have been told to \u2018carry on cooking\u2019, despite the shortfall in gas supplies. Energy minister Claire Perry has pledged that domestic supplies won\u2019t be disrupted, so Britons should \u201dcarrying on using your gas heating and cooking meals as normal\u201d. Here\u2019s Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on the surprise drop in US jobless claims: \u201cIn the final week of February 1969, 201,000 US workers made jobless claims (seasonally adjusted). Led Zeppelin had just released their debut album, the Vietnam war was raging, and some 69 million workers were on Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment was below 4%. The fact that a comparable number of initial jobless claims are being made today illustrates just how tight the US labour market is getting. We also have fresh data showing that inflationary pressure are building in America, although not dramatically. The prices paid by US consumers rose by 0.4% in January, although the annual rate remains below the significant 2% level. Reuters has the details: U.S. consumer prices increased in January, with a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, bolstering views that price pressures will accelerate this year. The Commerce Department said on Thursday consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4%. That was the biggest increase since September and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December. In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7% after a similar gain in December because of base effects. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index advanced 0.3% in January - the largest gain since January 2017. Economist Danny Blanchflower reckons this isn\u2019t an excuse to raise US interest rates.... Significantly, the four-week moving average of US jobless claims has also hit a 48-year low. This measure, which strips out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,000 to 220,500 last week. Bloomberg\u2019s Mike McKee says today\u2019s US unemployment data is seriously impressive: Analyst Marco Mazzocco says the figures highlight the strength of America\u2019s recovery Financial blogger Bill McBride has tweeted a graph showing the initial claims figures over the decades: Breaking: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has hit its lowest level in almost 50 years. The weekly initial claims survey shows that just 210,000 US citizens filed new claims last week, down from 220,000 the previous week. This extends a long run of impressive jobs data, underlining the strength of the US labor market (which is why interest rates are likely to rise three or four times this year). The shortage of gas in the UK has pushed prices to new record levels. Britain\u2019s same-day gas prices have surged by more than 130 per cent to 275p per therm. That extends todays record highs, and beats the previous record high of 150p set in 2013. Last week, wholesale gas for immediate use was trading around 60p per therm, but the snowy weather - and National Grid\u2019s warning that supplies can\u2019t meet demand today - has triggered a scramble to get hold of gas. Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, says a range of factors have left Britain short of supplies. He explains (via PA) \u201cBehind today\u2019s gas deficit warning is a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of unrelated short-term issues - freezing conditions, diminished Dutch gas production due to earthquake concerns, weather-related issues curbing imports from Europe, and a global LNG market in which supplies are being pulled to Asia by higher prices. \u201cBut underlying it is another set of issues that speak to a failure by successive governments to map out a secure gas future in the way that they have done so successfully for electricity. \u201cAllowing Centrica to close the UK\u2019s only big long-term gas store without consideration for supply during cold snaps, failing to develop a coherent plan for low-carbon heating, and above all a head-in-the-sand approach to improving energy efficiency in homes have all put households and businesses at risk of shortages and price spikes.\u201d The pound and the euro are both losing ground against the US dollar today. America\u2019s currency is benefiting from the prospect of several interest rate rises this year (which would make it more profitable to hold cash in dollars, rather than sterling or euros). The euro has slipped to a seven-week low against the dollar, at $1.216, while the pound has dipped to $1.374, a six-week low. The London stock market has fallen deeper into the red, after a morning of generally bad news. The FTSE 100 is now down 63 points, or 0.9%, at 7170. Ad firm WPP remains the biggest faller, down 13%, after reporting its weakest growth since 2009 this morning. The smaller FTSE 250 index, of medium-sized companies is also down, shedding 135 points or 0.7% . The latest gloom at Carpetright, the drop in UK house prices, and the slowdown in factory growth have all dampened the mood in the City. But there are chunky losses across Europe too -- with Germany\u2019s DAX down 1.6%. Wall Street is also expected to drop, when trading begins in over two hours time. Investors remain nervous about the prospect for US interest rates -- with new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaking at the US Senate in a few hours time. Will Powell repeat his upbeat words from Tuesday, when he testified before the lower House of Congress? Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains why traders will be watching closely: It would appear markets are bracing for more hawkish commentary from Powell today when he appears before the Senate Banking Committee, once again discussing the semi-annual monetary policy report. Given everything that he said on Tuesday, it seems pretty clear that economic forecasts will be revised higher this month and the pace of tightening will likely therefore pick up, which may make today\u2019s less eventful as he reiterates many of the views already expressed. That said, should he wish to back pedal on anything or clarify points that have been misinterpreted, it may attract some attention. Even the world\u2019s financial markets aren\u2019t immune to the snowy weather. The Irish stock exchange is closing at noon today, and will be shut all Friday, due to \u201cextreme weather conditions\u201d. The ISE says: Due to the announcement by the Irish Government\u2019s National Emergency Coordination Committee and the severe weather-related nationwide Status Red Warning, and to protect against any potential risk to market integrity in these exceptional circumstances, the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) is altering its trading calendar to facilitate an earlier closing of the market today, Thursday, 1 March 2018 and will close all day on Friday, 2 March 2018. Earlier today, a \u2018Red\u2019 weather alert was extended to cover the entire Republic of Ireland, which means people should stay at home to avoid the severe winter storm that is hitting the country. The Guardian\u2019s weather blog has full coverage of Storm Emma, and the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019: Heads-up, UK readers. This is the last day to spend your old \u00a310 notes (the ones with Charles Darwin on them). From Friday morning, only the new Jane Austen ones will do (although you can always change out-of-date notes at the Bank of England). Here\u2019s my colleague Mark Sweney on ad giant WPP\u2019s results, which have sent its shares sliding: The world\u2019s largest advertising and marketing services group, WPP, has said last year was its worst year since the 2009 recession. The UK company reported a 0.3% fall in revenues to \u00a315.2bn in its results for 2017, making it WPP\u2019s worst year in growth terms since 2009 when the company reported a fall of 8.1% during the depths of the recession following the credit crunch. WPP\u2019s share price fell more than 10% in early trading on Thursday, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, admitted 2017 \u201cwas not a pretty year\u201d for the company but denied it was because his agencies were being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. More here: Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, fears that Brexit uncertainty is hitting UK factory growth. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s manufacturing report: Although the sector remains positive, the continuing uncertainty over Brexit negotiations can\u2019t be helping the investment intentions of manufacturers who are looking for some degree of clarity over the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later. Manufacturers will also need to remain flexible in their planning as they negotiate the uncertain market conditions in 2018. With current Barclays data highlighting the premia that international consumers are prepared to pay for British goods, and given the continuing improvement in key overseas markets, manufacturing businesses should be increasingly focusing on differentiating their products on quality and service.\u201d Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, reckons Britain\u2019s factory sector is still in \u201ca positive mood\u201d, despite the drop in the manufacturing PMI last month. Brexit uncertainty is a key factor, he adds: Recent ONS figures show sector productivity is increasing, although there is still some way to go before the UK catches up to its G7 counterparts. But manufacturers are taking steps to make this happen by investing in automation and exploring the opportunities presented by Industry 4.0. Many are using specialist asset finance facilities to invest in equipment, protecting their working capital which can be used to support growth opportunities. \u201cClearly, challenges and uncertainties lay ahead. All firms are keen for clarity on the future trading relationship with the EU, but manufacturers, which account for nearly half of UK exports, are disproportionately exposed to uncertainty associated with international trade agreements. The PMI will therefore be closely watched in the coming months for any clues as to how exporting firms are managing this uncertainty.\u201d Newsflash: UK factory activity growth has hit its lowest level in eight months, according to data firm Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck. Manufacturers have reported that production increased at the slowest pace for 11 months in February, with \u201cdecelerations seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors\u201d. Firms also suffered a sharp rise in input costs, as raw materials and other commodities became pricier. Some companies passed this onto their own customers -- which could push inflation up. But there\u2019s good news too - new orders picked up, and firms kept hiring staff: Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says there wasn\u2019t much \u201cbonhomie\u201d in the UK manufacturing sector last month. All sectors lost their drive as manufacturing activity crawled at a snail\u2019s pace not seen for almost a year. \u201cAmidst these signs of a moderate slowdown, it was supply chain disruptions that were largely at fault. Suppliers underperformed not only on the timely delivery of goods but in their inability to meet the demand from makers for some raw materials. This intensified capacity issues and acted as a drag on overall purchasing activity. Time for some data... The euro zone\u2019s manufacturing boom slowed a little last month, new figures from Markit show. But Europe\u2019s factories are still in a rosy period, and enjoying their strongest growth spell in almost 20 years. Markit\u2019s manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (which tracks activity in the sector) dipped to 58.6 in February from 59.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. France and Germany both reported a small drop in growth. National Grid has issued a warning that the UK will not have enough gas to meet demand on Thursday, as temperatures plummeted and imports were hit by outages. It is thought unlikely that the situation will affect supply to households, but if enough extra gas supplies by pipeline or ship are not forthcoming, it could affect industrial users. Within-day wholesale gas prices soared 74% to 200p per therm this morning after the formal deficit warning, which acts as a call to suppliers to bring forward more gas on Thursday. Prices have since fallen back to 170p. More here: European stock markets are all in the red this morning, following last night\u2019s late slide on Wall Street. In London, the FTSE 100 is being dragged down by advertising giant WPP - which has shed 13% after reporting a \u201cslow start\u201d to the new year, and a 0.3% drop in like-for-like revenues in 2017. Otherwise, traders are continuing to fret about the prospect of sharp hikes in US interest rates this year (as the Federal Reserve tries to prevent inflation getting out of hand). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says European markets got off to \u201canother duff start\u201d, after traders saw America\u2019s Dow Jones shed 380 points last night. Interactive Investor\u2019s Lee Wild explains what\u2019s going on: A strong US economy is great for confidence and jobs, but corporate America will have to absorb more expensive debt, which is why equity traders are selling into the rally from mid-February lows. It\u2019s all eyes on Jerome Powell again on Thursday when the Fed chair testifies before the Senate Banking Committee. Any further talk about an overheating economy will give equity market bears another reason to dump stock. Retail analyst Nick Bubb is amazed that Carpetright has produced another profit warning today: It is only 6 weeks or so since the last Carpetright profit warning on Jan 19th, but, almost unbelievably it has issued yet another profit warning today and flagged, ominously, that it is in discussions with its banks about to prop up the balance sheet. Whether Carpetright needs to raise more equity remains unclear, as does the issue of how far its problems are to do with intense competition from its rival Tapi, but shareholders will fear the worst today\u2026 Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says Carpetright has deteriorated sharply in recent months. \u201cA bad week for retail as Carpetright\u2019s woes get worse: now the company expects to report a loss for the year to the end of April as its store investment programme is not paying off. It\u2019s been quite a climb-down from just a few months ago. In December it issued a profits warning, guiding underlying profit before tax for the year to be at the lower end of the previous range of \u00a313.8m to \u00a316.7m. As we noted at the time, profits warnings have a nasty habit of not coming alone and that guidance appeared to be wishful thinking. In January management slashed this to a range of \u00a32m-\u00a36m. Horrendous post-Christmas sales were to blame then but the trend is not improving. Now a small loss is expected as trading remains very difficult. That loss may not remain small if Easter doesn\u2019t go well. Like-for-like sales are negative and below management expectations. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says the next few months will be crucial for Carpetright. Carpetright\u2019s long and painful decline clearly has further to run. Things haven\u2019t improved since the last profits warning in January, and the company will lose money this year. It has the backing of its lenders for now, but a strong Easter is crucial for the business and any goodwill that remains. Newsflash: Shares in Carpetright, the UK flooring and furnishing business, have plunged by 25% in early trading. In another sign of retail gloom, Carpetright has issued a profits warning (its fourth in three months, according to Reuters). It now expects to make a small underlying pre-tax loss for the current financial year. Carpetright admits that sales in the UK have been weaker than hoped, saying: Trading conditions in the weeks since the Group last updated the market on 19 January 2018 have remained difficult, characterised by continued weak consumer confidence. While the trend in the Group\u2019s UK like-for-like sales has improved through the intervening period, it remains negative. Carpetright says it is \u201cproactively engaged in constructive discussions\u201d with its banks, to ensure it sticks with its bank facilities. They add: The bank lenders have indicated that they currently remain fully supportive. This comes a day after Toys R Us and Maplin, two other UK retailers, both fell into administration putting over 5,500 jobs at risk. The drop in UK house prices in February is a surprise, says Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent . He explains: \u2019As one of the most closely-watched indicators of property market strength due to its longevity and accuracy, Nationwide\u2019s figures may cause concern. At this time of the year we would have expected an increase, not a fall, in house price growth although of course these figures are in contrast to the previous month\u2019s findings. \u2018However, it goes to show the limitations of a national snapshot of the market. While Nationwide reports a lack of supply, on the ground, we are finding more balance between supply and demand in our part of London as buyers, spoilt for more choice, hesitate before making commitments and identifying whether they are dealing with serious sellers.\u2019 Simon French, chief economist of Panmure Gordon, predicts that the slowdown in UK house prices will continue this year: Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital, believes the property market is being battered by weak consumer confidence. \u201cWith the ongoing financial squeeze on households, you sense the house price slowdown has now begun in earnest. \u201cHigh living costs, low wage growth, potential rate rises and a lethargic economy in the shadow of Brexit: for consumers, the bad news is in stereo mode. \u201cWhile weak supply and very low borrowing costs will prevent a collapse in prices, it\u2019s hard to see 2018 delivering anything other than very low single digit growth. \u201cFebruary could go down as the month the big freeze on prices took hold. Newsflash: UK house prices fell in February, fuelling suspicions that the housing market is cooling fast. The Nationwide Building Society has reported that prices fell by 0.3% last month, crushing expectations of a rise, following January\u2019s 0.8% increase. That drags the annual rate of house price growth down to 2.2%, from 3.2% a month ago. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, blames falling consumer confidence and the squeeze on household budgets: \u201cMonth-to-month changes can be volatile, but the slowdown is consistent with signs of softening in the household sector in recent months. Retail sales were relatively soft over the Christmas period and at the start of the new year, as were key measures of consumer confidence, as the squeeze on household incomes continued to take its toll. Gardner points out that mortgage approvals fell to their weakest level for three years in December - a sign that activity in the sector has fallen. Nationwide expects house prices to only rise by 1% this year, due to \u2018subdued economic activity\u2019 and Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. \u201cHow the housing market performs in the year ahead will be determined in large part by developments in the wider economy and the path of interest rates. Brexit developments will remain a key factor, though these remain hard to foresee. I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are facing fresh losses today, after a late wobble on Wall Street sent the Dow Jones industrial average down almost 400 points, or 1.5%. The selloff ended Wall Street\u2019s run of 11 monthly gains, and was triggered by renewed jitters about the pace of US interest rate rises . The big fear is that America\u2019s central bank, the Fed, will hike interest rates four times in 2017. This has sparked declines in Asia, where Japan\u2019s Nikkei shed 1.5%. As AFP put it: After a couple of weeks of calm, the volatility that kicked off February has returned on worries that the strong US economy and Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts will lead the Federal Reserve to tighten borrowing costs more than previously thought. European markets are set to follow, with the main indices being called down 0.5%. The new chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, worried investors on Tuesday by indicating that borrowing costs must rise to prevent the US economy overheating. We\u2019ll hear from Powell again today, when he testifies to the Senate banking committee. If he repeats his hawkish tone, then the markets could take fright. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Mr Powell returns for a second round today with US lawmakers and markets will be looking to see whether he rows back a little from Tuesday\u2019s hawkish interpretation of his remarks or whether he reaffirms them. If he does the latter then we could well see further gains for the US dollar and increased pressure on stock markets. On the corporate side, advertising giant WPP and theme park operator Merlin are reporting results. We also find out how the world\u2019s manufacturing companies fared last month, as data firms Markit and ISM release their monthly healthchecks: The agenda: 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI report for February 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI report for February 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment figures for January 1.30pm GMT: US personal income and spending figures 3pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI for February 3pm GMT: Fed chair Jerome Powell testifies to Congress (again)",

Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the trend revealed that the currency dividend from the Brexit vote, which led to a steep fall in sterling\u2019s value, had waned and British goods were no longer as cheap abroad as they were last year. A slowdown in the stellar expansion across the eurozone last year had also played a part in British firms experiencing lower growth, he said. \u201cGrowth in the manufacturing sector is moderating, now that the recovery in the eurozone has started to lose a little pace and more than 18 months have elapsed since sterling\u2019s huge depreciation,\u201d he said. Dave Atkinson, a spokesman for Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said the sector was in a positive mood despite the slowdown and was bringing forward plans for investment. \u201cRecent [official] figures show sector productivity is increasing, although there is still some way to go before the UK catches up to its G7 counterparts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut manufacturers are taking steps to make this happen by investing in automation and exploring the opportunities presented by Industry 4.0. \u201cMany are using specialist asset finance facilities to invest in equipment, protecting their working capital which can be used to support growth opportunities.\u201d Bank of England lending figures for February showed a steep rise in borrowing by manufacturers for investment, maintaining a trend that started last April. Factory output growth slipped across the eurozone, but still enjoyed its best spell of expansion in almost two decades. IHS Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI for the eurozone fell to 58.6 in February from 59.6, just pipping an earlier flash estimate of 58.5.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "National Grid has warned that the UK would not have enough gas to meet public demand on Thursday, as temperatures plummeted and imports were affected by outages. But the government said households would not notice disruptions to their supply or any increase in energy bills because suppliers, including British Gas, bought energy further ahead. The energy minister Claire Perry said people should cook and use their heating as they would normally. But experts said there was a strong chance that industrial users could experience interruptions to their gas supply. Within-day wholesale gas prices soared 74% to 200p per therm after the formal deficit warning, which acts as a call to suppliers to bring forward more gas. It is the first time such an alert has been issued since 2010. By lunchtime on Thursday the price had spiked even higher, hitting a high of 275p per therm at one point. National Grid\u2019s forecast for the day initially showed a shortfall across the day of 49.5m cubic metres (mcm) below the country\u2019s projected need of 395.7mcm, which would normally be around 300mcm at this time of year. The gas deficit warning aims to fill the gap, which has since narrowed to 16.5mcm. \u201cWe are in communication with industry partners and are closely monitoring the situation,\u201d the company said. Widespread snow and temperatures of -7.8C due to the \u201cBeast from the East\u201d and Storm Emma have prompted consumers to fire up their heating. Public health authorities recommend an indoor temperature of 18C. Gas demand is now at a five-year high, according to the market watchers S&amp;P Global Platts. Simon Wood, a gas analyst at the group, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a strong chance you\u2019ll see some interruptions for industrial users to balance the system.\u201d Big energy users such as car manufacturers have supply contracts which can be interrupted in return for lower prices. The situation has been compounded by several supply outages, which can relate to very cold weather. There have been problems with a pipeline to the Netherlands, reductions in gas flows from Norway, and technical issues at facilities in the UK, including at the North Morecambe Barrow terminal. The crunch is also the UK\u2019s first big energy security test since the country\u2019s biggest gas storage facility was closed by Centrica last year. The Rough site in the North Sea had accounted for 70% of the UK\u2019s gas storage. The UK is currently drawing on gas stores around the country, and on liquefied natural gas at the Isle of Grain, in Kent, and at Dragon, in South Hook, Wales. Gas storage is at the lowest level since records began in 2006, primarily because of the closure of Rough. The UK has about 0.7bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas stocks, out of a total capacity of 1.3bcm. That total used to stand at 4.5bcm. Wood said that ensuring there was enough gas in the next few days would be \u201ctouch and go\u201d. Normally, energy demand dips at the weekend but that effect will be limited this Saturday and Sunday because cold temperatures keep more people indoors and bump up household demand. One analyst said that while this week\u2019s short-term problem had been caused by a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of unrelated issues, the government had failed to take long-term action on gas supplies and cut demand by encouraging energy-efficient homes. \u201cThe UK is largely isolated in its dependency on gas, with a huge over-reliance in the power and heating sectors. Experts have long warned about putting too many eggs in the same basket, with events such as today the undesirable outcome,\u201d said Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU thinktank. Labour accused the government of failing to plan for the winter by allowing Rough to close, and said it would insulate 4m homes as a priority. The government is due to meet an alliance of energy intensive industry groups and trade unions after they wrote to the business secretary, Greg Clark, last November demanding an inquiry on gas storage and supply. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the Forties [pipeline] disruption [in December], other events in January and February. We envisage the frequency of these will increase, and this will have impact on gas prices. This requires an inquiry,\u201d said Clive Moffatt, speaking for the group, whose members include ceramics and paper firms. The shale industry claimed today\u2019s deficit warning demonstrated the UK\u2019s need for \u201chomegrown\u201d gas supplies extracted by fracking. The jump in gas prices is much higher than the one in December after a large North Sea pipeline was closed for repairs. The high price of gas, which is expected to last for the rest of the week, has also had an impact on electricity supplies, leading to a surge of dirty coal power. The amount of electricity generated from oil in February was up 81% on January, and over the last seven days more than a fifth of power came from coal, according to MyGridGB. Power prices, which would usually be around \u00a345-50 per megawatt hour at this time of year, spiked at an astronomical \u00a3990 per MWh on Thursday. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2018 because an earlier version abbreviated megawatt hour to mWh.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More high street store closures could be on the cards after Carpetright warned it would slump into the red this year and said it was asking its banks for help to ride out the financial storm. The floor covering chain\u2019s third profit warning in four months comes the day after Toys R Us and Maplin, two of the high street\u2019s best known retailers, went into administration, casting doubt over the future of 5,500 jobs and 300 stores. The tough market conditions were also underlined by new figures published by the troubled South African group Steinhoff, which owns a number of UK retailers. It said like-for-like sales slumped in its furniture business, which includes the Bensons for Beds and Harveys brands, had dropped 7% in the last three months of 2017. By comparison sales at sister chain Poundland were up 5% after a record Christmas. Carpetright\u2019s chief executive, Wilf Walsh, is trying to turn around the retailer by modernising its stores and closing underperforming branches. But on Thursday the company said the trend of falling sales at its 409 UK stores had continued amid a slowdown in consumer spending. Carpetright said it now expected to make a loss of around \u00a34m for the year to 28 April. At the start of this year the City had pencilled in profits of \u00a313m. \u201cThe group is proactively engaged in constructive discussions with its bank lenders in order to ensure it continues to comply with the terms of its prevailing bank facilities,\u201d said the company in a statement. \u201cThe bank lenders have indicated that they currently remain fully supportive.\u201d The warning wiped more than a quarter off the value of Carpetright\u2019s shares, which were changing hands for 58p at lunchtime on Thursday, valuing the company at \u00a340m. Walsh said the retailer was examining a \u201crange of options to accelerate the turnaround of the business and strengthen its balance sheet\u201d. Analysts said the most likely scenario was that it sought to raise fresh funds from shareholders to finance an ongoing store refurbishment programme alongside closures. It is only six weeks since Carpetright\u2019s last profit warning, when it told the City that like-for-like sales were down 7.1% amid a sharp drop in the number of shoppers visiting the high street. The company said the magnitude of the sales fall had lessened in the intervening weeks but the trend remained negative. Carpetright has a \u00a355m overdraft and analysts said the two banks involved were expected to loosen the conditions attached to the loans when they are tested again next month. The home furnishings sector has been particularly hard hit by weak consumer confidence as inflation eats into Britons\u2019 spending power. The slowdown in the housing market has also depressed demand for big-ticket purchases like furniture and carpets. Home furnishings companies Multiyork, Feather &amp; Black and Warren Evans have all ceased trading since November. Walsh has cut the size of Carpetright\u2019s UK chain by more than 10% since taking charge in 2014. About half its stores have now been modernised \u2013 a process that involves ditching the dated red branding and improving customer service \u2013 and they are producing higher sales than the rest, which include a tail of unprofitable branches. The retail sector is braced for a wave of store closures this year as major players including Marks &amp; Spencer, House of Fraser and New Look scale back their high street presence. Prior to its collapse Toys R Us had been trying to close loss-making stores and downsize others. Canaccord Genuity analyst Sanjay Vidyarthi said Carpetright had too many stores but getting rid of them would be expensive given its straitened circumstances. \u201cThe issue here is a rent bill of \u00a380m and a UK store portfolio of circa 400 stores that should really be under 300,\u201d said Vidyarthi. \u201cThe average lease length as at April 2017 was 5.5 years. The cost of an early exit from onerous leases is likely to be hugely material relative to current market cap.\u201d",

By comparison sales at sister chain Poundland were up 5% after a record Christmas.</p> \n<p>Carpetright\u2019s chief executive, Wilf Walsh, is trying to turn around the retailer by modernising its stores and closing underperforming branches. <br></p> \n<p>But on Thursday the company said the trend of falling sales at its 409 UK stores had continued amid a slowdown in consumer spending. Carpetright said it now expected to make a loss of around \u00a34m for the year to 28 April. At the start of this year the City had pencilled in profits of \u00a313m.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe group is proactively engaged in constructive discussions with its bank lenders in order to ensure it continues to comply with the terms of its prevailing bank facilities,\u201d said the company in a statement. \u201cThe bank lenders have indicated that they currently remain fully supportive.\u201d </p> \n<p>The warning wiped more than a quarter off the value of Carpetright\u2019s shares, which were changing hands for 58p at lunchtime on Thursday, valuing the company at \u00a340m.</p> \n<p>Walsh said the retailer was examining a \u201crange of options to accelerate the turnaround of the business and strengthen its balance sheet\u201d. Analysts said the most likely scenario was that it sought to raise fresh funds from shareholders to finance an ongoing store refurbishment programme alongside closures. </p> \n<p>It is only six weeks since Carpetright\u2019s last profit warning, when it told the City that like-for-like sales were down 7.1% amid a sharp drop in the number of shoppers visiting the high street. </p> \n<p>The company said the magnitude of the sales fall had lessened in the intervening weeks but the trend remained negative. Carpetright has a \u00a355m overdraft and analysts said the two banks involved were expected to loosen the conditions attached to the loans when they are tested again next month.</p> \n<p>The home furnishings sector has been particularly hard hit by weak consumer confidence as inflation eats into Britons\u2019 spending power. </p> \n<p>The slowdown in the housing market has also depressed demand for big-ticket purchases like furniture and carpets.

Typically represented as percentage growth rates, like-for-like sales measure sales at stores that have been open for at least a year, stripping out the impact of sales at newer stores. The idea is that they allow a more transparent comparison of a retailer\u2019s sales performance over a certain period of time, when compared with the same period of time a year earlier.</p>\n    <p>However, there is no formal industry standard. This means that some companies include new extensions to stores in their like-for-like sales, while others include sales generated by a customer paying with a voucher. Critics of the measure say that like-for-like sales do not always give an accurate picture of a retailer\u2019s health.

      "bodyText": "UK house prices fell unexpectedly in February for the first time in six months, as the squeeze on household incomes and weaker economic backdrop weighed on the property market, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide. The average price of a home fell by 0.3% last month to \u00a3210,402, following a 0.8% increase in January. City economists had expected a 0.2% increase. The February decline drove down the annual rate of UK house price growth to 2.2%, the weakest in six months and less than half the 4.5% in the same month last year. \u201cMonth-to-month changes can be volatile, but the slowdown is consistent with signs of softening in the household sector in recent months,\u201d said Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist. He said the outlook for house prices in the months ahead was difficult to predict because of the uncertainty over Brexit negotiations. \u201cHow the housing market performs in the year ahead will be determined in large part by developments in the wider economy and the path of interest rates. Brexit developments will remain a key factor, though these remain hard to foresee,\u201d he said. \u201cSubdued economic activity and the ongoing squeeze on household budgets is likely to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth.\u201d Nationwide is forecasting a slowdown in house price growth to about 1% in 2018, down from 2.6% in 2017, the slowest rate of growth in five years. Gardner said low unemployment and a shortage of properties on the market were factors preventing a fall in average house prices. Separate data from the Bank of England painted a stronger picture of the UK housing market, with the sharpest rise in mortgage approvals in nearly three years at the beginning of 2018. The number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to 67,478 in January from a one-year low of 61,692 in December. It was the highest number since July 2017, the biggest monthly rise since April 2015 and easily beat forecasts of 62,000 in a Reuters poll of economists. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group, the EY Item Club, cautioned that housing market activity tended to be particularly volatile around Christmas and New Year. \u201cThe stronger January Bank of England mortgage approvals data does little to dilute our belief that 2018 will be a difficult year for the housing market,\u201d Archer said. \u201cPrice gains over the year are likely to be limited to a modest 2%.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest advertising and marketing services group, WPP, has said last year was its worst since the 2009 recession, as it published gender pay gap figures. The UK company reported a 0.9% fall in revenues to \u00a315.2bn in its results for 2017, making it WPP\u2019s worst year in growth terms since 2009 when the company reported a fall of 8.1% during the depths of the recession following the credit crunch. WPP\u2019s share price fell more than 14% in early trading on Thursday, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, after the company said there had been no improvement in trading so far this year and cut its long-term profit outlook. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, admitted 2017 \u201cwas not a pretty year\u201d for the company but denied it was because his agencies were being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. The tech companies account for almost 60% of the \u00a319.7bn UK internet market and hoover up as much as 90% of all new money coming in. However, Sorrell said advertisers were still using his agencies to spend money with the technology companies, and were not cutting them out by doing direct deals. Sorrell, one of the UK\u2019s highest-paid chief executives, who took home \u00a348m in 2016, said WPP spent more than $6bn (\u00a34.4bn) of its clients\u2019 advertising and marketing money with Google, its biggest single investment, last year, a 10% rise. Facebook received about $2.1bn of its ad spend last year, a 30% rise. \u201cThe major factors influencing [WPP\u2019s] performance were probably the long-term impact of technological disruption and more the short-term focus of zero-based budgeters, activist investors and private equity,\u201d he said. Zero-based budgeting is a marketing strategy where a company starts with a clean slate each year, rather than taking the previous year\u2019s advertising spend as a benchmark. WPP also published a gender pay gap report for the 14,000 staff in the UK. For basic pay excluding bonuses there was a median hourly gap of 14.6% between men and women, compared with the UK average of 18.4%. The difference between men and women was far higher on bonuses, with a median gap of 46.3%. The report found that while overall 51% of WPP\u2019s UK workforce are men, only 38% of women employees were in the most senior roles in the top 25% pay bracket. WPP\u2019s pre-tax profits rose 7.7% to \u00a32.1bn last year, but the company indicated that this year there would probably be job cuts among its 130,000 global staff. WPP needed to put a \u201ccontinued emphasis on balancing revenue growth with headcount increases and improvement in staff costs\u201d, it said. Staff costs climbed from \u00a37.78bn to \u00a38.3bn last year, with more than \u00a3320m paid out in cash and share-based performance bonuses.",

    "webTitle": "Shorten says Adani mine decision will be made when Labor is in government", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bill Shorten says Labor will make a decision about the future of the controversial Adani coalmine when it next wins government rather than taking any concrete position imminently, and will not rip up contracts or create sovereign risk. In a significant cooling of his recent public signalling on the Adani project, a statement issued by Shorten\u2019s office on Thursday says, \u201cif there are decisions to be made in government, Labor will make them in the national interest, based on relevant laws, and the best and most recent information before us\u201d. \u201cLabor does not rip up contracts and we don\u2019t create sovereign risk,\u201d the statement says. The Labor leader\u2019s indeterminate position will infuriate the environment and activist groups that have attempted over the summer to persuade Shorten to adopt a stronger stance on Adani \u2013 a lobbying effort that was triggered by Shorten himself. The Labor leader reached out to the environmentalist and businessman Geoff Cousins last December, signalling he wanted to take a tougher line against the project, which resulted in the two men visiting the Great Barrier Reef and the Adani mine site in late January. The statement from Shorten\u2019s office does not deny Cousins\u2019 detailed account of events from last December through to last weekend which the former president of the Australian Conservation Foundation shared with Guardian Australia on Wednesday. It confirms that Shorten requested a briefing from the Australian Conservation Foundation and Cousins on the Great Barrier Reef and their views on the proposed Adani coalmine. \u201cThis occurred in Queensland last month,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThey provided a valuable perspective on the reef and the mine. Bill really appreciated the time and effort they gave informing him of all the environmental issues\u201d. \u201cThe visit renewed Bill\u2019s convictions on the importance of protecting the reef and the environment\u201d. Cousins says Shorten reached out in December and then remained in contact throughout January and this month. According to Cousins, Shorten signalled his support for Labor revoking Adani\u2019s licence based on concern about the impact of the project on the reef, on groundwater and endangered species. Again, according to Cousins\u2019 account \u2013 not contradicted by the Labor leader \u2013 Shorten first signalled to him that Labor would adopt that position imminently, and then asked for more time because he\u2019d met internal resistance, before declining to clarify what position the ALP would adopt. The statement from Shorten\u2019s office reiterates the fact the Labor leader is \u201cdeeply sceptical of the proposed Adani coalmine\u201d. \u201cHe believes if it cannot stack up environmentally or commercially, it should not go ahead. So far it hasn\u2019t, and he doesn\u2019t believe it will,\u201d the statement says. The statement also downplays the input from Cousins and the ACF. \u201cBill has sought lots of feedback on the proposed mine\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s spent a lot of time in regional Queensland hearing different views \u2013 from coalminers, conservationists, landowners and scientists,\u201d the statement says. \u201cHe also held three town hall meetings last week in Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton to hear from locals\u201d. The Turnbull government has gone on the offensive against Shorten for delivering different messages to different constituencies, and for being \u201ctwo faced\u201d \u2013 and the Greens will also attack Labor in the Batman byelection, which is due on 17 March. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said on Thursday Labor needed to adopt a clear position on the project, as Bob Hawke did on the Franklin dam. \u201cShorten needs to make an unequivocal statement, that Labor won\u2019t let that mine proceed, and we are prepared to rip up contracts,\u201d the Greens leader said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Bill Shorten needs to say\u201d. Labor has been divided internally about how hard to go against Adani. Some favour the Cousins position, others think that will cost Labor political support in Queensland. As well as the political calculations, there have also been internal concerns about the viability of legal avenues to stop the project. Legal advice sought by the Australian Conservation Foundation argues the commonwealth environment minister has discretion to revoke the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act approval for Adani \u201con at least two grounds\u201d. The first ground would be \u201cnew information of the consecutive bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, indicating increased sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions\u201d and the second would be \u201cnew information of the insufficiency of offsets for the endangered black-throated finch, indicating a threat to the continued survival of the species from the Carmichael project\u201d. The legal advice from the Environmental Defenders Office in Queensland argues the revocation would not trigger a sovereign risk issue, or leave the government exposed to a compensation claim from the company, because the power in section 145 of the EPBC Act to revoke an approval \u201cis clear and unambiguous, and is essential for the minister to protect the environment from significant impacts not assessed prior to an approval being granted\u201d. The ACF advice says the power of revocation under section 145 of the EPBC Act \u201cis not properly considered the acquisition of property and therefore does not attract the obligation to pay compensation\u201d. But some in Labor think that legal opinion is overly optimistic, and there has been internal resistance to inserting a \u201cclimate trigger\u201d within the EPBC Act because that could be a mechanism to shut down the coal industry in Australia. The CFMEU warned Shorten against adopting a hardline on Adani on the basis that it would trigger a divisive debate inside the party and the labour movement about the future of coal.",

They are compiled by the company secretary, or stand-in, with all directors given the opportunity to check for accuracy afterwards. And what do minutes of Carillion\u2019s board meeting on 5 July last year show? Self-delusion on a scale that, outside the banking sector circa 2008, would be hard to believe at a public company employing tens of thousands of workers. Of all the pieces of evidence unearthed by the two select committees of MPs, these minutes may be the most damning. The scene was the board\u2019s receipt of the devastating news that Morgan Stanley, the company\u2019s joint corporate broker, was no longer prepared to underwrite a cash-raising rights issue that had been under preparation since May. Peter Moorhouse from Morgan Stanley delivered the bleak message in person. The size of the bad contracts \u2013 to be revealed the following week as a \u00a3845m provision \u2013 was too great. The investment case was \u201cinsufficient to support an underwriting\u201d. New investors \u201cwould not be convinced\u201d. Morgan Stanley\u2019s investment committee would not sign off. This should have been a neon-lit warning to the directors that Carillion was in deep financial trouble. Hedge funds, remember, had been shorting the shares for months. Now quick access to new equity was being turned off. The board\u2019s reaction was extraordinary. First, the minutes show, the directors asked no questions of Moorhouse. None. Instead, when Morgan Stanley\u2019s man had left the room, Carillion\u2019s bosses agreed that their advisers were being terribly unreasonable. Moorhouse\u2019s rationale was \u201cnot credible given that there had been no obvious change to the market position, the position of the business or its prospects\u201d since May. Carillion chairman Philip Green, displaying monumental levels of optimism, went on to say that work continued towards a \u201cpositive and upbeat announcement\u201d the following Monday. The directors then resolved to dump Morgan Stanley \u2013 as plain a case of shooting the messenger as you\u2019ll see. As it happens, when the huge write-offs were unveiled on the Monday, chief executive Richard Howson was stood down, suggesting Green was becoming dimly aware that Carillion faced a crisis of credibility, to put it mildly. In truth, though, these minutes point to a deep cause of Carillion\u2019s collapse: the directors were incapable of recognising bad news even when it was served up to them. ITV needs something, but is it a \u2018refresh\u2019? The bidding battle for Sky \u201cshows how much money there is around and how valuable content businesses and broadcast businesses are\u201d, argued Carolyn McCall, eight weeks into her new job as chief executive of ITV. Well, up to a point. None of the excitement around Sky has rubbed off the Coronation Street broadcaster\u2019s share price. ITV sits at 160p, down 8% on Wednesday, versus a peak of 260p in 2015. McCall\u2019s \u201crefresh\u201d of ITV\u2019s strategy is a work in progress, but the five-year run of special dividends for shareholders is over. Does that imply an investment splurge, as some investors clearly fear, or just a tightening of predecessor Adam Crozier\u2019s approach? It\u2019s hard to tell, but some form of wet towel is clearly required. ITV\u2019s advertising revenues fell in 2017 for the second year in a row \u2013 by a thumping 5%. Top-line profits also dropped 5%, to \u00a3842m, the first decline on that measure since the bad old days of 2009. Neither fall implies a crisis, since ITV\u2019s near-monopoly on free-to-air commercial TV advertising slots remains a valuable asset. But Netflix et al are changing viewing habits and also the definition of a large programming budget. Sky, supposedly, is too small to stand alone in the today\u2019s international world of TV giants, but will still be sold for \u00a322bn-plus. So where does that leave ITV, worth \u00a36.5bn? Outgunned, or more nimble? McCall\u2019s refresh needs to answer the question. But, if investment needs to be ramped up, go for it. This is supposed to be a golden age for television. Shine on, you Jamie Dimon Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, thinks shareholder meetings are \u201ca complete waste of time\u201d and have been \u201chijacked by people who have only political interests and don\u2019t have any interest in the future health of the company\u201d. He should pipe down. One reason why special-interest groups have alighted on annual meetings is that they offer a rare chance to penetrate the corporate bubble.

      "bodyText": "The UK government must put the car industry at the heart of Brexit negotiations or risk the loss of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of pounds of investment, MPs have warned. In a gloomy assessment of prospects for UK car manufacturing, the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) select committee said Brexit was negative for the sector, with \u201cdamage limitation\u201d the best possible outcome. The committee said the survival of volume car manufacturing in the UK would depend on the government\u2019s ability to secure the closest possible relationship with the existing EU regulatory and trading framework. A no-deal scenario would be disastrous for jobs and investment, it warned. \u201cThe car industry is one of the UK\u2019s great manufacturing successes,\u201d said Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the BEIS committee. \u201cInnovative and efficient car plants across the country provide thousands of jobs and the automotive sector is a major contributor to our economic growth. \u201cThere is no credible argument to suggest there are advantages to be gained from Brexit for the UK car industry.

      "bodyText": "New data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that the hurdle of getting into work is a high one for many and that, overwhelmingly, full-time work is going to those already working rather than to new entrants into the labour force or the unemployed. One of the problems with the monthly labour force figures is they don\u2019t really show just how much change occurs. When you hear stories of a company employing 100 new staff or, conversely, retrenching a similar number what is often not understood is just how many people each month get and lose jobs. Over the past 12 months, on average, 82,640 people went from being employed in one month to being unemployed in the following month \u2013 either due to retrenchment or by choice. And at the same time, about 117,500 people went from being unemployed one month to being employed the next month: While this is going on there are also nearly half a million people either moving from being employed to leaving the labour force (due to retirement, raising children, going back to education, health or any other reason) or shifting from not being in the labour force to being employed (due to leaving school, going back to work after raising children, etc). But while these are large numbers that give some context whenever any politicians boast or criticises a policy that will deliver (or lose) X number of jobs, as a rule what your labour force status is this month greatly determines what you\u2019ll be doing next month. About 93% of people employed full-time one month will be so employed in the following month; similarly, 82% of those employed part-time this month will be in the same employment next month \u2013 with 11% moving into full-time employment: And while more people go into employment from outside the labour force than they do from being unemployed, just over a quarter of unemployed were not in the labour force a month ago. But where the overall percentage movement each month from employment to unemployment and vice-versa is rather small, we can see big changes when we look at more long-term periods. This week the ABS, as part of its Australian Census Longitudinal Dataset, has released data that tracks the movement of people aged 15-59 in 2011 in and out of the labour force from 2011 to 2016. As expected, most of those employed (89%) in 2011 were still employed five years later. But such workers were more likely to be employed full-time than those newly arrived into the labour force. Currently, around 51% of all people aged 15-64 are employed full-time, whereas 61% of people who were employed in 2011 were working full-time in 2016: This suggests that the growth of part-time employment has mostly been for new entrants. This is also reflected in the changes in status of those people who were unemployed in 2011. Of those who were looking for work in 2011, only 32% were working full-time in 2016. As with overall employment, women who were unemployed in 2011 were more likely to be working part-time in 2016 than were men in the same situation. And while women were less likely to be still unemployed, they were more likely to have left the labour force: For those who were not in the labour force in 2011 the situation is even more stark. Only 17% were working full-time in 2016, and 21% were working part-time. Just over half of those not in the labour force in 2011 were still in such a status five years later, and 7.4% were unemployed: But when we look at the level of full-time employment among only those who were employed in 2016, the difference becomes even more clear. In 2016, around 66% of all those with a job were employed full-time, but a mere 55% of those who were unemployed in 2011 and had work in 2016 were employed full-time. Even worse is that only 43% of those who were outside the labour force in 2011 but were employed in 2016 were in full-time work. Also evident from the data is the difficulty of getting into work when unemployed. The unemployment rate in 2016 of those who had work in 2011 was just 3.6%, compared with the overall rate of 5.9%. Whereas the unemployment rate in 2016 of those who were unemployed in 2011 was a whopping 22.3%: One other difference that is quite clear from the data is the employment status of those by the type of school they attended. Of those who attended public school in 2011, 69% were employed five years later, compared with 77% of those who attended a Catholic school and 72% of those who went to a non-Catholic private school. Those who attended non-public schools were also much more likely to be employed and still studying: Those who attended public school in 2011 were also more likely to be either not in the labour force or unemployed than those who attended private school. While a similar percentage of public school and non-Catholic private school attendees from 2011 were out of the labour force in 2016, many more of those from private schools were still studying compared with those from the public school, who were more likely to be neither studying nor in the labour force. The long-term data give us some good insight into the labour force that we don\u2019t get from the monthly snapshot. Rather than just look at employment by gender, age and state, the long-term data show the importance of your current work status on the likelihood of being employed in the future. Entrants into the workforce have a much tougher time getting a full-time job than do those who are already employed, suggesting that a high proportion of part-time work is going to younger people and those returning to work, and that any growth in full-time work is overwhelmingly going to those already employed.
