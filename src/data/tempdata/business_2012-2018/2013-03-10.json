    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With the UK economy going sideways and continental Europe in the doldrums, all eyes are on the US. It could be a \"breakout\" year. That's the phrase used by a respected group of analysts at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who believe the US economy, after years spent taxiing down the runway, is about to take off. Friday's jobs numbers, which showed the unemployment rate tumbling to 7.7% from 7.9%, added to the growing euphoria. Such is the momentum that many who make their money on the US stock market are preparing for the day when the Federal Reserve stops pumping money into the economy. Before too long, they argue, it will even be forced to raise interest rates. According to analysts at fund manager M&amp;G the 236,000 extra jobs the US added in February will bring the unemployment rate down to 6.5% by the summer of 2014. The 6.5% number is important because that is the level Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, has made his target before he turns off the money taps. The central bank is currently buying in $85bn (\u00a357bn) of assets a month. In theory, stock markets that have risen on the back of central bank pump priming will cope with the decline in quantitative easing by switching their focus to the resurgence in growth. Like drug addicts who find their supply lines cut, they will stay happy by mainlining the next best thing \u2013 a booming economy based on rising property values and consumer borrowing. But before criticising the nature of that US boom, which would appear to be storing up the same problems that led to the sub-prime crisis, we should consider how likely it is that market theory will become market fact. Fox News, CNBC and Bloomberg TV have spent much of the last four years parading a succession of pundits, analysts and economists who insist that the Federal Reserve's $2trn injection of funds under its quantitative easing policy will eventually create hyper-inflation. The argument runs that when growth returns, today's pessimist investors will switch to optimists, and far from releasing a steady trickle of private sector funds back into the market, the switch will release a tidal wave. Investment funds that have sat on the sidelines will want to splurge their reserves on all manner of assets. Borrowing will become ridiculously easy again, encouraging consumers to spend on credit. Surely such a wall of money, which will push demand far in excess of supply, must create inflation? The same debate is happening in the UK, where some monetarists believe the extent of the downturn has been exaggerated by official statistics. In fact, they argue, growth is just around the corner \u2013 and growth will be quickly followed by runaway inflation. The former Bank of England official Andrew Sentance is one of a select band who have spent recent weeks picking through official data in an attempt to show last year's double dip recession was nothing of the kind and the prospect of a triple dip is fanciful. Simon Ward of Henderson Investors, in particular, uses some fancy footwork to strip out oil and gas from the output figures (they are both in a steep decline) \u2013 the result is to show the rest of the economy is not so bad. He also points to figures showing record employment levels as a strong signal of economic health. But economists including Paul Krugman, the Princeton professor and Nobel prize winner, are sceptical. Looking at the US, he argues that the level of Fed spending is dwarfed by the amount of money withdrawn from the economy in the last four years as companies and households have paid down debts. He also ridicules those who talk up the economy and claim it is back to its pre-crash vibrancy. Looking at the jobs numbers is a good start. The official 7.7% unemployment rate excludes the huge numbers of people who have withdrawn from the labour market, either to care for people who are no longer supported by welfare, or because they cannot find a job. On this view the real unemployment rate is more than 11%. Even taking the official figure as accurate, Krugman argues it is significantly higher than historical norms and far from any notional level of full employment. Krugman and his supporters also recommend switching focus from the ups and downs of Wall St to consider the economic conditions on Main Street, where they see few signs of life. In much of the US, demand would need to rocket before it started to bid up the price of goods and trigger inflation. With so many workers on short shifts or zero-hour contracts that mean they work mostly part time, there is plenty of slack to use up before wages start to rise and push up production costs. Let's be clear, the average US worker has failed to win a real-terms, inflation-busting pay rise in about 30 years and there is no sign of them winning one any time soon. Much the same can be said in the UK. Analysts at Capital Economics believe the gap between the supply of labour and demand remains large enough for the Bank of England to maintain QE until the end of 2015 when it will have soared from the current \u00a3375bn to \u00a3500bn. If market theory says prices jump when employment reaches capacity and wages rise, then with 2.5 million unemployed the time for a price jump is a decade in the future. But what about Simon Ward's point about record levels of employment? Well that only comes about because the UK's population is rising. Taken as a whole, the UK has more people in some kind of work than ever before, but as a proportion of the workforce, we are still well short of the 2007 peak. Sometimes it is best to get away from the figures and relate the stories of businesses that want to expand. In the US there are fewer blockages in the financial system standing in the way of small businesses asking to borrow. The Obama administration pumped excessive amounts of funds into the banks following the Lehman's crash, not just relying on QE to bolster confidence and re-invigorate a bustling economy. That said, Obama has bent to Congress's demands for public spending cuts, which have restricted public investment and prolonged the recovery. The crucial mistake made in the UK was to balk at a full bailout of the banks. A loathing of bankers stymied efforts to give them the necessary cash, whether through full nationalisations or massive high-interest loans as in the US. Now it is they who stand between small UK businesses and essential funds for investment. George Osborne's marriage of weak banks with a warm embrace for austerity has delivered the worst of all worlds. No wonder his ratings are plummeting. If the budget on 20 March does anything, it must tackle these twin problems. In the bad times only the government has the resources to rebuild confidence. Bizarrely, in the home of free market capitalism across the Atlantic, enough policymakers understood this fact. It is better to argue over the nature of a recovery than not have one at all.",

      "bodyText": "Like Fight Club, the first rule of finance is you don't talk about finance. Hence the views of the bankers expressed here \u2013 asked about how the EU bonus cap will affect the City \u2013 are anonymous. What's more, as the financial sector is huge and hugely diverse, it the cap will affect different people differently, depending on their activity, rank and their bank's nationality. It was striking how virtually every interviewee professed great confidence that their bank would find a way around any new rules. Equally striking was just how depressed the atmosphere in large areas of the major banks seems to be these days. But perhaps most surprising was that even those in favour of more stringent regulation \u2013 of whom there are more than you might think \u2013 were in near-unanimous agreement that this cap was not helpful. What we need is \"smart weapons\" specifically targeting the toxic corners of finance, they said; what we get is carpet-bombing. Equity sales (director level) at major bank (male, mid 40s) People on the trading floor talk about the cap, absolutely. There is an understanding that the political class must be seen to be doing something. But this idea that all investment bankers are the same, that our only wish in life is to take as much risk as we can, all for that number on bonus day \u2026 I am in equity, meaning we recommend and trade shares for institutional investors. There is no risk I could take, even if I wanted to, in order to increase revenue. It's all just bloody hard work. I hear colleagues wonder: if Mr Brussels cuts my pay to such a degree, do I still want to deal with the pressure, still put in the hours where I get up at 5am and not leave the office before 8pm? There is great confidence that banks will find ways around this, though \u2013 they always do. I hear people talk about setting up their own company and contracting themselves out to the bank. Financial recruiter (male, early 30s) Clients I talk to were genuinely shocked when the news came out. They were expecting a cap of maybe three times salary. Everyone is sticking their heads in the sand, for now. Still, what are people's options? If you are a bog-standard trader you make maybe \u00a3400k, of which \u00a3150k is base pay. With this cap that goes to \u00a3300k. So after tax you get \u00a350k less. Are you really going to move to New York or Asia for \u00a350k? Senior people have families; it's not only money. Also, if you are trading European markets from New York, that means the night desk for you, with the time difference. All the talent is in London. If, as a bank or hedge fund, you move to a much smaller centre and you need to fill a role, your options are so much more limited. People like London. Maybe not now, after four months of rain and cold, but this is a nice place to live. No one really knows about this EU cap. We hear it is postponed to 2014 and there's lots of confusion still. Banks are all working for ways around it so I'm sure I won't be as bad as people say. Then again, mate, the market is fucked. No one has any visibility, comps [pay] are tumbling, caps everywhere. The industry is on its knees. By \"no visibility\" I mean as in people work hard but have no idea if they will get paid, if markets will really improve, if industry is fundamentally changing etc. These guys are not used to be in the dark like that. It is quite telling that everyone is depressed and worried yet no one seems to know where we're heading. Early signs of optimism \u2013 \"it will all be OK eventually\" \u2013 have all but disappeared. Investment strategist at boutique firm (male, early 30s) This is obviously good for smaller boutiques who are unlikely to be affected by these regulations and can pay in hard cash \u2013 such as ourselves! The public seem to see bonuses as rewards for exceptional performance but, really, they are more about giving banks flexibility. I think the cap is likely to push up salaries, making the business model of large banks even more unstable and susceptible to economic swings. It is so much harder to lower salaries. Because if it were easy to adjust base pay, it would become almost, well, a bonus? Ultimately the only solution to systemic risk is to break apart the big banks and remove any sort of government backstop. Former structured products builder at major bank (male, late 30s) I don't think I would have left if the bonus cap had come into effect during my time at the bank. I have always been grateful for what I was getting. I'd say we'd have lost 10-20% of our staff \u2026 Younger people don't mind moving, but I have a family. I wouldn't have liked to work in the US and Asia is too far away. I would work with trading floors in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavia. Traders there get a really good salary, for local standards, but a bonus of maybe 25-75%, max. The atmosphere is quite different from London. So, yes, huge bonuses create a bonus culture. Still, many of these European banks blew up. What will happen with the cap: the greedy talent will go into hedge funds and private equity. That's where the real money is. And hedge funds and PE are still virtually unregulated. Managing director (advisory) at major European bank (male, late 40s) Base salaries have doubled or tripled over the past years, making bonuses less important. Still, without a bonus I'd have to sell my house, eventually. Also, there are school fees. Many people are in this position. I am in \"advisory\", acting as middleman between corporations in need of loans and investors looking for a place to put their money. I work hard, sometimes coming home at 6am, just when my wife wakes up. I am confident the bank will continue to find ways to pay us what we deserve. If not I will have to reconsider my options. Leave Europe, leave banking. The thing is, my clients are in Europe and I need to see them in person, regularly. Flying in and out from the US or Asia just doesn't work. Setting up a boutique would save me from all the compliance; with all the new regulation this is now taking insane amounts of time. But striking out for myself doesn't work either, as my clients want access to a big balance sheet. Corporate finance analyst at partially state-owned bank (female, mid 20s) Your bonus is your job, they have told us at the bank. Seriously, what can we do? There just aren't any jobs to go to. My base salary is \u00a345k. Bonuses? Well, for people like us it's maybe a few percent, which makes us, let's say, not overly concerned with the bonus cap; what's there to cap? Yes, I make twice what a policeman makes; then again, I work twice his hours. If he takes two jobs, we make the same. Quite apart from any bonus cap, there is now a deep and growing divide between the American giants who can still pay big bucks for the best talent, and the other big banks. Maybe Deutsche Bank can cling on; the rest of us in Europe and Britain now are decidedly in the second league. Barclays can keep up, perhaps. We'll see. Vice-president at cash equities firm (male, 30s) I am a basically leftwing guy and this cap is pissing me off a lot more than I thought it would. My income won't be affected but it's a measure that makes basically no sense at all except as a bunch of politicians wanting to generate headlines by doing a high-profile \"screw you\" to an unpopular constituency. This cap is going to move activity out of the regulated sector. Why are bonuses so important to us? When you're all in by 2pm and you've made 90 phone calls on a deal, the thing that gets you to make 50 more is the fact that the team all know that we need to put in the effort and we'll all get paid. It's an awful thing to see, the way that the wind goes out of a dealing floor at some point in the year when it becomes clear that [usually because of a loss somewhere else in the bank] the pool is gone.\" Managing director on trading floor of US bank in London, (female, late 30s) People are so battered by the recent waves of redundancies that they seem to have simply put the bonus cap on to one side. Recently we lost over 25% of people at my level, so if you ask around about a cap that may go into effect in 2014, they will [say]: let's see if I'm still around by then. Generally speaking, people expect our bank to find a way. If we can come up with solutions for the new Basel III capital rules and all the other regulation, then we'll work something out. What seems sure, though, is that the \"global heads\" who are not tied to Europe will all move back to the United States. Derivatives trader at major bank (male, early 40s) This cap threatens to affect me considerably, yes. I took this job under the assumption that at some point in the future I will be making several multiples of my salary. The cap puts that under threat. It's ridiculous to think that a cap stops risk-taking. You want traders to be as aggressive as they can and make the bank as much money as possible, within their risk limits. Traders are like tigers, and their risk limits their cages. It's about policing those cages. Risk management needs to be independent, meaning traders' bosses can't overrule them. Remuneration is becoming so complex. Part of your pay is deferred stock, so you need to ask: how will the bank perform overall? Are you at a subsidiary or the parent company, and how far is one from the other? These days a job interview is really a two-way affair. Does the bank want you, and do you want the bank? Former Treasury officer in bailed-out bank (male, early 50s) Back when I was at the bank, the bonus drove you to take risk and make money, and it was a symbol of the \"big swinging dick\". Looking at how people reacted to the bonus austerity after 2008, there was a sense of the remuneration not being sufficient to entice you out of bed in the morning. So were an effective cap to induce a sense of lethargy, then it would serve to reduce risk taking. An effective bonus cap in 2008 and before might have helped, at the margin. But in my understanding the cap is only restricting the short-term cash element. If stock markets reward high profits and risk with a higher share price, then management at these banks who receive large stock-related bonuses will still have an incentive to take risk.

      "standfirst": "About this time last year, Bob Diamond's pay package seemed to have triggered a new anger in investors. Looking back now, it seems the headlines were better than the reality", 
      "body": "<p>The anniversary of the start of the so-called shareholder spring happens about now. A year ago, it was the publication of Barclays' annual report that gave the first hint that something might be up: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-pay\" title=\"\">the revelation that the bank had paid the \u00a35.7m tax bill of then chief executive Bob Diamond </a>astonished even those hardened to bankers' self-serving definitions of fair rewards. A showdown of some sort seemed to be on the cards.</p> <p>A year on, the shareholder spring feels less exciting than it did at the time. Diamond has gone \u2013 not for any pay outrages but because of the Libor scandal that broke a few months later \u2013 and the amazement now lies in the fact that only 27% of Barclays' shareholders voted against the pay report.</p> <p>Antony Jenkins, the new chief executive, and Sir David Walker, the new chairman, have virtually acknowledged that pay practices at Barclays must be reformed more quickly. All that has really happened is that something closer to common sense has prevailed. And there's still a long way to go: Barclays's song is less shrill than in the past, but the \u00a31m-plus bonuses are still flowing even as its performance, measured by return on shareholders' equity, remains sub-par.</p> <p>Or look at the direct casualties of the spring, like Andrew Moss at Aviva. How on earth, we now wonder, did he survive so long? The new boss of the giant insurer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/07/aviva-no-bonuses-executive-pay-freeze\" title=\"\">cut the dividend by 44% last week</a>, admitting in effect that Aviva had been paying out sums it could not afford. And then remember that Moss received a 90% vote in favour of his re-election as a director, as pusillanimous investors instead registered unhappiness by voting against the pay report. Calling that a rebellion was an exaggeration. It was more an embarrassed cough on the part of City investors at Aviva's plunging share price.</p> <p>Indeed, various studies of what happened last spring make the entire show appear stronger on headlines than on substance. Out of a sample of just over 300 annual meetings, the average vote against pay reports was 7.64% in the first six months of 2012, compared to 6.1% in the same period a year earlier, according to a study by Pirc, the independent investment consultancy. Pirc also compared 234&#xa0;companies' results with the year before, showing that the level of abstentions dropped by 0.5% and the average opposition vote rose by only 1.5%. That's not a big deal.</p> <p>Fair Pensions concluded at the end of the spring that while the remuneration defeats had had a \"significant impact,\" they did not \"represent a sea change in investor attitudes either to stewardship generally or remuneration practice in particular\".</p> <p>But maybe last year's stirrings were just the start. Could this year's round of annual meetings be the moment when City fund managers discover real backbone?</p> <p>Don't hold your breath. Share prices are rising \u2013 the FTSE 100 index hit a five-year high last week \u2013 and there's nothing like a sense of greater financial wellbeing to make confrontations with the board feel like tomorrow's problem. Vince Cable's proposal for a binding vote on pay was not embraced by the majority of City institutions. In the end, it became a fudge whereby binding votes will be held every three years rather than annually.</p> <p>An optimist might conclude that the mere threat of an explosion over pay has concentrated minds among non-executive directors; for example, after a year of heavy losses, International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, gave chief executive Willie Walsh no bonus last year. A realist would fear that this spring will fail to build on last year's. Expect occasional outbreaks of excitement \u2013 but little change to overall voting patterns.</p> <h2>Newcomers find it hard to loosen big banks' grip</h2> <p>George Osborne insisted in a recent speech that \"it verges on an oligopoly\". He was referring to the oft-cited fact that 75% of all personal current accounts are in the hands of just four banks \u2013 HSBC, Barclays, and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group.</p> <p>\"I want new faces on the high street,\" the chancellor said, echoing the sentiments of his predecessors, whatever their political hue, over the decades.

      "bodyText": "The anniversary of the start of the so-called shareholder spring happens about now. A year ago, it was the publication of Barclays' annual report that gave the first hint that something might be up: the revelation that the bank had paid the \u00a35.7m tax bill of then chief executive Bob Diamond astonished even those hardened to bankers' self-serving definitions of fair rewards. A showdown of some sort seemed to be on the cards. A year on, the shareholder spring feels less exciting than it did at the time. Diamond has gone \u2013 not for any pay outrages but because of the Libor scandal that broke a few months later \u2013 and the amazement now lies in the fact that only 27% of Barclays' shareholders voted against the pay report. Antony Jenkins, the new chief executive, and Sir David Walker, the new chairman, have virtually acknowledged that pay practices at Barclays must be reformed more quickly. All that has really happened is that something closer to common sense has prevailed. And there's still a long way to go: Barclays's song is less shrill than in the past, but the \u00a31m-plus bonuses are still flowing even as its performance, measured by return on shareholders' equity, remains sub-par. Or look at the direct casualties of the spring, like Andrew Moss at Aviva. How on earth, we now wonder, did he survive so long? The new boss of the giant insurer cut the dividend by 44% last week, admitting in effect that Aviva had been paying out sums it could not afford. And then remember that Moss received a 90% vote in favour of his re-election as a director, as pusillanimous investors instead registered unhappiness by voting against the pay report. Calling that a rebellion was an exaggeration. It was more an embarrassed cough on the part of City investors at Aviva's plunging share price. Indeed, various studies of what happened last spring make the entire show appear stronger on headlines than on substance. Out of a sample of just over 300 annual meetings, the average vote against pay reports was 7.64% in the first six months of 2012, compared to 6.1% in the same period a year earlier, according to a study by Pirc, the independent investment consultancy. Pirc also compared 234 companies' results with the year before, showing that the level of abstentions dropped by 0.5% and the average opposition vote rose by only 1.5%. That's not a big deal. Fair Pensions concluded at the end of the spring that while the remuneration defeats had had a \"significant impact,\" they did not \"represent a sea change in investor attitudes either to stewardship generally or remuneration practice in particular\". But maybe last year's stirrings were just the start. Could this year's round of annual meetings be the moment when City fund managers discover real backbone? Don't hold your breath. Share prices are rising \u2013 the FTSE 100 index hit a five-year high last week \u2013 and there's nothing like a sense of greater financial wellbeing to make confrontations with the board feel like tomorrow's problem. Vince Cable's proposal for a binding vote on pay was not embraced by the majority of City institutions. In the end, it became a fudge whereby binding votes will be held every three years rather than annually. An optimist might conclude that the mere threat of an explosion over pay has concentrated minds among non-executive directors; for example, after a year of heavy losses, International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, gave chief executive Willie Walsh no bonus last year. A realist would fear that this spring will fail to build on last year's. Expect occasional outbreaks of excitement \u2013 but little change to overall voting patterns. Newcomers find it hard to loosen big banks' grip George Osborne insisted in a recent speech that \"it verges on an oligopoly\". He was referring to the oft-cited fact that 75% of all personal current accounts are in the hands of just four banks \u2013 HSBC, Barclays, and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. \"I want new faces on the high street,\" the chancellor said, echoing the sentiments of his predecessors, whatever their political hue, over the decades. He sounded just like Alistair Darling in 2009, who said: \"If you get more banks, then that will drive down the cost of borrowing, it will provide more credit and I think it will be far better for us all round.\" One of the newer faces is Virgin Money, to which the government sold the \"good\" part of Northern Rock in January last year with the hope of injecting more competition into the moribund market.

      "bodyText": "Fashionistas queuing round the block, a sell-out designer collection and breathless reviews by the style press. Can this really be John Lewis? As 84,700 partners working at the department stores celebrate their 17% bonus this weekend, they can rest assured they are back in fashion in a big way. A 9% rise in clothing sales helped drive a bumper year for John Lewis as it increased its market share, mainly at Marks &amp; Spencer's expense. The chain accounted for 2.1% of the UK clothing market in 2012, according to retail analysts Verdict, 10% up on a year before. Once associated with sensible knitwear and cosy slippers, the 40-store chain has polished up its fashion credentials through designer collaborations, classy own-label products and the addition of upmarket brands that had previously steered clear of the store. As a result, fashion sales topped \u00a31.1bn last year \u2013 up from about \u00a3700m in 2005. That's still only about a quarter of what Marks &amp; Spencer sells, but it indicates the kind of growth that rivals can only dream of in the economic downturn. Under the guidance of buying and brand director Peter Ruis, who took charge of fashion in 2007, John Lewis has created a buzz by recognising that shoppers of all ages now want to look trendy \u2013 and that older customers no longer want gold buttons and elasticated waistbands. Sitting in the John Lewis Christmas room surrounded by some very classy Alice Temperley lingerie as well as cute sparkly kids' dresses \u2013 and, of course, an array of tweed slippers \u2013 Ruis says: \"Everything's ageless these days.\" John Lewis's Somerset by Alice Temperley range is a case in point. Now in its second season, the British designer's collection is already the store's biggest own-label and its fastest-selling brand ever. But the fashionistas who line up outside the Oxford Street store and battle for popular items online form a broad church. \"We see people in their 50s and 60s wearing it, as well as people in their 20s,\" Ruis says. Its new Kin brand also takes on that concept. Its collection of simple, relatively low-cost pieces includes outfits for children similar to those aimed at their parents and grandparents. Anyway, Ruis says, the department store's fans have been misidentified for years: \"Historically we have been told that our customers are more affluent and a bit older, but increasingly our research has shown that to be a bit simplistic.\" He says John Lewis has strong market share in all age groups over 25, with a particular \"sweet spot\" among 35-to-44-year-olds. That demographic includes trendy urbanites who go to John Lewis to buy an iPad and stop to buy some clothes too. The store's combination of homewares, technology, beauty and fashion has, Ruis says, been vital in helping the business through tough times on the high street. Instead of worrying about ageing shoppers, he sees an opportunity in the fact that people feel less defined by their age: \"The 40s and 50s are the prime of life. People are having kids later, and taking out mortgages later.\" A stylish and well-groomed 44 with three children aged between four and 11, Ruis is a good example of that modern John Lewis customer. He believes the generation that grew up loving brands such as Topshop, Whistles, Ted Baker and Topman don't feel the need to swap to the classic labels that once formed the backbone of a typical department store. So in the past seven years, John Lewis has edited out traditional, conservative labels such as German brand Basler and British \"mother-of-the-bride\" classics Jacques Vert and Alexon, and transformed itself into a kind of indoor high street, but with a grown-up aesthetic. Ruis say the company works closely with brands to ensure their stock reflects what its customers want: \"It's less likely to be the most overt partygoing outfit of a 16-to-24-year-old. Those shoppers have less income, and the higher cost of going to university means there is less and less business there anyway.\" John Lewis fashion floors now mix the likes of Jaeger, Hobbs, Mango and Whistles with smaller brands such as Toast and Fenn Wright Manson. Prices have stretched up to Ralph Lauren levels, and down to the cheaper Kin. Somerset and Kin are the department store's newest and most adventurous creations, designed to suit a different kind of customer from those who would wear the classic John Lewis Collection or John Lewis &amp; Co menswear. \"We have now started to find our feet on own brands. In the first few years we were getting the core range right, but last year we got a bit more feisty and fun,\" Ruis says. \"We have taken the customer with us, and the more fashionable we get, the more interested they become.\" He predicts that own-label will move up from about 30% of John Lewis fashion sales today to 35% or 40% as Somerset and Kin expand. This autumn, there will be a 50% bigger range of Kin clothing in stores and Somerset will expand into lingerie for Christmas, as well as cashmere, kidswear and even, eventually, home textiles and electricals. Ruis is also in talks about bringing in a new designer name for menswear but says that despite the success of the Temperley range, he won't be signing a whole catwalk of collaborators, Debenhams-style. \"I'd hate to have 20 or 30 of them and lose our point of view,\" Ruis says. The Temperley range hasn't been the only hot success. Ruis says sales of John Lewis &amp; Co menswear shot up 20% after advertising featuring a long-haired bearded model proved controversial. A certain newspaper may have described the model as a \"gingery tramp\", but Ruis says shoppers were won over by the clothing, and menswear sales increased faster than womenswear over the year. Ruis, clad in a slimline Burberry Prorsum suit with a Richard James shirt and Grenson shoes, says men are more interested in fashion than they ever used to be. While it was once accepted that 80% of men's clothes were bought by their partners and mums, now men in their 40s are happy to shop for themselves. \"There is no embarrassment about men's fashions now. We used to talk about the pub factor \u2013 a man didn't want people to point at what he was wearing, even if as a compliment. Like with men's moisturiser, it isn't an issue any more.\" Yet it's not even metrosexual urbanites who are the main drivers behind John Lewis's fashion explosion. What is? The internet, of course. Sales of clothing in stores rose 3% last year, thanks partly to additional floor space. There are plans to add a further 10% of fashion square-footage by 2020 as John Lewis puts fashion into more stores. But that is all small beer compared with online growth. In the year to 26 January, online fashion sales increased 41%, and the Temperley range sold three times as much on the internet as it did at the Oxford Street store. Ruis suggests it could have sold more had there been more stock in the warehouse. There is no doubt that John Lewis's highly effective online operation has brought the brand to a much wider customer base \u2013 people who would never have dreamed of buying their dream outfit in an emporium that also sells irons, bedlinen and curtain rails. Yet Ruis believes John Lewis has just discovered the fashion in its bones. He says it is the story of the partnership and the way thousands of workers get a share of profits that really helped him persuade fashion brands to give the department store a whirl. \"What John Lewis has is quirkiness. It is unorthodox with a slight eccentricity to it. Great British brands of 150 years old work really well with fashion. We have always had that tradition, whether it's Savile Row or Barbour. I always thought it could work well.\"",

      "bodyText": "When someone told me that Sir Mervyn King wanted to break up the bank, it was tempting to think he might be referring to the Bank of England. The governor has been put in an unenviable position by the way the chancellor has been so openly favouring his successor, Mark Carney, and King is becoming increasingly outspoken. The putative plot thickened when we learned that some RBS cash machines had seized up: but there is no evidence that this was the next move in the outgoing governor's welcome assault on RBS. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, we learned that the Carneyisation of monetary policy will be a central feature of the budget on 20 March. \"Osborne to hand Carney powers to kickstart economy,\" roared the Financial Times. It got better: \"George Osborne's budget will pave the way for Mark Carney, incoming Bank of England governor, to come to the rescue of the economy as the chancellor sets the scene for a new era of looser monetary policy.\" There you have it: such confidence! And what a magnificent example of the begged question \u2013 assuming what has yet to be proved! The chancellor's spinners are spinning out of control. By \"the chancellor\", I am of course referring to George Osborne and not to business secretary Vince Cable, who tried in last week's New Statesman to inject some fiscal sense into the coalition's lamentably misguided economic strategy. Many observers have been urging the government to take advantage of rock-bottom interest rates to raise investment and demand in an economy whose depression has outlasted that experienced in the 1930s. Although he posed the problem as a \"controversial\" question, Cable made it pretty clear that the government \"should borrow more, at current very low interest rates, in order to finance more capital spending\". The list of possible, indeed desirable, projects includes the building of schools and colleges and \"small\" road and rail developments. And then there is new housebuilding, which featured prominently in the economic recovery of the 1930s. The connection between the lack of housebuilding and the swelling bill for subsidised rents is all too obvious, and the blame for neglect of public-sector housing lies at the door of successive Conservative and Labour governments. Oh, sorry, I nearly forgot: this government, which is being so unpleasant towards the poor, is actually a coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. But back to the budget. Harold Macmillan \u2013 Conservative chancellor in 1956 and prime minister from 1957 to 1963 \u2013 is one of David Cameron's heroes. As housing minister in the early 1950s he was celebrated for presiding over a major building programme, and his target of 300,000 dwellings was indeed achieved. If he were here today and consulted about the economic impasse, he would almost certainly tell the prime minister to sack his chancellor \u2013 Macmillan himself had no compunction in these matters \u2013 conduct an unashamed U-turn, and abandon the policies that actually restrict the growth Cameron says he is aiming at. In preparing his budget speech, Osborne could do worse than refer to the one budget speech Macmillan himself delivered, on 17 April 1956. I would not recommend the two hours that Macmillan spent on his feet, but there are some great passages, including a quotation from the historian Macaulay's Essays to the effect that worries about debt and deficits go back centuries, yet \"on what principle is it that, when we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?\". There is an interesting contrast between then and now. As Macmillan said, \"monetary policy cannot 'go it alone'. It can only operate effectively in conjunction with fiscal and other measures \u2026\" Now, Macmillan was talking in 1956 about \"checking demand\". He said \"no one has yet found an easy way to restrict credit without higher interest rates\". Fast forward, and today he would be talking about the need to boost demand, and complaining that \"no one has yet found an easy way to boost credit with lower interest rates\". That is to say, thanks to the banking crisis and its repercussions, quantitative easing may be boosting asset prices but not the credit mechanism that boosts demand. Macmillan wanted to boost savings \u2013 and, memorably, introduced premium bonds. The current ineffective \"rebalancing exercise\" should be boosting spending, not savings. Which brings us to an important lecture last week by Dr Sushil Wadhwani, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, delivering the annual Peston lecture at Queen Mary, University of London. Addressing the question \"The great stagnation: what can policymakers do?\", Wadhwani proposes a fiscal boost via what he calls \"a money-financed fiscal expansion\" \u2013 vouchers to stimulate consumption and temporary tax incentives to promote investment. Personally, I would add a cut in VAT. Such a policy is known by economists as a \"helicopter drop\" \u2013 not manna from heaven, but money out of the blue. My question is: do we make enough helicopters these days?",
