      "bodyText": "Thousands of Phones 4u customers who signed cashback contracts or took out the firm's handset insurance were still waiting to hear on Tuesday whether these deals will be honoured. The retailer shut its 550 stores on Monday, hours before it was put into administration, leaving nearly 5,600 jobs under threat, as a row raged over who was to blame for the chain's demise. Evidence has emerged that in the runup to the retailer's collapse, a significant number of people took out mobile phone cashback deals where they would receive the money either in a single payment or instalments. As recently as last Saturday, Phones 4u was offering a \u00a350 payment on a future date to tempt customers on O2 or Three contracts to switch to Vodafone or EE. Others are apparently owed larger sums. One customer contacted the Guardian to say they had signed up for a contract in which they were due to be sent a cheque for \u00a340 every three months, and were still owed \u00a3160. Customers have been advised that any mobile contracts bought through Phones 4u in the past would remain unaffected and carry on as normal, because the contracts were with the major network operators. However, the cashback element was separate from these contracts and paid by Phones 4u. Before it was taken offline, the Phones 4u website carried small print stating that its redemption promotion \"is a Phones 4u offer and is separate from the contract agreed between you and your chosen network airtime provider\". Technically, these customers could end up becoming creditors of Phones 4u, and if that happens, it is far from clear how much, if any, of their money they would receive. Meanwhile, there was continuing uncertainty for thousands of customers paying for mobile phone insurance from Phones 4u and wondering whether their cover is now worthless. With many of the policies, customers have to take their handset into a Phones 4u shop to make a claim \u2013 and at the moment they are all shut, with no word yet on when, or if, they will reopen. The policies are administered by Policy Administration Services, a Phones 4u group company, which was expected to be put into administration on Tuesday. Customers who called the Policy Administration Services helpline to make a claim were met with a message stating: \"We are still unable to process your claim while we wait for instruction from the administrator, and we would kindly ask you to call us back at a later date.\" One member of staff at Policy Administration Services told the Guardian: \"It's very touch and go at the moment.

    "webTitle": "Inflation drops to 1.5% after fall in UK food and petrol prices", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fierce price wars between supermarkets helped push inflation further down last month but the drop is expected to bring only limited relief to households as wages continue to stall. Official figures showed a fall in food and petrol prices helped inflation drop to 1.5% in August from 1.6% in July, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI). But separate labour market figures released on Wednesday are expected to show average earnings in the three months from May to July were up by just 0.5% on a year ago, only a third of the pace of price inflation. The mismatch between pay and prices was evidence of the \"cost of living crisis\", the Labour party said. \"While this fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, the squeeze on working people continues,\" said the shadow Treasury minister Catherine McKinnell. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also showed the core measure of inflation, which excludes the more volatile items like food and energy, picked up to 1.9% from 1.8%. The wider retail prices index measure, used to set many pay deals, was down to 2.4% on the year, compared with 2.5% in July. Economists said the numbers suggested price pressures in the economy were benign, with CPI below the Bank of England's 2% target, and would mean the Bank would be in no hurry to raise interest rates. Its monetary policy committee (MPC) has held borrowing costs at a record low of 0.5% for more than five years. But a mixed picture of solid economic growth, falling inflation and uncertainty over the outcome of Thursday's Scotland referendum have made the timing of the first rate rise particularly hard to call. \"Inflation is still on a downward trend despite the economic recovery's strength,\" said Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \"Although the low inflation outlook is unlikely to prevent the MPC from raising interest rates entirely over the next couple of years, it should limit the speed at which they rise.\" The ONS said falling prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks were behind much of the slowdown in the main CPI measure of inflation. That echoed business reports indicating food prices have been falling as supermarkets use discounts to lure back customers from value stores Aldi and Lidl. With oil prices around two-year lows, cheaper fuel also helped bring down inflation last month. Petrol fell by 1.8p a litre between July and August, compared with a rise of 2p a litre last year, the ONS said. Offsetting some of those downward pressures were the prices of clothing, transport services and alcohol. The Treasury welcomed the latest figures. \"The government's long-term economic plan is working, with inflation falling by more than two-thirds since its peak in September 2011,\" said a spokesman. Ministers are likely to get another boost from Wednesday's labour market figures, which are forecast to show the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance falling below a million for the first time in six years. But the pay figures are likely to remain weak, with annual growth in average earnings recovering only slightly from a surprise drop in last month's data. Last week the Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, predicted interest rates would probably start to rise before real wage growth returned some time next summer. But economists said the squeeze on households would play some role in the outlook for borrowing costs. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"We suspect that low inflation, current very weak earnings growth and the increased downside risks to economic activity coming from heightened geopolitical tensions and stuttering eurozone economic activity will cause the Bank of England to hold off from acting until February at the earliest, even though current robust economic activity and markedly falling unemployment provides support to the case for a near-term interest rate hike. The British Chambers of Commerce said the inflation figures reinforced the case against an early rate rise. Chief economist David Kern said: \"The main priority for the MPC must be to nurture business confidence by offering the stability of working in a low interest rate environment",

      "bodyText": "Barclays, HSBC and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland are among 13 banks facing fraud allegations and a claim for $1.15bn (\u00a3700m) in damages in the US state of Virginia over the sale of mortgage bonds during the financial crisis.

The case filed in the Richmond circuit court shows the actions of banks in the runup to the financial crisis continue to come under scrutiny by the authorities, potentially undermining attempts by banks to improve reputations that have been knocked by repeated allegations about their behaviour.

According to the allegations, 40% of the mortgages sold on to the retirement fund had a higher risk of default than was disclosed at the time they were bought, leading to $383m of losses. The law allows claims for treble the estimated losses and the 317-page lawsuit also names arms of Citigroup, Countrywide, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Washington Mutual. \"Every Virginian was harmed by the financial crisis. Homes were lost, retirement accounts were devastated, small businesses saw their credit dry up almost overnight, and state and federal budget cuts hurt vulnerable Virginians,\" said Herring. The lawsuit sets out three ways in which the banks mispresented the quality of the mortgages being sold: the value of the loan compared with the value of the home, the owner occupancy rate and percentage of homes with a second mortgage.",

      "bodyText": "Blame the Russians. Shares in Thomas Cook fell 7% on Tuesday after the travel firm announced sluggish bookings in Germany, its biggest market, where consumer confidence is dwindling as the crisis in Ukraine threatens exports. The company's valuation, down 33% from its springtime high, suggests dampened City expectations in the second year of Thomas Cook's recovery from the brink of bankruptcy. Not that Harriet Green, the chief executive credited with turning round the 173-year-old company, looks worried. She says: \"When you've been a serial disappointer like Thomas Cook there are always going to be questions. The only way you turn the doubters into believers and owners of our corporation is continuing to deliver the transformation. There will always be short-term trading and issues, but I think we're incredibly on track.\" A reality check may help, she hints, after a first year in charge in which the share price has multiplied 10-fold from a low of 14p \u2013 the point at which Green picked up 6.2m shares. The trouble is with successful transformation, she says, is that people think it's all done. It isn't. \"If you think of this in terms of a remission, you don't want people getting complacent.\" Green is sitting in head office, her leopard-skin coat on the rack, and a portrait of the firm's Victorian founder behind her. The Veuve Clicquot award for businesswoman of the year sits in a display case opposite, although Green points instead to her RideLondon badge \u2013 she says the 100-mile cycling event was the hardest thing she's ever done \u2013 and a print, given to her by staff, of one of her favourite quotes: Maya Angelou's observation that people never forget how you made them feel. By and large, it seems, Thomas Cook feels better. Green, fond of a medical metaphor, is clear: \"Thomas Cook was not well. The company was very shocked, beleaguered and very confused.\" There was an unpleasant bout of surgery for staff, with 2,500 jobs cut from a firm where most employees had been happy to stay put despite its troubles: \"It was quite alarming in that there was virtually no attrition.\" Only about a third of senior management were retained. A third were promoted and a third hired from outside. Of the new recruits, she says: \"We've had virtually zero organ rejection.\" Costcutting was less important than a product overhaul, she says, and a change of culture. \"The company wasn't working together. It wasn't acting with scale to get benefit. There was virtually no web strategy. We had to leapfrog: mostly focused on tablet and mobile.\" Bookings from smartphones have more than trebled since the website was relaunched in May, but she says they are still below target. Green, a rare female CEO of a substantial quoted company, speaks passionately for diversity. \"When I came to Thomas Cook my direct reports were all male and British or German. Now I have six different ethnicities and nationalities.\" That's not driven by her own gender, she says, but by the customer base, with 70% of holidays booked by women. But she says 13- and 14-year-old girls don't have good enough role models, something she would like to change \"if I was PM or ran the BBC, though all of these jobs are filled by perfectly effective people: getting young women to think about what it means to be a journalist, a doctor, a business person \u2026 I think Theresa May is amazing. How do you get to be Theresa May, 13-year-olds?\" Boards and recruiters don't do enough but, she says, echoing Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, women must take responsibility too. \"Some of it is us. We have to be bolder and more assertive and make choices about what we really want to do.\" And stronger too, it seems. Green survives on three hours' sleep and works out for an hour a day, mainly rowing and kettlebells - a Russian-inspired workout. \"Strong is the new thin, so I'm trying to be stronger and not thinner.\" Another favourite quote of Green's is Nelson Mandela's dictum to be the change you want to see in the world [see footnote]. But, she notes: \"People like the notion of very challenging women but not always the reality.\" Earlier this year she caused some dismay by saying a year's maternity leave was too much, but she insists the headlines did not tell the full story: she is \"a strong proponent \u2026 of making sure women if they wish to can return\", and has instigated buddying schemes at her companies to keep new mothers in the loop. Her big idea is a lifetime allowance of leave for parents. \"You never know when children need your time and support, it isn't always when they're little.\" Diversity helps firms, she says: \"Groupthink is dangerous. I try to add a point of view that is coloured by a grammar school education, reading medieval history \u2013 but sitting on heavy-hitting boards; having lived and worked in four continents.\" One of those boards is BAE Systems, the defence manufacturer, to which Green brings her interest in Middle East peace charities. \"I don't think those are mutually exclusive. The PeaceWorks Foundation and One Voice aim to embrace the views of the moderates \u2026 Hopefully that's doing some good. If it doesn't, and you're seeing the line play out perfectly, then trying to maintain stability in the region through the force of other things, as opposed to negotiations \u2026 I think you have to look at intractable problems from both ends.\" Having joined two years ago from electronics firm Premier Farnell as an outsider, Green is optimistic about the travel sector, \"a growth industry \u2013 we have people inquiring about space vacations, travel to Iran \u2026\", although she says Africa is facing difficulties: \"The Ebola virus has meant a large number of people have decided that isn't on their list.\" Green joined industry from her history studies, having earlier considered journalism and, having been brought up with amateur dramatics, she also toyed with applying to Rada. But performing, she says, is a key part of her job: \"There are many times as a CEO when you have to perform. When we were doing the huge \u00a31.6bn capital raise, we had lots of bank meetings, quite dry \u2026 You can't think: 'Shit, this is the fifth I've done.' Every meeting has to be as good as you can possibly be.\" \u2022 This footnote was appended on 19 September 2014: the dictum that Harriet Green attributed to Nelson Mandela is more often ascribed to Gandhi, although it is unclear whether he said it; it is possibly a paraphrase of something he wrote. A book published in 1989 attributed the words \"We must be the change we wish to see in the world\" to Gandhi, and in a 2001 interview Arun Gandhi said his grandfather used to say \"Be the change you wish to see\".",

      "bodyText": "Nervousness was evident among investors once more, writes Nick Fletcher, ahead of this week\u2019s Scottish referendum and the latest decisions from the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday. There were other reasons to be cautious, with worries about the effect of sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine (one of the reasons for a dip in German confidence) and a dip in inward investment in China raising concerns about its growth outlook. But news that the People\u2019s Bank of China was increasing liquidity to its leading banks helped limit some of the damage. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 11.97 points at 6792.24 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.28% to 9632.93 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.44% lower at 4409.15 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB slipped 0.3% to 20,788.50 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.39% down at 10,789.7 But reports that the Fed may not be as hawkish in its comments tomorrow as some feared have helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average 90 points or 0.53% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More on the forthcoming polls on the Scottish referendum from analyst Mike Smithson: Looking for some afternoon reading? Here\u2019s Larry Elliott, reminding us that September has often been a bad month for sterling: April is the cruellest month, TS Eliot once wrote.Not for the pound, it isn\u2019t. Without question the month that holds the maximum danger for sterling is September. What\u2019s more, this week \u2013 the week in which Scotland decides whether it wants to become an independent country \u2013 tends to be the scariest week of the scariest month. Consider the evidence. There were five big sterling crises in the 20th century, and four of them came to the boil in September. In the circumstances, it\u2019s not hard to see why foreign exchange dealers will be at their desks early on Friday morning to await news from Edinburgh about the referendum vote. The story starts in 1931, two years after the Wall Street Crash and six years after Sir Winston Churchill had, with some misgivings, put Britain back on the Gold Standard at its pre first world war rate. This involved a revaluation of the pound, a move that made UK exports more expensive. Industry\u2019s pain intensified when global trade started to contract in the early years of the Great Depression. The Labour government of James Ramsay Macdonald found that it could only balance the budget by imposing spending cuts that led to a split in the party and the formation of a coalition. International investors were spooked by a mutiny of sailors at Invergordon and capital flight was not staunched by an austerity budget. Sterling left the Gold Standard forever on 21 September 1931. For more drama, click here: The pound and September: a torrid month for Britain\u2019s currency Time to recap (do scroll back through the blog for more details, charts and reaction) Inflation in the UK has fallen back to its joint-lowest level in five year. Falling fuel and food bills helped to lower the Consumer Prices index to just 1.5% in August. The fall was welcomed by government ministers including chancellor George Osborne. But the Labour party, and the TUC union, both warned that the cost of living squeeze continues to hurt households. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: With inflation well under control there is no case for raising interest rates any time soon. It would dump higher mortgage costs on households still feeling a squeeze on their living standards and risk choking off economic recovery. \u201cAs the Governor of the Bank of England said last week, British workers have faced pay cuts deeper than at any time since the 1920s. The priority now has to be wage rises to ensure a sustained economic recovery and a return to growing living standards.\u201d The drop takes the pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates, predicts Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics: \u201cInflation is still on a downward trend despite the economic recovery\u2019s strength. Although the low inflation outlook is unlikely to prevent the MPC from raising interest rates entirely over the next couple of years, it should limit the speed at which they rise.\u201d House prices have continued to climb, pushing average Scottish prices to record highs. The average UK home value has risen by 11.9% in the last year. And houses in London jumped by 19%, meaning the average house in the capital now costs \u00a3514,000. Elsewhere.... There\u2019s no sign of rampant inflation in the US, with producer prices flat in August. The OECD has proposed a clampdown on multinationals avoiding paying their fair share of tax. The Ukraine crisis has pushed German investor confidence down to a two-year low. And it\u2019s helped to sent the Russian ruble down to its lowest ever point against the US dollar And on Scotland.... An investor survey has found that Thursday\u2019s Scottish independence vote has hit appetite for investing in the UK Betfair is paying out to punters who bet that Scotland will reject independence.... (some customers, anyway) ...while the boss of Thomas Cook has predicted that Scots will still want a break from \u201cone of the worst climates in the world\u201d if they vote yes. And with more polls due tonight, the markets remain tense..... Something to ponder.... Update: Can there be a surprise outcome when the polls are neck-and-neck, one reader asks? Well, Betfair has just paid out on No bets, so they\u2019d look pretty daft if the Yes side win. Good point, though.... The boss of Thomas Cook, Harriet Green, has argued that Scottish independence won\u2019t hit demand for holidays as Scots will want to visit somewhere with better weather. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Denise Roland reports that Green said: \u201cMy personal view is we\u2019re stronger together [but] Scots have shown enormous resilience. It has one of the worst climates in the world and vacation is extremely important.\u201d She was speaking after Thomas Cook reported a slowdown in demand in Germany: Thomas Cook experiences slowdown in German holiday bookings The Scottish referendum has encouraged some international investors to pull money out of the UK, according to a regular survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Here\u2019s the section on \u201cScottish fears:, via the WSJ: \u201cAs opinion polls indicated the referendum for Scottish independence was too close to call, negativity towards U.K. stocks deepened. The U.K. has entrenched its status as the world\u2019s least popular region among asset allocators this month. A net 16% of the panel is underweight U.K. equities.\u201d The outlook is also dim, according to BoA. The U.K. is the region that 14% of global investors want to underweight in the coming year. One in five investors said the region has the least favorable profit outlook, up from a net 12% in August. Investors, often a jittery bunch,, are also worried about geopolitical tensions, the weak eurozone economy, and the consequences if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates next year. More here. Here\u2019s something for US Federal Reserve policymakers to ponder as they meet today; the prices charged \u201cat the factory gate\u201d by American companies were unchanged in August. The 0.0% change in the Producer Prices index, released a few minute ago, surprised economists who expected a 0.1% rise. The Labor Department reports that falling gasoline and food costs cancelled out higher rising service sector prices, and kept the overall PPI unchanged. On an annual basis, though, producer prices increased by 1.8% after rising 1.7% in July. The Fed\u2019s two-day monetary policy meeting ends tomorrow. Multinational companies who play the system to slash their tax bills could face a clampdown, if new rules just announced by the OECD are imposed by G20 counties this week. My colleague Simon Bowers reports: Bold updates to international tax rules designed to force some of the world\u2019s biggest multinationals \u2013 including Google, Apple, Amazon,Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 to contribute their fair share towards government budgets are to be agreed by G20 countries this weekend. A package of draft rules and progress reports, published on Tuesday by tax experts from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), marks the halfway milestone in a two-year reform project which was set in train by world leaders in Moscow last summer. Many of the world\u2019s largest and best known corporations now face being forced to rapidly dismantle their elaborate cross-border corporate structures as governments move in unison in an attempt to corral them back within a joined-up and modernised network of international tax treaties. Full story: International tax rule updates to be agreed by G20 countries And here\u2019s Phillip Inman on today\u2019s record-breaking housing data: UK house prices hit new record as London average breaks \u00a3500,000 The pound has recovered some of this morning\u2019s losses in the last few minutes, and is now trading just over $1.62 (having hit $1.616 this morning). It jumped after online bookmakers Betfair announced it is paying out to anyone who wagered that the No side would win Thursday\u2019s Scottish referendum. A reminder for eurozone crisis watchers, French PM Manuel Valls faces a confidence vote this afternoon. The result could determine how much authority Valls has to implement economic reforms to stimulate growth in the French economy. From Paris, Kim Willsher reports: The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, will put his political career on the line on Tuesday afternoon by seeking a crucial vote of confidence from parliament in his programme to tackle the country\u2019s economic woes. Valls, who formed a new government less than four weeks ago, needs to quell dissent that has brought bitter divisions in the ruling Socialist party (PS) and overcome president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s record unpopularity, to obtain a clear mandate from the lower house, the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale. He is expected to win the vote, but will need a very clear majority to silence the critics and give him enough support to push through proposed reforms. A narrow victory could leave parliament paralysed just weeks before the government seeks approval of its 2015 budget bill..... Full story here. Another landmark in the UK housing market.... the average London house price now costs more than half a million pounds. In this morning\u2019s survey, the Office for National Statistics reports that houses in the capital are now 39.7% higher than the pre-financial crisis peak in January 2008. London, unsurprisingly, is the English region with the highest average house price at \u00a3514,000 and the North East had the lowest average house price at \u00a3156,000. London, the South East and the East all had prices higher than the UK average price of \u00a3272,000, according to the ONS. The FT\u2019s John Aglionby says: The figure will damp claims that the market is cooling and maintain pressure on the government and the Bank of England to act to contain house price inflation. Here\u2019s my colleague Katie Allen on today\u2019s inflation report: Inflation drops to 1.5% after fall in food and petrol prices A drop in food and petrol prices helped inflation edge lower last month, pushing it down to 1.5% from 1.6% in July, as measured by the consumer price index. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the wider retail prices index (RPI) measure used to set many pay deals was down to 2.4% on the year, compared with 2.5% in July. Both rates were as forecast by economists and they said the relatively benign price pressure in the economy would mean the Bank of England is in no hurry to raise interest rates. Its monetary policy committee (MPC) has held borrowing costs at a record low of 0.5% for more than five years. \u201cInflation is still on a downward trend despite the economic recovery\u2019s strength,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \u201cAlthough the low inflation outlook is unlikely to prevent the MPC from raising interest rates entirely over the next couple of years, it should limit the speed at which they rise.\u201d... Full story here. Calum Bennie, savings expert at building society Scottish Friendly, warns against assuming that interest rates will remain at their record lows indefinitely: \u201cWhile lower inflation may reduce the likelihood of interest rates going up in short term, it is unrealistic to think that they will not rise in the midterm. It is important that people retain a healthy dose of caution; going on a spending blitz before the festive season is not the answer. High street retailers might disagree..... Just noticed that George Osborne tweeted about the dip in inflation: The TUC has echoed Labour\u2019s concerns over the weak UK wage growth. General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady also argues that the Bank of England should hold of raising interest rates until earnings pick up: \u201cWith inflation well under control there is no case for raising interest rates any time soon. It would dump higher mortgage costs on households still feeling a squeeze on their living standards and risk choking off economic recovery. \u201cAs the Governor of the Bank of England said last week, British workers have faced pay cuts deeper than at any time since the 1920s. The priority now has to be wage rises to ensure a sustained economic recovery and a return to growing living standards.\u201d Tomorrow, the BoE will publish the minutes of this month\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting, which will show how many MPC members voted to raise raises. In August, two policymakers wanted to hike borrowing costs. Even though the inflation rate is back at a five year low, prices in the shops are rising faster than average pay rises. Catherine McKinnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Treasury Minister, says that Britons still face significant cost of living pressure: \u201cWhile this fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, the squeeze on working people continues. \u201cThe most recent figures show pay rising by a record low of just 0.6 per cent - less than half the rate of inflation. Wages after inflation have now fallen by over \u00a31,600 a year under this Government. \u201cLabour\u2019s economic plan will tackle the cost-of-living crisis, make Britain better off and earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few.\u201d This chart from last month shows how UK pay growth have lagged inflation since around 2010, meaning real wages have shrunk: Arguably, workers\u2019 willingness to accept falling real wages helped to prevent unemployment rising higher during the downturn. Alasdair Cavalla, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, says that this weak wage growth has also helped peg inflation. Cavalla says: Two main factors have kept the UK inflation rate below the Bank of England\u2019s central target of 2.0% over the past eight months. Weak wage growth for consumers has helped prevent prices from taking off with the recovery. In this sense, the low inflation rate is something of a relief as it has prevented living standards from falling too far over the year so far. Geopolitics is another factor, he adds: On the global level, Eurozone demand has taken a knock from the unexpected shock of the Ukraine crisis, reducing pressure on global prices such as commodities and energy. This happened against the backdrop of weakening Chinese growth, an expected development but nevertheless one which has had a downward impact on key prices. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank also points out that core inflation (+1.9%) remains higher than the main CPI index. That showing that some of the easing in price pressures is due to volatile factors like the oil price and global food costs. Wood says: Inflation is below the BoE\u2019s 2% target mainly because of volatile food and energy prices. Core inflation actually rose to 1.9%yoy in August, from 1.8% in July, reflecting the rise in air fares and clothing prices. So the underlying inflationary picture is not as subdued as the headlines suggest. The British Chambers of Commerce has long been arguing against an early rise in interest rates, and today\u2019s fall in inflation has strengthened their case. BCC chief economist David Kern says: \u201cThese figures highlight that inflationary pressures in the economy are easing and remain well below the 2% target. The drop in inflation alongside the recent stagnation in wage growth will relieve pressure on the Bank of England. While the UK recovery remains on track, this is clearly not the time to put the recovery at risk with premature interest rate rises. \u201cThe main priority for the MPC must be to nurture business confidence by offering the stability of working in a low interest rate environment. To secure a lasting recovery the government should continue to provide further measures in key areas such as improving access to finance for growing firms, and supporting UK exporters.\u201d The consumer prices index is likely to remain below the 2% target until the middle of next year, reckons Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He predicts the Bank of England will raise interest rates in February 2015, nearly six years after cutting them to the current record low of 0.5%. But the BoE could resist hiking for even longer, he adds, despite the recent growth in employment: We suspect that low inflation, current very weak earnings growth, and the increased downside risks to economic activity coming from heightened geopolitical tensions and stuttering Eurozone economic activity will cause the Bank of England to hold off from acting until February at the earliest even though current ongoing robust economic activity and markedly falling unemployment provides support to the case for a near-term interest rate hike. I\u2019m going to mop up the best reaction to today\u2019s inflation data.... ....starting with Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, who points out that underlying inflation was higher than the headline CPI reading. \u201cOf course, the headline figure does not tell the full story. Core prices surprised higher by 1.9% in August; they were unaffected by the slips in oil prices or the 1.1% decline in food and booze through the past 12 months.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson says: The government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, with inflation falling by more than two-thirds since its peak in September 2011. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has welcomed the drop in inflation in August...and used it as a hook to urge Scots to reject the chance of independence. He says: \u2018Today\u2019s inflation figures are another step on the long road to our economic recovery after the great crash of 2008. They come just days before the most important vote on these islands in living memory. This recovery is just one of the countless endeavours that we have shared during our hundreds of years of joint history as a United Kingdom. It\u2019s another example that shows that by being together, our family of nations has the combined strength to overcome the challenges that life in an uncertain world inevitably throws up\u2019. Over to Germany briefly, and the Ukraine crisis has hit investor confidence hard. The monthly ZEW index, which tracks morale in Europe\u2019s largest economy, has slumped to just 6.9 this month, down from 8.6 in August. That\u2019s the lowest level since December 2012, and the ninth fall in a row. The gauge of current conditions plunged to 25.4 from 44.3 in August. ZEW, the think tank, blamed the fall on rising uncertainty over Germany\u2019s economic prospects, given the risk of spiralling sanctions against Russia, and the disappointing stare of the eurozone economy. Those house price figures aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation, by the way.... Scottish house prices have hit their highest level ever, rising above the pre-crisis peak of 2008. Today\u2019s housing data (see 9.38am) shows that in the year to July 2014, average house prices increased by 12.0% in England, 7.4% in Wales, 7.6% in Scotland and 4.5% in Northern Ireland. This has pushed house prices in Scotland to new record highs, for the first time since the financial crisis, the Office for National Statistics reports. It says (on page 6 of the report): Scotland average house prices have now passed their pre-financial crisis peak of June 2008, and along with average prices in England are at record levels. Prices in Wales are now 0.8% below their pre-crisis peak. But in Northern Ireland, they are still 46.7% below their record levels (set in 2007). This chart shows more details of how the cost of living in the UK changed in August: The full inflation report is online here (pdf). Here\u2019s the details of why the UK inflation rate fell in August: Falls in the price of motor fuels and food &amp; non-alcoholic drinks produced the main downward effects on the headline rate between July and August. Petrol prices fell by 1.8 pence per litre between the two months this year, compared with a rise of 2.0 pence per litre a year ago. Similarly, diesel prices fell by 2.1 pence this year but rose by 2.0 pence a year ago. Prices of food also fell this year but rose a year ago, particularly in the milk, cheese and eggs category. But the prices of some items picked up pace last month, including alcoholic drinks and women\u2019s clothing. Offsetting these were upward effects from clothing, transport services and alcohol. Clothing prices rose, as usual, between July and August as autumn ranges started to enter the shops following the summer sales season and this year the increases were greater than a year ago. The main effect came from price rises on women\u2019s outerwear. Within transport services, the upward effect came from sea and air transport and within alcohol, it came from spirits and wine. At 1.5%, the consumer prices index is back at its joint lowest level since 2009: But while inflation fell, house prices have surged at their fastest rate in seven years. Average house prices in the UK jumped by 11.7% in the year to July, according to ONS data. That\u2019s the biggest monthly rise since 2007. In London, they are up by 19.1% over the last year. The drop in inflation in August was mainly due to falling fuel, food, non-alcoholic beverage costs, according to the Office for National Statistics. The Retail Prices Index, the inflation measure that also includes housing costs, has also fallen. It dropped to 2.4% in August, from 2.5% in July. Breaking: The UK inflation rate, as measures by the Consumer Prices Index has fallen to 1.5%. That equals May\u2019s five-year low. Details and reaction to follow.... OK, it\u2019s nearly time for the main event of the morning, the UK inflation data for August. A reminder, we\u2019re expecting the consumer prices index to fall to 1.5% in August, from 1.6% last month. That would equal May\u2019s five-year low..... Today is also the 22nd anniversary of Black Wednesday, when Britain was sent packing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism after being outgunned by speculator George Soros. At the time, Black Wednesday felt like a major humiliation for the UK. The government clung on, although John Major later admitted he came close to resigning after a dramatic day in which interest rates were (briefly) hiked twice in a bid to support the pound. But more than two decades later, losing the pound\u2019s peg against rival currencies such as the Deutsche Mark looks like a blessing in disguise. Devaluing sterling appears to have been the trigger that ended the early-1990s recession and heralded years of growth. The Russian ruble has tumbled to fresh record lows today, as the selloff that began yesterday intensified. An early burst of selling drove the ruble down 1%, to 38.732 to the US dollar. It has now lost 14% of its value since July, and 18% since the start of this year. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says the ruble\u2019s weakness is \u201chighlighting the return of geopolitical risk\u201d. And there are several reasons for the ruble\u2019s slide. 1) Reuters cites the \u201chefty\u201d foreign debt repayments which Russian companies face this month, which pushes up demand for US dollars and also leads to more foreign capital leaving Russia. 2) A former Russian finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, predicted this morning that the Russian economy could be plunged into a deep recession of Western governments implement tougher sanctions. 3) Morgan Stanley has warned that Russia\u2019s credit rating could be cut further, if the Ukraine crisis continues. Alexei Mikheev, an analyst at VTB 24 bank\u2019s investment department, summed up the mood thus: \u201cYou could characterise the behaviour of the market on the dollar-rouble pair as panicky and irrational.\u201d Thomas Cook\u2019s results have also failed to wow the market. Its shares are down almost 6%, leading the FTSE 250 fallers, even though earnings hit forecasts. The holiday firm did warn that price growth remained weak, which it combated by accelerating its cost-cutting measures. More here. The pound is losing some ground this morning, down half a cent or 0.33% against the US dollar at $1.6175. Against the euro, it\u2019s down 0.3% at \u20ac1.2501. Analysts continue to predict that sterling will tumble if the Yes campaign win Thursday\u2019s Scottish referendum vote. Disappointing profits forecasts are never in fashion in the City, as web clothing retailer Asos is learning this morning. Shares in Asos slumped by 15% at the start of trading, after the company downgraded its earning expectations for the 2014-15 financial year. The company dashed hopes of increased profits, saying it needed to make more \u201csignificant investments in our international pricing and proposition, as well as in our logistical infrastructure and technology platform\u201d. ASOS also reported that the fire at its Barnsley warehouse in June cost it between \u00a325m and \u00a330m in lost sales. The Press Association reports that a \u201csharper-than-expected change in inflation\u201d this morning could shake up the market\u2019s expectations of when interest rates rise. IHS Global Insight chief UK economist Howard Archer said price pressure in the UK economy is muted, with Brent crude oil prices trading at two-year lows in September and the pound at a relatively strong level, despite recent volatility due to the Scottish independence referendum. Mr Archer added: \u201cThe inflation environment currently looks benign, particularly with supermarkets heavily engaged in a food price war.\u201d Global Insight said it expected CPI to remain at around the current levels and clearly under 2% over the rest of 2014 and through the early months of 2015. But Capital Economics, which predicts CPI to drop to around 1.4% today, said the inflation measure could hit 1% by the end of 2014. It said: \u201cWe continue to think that a combination of stable energy bills, lower import prices and weak growth in unit wages will enable CPI inflation to fall to as low as 1% by the end of this year and remain weak in 2015.\u201d The Retail Prices Index, the broader measure of inflation, is expected to also drop from July\u2019s 2.5% to 2.4%, according to a Reuters poll. Even if UK inflation does fall to 1.5%, it will mean prices are rising ahead of wage growth. The latest labour market figures, released last month, showed that average earnings (ex-bonuses) grew by just 0.6% annually in the three months to June. We get fresh data tomorrow. Britain\u2019s inflation rate has been below 2% since January, having soared way over the Bank of England\u2019s target in 2010 and 2011, as this chart shows: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. The pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates could ease today, with the release of the latest UK inflation rate, for August, at 9.30am BST. Economists predict that the Consumer Prices Index fell last month, from 1.6% to 1.5%, further from the BoE\u2019s 2% target, partly thanks to lower energy costs. As Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains, that would reduce the chances of a hike in borrowing costs: All things equal, a drop in inflation today especially alongside a fall in wages tomorrow would ease pressure on the Bank of England over hiking rates and add more pressure onto an oversold British pound. It will be matter of judging the need for a rate hike as suggested by data against the committee\u2019s hawkishness in tomorrow\u2019s minutes [of this month\u2019s meeting] for the chance of a change in expected timeline for the first rate hike. Mind you, if Scotland votes for independence on Thursday, the resulting turmoil would probably make an early interest rate rise rather unlikely.... We\u2019ll also get the latest German investor confidence data at 10am BST; the ZEW index is expected to fall, as the escalating conflict in East Ukraine spooks Europe\u2019s largest economy, with its close links to Russia. Over in France, the embattled government faces a confidence vote. Prime Minister Manuel Valls should survive it, despite Francois Hollande\u2019s slumping popularity and concerns over the weak French economy.... We\u2019re not expecting any fireworks in the European markets this morning, after a mixed but unexciting session in Asia as investors await Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. And there are corporate results from Thomas Cook and from ASOS, the web fashion retailer recently hit by a warehouse fire, to digest.....",

This involved a revaluation of the pound, a move that made UK exports more expensive. Industry\u2019s pain intensified when global trade started to contract in the early years of the Great Depression.</p> <p>The Labour government of James Ramsay Macdonald found that it could only balance the budget by imposing spending cuts that led to a split in the party and the formation of a coalition.

      "body": "<p>Ahead of the crucial Scottish independence vote and the latest US Federal Reserve meeting, leading shares continued to edge lower.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 11.97 points lower at 6792.24 as the referendum in Scotland looked too close to call, despite Betfair apparently paying out on a no vote. As for the US, analysts believe there might be more hawkish noises about a rise in interest rates from the Fed.</p> <p>Continuing concerns about the effect of sanctions against Russia over its involvement in Ukraine helped push German confidence lower, while there were also worries about China's growth after a fall in inward investment, although news the central bank was boosting liquidity to its leading banks helped markets recover from their worst levels.</p> <p>Meanwhile UK inflation figures were in line with expectations, giving little clue as to the timing of the next move in the country's borrowing costs. Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote> Shares in Europe fell across the board today as investors took a more defensive stance leading into tomorrow's Fed meeting particularly given the reported weak capital flows into China and a further drop in German investor confidence. </blockquote> <p>With Brent crude adding 1% after recent falls, <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> A shares rose 23p to 2411.5p while <strong>BP</strong> was 4.05p better at 472.35p.</p> <p>Among the other risers <strong>Antofagasta</strong> added 0.5p to 762p as Deutsche Bank moved from sell to hold with an 820p price target, while <strong>Anglo American</strong> was up 9p at 1497.5p as the bank issued a buy recommendation.</p> <p>Other analyst notes also had an influence.</p> <p>Publishing group <strong>Pearson</strong> put on 20p to \u00a312.26 after analysts at Morgan Stanley moved from equal weight to overweight, and raised their price target from \u00a311 to \u00a313.50. They said:</p> <blockquote> We think the restructuring is complete, 15%-20% earnings per share growth is in prospect for 2015 and Pearson now addresses a bigger market with a more flexible cost base. It is time to own Pearson again. </blockquote> <p><strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> added 35p to \u00a354.95 as Berenberg Bank restarted coverage with a hold recommendation and \u00a355 price target. Analyst James Targett said:</p> <blockquote> Reckitt Benckiser is an impressive operator with strong fundamentals \u2013 solid organic growth, high margins, excellent cash generation, best-in-class return on invested capital, a strong balance sheet \u2013 and it pursues an active M&amp;A agenda. This has led to the company's total shareholder returns and cumulative earnings per share growth being among the best of its peer group over the last decade. However, after a 50% increase in the last two years, the stock is expensive on 20 times 2015 PE. Although the proposed spin-off of the RB pharmaceutical arm in 2015 is positive (we estimate 385p per share), this is now priced in. Reckitt's underlying markets, both developed and emerging, will provide little relief in the second half. <br> Reckitt's active M&amp;A strategy has pros and cons: it has used its free cash flow generation (more than \u00a31.5bn per annum, 100% conversion) and balance sheet to its advantage, spending over \u00a315bn on M&amp;A over the last 10 years. These have taken their toll on return on invested capital, down from 32% in 2005 to 18.5%. While still above peers, we only expect modest improvement to 20% by 2016. Reckitt has \u00a33bn-\u00a34bn of excess cash to spend each year. Recent consolidation in consumer health will put upward pressure on invested capital.  Management is not afraid to make divestments to create shareholder value: RB Pharmaceuticals is expected to be spun off in 2015, at a value of \u00a32.8bn. The Food and Portfolio divisions could fetch \u00a3925m and \u00a3300m respectively and be accretive to organic growth, in our view. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> slipped 33.5p to 4511.5p despite the pharmaceutical group unveiled a partnership with US group Eli Lilly for its experimental alzheimer's drug. Under the deal, Lilly will pay up to $500m to share rights to the drug, depending on how successful it ends up being. AstraZeneca also announced that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its Movantik tablets as a treatment for opioid-induced constipation.</p> <p>Retail shares were under the cosh after poor updates from online fashion group <strong>Asos</strong>, down 215p or 9% to \u00a322.07 after it warned investment would hold back full year profits, and Jacamo and Simply Be owner <strong>N Brown</strong>, 19.6p lower at 385.4p following a 0.6% dip in first half revenues.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Thomas Cook</strong> fell 8p to 122p after the tour operator said it expected to meet full year forecasts, but cautioned on a slowdown in bookings in the German market.</p> <p>But <strong>Ophir Energy</strong> added 10.5p to 238.5p as it announced it was a new gas discovery at its Silenus East-1 well in Equatorial Guinea.</p> <p><strong>Inmarsat</strong> climbed 14p to 725.5p after a buy note from Jefferies with a 925p price target. Analyst Giles Thorne said the shares had languished despite Inmarsat announcing in June it planned to launch a hybrid cellular/satellite air-to-ground network to allow in-flight broadband on airliners. There had been worries about delays to its next Global Xpress satellite launches following problems with the Proton rockets, but these should now take place next year. Thorne said:</p> <blockquote> Inmarsat's shares remain muted, the market seemingly unwilling to look through to the upside from Global Xpress and air to ground/satellite network until the overhangs from the Global Xpress launch delay/Russian sanctions are overcome. Our forecasts are largely unchanged, other than to lower our 2015 Global Xpress revenue number (from $50m to $30m) to reflect the later global commercial service introduction, as guided to by management at the second quarter results. We nudge our price target up from 920p to 925p, mostly on the appreciation of the dollar against sterling since our last published note (which more than offsets the tax provision impact). <br> On 24 September, Inmarsat management (both senior and sector leads) will host a capital markets day at its head office in London. The agenda has been circulated. Investors will receive a thorough update of the entire business, not just the recent air to ground/satellite network investment programme, though we do expect the latter to perhaps dominate airtime. Inmarsat's \"sector silo\" approach suggests we should expect each industry lead to talk to L-band/Global Express/air to ground. We expect management to update on future capital expenditure requirements. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Game Digital</strong> added 2p to 277p after Monday's news it was buying the Spanish stores owned by US rival GameStop. Liberum issued a buy note, saying:</p> <blockquote> Game has announced it is to acquire Spanish stores from GameStop, as its US-based competitor exits the Spanish market. The transaction will see the only other major specialist video games retailer in Spain leave the market and will be a clear positive for Game, in our view.

      "bodyText": "Ahead of the crucial Scottish independence vote and the latest US Federal Reserve meeting, leading shares continued to edge lower. The FTSE 100 finished 11.97 points lower at 6792.24 as the referendum in Scotland looked too close to call, despite Betfair apparently paying out on a no vote. As for the US, analysts believe there might be more hawkish noises about a rise in interest rates from the Fed. Continuing concerns about the effect of sanctions against Russia over its involvement in Ukraine helped push German confidence lower, while there were also worries about China's growth after a fall in inward investment, although news the central bank was boosting liquidity to its leading banks helped markets recover from their worst levels. Meanwhile UK inflation figures were in line with expectations, giving little clue as to the timing of the next move in the country's borrowing costs. Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Shares in Europe fell across the board today as investors took a more defensive stance leading into tomorrow's Fed meeting particularly given the reported weak capital flows into China and a further drop in German investor confidence. With Brent crude adding 1% after recent falls, Royal Dutch Shell A shares rose 23p to 2411.5p while BP was 4.05p better at 472.35p. Among the other risers Antofagasta added 0.5p to 762p as Deutsche Bank moved from sell to hold with an 820p price target, while Anglo American was up 9p at 1497.5p as the bank issued a buy recommendation. Other analyst notes also had an influence. Publishing group Pearson put on 20p to \u00a312.26 after analysts at Morgan Stanley moved from equal weight to overweight, and raised their price target from \u00a311 to \u00a313.50. They said: We think the restructuring is complete, 15%-20% earnings per share growth is in prospect for 2015 and Pearson now addresses a bigger market with a more flexible cost base. It is time to own Pearson again. Reckitt Benckiser added 35p to \u00a354.95 as Berenberg Bank restarted coverage with a hold recommendation and \u00a355 price target. Analyst James Targett said: Reckitt Benckiser is an impressive operator with strong fundamentals \u2013 solid organic growth, high margins, excellent cash generation, best-in-class return on invested capital, a strong balance sheet \u2013 and it pursues an active M&amp;A agenda. This has led to the company's total shareholder returns and cumulative earnings per share growth being among the best of its peer group over the last decade. However, after a 50% increase in the last two years, the stock is expensive on 20 times 2015 PE. Although the proposed spin-off of the RB pharmaceutical arm in 2015 is positive (we estimate 385p per share), this is now priced in. Reckitt's underlying markets, both developed and emerging, will provide little relief in the second half. Reckitt's active M&amp;A strategy has pros and cons: it has used its free cash flow generation (more than \u00a31.5bn per annum, 100% conversion) and balance sheet to its advantage, spending over \u00a315bn on M&amp;A over the last 10 years. These have taken their toll on return on invested capital, down from 32% in 2005 to 18.5%. While still above peers, we only expect modest improvement to 20% by 2016. Reckitt has \u00a33bn-\u00a34bn of excess cash to spend each year. Recent consolidation in consumer health will put upward pressure on invested capital. Management is not afraid to make divestments to create shareholder value: RB Pharmaceuticals is expected to be spun off in 2015, at a value of \u00a32.8bn. The Food and Portfolio divisions could fetch \u00a3925m and \u00a3300m respectively and be accretive to organic growth, in our view. But AstraZeneca slipped 33.5p to 4511.5p despite the pharmaceutical group unveiled a partnership with US group Eli Lilly for its experimental alzheimer's drug. Under the deal, Lilly will pay up to $500m to share rights to the drug, depending on how successful it ends up being. AstraZeneca also announced that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its Movantik tablets as a treatment for opioid-induced constipation. Retail shares were under the cosh after poor updates from online fashion group Asos, down 215p or 9% to \u00a322.07 after it warned investment would hold back full year profits, and Jacamo and Simply Be owner N Brown, 19.6p lower at 385.4p following a 0.6% dip in first half revenues. Meanwhile Thomas Cook fell 8p to 122p after the tour operator said it expected to meet full year forecasts, but cautioned on a slowdown in bookings in the German market. But Ophir Energy added 10.5p to 238.5p as it announced it was a new gas discovery at its Silenus East-1 well in Equatorial Guinea. Inmarsat climbed 14p to 725.5p after a buy note from Jefferies with a 925p price target. Analyst Giles Thorne said the shares had languished despite Inmarsat announcing in June it planned to launch a hybrid cellular/satellite air-to-ground network to allow in-flight broadband on airliners. There had been worries about delays to its next Global Xpress satellite launches following problems with the Proton rockets, but these should now take place next year. Thorne said: Inmarsat's shares remain muted, the market seemingly unwilling to look through to the upside from Global Xpress and air to ground/satellite network until the overhangs from the Global Xpress launch delay/Russian sanctions are overcome. Our forecasts are largely unchanged, other than to lower our 2015 Global Xpress revenue number (from $50m to $30m) to reflect the later global commercial service introduction, as guided to by management at the second quarter results. We nudge our price target up from 920p to 925p, mostly on the appreciation of the dollar against sterling since our last published note (which more than offsets the tax provision impact). On 24 September, Inmarsat management (both senior and sector leads) will host a capital markets day at its head office in London. The agenda has been circulated. Investors will receive a thorough update of the entire business, not just the recent air to ground/satellite network investment programme, though we do expect the latter to perhaps dominate airtime. Inmarsat's \"sector silo\" approach suggests we should expect each industry lead to talk to L-band/Global Express/air to ground. We expect management to update on future capital expenditure requirements. Finally Game Digital added 2p to 277p after Monday's news it was buying the Spanish stores owned by US rival GameStop. Liberum issued a buy note, saying: Game has announced it is to acquire Spanish stores from GameStop, as its US-based competitor exits the Spanish market. The transaction will see the only other major specialist video games retailer in Spain leave the market and will be a clear positive for Game, in our view. The terms of the transaction are undisclosed, but management expects a broadly neutral earnings impact for 2014, with modest benefits thereafter. Given the lack of financial details, we make no changes to our forecasts at this stage, but see risks on the upside.",

      "bodyText": "Scotch whisky makers could lose out if Scotland votes yes in Thursday's referendum, according to the Dutch bank Rabobank. Whisky is Scotland's second-largest export behind oil and gas and is worth \u00a34.3bn a year to the local economy, but sales could be hit if the country loses access to the EU's free trade area and to markets in the rest of the world where Brussels has forged trade deals. The Scottish National party has argued that independence would boost food and drink manufacturers by giving them tailor-made support to sell abroad, while they would also benefit from the pound and uninterrupted EU membership.

Indeed it does: in the language used by the outside world, Asos's gross profit margin plunged by 6.4 percentage points in the last quarter of the financial year. Not pretty. Asos's upside-down reporting hints at deeper problems that have afflicted the go-go online clothes retailer. The company has been run on the assumption that years of rapid growth in sales lie ahead and that the benefits of greater size would blow warm breezes through profit margins, which would only ever go up. It's not that simple, as Asos is being obliged to admit. Tuesday's was the third profit warning in six months. Forget pre-tax (as opposed to gross) profit margins of 7-8%, which was the old dream; for the time being, Asos will run at 4-5%. Aside from an unfortunate fire at the large Barnsley distribution depot, there is little wrong with the UK operation, where sales were a third higher than a year ago. The problems are all overseas, which is a serious rip if you're trying to sell to 200 countries. In the last quarter, Asos's sales were flat in the US. The \"rest of the world\" segment \u2013 which includes Australia, Russia and China \u2013 fell 5%. Blame the strength of sterling, suggests Asos. A dress that sells for \u00a320 in the UK suddenly cost \u00a323 or \u00a324 for an Australian customer, says its chief executive, Nick Robertson. OK, but surely a business with a sterling cost base and a sterling pricing structure should have noticed that currency movements can play havoc with its competitive clout. New software is on the way to provide local pricing, says Robertson. It can't arrive soon enough. But here's what it will cost: \"significant investments in our international pricing and proposition\" mean pre-tax profits will be flat next year. Even if that is achieved, Asos's progress will look almost pedestrian: \u00a340m of pre-tax profit in 2012; \u00a354.7m in 2013; \u00a345m in 2014; and \u00a345m in 2015. To think, at the start of this year, Asos was valued at \u00a36bn and some people were willing to pay 100 times expected earnings to own the shares. The share price has crashed from \u00a370 to \u00a322 since then, teaching optimistic punters two hard \u2013 but very old \u2013 lessons. First, global leadership never comes easily. Second, growth in profits is more important than increases in sales. Asos remains a smart and impressive operation, but it's a third lesson that's the next problem: competitors catch up.",

    "webTitle": "International tax rule updates to be agreed by G20 countries", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bold updates to international tax rules designed to force some of the world's biggest multinationals \u2013 including Google, Apple, Amazon, Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 to contribute their fair share towards government budgets are to be agreed by G20 countries this weekend. Under draft rules published on Tuesday by tax experts from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) many of the world's largest and best known corporations face being forced to rapidly dismantle their elaborate cross-border corporate structures. The moves by governments to corral companies back into a joined-up, modernised network of international tax treaties mark the halfway point in a two-year reform project begun by world leaders in Moscow last summer. If nerves hold among the 44 countries involved \u2013 which together represent 90% of the world's economy \u2013 the impact on corporate profits and treasury receipts could be significant in many economies, large and small. Meanwhile, countries that have courted multinationals with tax-friendly regimes \u2013 Bermuda, Ireland and Luxembourg among them \u2013 could suffer an investment exodus. Existing international tax rules, laid down in a network of about 3,000 bilateral tax treaties, have for decades been straining to keep up with innovations in technology and tax avoidance. The OECD has said the G20 reform project is urgently required \"to prevent the existing consensus-based international tax framework from unravelling\". Among the initiatives OECD experts claim will have the most impact are new rules to stop companies exploiting differences between tax regimes to conjure up unwarranted tax deductions. These so-called hybrid mismatch structures are thought to leak billions from treasury coffers around the world each year and are routinely deployed by the world's largest international businesses. One of the OECD tax experts leading the reform programme, Raffaele Russo, said: \"I think with these rules, we really kill them. Time will tell, because you never know how creative people will get, but I think if countries do what these rules require I just don't see how you can do hybrids any more.\" Also published in the OECD update are draft rules that will require multinationals to give tax authorities a country-by-country detailed breakdown of their activities and earnings, making it easier for nations to detect patterns of avoidance. At the same time G20 finance minsters will receive OECD draft rules designed to stamp out so-called treaty shopping. In the past, favourable treaty arrangements have seen, for example, up to 40% of overseas investment in India channelled through Mauritius first. Among the most contentious issues, however, remains how to treat digital companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google that have experienced explosive growth in the last three decades, often developing tax structures as innovative as their products. The US last year fought off French and Italian efforts for the OECD programme to develop specific rules targeted at computer and internet companies. But all participants in the project have pledged that its second phase, while not singling out the digital sector, must stamp out some of the most egregious behaviour that has thrived in these newer enterprises. As a result, the likes of Amazon and Google are unlikely to be able to continue to tell tax authorities in Britain and other major European markets that their offshore sales hubs can take billions of pounds of sales without having a taxable presence locally, known in tax jargon as a \"permanent establishment\". Further beefing up of existing tax rules over the next 12 months are to make it harder for multinationals to transfer parts of their intellectual property rights to low-tax jurisdictions at modest cost. This could present a challenge to Apple, Google and others. Russo said: \"Have we solved all the problems of the digital economy? I think no. But have we put some clarity in the debate? I think yes.\" But the UK chancellor, George Osborne, who two years ago positioned himself as a prominent cheerleader for the project, is this weekend expected to cut an isolated figure as other G20 finance ministers meet in Cairns, Australia, to give formal backing to the OECD's work. Osborne has angered his peers with Britain's so-called \"patent box\" tax incentives. These tax breaks are offered by a handful of European countries to businesses that bring with them lucrative intellectual property profits. The UK has argued they encourage high-tech research and development, others say they are too easy for overseas R&amp;D firms to exploit. The issue has left the UK increasingly isolated, along with the Netherlands and Luxembourg, in resisting pressure from other nations furious at what they regard as harmful competition. Elsewhere, early US reticence over the tax reform project appears to have receded a little. Many in Washington still feel that US corporations have been disproportionately cited among the most aggressive abusers of the current international tax rules. But the political mood toward US homegrown multinationals has shifted in recent months. A rash of so-called \"corporate inversion\" takeovers \u2013 by which US-incorporated groups acquire a rival and transfer their headquarters overseas \u2013 has led to angry condemnation from politicians. Such manoeuvres have been criticised as tax-avoidance-driven ploys to keep offshore cash piles beyond the grasp of the US tax authorities. Barack Obama has described such deals as unpatriotic and has promised new laws to prevent them. But many tax experts believe the best avenue for bringing multinationals to heel, both within the US and beyond, is via concerted international efforts led by G20 nations.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The National Union of Mineworkers has stepped in to save the UK's last viable deep pit coal mine by investing \u00a34m in the employee-owned Hatfield Colliery, near Doncaster. The South Yorkshire mine, which played a prominent role in the 1984 miners' strike and the 1996 film Brassed Off, faced closure unless it could secure funds to start mining a new coalface in the next few weeks. The Hatfield Colliery Employee Benefit Partnership, which runs the mine for the benefit of its 438 employees in a similar way to the John Lewis Partnership, said it had struggled to secure a loan from the government or banks. John Grogan, chair of Hatfield Colliery, approached the NUM on 1 September and the loan was arranged within days. \"Without an injection of finance we would have been struggling to get into the new face, and this [funding] allows us to get into it and guarantee our future for 18 months,\" he said. \"The National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] has given us a future. It's hard for the deep mining sector to get money from banks.\" Grogan said the NUM's \u00a34m one-year loan was made on fully commercial terms that will pay the union a competitive, but undisclosed, rate of interest. The NUM said: \"This action is an unprecedented step for the union but reinforces its commitment to the deep coal mining industry in the UK. It is the view of the union that there is a future for coal in the generation of electricity in the UK for years to come and that the coal burnt should be UK mined coal securing employment for miners in the UK not imported from Russia and Colombia or anywhere else.\" The Hatfield mine, which is in Ed Miliband's Doncaster North constituency and dates back to 1916, is the last of the UK's deep coal mines not to have announced its closure. UK Coal, the owner of the other two remaining mines \u2013 Kellingley Colliery in Yorkshire and Thoresby Colliery in Nottinghamshire \u2013 announced plans in April to close the mines within 18 months with the loss of 1,300 jobs. \"The granting of the loan by the NUM has given us time to make the case to the generators [coal-fired power stations] and to government that the last deep coal mine in the country not to announce its closure deserves a future. We owe it to all those who have gone before us not to go quietly into the good night,\" Grogan said.",

It's hard for the deep mining sector to get money from banks.\"</p> <p>Grogan said the NUM's \u00a34m one-year loan was made on fully commercial terms that will pay the union a competitive, but undisclosed, rate of interest.</p> <p>The NUM said: \"This action is an unprecedented step for the union but reinforces its commitment to the deep coal mining industry in the UK. It is the view of the union that there is a future for coal in the generation of electricity in the UK for years to come and that the coal burnt should be UK mined coal securing employment for miners in the UK not imported from Russia and Colombia or anywhere else.\"</p> <p>The Hatfield mine, which is in Ed Miliband's Doncaster North constituency and dates back to 1916, is the last of the UK's deep coal mines not to have announced its closure.</p> <p>UK Coal, the owner of the other two remaining mines \u2013 Kellingley Colliery in Yorkshire and Thoresby Colliery in Nottinghamshire \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-26969266\" title=\"\">announced plans in April to close the mines within 18 months with the loss of 1,300 jobs</a>.</p> <p>\"The granting of the loan by the NUM has given us time to make the case to the generators [coal-fired power stations] and to government that the last deep coal mine in the country not to announce its closure deserves a future. We owe it to all those who have gone before us not to go quietly into the good night,\" Grogan said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "House prices hit a fresh record high in July after surging by 11.7% over the last year, according to official figures. The average price of a British home stood at \u00a3272,000 following three consecutive months of double-digit price rises. Most of the UK's regions saw house values jump above their pre-financial crisis peaks, fuelling concerns that much of the UK's recovery has been fuelled to a large degree by a booming housing market. Scottish house prices soared to a record high, while the east Midlands, the West Midlands and the south-west joined London, the east and the south-east in having price levels higher than their pre-financial crisis peaks of 2007/08, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Property values in London continue to rise faster than the rest of the country, recording a 19.1% year-on-year jump, and taking the average property price in the capital to \u00a3514,000. But the pace of growth slowed from 19.3% in June and hinted at a cooling off in activity during the summer compared to the hectic pace of growth in the same period last year. Several surveys have showed a slowing in activity as a mix of low wage rises and sky-high prices restrict buyers from obtaining mortgages. Emphasising how difficult it has become for new entrants to the market, the ONS said prices paid by first-time buyers in July were 13.5% higher on average than the same month last year. For owner-occupiers moving home, prices increased by 10.9% for the same period. On a month-on-month basis, property values increased by 1.6% across the UK between June and July. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the consistent double-digit price rises will \"add to worries that the property market poses a key risk to financial stability\". He said there will be officials in the Bank of England, which is the chief financial regulator, who fear \"that macro-prudential tools may be insufficient to cool the housing market without an accompanying rate hike\". Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Stretched house prices to earnings ratios, the prospect that interest rates will start to rise before long and tighter checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders will likely have some limiting impact on buyer interest. \"Even so, with the economy seen holding up pretty well going forward, employment high and rising, consumer confidence elevated and earnings growth likely to improve (particularly in 2015), and with housing supply still tight in a number of areas, house price growth seems unlikely to fall away.\" Connells Survey &amp; Valuation said its own survey of activity in August showed a drop in transactions over the last year. It said the total number of valuations was 13% higher than in July, though 4% fewer when compared with August 2013. Spokesman John Bagshaw said: \"August has seen a bounce back from a particularly quiet July. Yet this is still quieter than a year ago. That's partly because August 2013 was particularly strong \u2013 an exceptional month for comparison, being the first time where it was clear the property market was moving into sustained positive territory.\"",

Most analysts expect the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation to fall to 1.5% from 1.6% in July, as a result of pressure from the ongoing supermarket price war and lower petrol prices, although some are forecasting a drop to 1.4%. The CPI rate fell back markedly to 1.6% in July after spiking to a five-month high of 1.9% in June, from 1.5% in May, which was the lowest rate since October 2009. The retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation, which includes housing costs, is forecast to remain unmoved from last month at 2.5%. But it is the CPI measure, published on Tuesday and used for the Bank's target, which will be watched by analysts amid speculation about when interest rates, held at a record low of 0.5% for more than five years, will start to rise. Lower inflation eases pressure on the Bank for any hike as it considers whether the economy should return to more normal borrowing rates following the financial crisis. Experts are pencilling in an increase for February next year, but a sharper-than-forecast change in inflation could shake up the market's expectations. IHS Global Insight's chief UK economist, Howard Archer, said price pressure in the UK economy is muted, with Brent crude oil prices trading at two-year lows in September and the pound at a relatively strong level, despite recent volatility due to the Scottish independence referendum. Archer added: \"The inflation environment currently looks benign, particularly with supermarkets heavily engaged in a food price war.\" Global Insight said it expected the CPI to remain at around the current levels and clearly under 2% over the rest of 2014 and through the early months of 2015. But Capital Economics, which predicts the CPI to drop to around 1.4% on Tuesday, said the inflation measure could hit 1% by the end of 2014.

If this group cut their spending by more than the average, it could account for two-fifths of the 5% collapse in private consumption after 2007, the report says.

Officials at the Bank believe maintaining low rates of private debt relative to national income will help protect the UK from severe recession in the event of another financial crash.
