      "body": "<p>The North American International Auto Show, which opens to the public this weekend in Detroit, is not an event known for its subtlety. </p> <p> The Detroit auto show \u2013 next to the shows held throughout the year in Geneva, Paris, Frankfurt and Shanghai, among other places \u2013 is one of the largest and most significant in the industry, and is certainly the most important show for manufacturers touting their wares in the the United States and Canada. It gives automakers a chance to display, amid great fanfare, new models and flashy concepts, a task they embrace with vigor. <br></p> <p>At the 2010 show, Ford lowered the Atlas concept truck \u2013 a predecessor to the new F-150 pickup \u2013 <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/15/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-150-atlas-20130115\">from the ceiling on a steel sling</a>. One of the more famous stunts was when Chrysler introduced the new Jeep Grand Cherokee to journalists by <a href=\"http://www.motorbooks.com/motorbooks-blog/1992-Jeep-Unveiled-the-New-Grand-Cherokee/282 \">driving it through a plate glass window</a> at the front of the Cobo Center.</p> <p>There was nothing so flashy this year in the media previews, but it was still like walking into a carnival of capitalism. The presentations feature huge, brightly lit display monitors, loud music, smoke machines, laser displays. Pyrotechnic displays are not unusual. Circus impresario PT Barnum would feel at home. <br></p> <p>The show opens to the public today for a week, though journalists \u2013 sporting comically large pink badges and bright orange wrist bands \u2013 had an early look last week. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84123d1a13998a67522e50709cde8d128f67962c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/16/1421450000672/d8395b4d-120b-42f9-975a-153c0b1e3ea6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"detroit\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Infinity Q60 concept car is displayed during the press preview at the North American International Auto Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spectacle is a beloved tradition, and the ringmasters were all present. Automakers\u2019 chief executives were front and center in Detroit this year. That includes GM\u2019s Mary Barra; Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of both Renault and Nissan; William Clay Ford Jr, executive chairman of Ford, and Dieter Zetsche, the mustachioed chairman of Daimler, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s parent company. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Sergio Marchionne made it to the show, but <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/01/13/sergio-marchionne-detroit-auto-show/\">declined playing ringmaster in favor of getting down to brass tacks</a> on the particulars of auto industry finance at a seminar.</p> <p>Such capitalist splendor is matched by journalists, who are known for their rumpled everyday outfits but typically dress to the nines at these events. Most men wear suits or jackets and ties, and women wear everything from smart pantsuits to elegant dresses. A small few opt to wear comfortable clothes. <br></p> <p>Each automaker gets its own area to tout its wares, and its showmanship is on display. Ford, for example, introduced three high performance vehicles \u2013 the F-150 Raptor, the Shelby GT350R and the GT super car \u2013 on the stage of the giant Joe Louis Arena. Like supermodels featuring a designer\u2019s new collection, all three vehicles were in the same shade of brilliant blue. An official driver drove the Shelby with Dukes of Hazzard-style panache, spinning its rear wheels and drifting the car around one end of the stage. The drivers for the offroad muscle truck and the supercar chose a more stately pace, appropriate to supermarket parking lots. <br></p> <p>When an automaker\u2019s turn comes to strut its stuff, a crowd gathers before the stage and attention is focused in that direction. Usually, there is a countdown clock, which, as it reaches the one-minute mark, is accompanied by music that one would expect to hear at the sort of expensive nightclub that many journalists would, when not offered free entrance by an automaker, have to wait on a long line to enter. Oomp-tsss, oomp-tsss, oomp-tsss, oomp-tsss, oomp-tsss \u2026<br></p> <p>The signal that a show has begun is usually a loud sound \u2013 music, a pyrotechnic burst, bass that causes the structural supports in the hall\u2019s ceiling to vibrate, or, sometimes, edgy guitar riffs. Each automaker has its favorite style. General Motors tends to favor rocky guitar music played at a volume that would burst eardrums if played for more than a few seconds, as well as \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/12/chevy-introduces-new-electric-bolt-200-miles-per-charge\">this year, in the case of the Bolt/Volt introduction</a> \u2013 electrical sparking sound effects to go along with the lightning bolts streaking across large video monitors positioned around the stage. Zzzztt. Zzt. Zzzzzttt-ttssss \u2026<br></p> <p>Like Detroit itself, these flashbang features don\u2019t always work as they should. The public address system stopped briefly, cutting off in half the room from the voice of Mary Barra, GM\u2019s chief executive, as she spoke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c013524e2ff626335a014798a51bdcc088b8370\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/16/1421450206887/4a7a3c85-b615-4d5c-a641-d73c7a0fb34f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"auto show\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Honda product specialist demonstrates the Uni-Cub personal mobility device during media previews for the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the introductory music over, these press conferences usually follow a predictable format.
