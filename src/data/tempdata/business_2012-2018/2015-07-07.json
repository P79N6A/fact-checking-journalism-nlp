      "bodyText": "OK, that really is all for today. Do check out my most recent summary, after a dramatic evening in which Greece was given just five days to reach a deal or face exit from the Euro. Here\u2019s Ian Traynor\u2019s take: Here\u2019s how other news outlets are reporting it: We\u2019ll be back on Wednesday morning. Thanks for reading, and for your help. Goodnight! GW The final moment of truth is approaching quickly for Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, says analyst Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence. Athens has until Sunday to agree with its lenders on a credible reform agenda so as to start negotiations for a new ESM program and potentially some bridge financing until talks are concluded and parliamentary sign-off has been achieved. If the Sunday deadline is missed, Grexit will materialize. We have the best readers in the business, I tell you. Regular contributor equusmulusoctopus has kindly translated Alexis Tsipras\u2019s statement into English, after I posted the Greek video here. We couldn\u2019t manage without you all. Another long night for the Brussels press pack: Alistair Darling, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, told bankers assembled in the Mansion House tonight that the situation in Greece could have repercussions for the UK\u2019s continued membership of the European Union. \u201cThe longer this goes on, [given] the signals it sends to the world about the eurozone and the European Union ...the more risk is the contagion will spread\u201d on both political and economic terms, said Darling, adding: \u201cPeople might think this isn\u2019t a great success ... and we may be tempted when we have our referendum ... to say that we may want to leave\u201d. Speaking at the annual dinner of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, he urged campaigners in the UK\u2019s referendum not to dwell on migration. Darling was a key figure in the Scottish referendum but stood down as an MP at the general election. He urged business leaders to speak out Europe; they were slow to do so in the Scottish referendum. And ahead of the budget on Wednesday where there is speculation that George Osborne may signal a review of the bank levy, Darling told the bankers: \u201cThe Chancellor needs money. (The industry) is an easy place to go\u201d. Donald Tusk didn\u2019t just blame Greece for the crisis, points out my colleague Ian Traynor. As covered here, Tusk spoke of \u2018All sides of the negotiations\u2019 sharing responsibility for this mess. We\u2019ve seen so many deadlines come and go since the Greek debt crisis began. But tonight, I really believe we\u2019re rattling towards a crucial decision. Europe has given Athens one last chance to produce a credible economic reform plan that could underpin a new bailout. It has also threatened that Greece will leave the eurozone if it doesn\u2019t comply before Sunday, when a new emergency summit will be held. Speaking after tonight\u2019s eurozone summit, European Council president Donald Tusk warned gravely that the next five days are the most critical in the European Union\u2019s history. He has called all 28 European leaders to Brussels on Sunday, which could be the moment that Greece begins to leave the Euro. Tusk warned: Our inability to find agreement may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece and the insolvency of its banking system. And for sure, it will be most painful for the Greek people. I have no doubt that this will affect all of Europe, also in the geo-political sense. If someone has any illusion that it will not be so, they are naive. The stark reality is that only have five days to find the ultimate agreement. Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker revealed that Europe now has a \u201cdetailed\u201d Grexit plan, suggesting a serious risk that Greece\u2019s membership of the single currency is in doubt. Juncker said: I am strongly against Grexit but I can\u2019t prevent it unless the Greek government do what they need to do. We have a Grexit scenario prepared in detail; we have a scenario as far as humanitarian aid is concerned.\u201d A series of other eurozone leaders have added their weight to Tusk\u2019s warning. French President Francois Hollande said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the problem of Greece [at stake], it\u2019s the future of the European Union\u201d Italy\u2019s Mattei Renzi said he was \u201cnot pessimistic\u201d of a deal, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ll see if on Sunday this issue will be solved once and for all,\u201d But Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel warned that Greece has not yet done enough to begin talks about a new bailout. Sunday\u2019s summit has been called, she said, \u201cbecause we think the situation is so dangerous\u201d. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek PM who arrived in Brussels with the backing of most Greek political parties, now faces the unpalatable option of signing up to a deal similar to the one that was rejected by the Greek people on Sunday. Tsipras remained optimistic, though, telling reporters: \u201cThe discussion was held in a positive atmosphere. The process will be fast, it starts in the coming hours with the aim of concluding it by the end of the week, at the latest. \u201cThe Greek side will continue the effort, having the strong weapon of the Greek people\u2019s verdict ... the vast majority\u2019s will for a viable agreement to end the discussion (about a Grexit) and offer the prospect of finally exiting the crisis.\u201d Earlier in the evening Tsipras had presented his case for a new bailout to EU leaders, raising hopes that a deal was still possible. It still is, but the consequences of failure have never been quite this clear. So what happens next? On Wednesday morning, Greece must resubmit a modified bailout request to the Eurogroup of finance ministers. They will then discuss it on a conference call. And Tsipras is due to appear before the European Parliament on Wednesday morning, at 9am Brussels time (8am BST). And the political reaction in Athens will also be crucial. Here\u2019s a videoclip of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s statement following tonight\u2019s summit (no English translation, sorry) There is a glimmer of a possibility that Sunday\u2019s summit may yet be cancelled, from the leaders of Luxembourg and Austria: That also suggests, though, that if the Summit does go ahead, it will be to discuss Greece\u2019s exit from the single currency. The Austrian leader also criticised Tsipras\u2019s decision to call a referendum on Sunday: Austria\u2019s chancellor, Walter Faymann, has warned that Sunday\u2019s summit will talk about Plan B (ie, Grexit), unless there is a deal by then. Leader will also have to provide humanitarian aid for the poorest in Greece if a deal isn\u2019t reached, he adds. Faymann also warns that the situation in Greek bank reserves is \u201cserious\u201d, and said that leaders can\u2019t discuss writing off some Greek debt. Francois Hollande has given his own briefing. He says the Eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) will meet on Saturday to consider Greece\u2019s proposals, ready for the Sunday summit. A deal is still possible, Hollande adds, talking about the need to keep Berlin and Paris aligned: It\u2019s all go in Brussels tonight. Greece\u2019s PM is now giving an inpromptu press conference. Tsipras says that he submitted proposals that aim to deliver a \u201csocially just and economically viable agreement\u201d. They included \u201ccredible reforms\u201d, in return for funding commitments. We had a \u201cpositive\u201d discussion, he says, and the target is to conclude the process by the end of the week at the latest Our aim, Tsipras concludes, is to achieve a \u201cfinal exit from the crisis\u201d. (quotes via Reuters) How long does Greece have to produce detailed proposals? The deadline is 8.30am Friday morning, Juncker replies. Juncker also insists that he doesn\u2019t want Greece to leave the euro, but it cannot be ruled out. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Council, says the Greek crisis is a matter that affects the entire EU. We have a Grexit scenario, prepared in detail, he reveals. Thumping the lectern, Juncker demands to know how Greek officials dared to call the EC terrorists. Greece didn\u2019t manage to supply a detailed reform plan tonight, but they need to do it fast. Why are all 28 leaders coming to Sunday\u2019s summit? We cannot avoid the possibility that there will not be a proposal on the table by Sunday, Tusk says, mentioning the \u2018black\u2019 scenario. And we may need to consider the issue of humanitarian aid for Greece. I have no doubt that this is the most critical moment in our history - Europe and the Eurozone. No doubt that having all leaders around the table is the right thing to do, he concludes. Donald Tusk then gives a stark warning that there are just five days to avoid the worst-case scenario and save Greece from bankruptcy. The European Council president says: All sides of the negotiations share responsibility for the current status quo. That is why today I called leaders to try to find a consensus which will be our common success with no losers or winners. If that doesn\u2019t happen, it will means the end of the negotiations with all the possible consequences including the worst case scenario where all of us will lose. Our inability to find agreement may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece and the insolvency of its banking system. And for sure, it will be most painful for the Greek people. I have no doubt that this will affect all of Europe, also in the geo-political sense. If someone has any illusion that it will not be so, they are naive. The stark reality is that only have five days to find the ultimate agreement. Until now I have avoided talking about deadlines, but tonight I have to say it loud and clear - the final deadline ends this week. All of us are responsible for the crisis, and all of us have a responsibility to resolve it. Donald Tusk speaks first, telling reporters that: We met tonight to discuss the serious situation in Greece. Following the Greek referendum, Alexis Tsipras agreed to apply for a new bailout including strict conditionality. Greece will set out, by Thursday 9th July at the latest, its reform plans. Heads of state and government will meet on Sunday 12 July. OK, let\u2019s break away from Angela Merkel\u2019s press conference - because presidents Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are giving their own briefing. Livestream is here Did leaders discuss the possibility that Greece might have to issue a parallel currency? No, we didn\u2019t, Merkel replied - and then she seemed to suggest that this is a matter for European finance ministers to consider. Important point -- Greece has not yet done enough to start negotiations about a new bailout programme: The economic conditions in Greece have not improved in the last 10 days, Merkel adds wryly. Why are all 28 EU members coming to Sunday\u2019s meeting? Is it because Greece could soon be out of the euro? We are all linked together in Europe, says Angela Merkel. Given the importance of the situation it is appropriate that all 28 leaders are there. First, Greece must produce long-term proposals, and then we could talk about short-term financing needs, Merkel continues. In other words -- the eurozone isn\u2019t prepared to just kick the can by a couple of months, it wants to see a proper third bailout programme. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s hand may have been strengthened by Sunday\u2019s referendum, Merkel adds, but the freedom of manoeuvre of the other 18 members has been reduced. Angela Merkel is giving a press conference now. She confirms that Greece will submit a loan request and a list of reform proposals on Wednesday, and also expects \u201cdetailed Greek proposals\u201d for a new multi-year programme on Thursday. She says leaders had a very clear and candid discussion at today\u2019s summit. We respect the result of a referendum, but there are 18 other states whose sovereignty needs to be considered. It was a very long, intensive discussion, that reflects the seriousness of the situation at hand, the German chancellor adds. It\u2019s official! European leaders are going to meet again on Sunday for another meeting to discuss Greece. That\u2019s via Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who is briefing the press now (live feed). A cheerful looking Renzi says: Tonight the decision is that we wait until Sunday for the new proposals to be submitted to the Institutions from the Greek government I hope this could be the last meeting for Greece. I hope it could be a happy ending. I think we can achieve an agreement on Sunday. I am not pessimistic about it. Renzi then repeats his call for Europe to be reformed to stimulate growth and investment, and to move beyond the Greek crisis. Sounds like the Euro Summit has ended -- onto the press conferences, where we\u2019ll find out what happened tonight. And here\u2019s Reuters take on tonight\u2019s last-ditch push to find a deal for Greece: Euro zone leaders could hold a further emergency summit on Sunday to approve a plan to aid Greece if creditor institutions are satisfied with a Greek loan application and reform commitments, two senior EU sources said. The leaders were meeting on Tuesday evening in Brussels with Greek banks shuttered and fast running out of cash and the Greek economy on the verge of collapse. The sources set out a tentative timetable that could offer a breakthrough to keep Greece afloat and in the euro zone, provided it accepts credible reforms and spending cuts to make its public finances sustainable in the mid-term. The Wall Street Journal has a good take on the emergency financing that eurozone leaders have been discussing tonight: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras came to a meeting of eurozone leaders in Brussels with a proposal for interim financing until the end of the month, a senior Greek government official said. \u201cIn return, Greece will pass some of the overhauls demanded by the country\u2019s international creditors, the official said, adding that Greece remained open to other ideas for \u201ca big viable solution.\u201d France, which has been Greece\u2019s biggest eurozone ally, is pushing for a deal in which Athens accepts and passes the budgetary measures\u2014with limited changes\u2014that were in the plan that was rejected by Greek voters in their referendum Sunday. Greece would then receive immediate financing and the prospect of a future restructuring of its debt, a senior French official said.... More here: Eurozone Considers Proposal to Offer Greece Interim Funding We\u2019re hearing that tonight\u2019s talks haven\u2019t gone disastrously, so far..... (coffee? Excellent idea) The chief of Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s cabinet, Martin Selmayr, just tweeted a photo of a rainbow over the European Commission - and called it a sign of hope. That must be an optimistic sign, right? Back in Brussels, there are more reports that Greece and its creditors are talking about a short-term agreement followed by a long-term one. Dow Jones newswires says the deal would centre on the proposals on the table before Sunday\u2019s referendum (where they were rejected by the people) but with some pledge on debt relief.... Hilary Clinton has echoed Barack Obama\u2019s call on Europe to do more to resolve Greece: Our own Ian Traynor grabbed a word with Euclid Tsakalotos as Greece\u2019s new finance minister fought his way though the press area in Brussels tonight. Ian reports: He told me things: one, that his wife was from Glasgow; two, \u201cI am pleased with the progress we have made today\u201d Both good signs, I\u2019d say. Tsakalotos\u2019s wife is economist Heather D. Gibson, who advises the Bank of Greece. Eurozone summits look more productive if you speed the action up: I think a recap might be helpful. Eurozone leaders are locked in an emergency summit tonight that will, most likely, determine Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, has laid out Athens\u2019 plans for a new aid programme. There are reports that Greece going to ask for a short-term funding deal, to cover its immediate needs, and then a longer package. Sources have told the Guardian that Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, wants a decision tonight on whether a third bailout package is viable. That will determine whether talks resume with Greece, or whether the eurozone starts planning to lose a member. The stakes tonight are desperately high, as leaders talk over their vichyssoise soup, cod fillet, and chocolate mousse. As Ireland\u2019s Enda Kenny put it: The time is now to bring some hope, certainty and stability to the people of Greece in the medium term, for they are now suffering. Speculation is rife that a summit could be called on Sunday - either to hammer out a Greek aid plan, or to prepare Grexit. My colleague Ian Traynor has also heard that EU officials are planning ways to help Greece avoid defaulting on \u20ac3.5bn owed to the ECB on 20 July. But Eurozone leaders have already warned that Greece cannot expect any debt relief soon. And President Barack Obama has piled more pressure on both sides to find a solution that keeps Greece in the single currency. Earlier, Greece\u2019s new finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos attended his first eurogroup meeting. Afterwards, he told reporters there is \u2018political will\u2019 for a deal. The White House has confirmed that President Obama spoke with Angela Merkel today, and pushed her to avoid Greece leaving the eurozone. There is a way that Greece could agree a bailout programme and avoid defaulting on its payments to the European Central Bank in two weeks, if tonight\u2019s negotiations go well. Europe editor Ian Traynor has been speaking to insiders, and explains: If the option of a new Greek bailout through the ESM gets the go-ahead, the best predictions of actual cash disbursements are mid-to end August, way too late to stop Greece defaulting big time on the \u20ac3.5bn in bonds it must redeem at the ECB on July 20 (as explained earlier). But given a modicum of goodwill, something so far in very short supply (although the general temper today has been a lot better than when Yanis Varoufakis was doing the rounds), there is a fix available to the ECB problem. When Greece\u2019s 2nd bailout expired last Tuesday, some \u20ac3.3bn in ECB profits from its securities markets programme due to Greece also vanished [that\u2019s money that the ECB made from bailing Greece out]. For 2014 the profits amounted to \u20ac1.85bn. These are held in an ESM account and could be released to the Greeks if the eurogroup so decided. There is also a further \u20ac1.5bn currently held by eurozone governments. This money could also be released to the Greeks -- meaning the ECB problem is effectively solved. A eurozone source says: \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy solution, but probably the only solution,\u201d The advantage here is that this money could be released without having to wait for any tiresome parliamentary procedures. But the fly in the ointment here is that both wads of cash need to be authorised by the eurogroup unanimously, meaning that a single country could veto the whole show. The German finance ministry, for example, has been sending negative signals on this, indeed it has been demanding back \u20ac500m of the money held by the ESM, the 2014 profits. More developments......various sources are reporting that Greece is sending a letter tonight, outlining its request for a new bailout. This may be significant. While he was being chased through the press centre, Greece\u2019s new finance minister told reporters that there is \u2018political will\u2019 in Brussels to give Athens another chance. The FT\u2019s Paris bureau chief, Anne Sylvaine Chassany, explains how Greece could actually seek two bailouts this year: But it won\u2019t get any aid unless it signs up to meaningful reforms (the \u2018conditionality\u2019 Ian just mentioned) Hungry work, saving the eurozone: We can\u2019t blame Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos for wanting to mingle with the press pack: One at a time, guys... The measure of (qualified) success or failure tonight is whether there\u2019s an actual agreement/decision to open a new negotiation towards a new bailout for Greece from via the European Stability Mechanism, Ian adds. Alexis Tsipras is said to be laying out his position to the summit now, reports Ian Traynor in Brussels. Donald Tusk will then ask ECB president Mario Draghi, EC president Jean-Claude Juncker, and Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem for their views. Draghi is expected to dwell on capital controls and the dire condition of the Greek banks, Dijsselbloem is to brief on this afternoon\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Juncker\u2019s contribution is less than clear. These expositions are likely to be followed by a broader exchange on the feasibility of a new longer-term ESM bailout, the conditionality [the reforms Greece would commit to], the deadlines. Basically, by the end of the evening, they should have decided whether the eurozone and Greece should open a new negotiation. This, from EU sources, is perhaps the upbeat narrative. The more depressing scenario circulating is of another summit on Sunday, but not of the eurozone but of all 28 leaders, a full EU summit. If that transpires, the meat of the meeting is Grexit. If a tentative accord to proceed with the ESM option is not looking good by the weekend, The Full Monty of Grexit becomes the dominant narrative, with Draghi throwing up his hands, saying he can\u2019t do any more and the Greek banks collapsing. Bloomberg\u2019s Arne Delfs is also hearing that we might all be back in five days: Speculation continues to swirl around Brussels that another summit will be called on Sunday. One theory is that Greece will submit a request for a short-term aid agreement, to tide it over the immediate funding crisis. And Reuters says there is a \u201ctentative plan\u201d for a Sunday summit to approve \u2018any plan to aid Greece\u2019. One of the more ominous realisations here is that the press pack\u2019s accreditation cards for this evening\u2019s summit are valid simply for \u201cJuly.\u201d Usually, for security reasons, they only show the date of the meeting. A month of summits? Groan. Barack Obama has been hitting the phones in an attempt to help break the deadlock. That follows his call with Alexis Tsipras earlier today. Donald Tusk, chairing the eurozone summit, wants the leaders to take a decision tonight on whether Greece can obtain a new, longer-term bailout deal from the European Stability Mechanism, EU sources said. A green light for such a move will depend on what Tsipras tells the summit, they added, displaying frustration that the Greeks had not yet, as expected, formally submitted proposals for a rescue package. Although a Greek application will be made to the European Stability Mechanism on Wednesday, officials also said Tsipras could also spring a surprise and unveil his proposals at this evening\u2019s summit. Brussels reporters have just had a rather nasty shock: Alexis Tsipras spoke with Mario Draghi before the summit began - perhaps to push the ECB to provide more liquidity to the Greek banking sector: It\u2019s not clear that the conversation went well: And then the leaders took their seats to discuss Greece: Talk to the hands..... From Brussels, Jennifer Rankin sums up the situation: The Greek government has been told by its eurozone partners not to expect debt relief any time soon, amid fading hopes of decisive action to stop the country tumbling out of the currency union. Arriving at an emergency summit of eurozone leaders, Angela Merkel said there was no clear basis to negotiate with Athens after Greek voters rejected an EU bailout plan in a referendum on Sunday. The German chancellor warned that time was running out. \u201cIt is not a matter of weeks anymore, it is a matter of days.\u201d Eurozone finance ministers meeting ahead of the summit made it clear they were waiting on Athens to make the first move and were in no hurry to discuss debt relief. Diplomatic niceties were abandoned as it emerged Greece\u2019s new finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos had not come armed with detailed proposals. \u201c[With] the Greek government it is every time ma\u00f1ana,\u201d said Lithuania\u2019s president Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, one of the Greek government\u2019s most tough-talking critics. \u201cIt can always be ma\u00f1ana every day.\u201d Greek banks are almost out of cash and some Eurozone figures are already saying that Grexit is the only option for the debt-ridden country. The head of Latvia\u2019s central bank told domestic radio that the \u201cbrave\u201d Greek nation had \u201cvoted itself out of the eurozone\u201d... Here\u2019s her full report from the Summit: Get ready to cancel your weekend plans (again) folks: Greece\u2019s financial situation is extremely serious. Even if progress is made tonight, there is no hope of any fresh bailout cash being granted soon. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor explains: Eurozone sources said that under the formal new bailout proposal to be tabled on Wednesday, it would take several weeks before Greece could hope to receive any disbursements. None of that money would be possible before July 20 when Greece has to pay the European Central Bank \u20ac3.5bn. Any agreement on a programme from the permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, would have to be medium-term and would come with \u201ctight conditionality.\u201d Failure to repay the European Central Bank on July 20 could have very serious consequences; the ECB could respond by terminating the emergency liquidity assistance provided to Greek banks (which is already capped, of course) The summit is just getting underway.... Alexis Tsipras remained cheerful at his meeting with the heads of Germany, France and the Commission; Hollande and Juncker look less amused: Italian prime minister Mattei Renzi sounded more optimistic than other leaders - he told reporters that a deal with Greece can be found in the hours ahead. Renzi also cautioned, though, that Europe needs more than a mere \u2018technical solution\u2019 to the crisis: Oh dear... Alex Stubb, Finland\u2019s finance minister, tweets that today\u2019s meeting was \u2018useful\u2019, even though Greece hasn\u2019t submitted a request for aid yet. \u201cWe need a deal here\u201d declares Irish leader Enda Kenny as he arrives at tonight\u2019s summit. The time is now to bring some hope, certainty and stability to the people of Greece in the medium term, for they are now suffering. I look forward \u201cvery much\u201d to hear what prime minister Tsipras has to say, Kenny adds, before heading inside. Ouch! Over in Athens, the Greek government is INSISTING that it has already tabled proposals that still stand, says Helena Smith. If there was ever any proof that the leftist-led coalition is still not singing from the same hymn sheet as foreign lenders, it was produced in the last five minutes when the government issued one of its famous \u201cnon--papers\u201d declaring: \u201cThe Greeks side delivered proposals the previous Tuesday which remain on the table with some improvements. These proposals include reforms, financing, the investment programs and the restructuring of debt.\u201d The Greek government\u2019s proposals will be discussed today and tomorrow, so that, soon, a mutually beneficial agreement can be closed with the mandate of the referendum as its base. An agreement, which at the same time, will reintroduce liquidity to the banking system.\u201d Here\u2019s the transcript of Jeroen Dijsselbloem\u2019s statement after today\u2019s inconclusive Eurogroup meeting: Away from the talking in Brussels, Greece\u2019s economy is bleeding. My colleague Phoebe Greenwood has visited the Athens market district, to find a dreadful scene of deserted shops, piles of unsold meat and vegetables, and shop-keepers and cafe owners on the brink of shutting down. This is what capital controls does to a country, when people are unwilling and simply unable to spend. Here\u2019s Phoebe\u2019s unmissable video: The Greek government has just confirmed that prime minister Alexis Tsipras is meeting German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the French president Francois Hollande and the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The statement did not state what either group hoped to achieve. Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande, Alexis Tsipras and Jean-Claude Juncker are now locked in a room with their advisors: More from Francois Hollande: Another car sweeps into the arrivals zone, and out springs...Francois Hollande. The French president says that Greece needs serious, credible, proposals and must present its reforms quickly. Like Angela Merkel, he is also speaking about the importance that Eurozone countries show responsibility, as well as solidarity. Barack Obama, US president, has spoken with Alexis Tsipras about Greece\u2019s proposals, according to a Greek official. That underlines how concerned America is about the prospect of the crisis escalating. Ever the optimist, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is still hopeful that a Greek agreement can be reached... Here comes Angela Merkel...and she heads straight to the press microphones to deliver a clear message. There is still no basis for negotiations after the very clear no in the Greek referendum on Sunday. Solidarity at the European level, and responsibility at national level are still important. Without solidarity and without reforms we cannot embark on this path. And the chancellor concludes by warning that time is extremely short: It\u2019s not a matter of weeks any more, it\u2019s a matter of days. Alexis Tsipras has arrived at the summit looking cheerful and relaxed, but doesn\u2019t stop to speak to the press (boo!). Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has a stark warning as he arrives at the summit. Greece is taking a big risk, the only solution is to make reforms. If it doesn\u2019t come with proposals soon, eurozone leaders won\u2019t be able to help. Leaders are now arriving in droves at the emergency summit on Greece. Jean-Claude Juncker, Commission president, tells reporters that the solution to the crisis \u201cdepends on Mr Tsipras\u201d. I am always happy to meet with him to discuss the situation, he adds. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup, is giving his statement now. He says that eurozone finance ministers will hold a conference call on Wednesday to discuss a request from Greece for financial assistance through the European Stability Mechanism. He confirms that the Greek government did not submit a written request today - remarkable, really, given the urgency of the crisis now -- but will produce one by tomorrow. They better had do..... Euclid Tsakalotos appears to have committed a schoolboy error at his first eurogroup meeting, by allowing his notes (written on hotel paper!) to be photographed. It includes a reminder to avoid any \u201ctriumphalism\u201d (presumably following Sunday\u2019s referendum) The Eurogroup is officially over, according to social media manager Finland\u2019s finance chief, Alex Stubb: European Council president Donald Tusk and ECB president Mario Draghi are discussing the Greek situation, before tonight\u2019s emergency summit. This crisis is no laughing matter, chaps. No pushing at the back! The press pack are ready to watch Jeroen Dijsselbloem\u2019s statement following the end of Eurogroup meeting. As if there wasn\u2019t enough drama, Alexis Tsipras is to address the European Parliament on Wednesday morning: That\u2019s via EP president Martin Schulz: You can watch eurozone leaders arrive for tonight\u2019s Greek summit here: EbS Live and possibly also here EbS+ Live. Disappointing: Jeroen Dijsselbooem\u2019s statement following the Eurogroup meeting may not be streamed live.... I\u2019m sure the Brussels press pack will do their usual bang-up job of tweeting the key points, though.... As one meeting ends, another is beginning.... Mario Draghi, the ECB president, just arrived at tonight\u2019s summit of Eurozone leaders, but slipped inside without speaking to the press. All may not be lost -- Euclid Tsakalotos has apparently verbally outlined Greece\u2019s plans to the rest of the eurogroup: But will it be good enough, given the remarkable news that Athens didn\u2019t produce some written proposals. We\u2019ll find out in a few minutes... The British Ambassador to Greece, John Kittmer, has issued a statement - reassuring tourists that his staff are prepared to help then enjoy their holidays: \u201cMy teams in Athens and on Rhodes, Corfu, Crete and Zakynthos are here to support British nationals who find themselves in need. As we enter peak holiday season we have strengthened our consular offices. \u201cGreece is a hospitable country, and Greeks will do all they can in exceptional times to make tourists welcome. There are no reports from tour operators to suggest that there are disruptions to services on the islands. My Embassy has been planning carefully, so that British holiday makers arrive well prepared and can complete their holidays with peace of mind.\u201d But as flagged earlier, tourists shouldn\u2019t count on being able to access cash or medicines during their stay. It does appear that today\u2019s Eurogroup has failed to make progress.... Word from Brussels - Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Eurogroup president, will speak in around half an hour: Britain has updated its travel advice for holidaymakers, to warn that Greek banks will remain closed until at least the close of business on 8 July. It also advices that people take enough cash, and medicines, for the full length of their stay and any \u201cunexpected delays\u201d, and warns that cash machines and credit card transactions \u201ccould potentially become limited at short notice.\u201d The confusion continues: Multiple sources are now reporting that Greece hasn\u2019t brought new proposals to the Eurogroup (as rumoured earlier). The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel says: According to a third eurozone official, Greece will instead present its new plan tomorrow. No wonder Euclid looked rather melancholy as he arrived at today\u2019s meeting. Bet your bottom euro that tomorrow.... EC president Donald Tusk has been speaking to Alexis Tsipras to prepare for tonight\u2019s meeting: Meanwhile here is the letter from Greek president Prokopis Pavlopoulos to Tusk outlining Monday\u2019s declaration by most of the country\u2019s party leaders, which he hopes will lead to a \u201cviable agreement\u201d. He also maintains the No vote was not a mandate for leaving the eurozone. July 7, 2015 Dear Mr. President, I would like to inform you that following a request by the Prime Minister of Greece Mr. Alexis Tsipras, I called a meeting yesterday of the political leaders of the Parties of the Greek Parliament, in which a common declaration was adopted by all Parties except the Communist Party of Greece stating the following: The recent vote of the Greek people in the referendum does not constitute a mandate to break away from the Euro zone, but a mandate to continue and strengthen the effort for attaining a socially just and economically viable agreement. The Government will assume the responsibility of continuing negotiations, and every political leader will contribute to this effort on the basis of their institutional and political role. The common goal, in this context, is the pursuit of a solution that will ensure: - Covering, sufficiently, the financial needs of the country - Credible reforms, based on a fair distribution of burdens and the promotion of growth, with as few recessionary consequences as possible - A strong, front-loaded developmental program, primarily oriented to confronting unemployment and encouraging entrepreneurship - A commitment to beginning a substantial discussion on confronting the problem of the viability of Greek public debt The Political Leaders also underlined that the restoration of liquidity in the Greek banking system, in coordination with the ECB, constitutes an immediate priority. The aforementioned consensual decision of most Greek Parliamentary parties constitutes a crucial opportunity for all euro zone partners to reach an economically and politically viable agreement. I remain, Sincerely yours Prokopis Pavlopoulos Not a promising sign: Could be a short statement after a short meeting if Greece really hasn\u2019t brought any new proposals to the table. Euclid Tsakalotos has attended eurogroup meetings before, but today is the first time he\u2019s arrived as a full-blown finance minister. He\u2019s been welcomed by Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem (who probably isn\u2019t pining for Yanis Varoufakis): Before getting down to business: It can be a lonely business, being Greece\u2019s finance minister: Especially if everyone else wants to listen to Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble: And then they got down to business, discussing Greece and its new proposals (assuming there are any.....) The eurozone leaders meeting has been put back by half an hour, says Jennifer Rankin in Brussels, but this is nothing unusual. Surely not? A good sign ahead of the summit (as seen by Kate Connolly in Berlin)? Irish finance minister Michael Noonan is hopeful for a new proposal: But he said: There is a lot to do in a very short period of time, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at a conclusion today. But I hope there\u2019s proper engagement. More from Finland\u2019s Alexander Stubb. We are looking at three things. One. The short term financial needs of Greece. Money is running out, at the latest by 20 July. Two. The role of Greece in the eurozone after the referendum. Three. We have to deepen economic co-operations inside the euro. We are not looking at Grexit. On a possible deal today: I am an eternal optimist but I don\u2019t think we will have a result today. It is about listening and learning what the Greek government will do after the referendum. We won\u2019t be able to put forward any new commitments. We will keep the doors to negotiations open. We are not in the business of renegotiating debt. Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg ( which currently holds the presidency) said they respected the results of the referendum, but now new proposals were needed. We need to understand how [the Greek government] will resolve the contradiction - they want to stay in the eurozone but they say the proposals on the table are not acceptable. [On debt relief] we have to look at all the options, everything must be discussed. Lithuania\u2019s Rimantas Sadzuis said what was needed was more clarity, following the referendum result. Grexit is not the option for us. The eurozone should expand rather than contract. But Greece needs to perform reforms. In politics there is always room for compromise. Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos said Grexit is not what anyone wants: More talk of Grexit, this time from Latvian finance minister J\u0101nis Reirs: More quashing of hopes on Greece\u2019s debt, from Finnish finance minister Alexander Stubb. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, asked if Greece can keep the euro, said you must ask the Greek goverment (quote from Reuters) EC vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said: If trust is not rebuilt, if there is no credible reform plan in place [Grexit] cannot be excluded. Slovakia\u2019s Peter Kazimir said a viable deal was only possible at the highest level: I am sceptical a deal will be found today. The referendum result did not change the reality of Greece. Greece is behind the curve. On debt relief, he said that was a red line: For my country nominal debt relief is impossible. As he arrived at the meeting, Belgium finance minister Johan Van Overtveldt said: The [Greek] economy is in freefall. The banking system is in freefall. We don\u2019t have much time. It is all about the Greek proposals EC economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovic said the Eurogroup was not about discussing Greece\u2019s debt. He said it was up to Greek government to give concrete proposals, to say where they want to go. There has been a lot of mistrust, we have to rebuild that. Let us see what the intentions of the Greek government are. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said finance ministers were still waiting for the Greek proposals, and needed to see if they were credible. As he arrived at the Eurogroup meeting, he was asked if a new Greek finance minister would help talks, Dijsselbloem said it was not about personalities but \u201cwhere we stand politically.\u201d The No [vote] means the old proposals were rejected, It is very difficult. We await the new proposals and see if they are credible. Asked if they had not already been delivered and were a version of the previous reforms, he said: You seem to have them, I am going in to see my colleagues. We have been doing whatever it takes to strengthen the eurozone and keep it together. We can\u2019t have an outcome which would damage our credibility. It has to be credible for the future of Greece and the eurozone We will be working on that and hopefully getting a solution. The eurozone finance ministers are arriving in Brussels (live feed here) but nothing revalatory so far: Russia and Greece have played down the idea of any financial aid but: Greece\u2019s proposals to the Eurogroup will be broadly similar to the plan which was rejected in the referendum, according to S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung (in German). It would keep the VAT rebate for islands, leave VAT for restaurants at 13% and contain limited cuts in defence spending. VAT and pensions were of course the famous red lines, beyond which the Greek government would not go. Meanwhile in the Stern report, Germany\u2019s Gabriel hinted at the possibility of discussing debt relief but only if Greece agrees to reforms: \u201cIf we simply emphasize debt, without that much will change fundamentally in Greece, nothing is won,\u201d said Gabriel; they could also talk about \u201cthe possibility of reducing the debt, only talk if the Greek Government also indicates that will implement reforms.\u201dBut he was confident \u201cat the end we will find a way out of the crisis in Greece\u201d. Oil has recovered some ground after a plunge on Monday. Brent crude is currently up 1.75% at $57.53 a barrel following a drop of more than 6% on Monday. The price fall came as China\u2019s stock market fell again, amid worries about the country\u2019s future growth and thus its demand for oil, as well as the uncertainty caused by the Greek referendum. Talks in Vienna over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme could - if an agreement is reached - lead to increased supplies from Iran at a time of global oversupply. The European Central Bank has clarified some of the rules on the emergency liquidity assistance, a day after tightening the conditions for Greece. In a document on its website the ECB suggested it was concerned that loosening the rules for Greece could lead others to act less responsibly. Bloomberg reports: The Eurosystem\u2019s functioning could be disrupted by \u201cprovision of ELA at overly generous conditions, which, in turn, could increase the risk of moral hazard on the side of financial institutions or responsible authorities,\u201d the ECB said in a document published on its website Tuesday. \u201cThe objective of ELA is to support solvent credit institutions facing temporary liquidity problems. It is not a monetary-policy instrument.\u201d The document on the ECB\u2019s financial-risk management clarifies the conditions surrounding emergency bank aid at a time when policy makers are restricting the provision of such funding to Greek banks. The reference to moral hazard indicates that officials are worried that bending the liquidity rules for Greece, as the country heads for a possible default, may lead future recipients to act less responsibly. On Monday, the ECB increased the discounts on collateral for lenders receiving ELA from the Bank of Greece. That makes it more difficult for banks to access the funds that have kept them alive as deposit withdrawals accelerated amid uncertainty over the country\u2019s place in the euro. Marks &amp; Spencer boss Marc Bolland said he felt it was important to remain in Greece where the retailer has 20 stores via a joint venture that has been in place since 1978. He told reporters following a trading update: \u201cWe have taken steps to continue to trade there at the moment. The situation might change every day but over the last week stores have been trading at 60% to 70% [of the level of normal sales]. At a time when people are only able to get \u20ac60 out of a cash machine, that\u2019s remarkable.\u201d He said staff had been paid. Bolland said Greece made up about 5% of M&amp;S\u2019s international business and so was \u201cvery small\u201d but he added: \u201cWe feel it is important to stay in Greece.\u201d German vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has admitted it was a mistake to allow Greece into the euro. Here\u2019s a translation of the report: SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel has for the first time admitted that it was a mistake to allow Greece to join the euro zone. \u201cThe entry of Greece into the euro was done, from today\u2019s perspective, very naively,\u201d Gabriel said in an interview with Stern. \u201cWorse is that all have watched far too long\u201d as the country fell deeper and deeper into crisis, added the Vice-Chancellor. Full report here (in German) The Greek government is to blame for the current crisis and not Germany, according to Italy\u2019s foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni. APF reports: Greeks have their own leaders to blame for the crisis in their country, and not \u201cmean Germans\u201d, Gentiloni said Tuesday. The current crisis \u201c...is not the fault of mean Germans, but is the responsibility of the Greek governments which have followed one another these past 15-20 years,\u201d he told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera.| Germany, the eurozone\u2019s de facto paymaster, has been the driving force behind requiring austerity policies to accompany bailout help for Greece. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that conditions for a new Greek rescue package \u201chave not yet been met.\u201d Capital Economics reckons a Grexit is likely sooner or later whatever happens today: Asked whether the Greek referendum success would mean other populist governments might use a plebiscite as a political weapon, he said: \u201cThis has been discussed...what would happen if a referendum in another country put in doubt a compromise with Greece. \u201cWe are in a difficult situation but we hope will will get a compromise acceptable to everyone.\u201d European president Martin Schulz has said he wants Greece to remain in the eurozone. He told a press conference: \u201cI\u2019m in favour of keeping the eurozone together. Those who want to split up the eurozone are wrong.\u201d But he said it all depended on the new proposals from the Greek government: \u201cConfrontation is not a solution... we need to get both sides together.\u201d With fears growing that Greece will leave the eurozone, as leaders travel to Brussels for last ditch talks, the euro is coming under pressure. It is now fallen to below $1.10, its lowest level for more than a month. At least three companies in Greece are paying staff in cash after the capital controls imposed last week to limit withdrawals from banks, according to Reuters. The companies include Kotsovolos, the country\u2019s biggest electronics retailer and a subsidiary of Britain\u2019s Dixons Carphone. Here\u2019s an interesting chart from the economics team at RBS: Greece\u2019s stock market will remain closed until Wednesday according to the Greek Capital Markets Commission, in line with the extended bank holiday. Twitter (Varoufakis quits announcement), Facebook (Italian prime minister\u2019s latest view on what must be done), and now texting. The modern way to run a crisis. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, will reportedly be staying at home rather than attending the day\u2019s meetings in Brussels. Not a surprise really. Greece is already in arrears with the IMF after failing to make a $1.5bn payment due at the end of last month, so it is unlikely the fund would be taking part in any new bailout until that money is paid. And the IMF also threw a spanner into the works just ahead of Greece\u2019s referendum by saying that debt relief should be part of any new package, something seized on by Alexis Tsipras and his colleagues. And if 16 out of 18 eurozone countries are in favour of Greece leaving then who are the other two? Investors remain cautious ahead of the day\u2019s meetings, with markets edging higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 has added 0.1%, France\u2019s Cac is 0.2% better, Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 0.14%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.6%, and Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 0.2%. In the bond market Greek two-year and ten year yields have slipped back slightly, while ten-year yields for other peripherals - Italy, Spain and Portugal - are also a little lower. And today\u2019s \u201cBall is in the Greek\u2019s court Award\u201d goes to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Speaking in Strasbourg, he said: But he must be glad to see the back of Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister who described the country\u2019s creditors as \u201cterrorists\u201d Interesting snippet in the report on Monday\u2019s events by Greek newspaper Kathimerini: According to sources in Brussels, 16 of the other 18 countries in the eurozone are in favor of letting Greece leave the eurozone and they will have to weigh up the cost of any agreement to keep Athens in the single currency. Breaking news: Here are the expected timings for two Brussels meetings later. First the Eurogroup of finance ministers: 12:00 (Brussels time, 11.00 BST) Arrivals 13:00 (12.00 BST) Roundtable chaired by Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem The agenda is as follows: The Eurogroup will discuss the situation following the referendum in Greece that was held on 5 July 2015. Ministers expect new proposals from the Greek authorities. And here\u2019s the details of the leaders\u2019 summit: From 17.00 (16.00 BST) Arrival of the heads of state or government of the Euro area 18.00 (17.00 BST) Working dinner at the end of the meeting Press conference by the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission And European markets are forecast to open higher ahead of the day\u2019s key meetings: Markets came under pressure on Monday following the No victory in the Greek referendum, but things were nothing like as bad as some had feared. Economist Ian Williams at Peel Hunt said: Given the apocalyptic predictions of the consequences of a Greek \u2018no\u2019 vote made before the weekend, losses of around 2% for the Eurozone indices should have been greeted with a sigh of relief. Similarly, the moves in Eurozone bond markets were modest, in the context of recently heightened levels of volatility. That sanguine response may not be so much based on optimism that a compromise deal can still be reached (given the removal of Mr Varoufakis) as reflecting a judgement that, even if Grexit is now more likely than before, the broader economic consequences for the region can be contained. The Eurozone\u2019s peripheral markets were understandably less sanguine than the core, with Italy\u2019s MIB index losing 4% and the IBEX in Spain 2.2%. Asian markets were mixed, with the Nikkei up 1.3% but the Hang Seng down 0.6%. And China continued its recent slump: Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the continuing eurozone crisis and the latest attempts to broker a deal between Greece and its creditors. With time running out - to quote German Chancellor Angela Merkel - Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is set to present new proposals following his resounding victory in Sunday\u2019s referendum. Finance ministers will meet later to consider what Greece has put on the table, with European leaders discussing the situation in an emergency summit this evening. Here\u2019s Ian Traynor\u2019s story looking at the prospects for a deal: Germany and France scrambled to avoid a major split over Greece on Monday evening as the eurozone delivered a damning verdict on Alexis Tsipras\u2019s landslide referendum victory on Sunday and Angela Merkel demanded that the Greek prime minister put down new proposals to break the deadlock. As concerns mount that Greek banks will run out of cash and about the damage being inflicted on the country\u2019s economy, hopes for a breakthrough faded. EU leaders voiced despair and descended into recrimination over how to respond to Sunday\u2019s overwhelming rejection of eurozone austerity terms as the price for keeping Greece in the currency. Tsipras, meanwhile, moved to insure himself against purported eurozone plots to topple him and force regime change by engineering a national consensus of the country\u2019s five mainstream parties behind his negotiating strategy, focused on securing debt relief. Full story here: One key participant will be new Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, appointed after the resignation of his colourful predecessor Yanis Varoufakis on Monday. Here is our profile of Tskalotos. Meanwhile Greek banks will not reopen today after capital controls were extended until at least tomorrow. The European Central Bank put more pressure on the Greek system by tightening the rules for giving emergency funding. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: [The ECB move} is likely to increase criticism that the central bank is getting involved in exerting political pressure and acting beyond its mandate of price stability, and as lender of last resort, which any credible central bank should do as a matter of course. All the ECB has done is make it more likely that Greek banks will run out of money in a matter of days. Furthermore it remains highly unlikely that the Greek government will be able to make it to the next key payment deadline of 20th July when a \u20ac3.5bn bond to the ECB becomes repayable. While the departure of the polarising Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is likely to mean that relations between the creditors and the Greek government are likely to improve, in reality the move changes nothing, particularly since attitudes in some parts of Europe appear to have hardened. The players may have changed but the problems remain the same and while European finance ministers have agreed to meet today to consider some new Greek proposals, the likelihood is that they are unlikely to be any more acceptable now than they would have been last week, particularly given that debt relief is likely to be one of the key demands from the Greece side. This would suggest that any new agreement remains unlikely which means that Greece may well be forced to issue its own currency in a matter of days.",

Fundamental goal is an agreement which is socially just and economically sustainable for Greece, and also for the eurozone. This framework includes credible reforms with social justice as the criterion, includes on the other hand in return a committement to an adequate covering of the financial needs of the country in the medium term, a strong investment package, a package of investments to cope with the big problems, mainly the problem of unemployment, as well as the initiation of a meaningful discussion on the necessary restructuring of the debt. </p> <p>The discussion took place in a positive atmosphere, the procedure will be fast, it will be very rapid, it is beginning in the next hours, with the goal of having reached a result by the end of the week at the latest. </p> <p>[Unintelligible question from journo about Grexit. Possibly &quot;They talk about Grexit&quot;]</p> <p>The Greek side will continue the effort having as a strong weapon the verdict of the Greek people which was clear, the will of the overwhelming majority of the Greek people for a viable agreement that will put an end to this discussion, to which you just referred, once and for all, and will give a prospective of a definite end to the crisis. I am glad, ehm, to say, that by the statements of my colleagues I realise that they all understand, that we do not have a Greek problem, but a European problem to which we are called to give a solution to all together, with responsibility.

Bloomberg reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Eurosystem\u2019s functioning could be disrupted by \u201cprovision of ELA at overly generous conditions, which, in turn, could increase the risk of moral hazard on the side of financial institutions or responsible authorities,\u201d the ECB said in a document published on its website Tuesday. \u201cThe objective of ELA is to support solvent credit institutions facing temporary liquidity problems. It is not a monetary-policy instrument.\u201d</p> <p>The document on the ECB\u2019s financial-risk management clarifies the conditions surrounding emergency bank aid at a time when policy makers are restricting the provision of such funding to Greek banks. The reference to moral hazard indicates that officials are worried that bending the liquidity rules for Greece, as the country heads for a possible default, may lead future recipients to act less responsibly.</p> <p>On Monday, the ECB increased the discounts on collateral for lenders receiving ELA from the Bank of Greece. That makes it more difficult for banks to access the funds that have kept them alive as deposit withdrawals accelerated amid uncertainty over the country\u2019s place in the euro.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Hugodixon/statuses/618355825229320192\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cash theoretically available to Greek banks fell from \u20ac18bn to \u20ac5bn after ECB increased haircuts, Kathimerini <a href=\"https://t.co/HiCnI6k3fh\">https://t.co/HiCnI6k3fh</a></p>&mdash; Hugo Dixon (@Hugodixon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hugodixon/status/618355825229320192\">July 7, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-07T12:29:10.678Z\">at 1.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-559ba1b2e4b032a39a3bae88\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-07T09:55:50.759Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer boss Marc Bolland said he felt it was important to remain in Greece where the retailer has 20 stores via a joint venture that has been in place since 1978. </strong></p> <p>He told reporters following a trading update: \u201cWe have taken steps to continue to trade there at the moment.

That sanguine response may not be so much based on optimism that a compromise deal can still be reached (given the removal of Mr Varoufakis) as reflecting a judgement that, even if Grexit is now more likely than before, the broader economic consequences for the region can be contained.</p> <p>The Eurozone\u2019s peripheral markets were understandably less sanguine than the core, with Italy\u2019s MIB index losing 4% and the IBEX in Spain 2.2%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asian markets were mixed, with the Nikkei up 1.3% but the Hang Seng down 0.6%.</p> <p>And China continued its recent slump:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/07/china-stocks-tumble-again-after-premier-li-keqiang-fails-to-mention-crisis\">China stocks tumble again after premier Li Keqiang fails to mention crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e80dba4a1b3a85c2f6549f5588e474dbe2f9cad1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e80dba4a1b3a85c2f6549f5588e474dbe2f9cad1/0_0_4348_2607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tokyo share prices rise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tokyo share prices rise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-07T06:57:47.423Z\">at 7.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-559b6fdfe4b00bdd277082cc\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-07T06:38:15.619Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Introduction: Leaders await new Greece proposals</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the continuing eurozone crisis and the latest attempts to broker a deal between Greece and its creditors.</p> <p>With time running out - to quote German Chancellor Angela Merkel - Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is set to present new proposals following his resounding victory in Sunday\u2019s referendum.</p> <p>Finance ministers will meet later to consider what Greece has put on the table, with European leaders discussing the situation in an emergency summit this evening. Here\u2019s Ian Traynor\u2019s story looking at the prospects for a deal:</p> <blockquote> <p>Germany and France scrambled to avoid a major split over Greece on Monday evening as the eurozone delivered a damning verdict on Alexis Tsipras\u2019s landslide referendum victory on Sunday and Angela Merkel demanded that the Greek prime minister put down new proposals to break the deadlock.</p> <p>As concerns mount that Greek banks will run out of cash and about the damage being inflicted on the country\u2019s economy, hopes for a breakthrough faded. EU leaders voiced despair and descended into recrimination over how to respond to Sunday\u2019s overwhelming rejection of eurozone austerity terms as the price for keeping <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece\">Greece</a> in the currency.</p> <p>Tsipras, meanwhile, moved to insure himself against purported eurozone plots to topple him and force regime change by engineering a national consensus of the country\u2019s five mainstream parties behind his negotiating strategy, focused on securing debt relief.</p> </blockquote> <p>Full story here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/06/eurozone-struggles-joint-response-greek-referendum\">Eurozone struggles to find joint response to Greek referendum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One key participant will be new Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, appointed after the resignation of his colourful predecessor Yanis Varoufakis on Monday. Here is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/jul/06/greek-referendum-eu-leaders-call-crisis-meeting-as-bailout-rejected-live-updates#block-559aacdae4b00bdd27708188\"><strong>our profile of Tskalotos</strong></a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile Greek banks will not reopen today after capital controls were extended until at least tomorrow. The European Central Bank put more pressure on the Greek system by tightening the rules for giving emergency funding. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The ECB move} is likely to<strong> </strong>increase criticism that the central bank is getting involved in exerting political pressure and acting beyond its mandate of price stability, and as lender of last resort, which any credible central bank should do as a matter of course. </p> <p> All the ECB has done is make it more likely that Greek banks will run out of money in a matter of days. Furthermore it remains highly unlikely that the Greek government will be able to make it to the next key payment deadline of 20<sup>th</sup> July when a \u20ac3.5bn bond to the ECB becomes repayable.</p> <p> While the departure of the polarising Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is likely to mean that relations between the creditors and the Greek government are likely to improve, in reality the move changes nothing, particularly since attitudes in some parts of Europe appear to have hardened. </p> <p> The players may have changed but the problems remain the same and while European finance ministers have agreed to meet today to consider some new Greek proposals, the likelihood is that they are unlikely to be any more acceptable now than they would have been last week, particularly given that debt relief is likely to be one of the key demands from the Greece side.</p> <p> This would suggest that any new agreement remains unlikely which means that Greece may well be forced to issue its own currency in a matter of days. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-07T06:52:04.936Z\">at 7.52am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Heavy discounting by food and furniture retailers helped shop prices fall for the 26th consecutive month in June, according to an industry survey. Prices fell 1.3% on average as retailers passed on lower food and commodity costs to attract hard-pressed consumers in search of bargains. The only boost to prices came from rising oil costs, which have moved up from a low point earlier this year. This helped moderate the shop price slump in June following a fall of 1.9% in May, said the British Retail Consortium (BRC). The BRC\u2019s director general, Helen Dickinson, said the biggest price falls were in the furniture and DIY sectors, fuelling a near 2% drop in non-food prices. \u201cShoppers wishing to invest in their home won\u2019t be disappointed, with great deals to be found in furniture and flooring and gardening and hardware in particular,\u201d she said. Food prices declined 0.4%, as bumper food harvests around the world cut the cost of basic foodstuffs. Popular agricultural commodities maintained a long decline, led by soya beans, sugar and wheat, which all reported a double-digit slide over the last year, falling 34%, 24% and 14% respectively This situation is expected to reverse following forecasts that the US will suffer poor harvests later this year with heavy rain expected to hinder wheat and soya bean planting. Dickinson said shops might enjoy an even better July, after consumer confidence hit a 15-year high, suggesting that shoppers could feel more comfortable about buying major purchases. \u201cIt also suggests that consumer spending, one of the main drivers of the recovery, should remain robust over the summer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a strong appetite for consumer credit, inflation remains at an historic low, unemployment continues to fall and wages have started to rise, the wider macro-economic data continues to be supportive for the consumer.\u2019\u2019 But several high street chains have begun summer sales with discounts of up to 75%, signalling that shoppers remain careful with their cash. H&amp;M cut prices by up to 75%, while JD Sports is offering up to 50% off. Mike Watkins, retail expert at researcher Nielsen, said: \u201cRetailers continue to use price cuts and promotions to stimulate sales, which is helping to maintain shop price deflation, and we see little evidence to suggest that prices will rise in the near future. \u201cWith many food retailers still using price cuts to attract new shoppers, this is lowering the cost of the weekly shop and so the overall CPI figure in the UK. Deflation and price led competition will continue to be a key driver of sales growth for some time yet,\u201d he said.",

Ofgem, the industry regulator, has been saying the same thing for a couple of decades, only to find its cries received with utter indifference in many quarters. By contrast, the CMA has an idea to improve the lot of those who are too lazy, or too baffled by complexity, to save themselves \u00a3160 a year or thereabouts. It suggests a default tariff that would act as a safeguard against unfair pricing. The price would apply only to the most expensive tariffs and would be set at a sort of Goldilocks level \u2013 low enough to prevent gouging of non-switchers, but not so low that it kills competition. One glorious day in the future, when competition is deemed to be effective, the safeguard would be removed. The CMA\u2019s vision of a competitive market rests heavily on the supposed wonders of smart meters, which is alarming. As the Institute of Directors has argued persuasively, this \u00a312bn programme smells like a vastly expensive way to install technology that may be out-of-date by the time it arrives.

Second, it\u2019s more intelligent than Ed Miliband\u2019s blunt \u201cprice freeze\u201d proposal because it recognises the reality that wholesale energy prices move. Third, a default price sets a semi-official benchmark against which suppliers\u2019 other tariffs can be compared. Do non-switchers deserve a nanny regulator to hold their hand to such a degree? Some government ministers may hate a proposal with even the slightest whiff of price regulation. They should reconsider. The CMA\u2019s report is sober and unremarkable in most respects \u2013 it gives a clean bill of health to the wholesale energy market, for example, and says integration between generators and suppliers is fine. But the key finding is that households have been paying \u00a31.2bn a year too much for their energy, and small businesses are losing \u00a3500m. If those statistics are robust, a regulatory response is required. A safeguard tariff is a cleverer idea than anything that has emerged from Ofgem over the years. The energy companies, who keep telling us they want to restore \u201ctrust\u201d in their industry, should get behind it. This report could have been a lot worse for them. China crisis? There\u2019s one way to stop investors selling shares \u2013 just suspend trading in a large part of the market. Yes, it\u2019s the latest chapter in China\u2019s cack-handed attempt to prevent its over-valued stock market falling further. About a quarter of the firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges have asked for trading in their shares to be halted. Most of these companies have offered an excuse of some sort \u2013 a restructuring or share issue in the offing. But it defies belief that all these explanations are genuine. Rather, the rash of suspensions look to be part of the state-sponsored share-support operation that has already seen the government funds step in as big buyers of shares. It\u2019s not working.

      "bodyText": "A new regulatory regime in the City of London intended to hold individuals to account for their actions could be extended to traders who had not expected to be covered by the rules. The Financial Conduct Authority launched a consultation on Tuesday that could result in managers working in areas such as algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading being included in the regime which is being introduced in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal. As the City regulator published rules that cover a range of roles from top bosses to junior branch staff, it added that it wanted to broaden the scope of its new powers to fine and ban individuals. The FCA said it was \u201calso consulting on amendments to the rules in regard to the certification of individuals involved in wholesale activity, such as traders\u201d. \u201cThe change is designed to expand the certification regime to ensure that individuals working in wholesale markets in relevant firms who could pose significant harm to the firm or its customers are subject to the new accountability rules,\u201d it added. The new regulations are the result of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Conservative MP, Andrew Tyrie, and set up by the previous government after the furore caused by the \u00a3290m fine imposed on Barclays for rigging Libor. Individuals who fall under the FCA\u2019s senior managers regime will need to be preauthorised by the FCA before they can take up their roles. Those who fall under the certification regime \u2013 also part of the new rules \u2013 will not need preauthorisation but it covers anyone who could cause a risk to their firm, from Libor traders to staff who give investment advice. They will be subject to the new conduct rules which set out basic standards for how individuals behave. Some non-executive directors of banks, however, are not covered by the senior managers regime. Chris Lawrenson, head of legal services at the Building Societies Association, said this meant junior members of staff would be held to account but a large number of non-executive directors would not. He said any errors by junior workers covered by the certification regime would need to be reported annually to the regulator, when they might otherwise have been handled by their managers. \u201cThe culture of fear which could result from branch staff being personally liable to the regulator is likely to cause not prevent customer detriment and will very likely make the potential of a conversation with a customer a distant memory, replaced by the delivery of a script,\u201d the BSA said.",

The Association of Convenience Stores (ACS), which represents thousands of small independent grocery outlets, condemned the proposal set to be unveiled in Wednesday\u2019s budget, saying it would not increase trade on high streets and would threaten the livelihoods of convenience store owners. Under current laws, small shops can stay open all day on Sundays but large sites such as supermarkets are limited to trading for six hours. James Lowman, ACS chief executive, said: \u201cIn areas where large stores\u2019 trading hours are extended, we will simply see the same amount of trade spread over more hours and shifting from small stores to large stores, as was the case when the laws were suspended for the 2012 London Olympics, when overall retail sales actually fell.\u201d Research conducted by the lobby group in February 2015 found that three quarters of the public supported the existing Sunday trading regulations. Of those who are in favour of change, 60% called for greater restrictions on trading hours. The Rural Shops Alliance (RSA), which represents 7,500 retailers, said the government\u2019s new plan flew in the face of a Conservative party manifesto promise to protect the future of 3,000 rural post offices. \u201cThe vast majority of these post offices are sited within a rural convenience store and hence their very existence depends on the host store remaining profitable,\u201d the lobby group said. \u201cThere is universal agreement that the existing Sunday trading laws provide a modest but very welcome boost to smaller convenience stores, which are able to meet customers\u2019 needs at times on Sundays when larger stores are closed.\u201d The RSA said there had been no mention of an extension to Sunday trading hours in the Tory manifesto among hundreds of proposals over 84 pages. Meanwhile, less than three months ago, the Conservatives wrote to the Keep Sunday Special Campaign, which has fought against an extension of trading hours, saying it had \u201cno current plans to relax Sunday trading laws\u201d. Some major retailers, including Asda and Morrisons, support extending opening hours on a Sunday, but others have been less enthusiastic. Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose have all said they would respond to whatever the government decided to do. Sainsbury\u2019s declined to comment, but former chief executive Justin King has said that \u201cmaintaining Sunday\u2019s special status has great merit\u201d for both customers and staff.

Buck said last month: \u201cHMRC need to satisfy themselves that these are robust, and all the tax affairs relating to the development of this landmark luxury housing scheme have been properly discharged.\u201d A spokesman for HMRC said: \u201cIan Barlow was appointed as someone with extensive experience of tax and business management, which brings huge value as well as challenge to HMRC\u2019s Board and executive management. HMRC was aware of his previous role as a senior partner of KPMG and was satisfied there was no impediment to his appointment as lead non-executive, given the nature of his involvement and the length of time that has passed. He has also demonstrated a clear commitment in recent years to promoting corporate responsibility in tax planning as an issue for board-level oversight, which HMRC believes is an important initiative in tackling corporate tax avoidance.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Eurozone tells Greece not to expect debt relief in near future", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Greek government has been told by its eurozone partners not to expect debt relief any time soon, amid fading hopes of decisive action to stop the country tumbling out of the currency union. Arriving at an emergency summit of eurozone leaders, Angela Merkel said there was no clear basis to negotiate with Athens after Greek voters rejected an EU bailout plan in a referendum on Sunday. The German chancellor warned that time was running out. \u201cIt is not a matter of weeks anymore, it is a matter of days.\u201d Eurozone finance ministers meeting ahead of the summit made it clear they were waiting on Athens to make the first move and were in no hurry to discuss debt relief. Diplomatic niceties were abandoned as it emerged Greece\u2019s new finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos had not come armed with detailed proposals. \u201c[With] the Greek government it is every time ma\u00f1ana,\u201d said Lithuania\u2019s president Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, one of the Greek government\u2019s most tough-talking critics. \u201cIt can always be ma\u00f1ana every day.\u201d Greek banks are almost out of cash and some Eurozone figures are already saying that Grexit is the only option for the debt-ridden country. The head of Latvia\u2019s central bank told domestic radio that the \u201cbrave\u201d Greek nation had \u201cvoted itself out of the eurozone\u201d. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said he was not in favour of a Greek exit from the eurozone, but dampened hopes of a breakthrough from the summit. \u201cWhat we are going to do today is to talk to each other and restore order,\u201d he said. Tsakalotos, the Oxford-educated economics professor, who was sworn in as Greek finance minister on Monday night, arrived at Tuesday\u2019s meeting without talking to reporters. Neither did he bring any detailed proposals \u2013 an omission that caused incredulity among other eurozone governments. Malta\u2019s prime minister Joseph Muscat said \u201cthe absence of a concrete proposal\u201d wouldn\u2019t help the eurozone leaders\u2019 summit. Greece will a make formal proposal on Wednesday to tap the EU\u2019s \u20ac500bn bailout fund, the European stability mechanism, said the chair of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, after the meeting ended with scant results. Finance ministers will discuss the idea by phone. \u201cAll of this has to be done in a matter of days. We have very little time,\u201d he said. The leaders of France and Germany said they expected Greece to come up with \u201cserious and credible proposals\u201d at today\u2019s summit. The demand was echoed by finance ministers, who stressed they wanted to see the Greek government sign up to reforms. Several made it clear they would not support any write-off of Greek debt. \u201cWe are not in the business of renegotiating debt,\u201d said Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alexander Stubb. \u201cThat was already done in 2011 and 2012,\u201d referring to restructuring of Greek debts that imposed heavy losses on private creditors. Stubb said Finland\u2019s commitments to Greece had proved to be more than anyone ever expected, totalling 10% of the Finnish government budget. The European commission, the guardian of EU law, was openly split. Valdis Dombrovskis, the Latvian commissioner in charge of the euro, said a Greek exit from the eurozone could not be excluded. Pierre Moscovici, the French commissioner in charge of the economic policy, struck a different note, saying that Grexit would be a terrible collective failure. Juncker blamed the Greeks for walking out of talks and said it was up to Athens to come up with proposals that would allow Europe to get out of this situation. The depths of mistrust were highlighted by Latvia\u2019s finance minister, J\u00e3nis Reirs, who said his compatriots were surprised at the referendum result. \u201cLatvian people do not understand Greek people,\u201d he said. As talks in Brussels grind on, Greek banks remain closed and it is far from clear they will be able to reopen on Thursday, when an extended bank holiday is due to end. Greece has to find \u20ac3.5bn to meet a debt repayment to the European Central Bank in two weeks\u2019 time (20 July). Failure to make the payment would leave the ECB with little choice but to declare Greek banks insolvent and cut off all emergency aid, almost certainly triggering a eurozone exit. But many analysts suspect Greek banks cannot last this long without financial help. The European Central Bank raised the pressure on Greek banks on Monday night by tightening access to emergency credit. The Frankfurt-based institution has pumped \u20ac89bn (\u00a363bn) into the Greek financial system in recent months, but Greek banks can only tap this emergency aid by putting up collateral, such as Greek government bonds. The bank said on Monday it was \u201cadjust[ing] the haircuts accepted on collateral\u201d, meaning that Greek assets are now deemed more risky, to secure smaller amounts of emergency funds. \u201cRestoration of liquidity in the Greek banking system [is] an immediate priority,\u201d Greek president Prokopis Pavlopoulos wrote in a letter to the European council president Donald Tusk. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, pressed for capital controls to be lifted when he spoke to the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, on Monday. After a hectic day of meetings with Greek party leaders, Tsipras also spoke to Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. She told him the IMF was no longer able to provide money to Greece until it clears its arrears, following last week\u2019s default on a \u20ac1.6bn loan repayment. Analysts at Capital Economics said Greece\u2019s creditors may soon have to \u201caccept the inevitable\u201d and cut Greece loose. \u201cGreece and its creditors may yet find a way to step back from the brink. But without major debt relief, any near-term deal looks likely just to put off the inevitable for a bit longer,\u201d wrote chief European economist Jonathan Loynes. \u201cMeantime, Greece\u2019s economic and fiscal position will continue to worsen and the eurozone\u2019s policymakers will devote yet more time and effort to what looks increasingly like a hopeless cause. We don\u2019t say it at all lightly. But it might well be time to let Greece go.\u201d",

Finance ministers will discuss the idea by phone.</p> <p>\u201cAll of this has to be done in a matter of days. We have very little time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The leaders of France and Germany said they expected Greece to come up with \u201cserious and credible proposals\u201d at today\u2019s summit.</p> <p>The demand was echoed by finance ministers, who stressed they wanted to see the Greek government sign up to reforms. Several made it clear they would not support any write-off of Greek debt.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not in the business of renegotiating debt,\u201d said Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alexander Stubb. \u201cThat was already done in 2011 and 2012,\u201d referring to restructuring of Greek debts that imposed heavy losses on private creditors.<br></p> <p>Stubb said Finland\u2019s commitments to Greece had proved to be more than anyone ever expected, totalling 10% of the Finnish government budget.</p> <p>The European commission, the guardian of EU law, was openly split. Valdis Dombrovskis, the Latvian commissioner in charge of the euro, said a Greek exit from the eurozone could not be excluded. Pierre Moscovici, the French commissioner in charge of the economic policy, struck a different note, saying that Grexit would be a terrible collective failure.</p> <p>Juncker blamed the Greeks for walking out of talks and said it was up to Athens to come up with proposals that would allow Europe to get out of this situation.<br></p> <p>The depths of mistrust were highlighted by Latvia\u2019s finance minister, J\u00e3nis Reirs, who said his compatriots were surprised at the referendum result. \u201cLatvian people do not understand Greek people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As talks in Brussels grind on, Greek banks remain closed and it is far from clear they will be able to reopen on Thursday, when an extended bank holiday is due to end.<br></p> <p>Greece has to find \u20ac3.5bn to meet a debt repayment to the European Central Bank in two weeks\u2019 time (20 July). Failure to make the payment would leave the ECB with little choice but to declare Greek banks insolvent and cut off all emergency aid, almost certainly triggering a eurozone exit. </p> <p>But many analysts suspect Greek banks cannot last this long without financial help.</p> <p>The European Central Bank raised the pressure on Greek banks on Monday night by tightening access to emergency credit. The Frankfurt-based institution has pumped \u20ac89bn (\u00a363bn) into the Greek financial system in recent months, but Greek banks can only tap this emergency aid by putting up collateral, such as Greek government bonds.</p> <p>The bank said on Monday it was \u201cadjust[ing] the haircuts accepted on collateral\u201d, meaning that Greek assets are now deemed more risky, to secure smaller amounts of emergency funds. </p> <p>\u201cRestoration of liquidity in the Greek banking system [is] an immediate priority,\u201d Greek president Prokopis Pavlopoulos wrote in a letter to the European council president Donald Tusk.<br></p> <p>The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, pressed for capital controls to be lifted when he spoke to the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, on Monday. After a hectic day of meetings with Greek party leaders, Tsipras also spoke to Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. She told him the IMF was no longer able to provide money to Greece until it clears its arrears, following last week\u2019s default on a \u20ac1.6bn loan repayment.<br></p> <p>Analysts at Capital Economics said Greece\u2019s creditors may soon have to \u201caccept the inevitable\u201d and cut Greece loose.<br></p> <p>\u201cGreece and its creditors may yet find a way to step back from the brink. But without major debt relief, any near-term deal looks likely just to put off the inevitable for a bit longer,\u201d wrote chief European economist Jonathan Loynes.</p> <p> \u201cMeantime, Greece\u2019s economic and fiscal position will continue to worsen and the eurozone\u2019s policymakers will devote yet more time and effort to what looks increasingly like a hopeless cause. We don\u2019t say it at all lightly. But it might well be time to let Greece go.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Demand for summer dresses and festival wear helped business boom for online fashion retailer Asos, which said annual sales would be at the top of forecasts. The company, whose customers include Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron, said retail sales for the four months to 30 June increased 20%, or 24% allowing for currency movements. Sales in Britain rose 27% and international sales, worth about 60% of the total, were up 16%, or 23% in constant currencies. For the year that ends on 31 August, sales will be at the high end of Asos\u2019s previous guidance of 15% to 20%. Nick Robertson, Asos\u2019s chief executive, said top-selling items included sequinned mini skirts, structured sun dresses, dungarees and boots for festivals bought by customers in their 20s. \u201cFestivals and dresses for holidays were really, really strong for us,\u201d he said. In the UK, new brands such as Misguided and Boohoo helped increase sales. The company also extended its cutoff time for next-day delivery to midnight from 10pm and simplified its smartphone app. Asos\u2019s strong trading is a turnaround from last year when three profit warnings in six months rocked its position as a stock market favourite valued at \u00a36bn. The company, which sells in about 200 countries, blamed weak international sales caused by the strong pound making goods expensive and it also suffered a fire at its main depot in Barnsley. \u201cA year ago our UK performance was OK but where we were struggling was international. That was with the currency working against us and we were unable back then to change our prices in international territories.\u201d Asos installed software so it could adjust prices quickly to compete in particular countries. It has cut prices but better stock control and strong full-price sales have helped keep gross profit margins steady when analysts had expected a sharp fall. High-street fashion retailers suffered slow spring sales because of cold weather, prompting many to launch their sales early. Robertson said the unseasonal weather had little effect on Asos. \u201cWe are very global and we are not reliant on the UK,\u201d he said. The company is on track to reach its target of \u00a32.5bn annual sales soon, Robertson said without being more specific. Andrew Wade, an analyst at stockbroker Numis, increased his estimate for annual pre-tax profit to \u00a346.5m from \u00a345.8m. Profit last year was \u00a343.9m. Wade said: \u201cWe are seeing clear positive results and a business which has regained its momentum.\u201d Asos shares, which were valued at \u00a370 in February 2014, were down 2.5% at \u00a337.45 in lunchtime trading. After plunging in 2014, they have gained about 50% this year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two Labour leadership candidates have said they oppose government plans to allow local councils to permit all-day Sunday opening by larger shops. Andy Burnham, the frontrunner in the leadership race, tweeted: \u201cSundays are only day people who work in shops can bank on some time with their kids. I will oppose this all the way.\u201d Another contender, Liz Kendall, said: \u201cThe Sunday Trading Act works: retailers can trade, customers can shop, shopworkers can spend time with their families. Why change it?\u201d The plans to shake up trading laws will be included in Wednesday\u2019s budget. The chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to issue a consultation on handing responsibility for Sunday rules to local authorities. The move would end the national ban on large stores opening for more than six hours on Sundays. On Tuesday, the business minister, Anna Soubry, defended the plans. She said she was of a generation that remembered when Sundays were the most miserable day of the week. She said: \u201cThe only thing to look forward to was Sing Something Simple on the radio and, I mean, goodness me, if that didn\u2019t sum up a miserable Sunday. \u201cI think we\u2019re harking back to a world that probably didn\u2019t exist. And now Sundays are a great day \u2013 you have family life but you can still have shopping.\u201d The six-hour rule was relaxed for six weeks during the London Olympics in 2012, resulting in a significant increase in sales. At the time, the Liberal Democrats, then part of the coalition government, opposed a permanent relaxation, insisting that Sunday should remain special and that the compromise between consumers, traders, shopworkers and churchgoers should be retained. Supermarkets are divided over the wisdom of opening for longer on Sunday. Responding to concerns from trade unions such as Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 union, which said it would campaign against the move, Soubry stressed that the proposals were for a consultation and no decisions had been made. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThese are the sorts of views that we want to hear and the considerations we need to be aware of. But I think the point is, if we go ahead with it \u2013 and personally I hope we do \u2013 it\u2019s about giving local authorities the ability to determine what they want to do in their area, and it may be that in some areas they say \u2018no, this is not for us\u2019.\u201d A consultation on two proposals is expected to be announced in the the budget: devolving power over Sunday trading law to elected mayors, and to local authorities. If the first proposal is chosen, it would have a much slower impact since the number of mayors is to be limited for the foreseeable future. Osborne said: \u201cEven two decades on from the introduction of the Sunday Trading Act, it is clear that there is still a growing appetite for shopping on a Sunday. There is some evidence that transactions for Sunday shopping are actually growing faster than those for Saturday. \u201cThe rise of online shopping, which people can do round the clock, also means more retailers want to be able to compete by opening for longer at the weekend. But this won\u2019t be right for every area, so I want to devolve the power to make this decision to mayors and local authorities. \u201cThis will be another part of my plan to ensure a truly national recovery, with our great towns and cities able to determine their own futures.\u201d Sunday trading laws allow all stores to open for six hours between 10am and 6pm, while small shops covering less than 280 sq metres, (3,000 sq ft) can open all day. The lobby group Open Sundays claims the changes in the law would generate an extra \u00a320.3bn over 20 years for the British economy. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cTurning Sunday into another Saturday for major retailers would take precious family time away from shopworkers. There is no pressure for this from shoppers and it may push some smaller retailers out of business.\u201d O\u2019Grady argued that it was a sign of desperation that Osborne was trying to strengthen growth through shopping instead of manufacturing. She said: \u201cWe need a better economic plan than asking people to spend another day of the week putting debt on their credit cards.\u201d John Hannett, the general secretary of Usdaw, told the Today programme that the current settlement had been arrived at to achieve a balance between consumer convenience and the need for staff to have respite. He said: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with the announcement. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that we received a letter from the Conservatives saying they had no intention of further deregulation.\u201d At the time of the temporary exemption for the Olympics, Hannett said: \u201cUsdaw remains vehemently opposed to the deregulation of Sunday trading and we expect the government to abide by its commitment that this summer\u2019s temporary suspension will not lead to any further attempts to extend Sunday opening hours. \u201cThe government failed to make a coherent business case for the suspension and there is no evidence that it will boost the economy or tourism.\u201d Under existing laws, shopworkers have a right to opt out of Sunday working but, in practice that right can be reduced if employers put pressure on their staff. Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, speaking on Radio 4\u2019s the World at One, argued that extended Sunday trading hours exist in Scotland and \u201cthe sky hasn\u2019t fallen in\u201d there. Davies said there was no \u201crhyme or reason\u201d to the current laws preventing somebody working long hours in a large out-of-town supermarket on Sundays and but not people working in smaller supermarkets. The bishop of St Albans, the Rt Rev Dr Alan Smith, told the programme: \u201cThe issue is whether we think that what makes for human thriving is more and more shopping and whether actually there are other things that we as a society might want to value and champion.\u201d Research by the New West End Company, which provides management and marketing services to 25 streets within London\u2019s retail heartland, suggests that extending Sunday trading by two hours in the capital would create almost 3,000 jobs and generate more than \u00a3200m a year in extra income. Reform would bring Britain in line with its international competitors. For instance, Paris has recently relaxed restrictions on Sunday trading, and there are none at all in New York. The chancellor\u2019s plans are expected to be taken forward in the government\u2019s enterprise bill in the autumn. High street shops claim to be under growing pressure from online retailers, which now account for 11% of all retail sales \u2013 rising to 17% in the month before Christmas.",

At the time, the Liberal Democrats, then part of the coalition government, opposed a permanent relaxation, insisting that Sunday should remain special and that the compromise between consumers, traders, shopworkers and churchgoers should be retained.</p> <p>Supermarkets are divided over the wisdom of opening for longer on Sunday. </p> <p>Responding to concerns from trade unions such as Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 union, which said it would campaign against the move, Soubry stressed that the proposals were for a consultation and no decisions had been made.</p> <p>She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThese are the sorts of views that we want to hear and the considerations we need to be aware of. But I think the point is, if we go ahead with it \u2013 and personally I hope we do \u2013 it\u2019s about giving local authorities the ability to determine what they want to do in their area, and it may be that in some areas they say \u2018no, this is not for us\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>A consultation on two proposals is expected to be announced in the the budget: devolving power over Sunday trading law to elected mayors, and to local authorities. If the first proposal is chosen, it would have a much slower impact since the number of mayors is to be limited for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Osborne said: \u201cEven two decades on from the introduction of the Sunday Trading Act, it is clear that there is still a growing appetite for shopping on a Sunday. There is some evidence that transactions for Sunday shopping are actually growing faster than those for Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise of online shopping, which people can do round the clock, also means more retailers want to be able to compete by opening for longer at the weekend. But this won\u2019t be right for every area, so I want to devolve the power to make this decision to mayors and local authorities.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be another part of my plan to ensure a truly national recovery, with our great towns and cities able to determine their own futures.\u201d</p> <p>Sunday trading laws allow all stores to open for six hours between 10am and 6pm, while small shops covering less than 280 sq metres, (3,000 sq ft) can open all day.</p> <p>The lobby group Open Sundays claims the changes in the law would generate an extra \u00a320.3bn over 20 years for the British economy.</p> <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cTurning Sunday into another Saturday for major retailers would take precious family time away from shopworkers. There is no pressure for this from shoppers and it may push some smaller retailers out of business.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Grady argued that it was a sign of desperation that Osborne was trying to strengthen growth through shopping instead of manufacturing. She said: \u201cWe need a better economic plan than asking people to spend another day of the week putting debt on their credit cards.\u201d</p> <p>John Hannett, the general secretary of Usdaw, told the Today programme that the current settlement had been arrived at to achieve a balance between consumer convenience and the need for staff to have respite. </p> <p>He said: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with the announcement. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that we received a letter from the Conservatives saying they had no intention of further deregulation.\u201d</p> <p>At the time of the temporary exemption for the Olympics, Hannett said: \u201cUsdaw remains vehemently opposed to the deregulation of Sunday trading and we expect the government to abide by its commitment that this summer\u2019s temporary suspension will not lead to any further attempts to extend Sunday opening hours.</p> <p>\u201cThe government failed to make a coherent business case for the suspension and there is no evidence that it will boost the economy or tourism.\u201d</p> <p>Under existing laws, shopworkers have a right to opt out of Sunday working but, in practice that right can be reduced if employers put pressure on their staff.</p> <p>Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, speaking on Radio 4\u2019s the World at One, argued that extended Sunday trading hours exist in Scotland and \u201cthe sky hasn\u2019t fallen in\u201d there. Davies said there was no \u201crhyme or reason\u201d to the current laws preventing somebody working long hours in a large out-of-town supermarket on Sundays and but not people working in smaller supermarkets.</p> <p>The bishop of St Albans, the Rt Rev Dr Alan Smith, told the programme: \u201cThe issue is whether we think that what makes for human thriving is more and more shopping and whether actually there are other things that we as a society might want to value and champion.\u201d</p> <p>Research by the New West End Company, which provides management and marketing services to 25 streets within London\u2019s retail heartland, suggests that extending Sunday trading by two hours in the capital would create almost 3,000 jobs and generate more than \u00a3200m a year in extra income. </p> <p>Reform would bring Britain in line with its international competitors. For instance, Paris has recently relaxed restrictions on Sunday trading, and there are none at all in New York.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s plans are expected to be taken forward in the government\u2019s enterprise bill in the autumn.</p> <p>High street shops claim to be under growing pressure from online retailers, which now account for 11% of all retail sales \u2013 rising to 17% in the month before Christmas.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The economist Ajit Singh, who has died aged 74, was a pioneer in the analysis of takeovers and the structure of the modern business enterprise. He also devised the first operational definition of de-industrialisation in advanced economies and was a leading voice in the debate over the dynamics of industrialisation and financial markets in the developing world. Singh\u2019s work on corporate behaviour resulted in two major publications, Growth Profitability and Valuation (1968, co-authored with Geoffrey Whittington) and Takeovers: Their Relevance to the Stock Market and the Theory of the Firm (1972). In these two books Singh tested the work of the Cambridge economist Robin Marris, who, developing research on corporate structure in the 1930s by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, had argued that the role of disciplining corporate managers and of aligning their decision-making with the welfare of shareholders would be played by the stock market alone: in other words, that the market will ensure efficiency by selecting the fittest companies for survival. Singh demonstrated conclusively that these rosy conclusions were false. By careful empirical study of takeovers, he revealed that it is not possible to distinguish between the characteristics of acquired and non-acquired firms, other than that there is a tendency for smaller firms to be taken over. Equally, both the short- and long-run impacts of takeovers on share prices suggest that, on average, takeovers lead to substantial loss of wealth for shareholders of the acquiring company. Later, Singh\u2019s interest in industrial structure and performance took a more macro-economic focus in the debate, stimulated initially by another Cambridge economist, Nicholas Kaldor, over the de-industrialisation of Britain. De-industrialisation had been defined as simply a declining share of manufacturing in GDP. But this is a characteristic of most advanced economies today. The concept was first given analytical precision in Singh\u2019s pathbreaking article of 1997, UK Industry and the World Economy: A Case of De-industrialisation? In this he defined an efficient manufacturing sector as \u201cone which (currently as well as potentially) \u2026 sells enough of its products abroad to pay for the nation\u2019s import requirements \u2026 at socially acceptable levels of output, employment and the exchange rate\u201d. That insight is particularly pertinent today, when the UK\u2019s deficit on manufactured trade is 5% of GDP (having been 1.5% 20 years ago), contributing to a balance of payments deficit of around 6% of GDP, and hence current levels of output and employment are sustained only by the persistent accumulation of foreign debt. Singh\u2019s analysis of the interaction between financial development, industrialisation and international competitiveness informed his subsequent research spanning a wide range of topics including the role of the state, industrial policy, structural change, competition policy, foreign aid, agriculture, basic needs, urbanisation, employment and income distribution. One of his consistent themes was the central role of manufacturing industry in economic development and poverty reduction. He regarded the obsession of modern-day economists with abstract modelling as self-indulgent, was an inheritor of John Maynard Keynes\u2019s commitment to making economics useful, and always insisted on the value of thoroughly researched material that uses meticulous empirical technique to address practical problems. Singh was born in Lahore, in pre-partition India, the son of Sardar, a judge, and Pushpa (nee Bawa), who was a descendant of the third of the 10 gurus of Sikhism, Guru Amar Das. Singh studied Sanskrit, mathematics and economics at Punjab University in Chandigarh, then went to Howard University in Washington, DC, where he obtained an MA in economics, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his PhD. It was at Berkeley that he met Marris, who was visiting from Cambridge, and began to investigate some of the empirical implications of Marris\u2019s classic book, The Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism (1964). Singh moved to Cambridge University to continue that work, and in 1964 became a research officer in the department of applied economics. In 1965 he was appointed to a university lectureship, in 1991 to a readership, and in 1995 to a professorship. He was devoted to his college, Queens\u2019, where he became a fellow. He inspired generations of students at Cambridge, where his research was often controversial but always thorough. He applied similar care to his politics, and in the late 1960s his rooms in Queens\u2019 were packed with material on the Vietnam war. Few who were present will forget his polite but devastating interrogation of the then foreign secretary, Michael Stewart, at a 1966 Cambridge Union meeting on the war. However, the most abiding memories of him will be of the twinkling eyes below his turban, of a penetrating intellect, and of an unwavering commitment to social and economic progress. Despite suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease for more than three decades, he continued to contribute original academic and policy work right up to the time of his death. His first marriage, to Jo Bradley, ended in divorce in 2012. He is survived by his second wife, Ann Zammit, and by his sisters Parveen and Rani. \u2022 Ajit Singh, economist, born 11 September 1940; died 23 June 2015",

    "webTitle": "Budget 2015: George Osborne to shake up Sunday trading laws", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The biggest shakeup of trading laws since the reforms of the 1990s is set to be unveiled in the budget on Wednesday. George Osborne will hand responsibility for Sunday trading laws in England and Wales to towns and cities, allowing them to decide how long shops can stay open, in a move that will put an end to the ban on large stores staying open for more than six hours. The six-hour rule was relaxed for six weeks in July 2012 during the Olympics, resulting in a relatively significant surge in sales. The Liberal Democrats, then part of the coalition government, opposed a permanent relaxation at the time, insisting that Sunday should remain special and that the compromise between consumers, traders, shopworkers and the religious should be retained. Osborne has decided that verdicts on similar relaxations of the law should in future be taken at a local level, so that areas that think longer opening hours would boost economic activity would be free to do so. The supermarkets are divided over the wisdom of opening hours for longer on Sunday. The budget is expected to announce a consultation on two proposals: devolving power over Sunday trading law to elected mayors, and also to local authorities. If the reform was only handed to elected mayors, it would have a much slower impact since the number of mayors is going to be limited for the foreseeable future. Osborne said: \u201cEven two decades on from the introduction of the Sunday Trading Act, it is clear that there is still a growing appetite for shopping on a Sunday. There is some evidence that transactions for Sunday shopping are actually growing faster than those for Saturday. \u201cThe rise of online shopping, which people can do round the clock, also means more retailers want to be able to compete by opening for longer at the weekend. But this won\u2019t be right for every area, so I want to devolve the power to make this decision to mayors and local authorities. \u201cThis will be another part of my plan to ensure a truly national recovery, with our great towns and cities able to determine their own futures.\u201d Sunday trading laws allow all stores to open for six hours between 10am and 6pm, while small shops covering less than 3,000 sq ft, or less than 280 square metres, can open all day. The lobby group Open Sundays claims the reform would bring in \u00a320.3bn over 20 years to the British economy. At the time of the temporary exemption for the Olympics, John Hannett, general secretary of the shopworkers\u2019 union, Usdaw, said: \u201cUsdaw remains vehemently opposed to the deregulation of Sunday trading and we expect the government to abide by its commitment that this summer\u2019s temporary suspension will not lead to any further attempts to extend Sunday opening hours. \u201cThe government failed to make a coherent business case for the suspension and there is no evidence that it will boost the economy or tourism.\u201d Under existing laws, shopworkers have a right to opt out of Sunday working but, in practice, that right can be reduced if employers put pressure on their staff. Research by the New West End Company, the London business voice for the West End, has shown that extending Sunday trading by two hours in London alone would create nearly 3,000 jobs, and generate more than \u00a3200m a year in extra income. Reform would bring Britain in line with its international competitors. For instance, Paris has recently relaxed restrictions on Sunday trading, while there are none at all in New York. The chancellor\u2019s plans are expected to be taken forward in the government\u2019s enterprise bill in the autumn. High street shops claim to have been under growing pressure from online retailers, which now account for 11% of retail sales overall \u2013 rising to 17% in the month before Christmas. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 July 2015 to clarify that George Osborne plans to relax Sunday trading laws that apply in England and Wales, not throughout Britain.",

      "body": "<p>The biggest shakeup of trading laws since the reforms of the 1990s is set to be unveiled in the budget on Wednesday. George Osborne will hand responsibility for Sunday trading laws in England and Wales to towns and cities, allowing them to decide how long shops can stay open, in a move that will put an end to the ban on large stores staying open for more than six hours.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The six-hour rule was relaxed for six weeks in July 2012 during the Olympics, resulting in a relatively significant surge in sales. The Liberal Democrats, then part of the coalition government, opposed a permanent relaxation at the time, insisting that Sunday should remain special and that the compromise between consumers, traders, shopworkers and the religious should be retained.</p> <p>Osborne has decided that verdicts on similar relaxations of the law should in future be taken at a local level, so that areas that think longer opening hours would boost economic activity would be free to do so. The supermarkets are divided over the wisdom of opening hours for longer on Sunday.</p> <p>The budget is expected to announce a consultation on two proposals: devolving power over Sunday trading law to elected mayors, and also to local authorities. If the reform was only handed to elected mayors, it would have a much slower impact since the number of mayors is going to be limited for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Osborne said: \u201cEven two decades on from the introduction of the Sunday Trading Act, it is clear that there is still a growing appetite for shopping on a Sunday.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer took a battering from independent investors over poor designs and low pay at its annual shareholder meeting as it revealed a renewed slide in clothing sales this spring. Shares in the retailer fell 2% as it said sales of clothing and homeware had slipped 0.4% at established stores in the three months to 13 June. The sales fall is a blow for the chief executive, Marc Bolland, after M&amp;S delivered its first rise in clothing sales in four years in the previous quarter. Bolland said M&amp;S had been forced to offer more discounts than last year in a \u201cchallenging and promotional\u201d quarter. Cool weather in May affected the whole high street, which put up the sale banners earlier than usual in June. Bolland said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say we are disappointed in a very difficult quarter to still have level sales ... In a difficult market in a more difficult quarter we have done very well, we are holding up strongly.\u201d He said the fall in underlying sales of general merchandise was not as bad as the 1% decline predicted by analysts. Bolland admitted the sales numbers would be \u201ccompletely different\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for a turnaround in trading at the retailer\u2019s website where sales rose 38.7%. Retail analyst Nick Bubb estimated that, had it not been for the online boost, the underlying sales decline would have been up to 5%. Independent shareholders at the retailer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting had clear ideas about where the retailer was going wrong. Muriel Conway, a shareholder who spent 25 years designing womenswear for M&amp;S until the late 1990s, said: \u201cI could weep at what I see in stores today. Where\u2019s the originality, flair, newness and good taste? The necklines are too low and the polos too high.\u201d To applause from the hundreds of shareholders gathered at the meeting at a function hall in Wembley Stadium she also said M&amp;S\u2019s clothing sizes were inconsistent so that she could wear anything from \u201ca size eight to a size 16\u201d. M&amp;S also drew criticism over its choice of clothing patterns and poor availability of popular sizes. Despite shareholders comments, Bolland insisted that shoppers\u2019 perception of the style and quality of M&amp;S\u2019s clothing had improved. He said M&amp;S was on track and would deliver promised improvements in profit margins as a result of more efficient buying practices. Bolland said M&amp;S was focused on improving profit margins \u2013 by 1.5% to 2% this year \u2013 and he could not promise that clothing and homewares sales would return to positive territory in the next quarter. \u201cWe will see some quarters which are slightly down and some that are slightly up. That\u2019s how we are trading this business,\u201d he said. M&amp;S\u2019s food sales continued to increase, helping the retailer improve its market share in a tough environment where supermarkets are embroiled in a price war. Underlying sales of food rose 0.3% during the quarter \u2013 in line with expectations \u2013 as the retailer introduced 700 new product lines. Total food sales rose 3.2% as the company opened more of its Simply Food convenience stores. Bolland said M&amp;S was on track to open 90 new stores this year. Bolland said M&amp;S would launch a promised \u00a3150m share buy-back on Wednesday. Fears of a shareholder revolt over executive pay failed to materialise despite M&amp;S offering Bolland the chance to earn up to three times his salary in long-term share awards based on performance measures that are not linked to financial targets. This year, M&amp;S\u2019s senior executives received bonuses for the first time in two years after an improvement in performance at the retailer. Chairman Robert Swannell defended M&amp;S\u2019s pay record saying: \u201cThere are companies that could possibly be accused of excessive remuneration but I don\u2019t think this would be one of them.\u201d He said Steve Rowe, M&amp;S\u2019s food director, deserved \u201cevery penny\u201d of his \u00a3643,000 bonus after delivering an \u201cabsolutely outstanding\u201d performance in the food business. However campaigners from ShareAction and Citizens UK urged M&amp;S to pay its staff the living wage of \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 across the rest of the UK. Swannell promised to meet with pay campaigners. He said he couldn\u2019t promise to agree with their demands but said: \u201cWe want M&amp;S to be at the forefront on this and think shareholders want us to lead the way.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Millions of Britons are overpaying for energy, says competition report", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Households paid \u00a38.5bn too much for their power between 2009 and 2013, according to a report by the competition watchdog that found customers bore more responsibility for the overspend than companies because they do not switch supplier enough. Millions of householders could each save up to \u00a3160 a year by switching to a new breed of lower-cost provider, claimed the Competition and Markets Authority. But the CMA resisted calls from fuel poverty campaigners for a breakup of the big six energy companies and instead recommended a price cap on high-cost tariffs. The watchdog also recommended a price comparison website should be set up and run by the energy regulator, Ofgem, and called for the scrapping of a recently introduced measure to restrict the number of tariffs available. However, the CMA\u2019s most critical comments came in an assessment of how large utilities have benefited at the expense of their customers. \u201cThe initial findings of this [CMA] analysis suggest that average prices offered by the big six firms over the period 2009 to 2013 were around 5% above the competitive level in the domestic segment ... this amounts to domestic customers paying around \u00a31.2bn \u2026 more on an annual basis.\u201d Combined with the estimated \u00a3500m of extra charges on small- and medium-sized business customers the amount over the five year period comes to \u00a38.5bn. Roger Witcomb, a CMA non-executive and chairman of the energy market investigation, declined to criticise the big six - British Gas, RWE Npower, SSE, EDF, Scottish Power and E.On - and insisted they had just \u201cbehaved in a very commercial way\u201d. But he attacked a series of initiatives by Ofgem and the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which he argued had failed to bring benefits to consumers. Witcomb said transitional price caps could be introduced as soon as January 2016 to bring down the highest bills. This could in theory mean that 70% of the market \u2013 bill payers on standard variable rates \u2013 could benefit. However, the price would rise and fall in line with wholesale power prices and other costs. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: \u201cThis is a damning indictment of how the energy market is failing consumers, with the biggest suppliers taking advantage of millions of households who have also been hit with the costs of government energy policy. \u201cNow that we have a clear, official assessment of what\u2019s wrong, we want the regulators to work with consumers to make sure their reforms will be effective this time. \u201cIn the meantime, it\u2019s right to put in place strong extra protection for consumers who don\u2019t, for whatever reason, get a fair and competitive price.\u201d The report was met largely with relief by the big six energy suppliers but the share price of British Gas parent, Centrica, closed down nearly 3% and SSE dipped just over 2%. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of the power industry lobby group Energy UK, said the report found no evidence of profiteering. \u201cThe energy industry recognises the need to put customers first while delivering secure, affordable and cleaner energy. Customers have not been overcharged but money may still be saved when people shop around for deals that suit their individual circumstances,\u201d he said. Amber Rudd, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, welcomed the CMA report and recommendations. The findings now go out to consultation with a final document promised by Christmas Day. \u201cWe\u2019ll consider the report and respond soon and we won\u2019t hesitate to take further action where the market is not delivering a fair deal for consumers \u2013 including doing more to support switching, ensure the swift roll-out of smart meters, and increase competition in energy markets,\u201d said Rudd. But a spokesman for the prime minister at a political briefing for journalists on Monday morning expressed concern about the price caps: \u201cThe prime minister \u2026 does not think that price regulation across the market is the right approach.\u201d Peter Atherton, a utility analyst with Jefferies investment bank in London, said he was reassured by the CMA\u2019s awareness that the price cap would have to be introduced carefully in order to avoid killing off competition. Atherton added that the report vindicated the industry\u2019s protestations of innocence. \u201cIf you had offered a report with findings like this to the energy sector a year ago they would have bitten your hand off (to accept it).\u201d",

Customers have not been overcharged but money may still be saved when people shop around for deals that suit their individual circumstances,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Amber Rudd, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, welcomed the CMA report and recommendations. The findings now go out to consultation with a final document promised by Christmas Day. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll consider the report and respond soon and we won\u2019t hesitate to take further action where the market is not delivering a fair deal for consumers \u2013 including doing more to support switching, ensure the swift roll-out of smart meters, and increase competition in energy markets,\u201d said Rudd.<br></p> <p>But a spokesman for the prime minister at a political briefing for journalists on Monday morning expressed concern about the price caps: \u201cThe prime minister \u2026 does not think that price regulation across the market is the right approach.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Atherton, a utility analyst with Jefferies investment bank in London, said he was reassured by the CMA\u2019s awareness that the price cap would have to be introduced carefully in order to avoid killing off competition. </p> <p>Atherton added that the report vindicated the industry\u2019s protestations of innocence. \u201cIf you had offered a report with findings like this to the energy sector a year ago they would have bitten your hand off (to accept it).\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Chinese companies suspended dealings in their shares in a bid to arrest a frenzy of selling on China\u2019s main stock markets, which have lost more than a quarter of their value since June. The move, considered by many analysts to be another stumbling response to a full-blown share price crash, sparked a nervous reaction in commodity markets and sent copper prices to a six-year low. Beijing has supported a series of market operations to halt a sharp decline in share values on the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges over the past four weeks, but each one has been criticised for failing to restore market confidence. Chinese shares fell on Tuesday after premier Li Keqiang\u2019s failure to mention the deepening market crisis in a statement on the economy. Before the market opened, Li said in comments on a government website that China had the confidence and ability to deal with challenges faced by its economy. But he had nothing to say about the three-week plunge that has knocked about 30% off Chinese shares since mid-June. After a brief pause to the slide on Monday, the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 1.8% on Tuesday, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.3%. The ChiNext growth board, home to some of China\u2019s headiest small-cap valuations, fell 5.1%. Commodities followed the downward march of shares, with the benchmark copper price on the London Metal Exchange falling nearly 6% to $5,261.50 a tonne \u2013 its lowest since July 2009. The metal, used in power and construction, recovered a little of its earlier losses later in the day, but reflected falls in nickel and other industrial metals. In an attempt over the weekend to halt the slide in domestic markets, China has arranged a curb on new share issues and enlisted brokerages and fund managers to buy massive amounts of shares, helped by China\u2019s state-backed margin finance company, which in turn has a direct line of liquidity from the central bank. The suspension of trading in some of the worst-hit firms was another tactic adopted by regulators that has so far failed to restore confidence. On Tuesday another 173 firms announced trading suspensions after the market, bringing the total to almost 950, or more than a third of all listed firms on the two main exchanges. Analysts said the government was taking a big risk. \u201cChina\u2019s leadership has doubled down on its efforts to prop up equity prices, because it believes that its own credibility is now coupled to continued gains on the markets,\u201d said Mark Williams of consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cOur view remains that a market rally cannot run ahead of economic fundamentals indefinitely,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a good chance that the market rescue efforts are seen to be a failure in a few months\u2019 time.\u201d Global investors have grown increasingly worried that a crash could destabilise the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and the source of much of the world\u2019s economic growth. \u201cI don\u2019t see any change in the downward trend,\u201d said Qi Yifeng, analyst at consultancy CEBM. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of whether the market will fall more slowly, or continue to go south in a freefall.\u201d The official Shanghai Securities News reported on Tuesday that China\u2019s major insurance firms ploughed tens of billions of yuan into blue-chip exchange-traded funds (ETF), and large listed companies on Monday. China Life Insurance bought a net 10bn yuan (\u00a31bn) in index funds, while China Pacific Insurance Group and other insurers each invested more than 1bn yuan, the newspaper said. The purchases helped the indexes rise just over 2% on Monday, but the relief was shortlived. Lei Mao, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, said government measures to support the market distorted the allocation of funds, and trading behaviour, and could create the conditions for further sharp falls. \u201cEven an optimistic investor should not participate in the market for now,\u201d he said. Traders are increasingly unnerved by the unusually large number of Chinese companies asking for their shares to be suspended from trading, fearing that many of them are looking for excuses to sit out the market turmoil. About a quarter of the 2,800 companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen had filed for a trading halt by the close on Monday. On Tuesday, the Securities Times said another 200 had announced a suspension. Investors were also reacting to news of tightened restrictions on futures trading on a major index of smaller companies. The rapid decline of China\u2019s previously booming stock market, which had more than doubled in the year to mid-June, has become a major headache for President Xi Jinping and China\u2019s senior leaders, who are already struggling to avert a sharper economic slowdown. Even China\u2019s bullish securities regulators admitted that markets had become frothy before they turned down, but the slide quickly showed signs of getting out of hand. A surprise interest rate cut by the central bank at the end of June, relaxations in margin trading and other \u201cstability measures\u201d did little to calm investors, many of whom are individual investors who have borrowed heavily to play the stock market. In a series of announcements on Saturday, China\u2019s top brokerages pledged to collectively buy at least 120bn yuan of shares to help steady the market, and said they would not sell while the Shanghai Composite Index remained below 4,500. The index has traded below that level since 25 June.",

      "bodyText": "Nervous about the Chinese stock market? You should be. First, it looks expensive, even after a dip. Second, the authorities in Beijing, by adopting increasingly desperate measures to prop up share prices, are sending an unmistakable message that they fear a crash is a possibility. The latest official attempt to manipulate the stock market would be laughed out of court if it were attempted in the west. The central bank is shovelling cash towards a state-backed finance company that lends to individuals who would like to make bigger bets on the stock market than they can afford. That\u2019s right, in today\u2019s communist China, there are subsidies for stock market speculation. By way of further encouragement, the state itself is piling in. A state-backed wealth fund is buying blue-chip stocks. Meanwhile, supposedly independent brokers and fund managers have decided this is the ideal moment to invest the equivalent of \u00a312bn and pledge not to sell until the main Shanghai index has risen at least 20%. This extraordinary effort, apparently, is required to \u201cuphold market stability\u201d. So what catastrophe has befallen the Chinese stock market? Well, nothing to justify all-out panic. Having risen 150% in a year, the Shanghai Composite Index has surrendered 30% of its gains. That\u2019s how excitable developing markets often work: an enormous rise can be followed by a smaller fall. It\u2019s not unusual. And, at about 20 times earnings, the Shanghai market is not a bargain given the slow-down in growth in the Chinese economy. The authorities in Beijing, one assumes, know all that. But they are inventing and deploying emergency measures anyway. Why? One assumes they think a serious slide in share prices would cause financial distress among 90 million individuals with share accounts. That might damage the real economy or, conceivably, create social unrest. Alternatively, the authorities think a crash could kill Chinese companies\u2019 long-term access to capital. Whatever it is, Beijing has put its credibility on the line. Share prices must rise because the state, in effect, has issued an order. The authorities may win the immediate battle with the market, though it\u2019s by no means certain. Monday\u2019s action was mixed. Blue-chip stocks, such as banks, rose because that is where the wall of money is being directed; small companies\u2019 shares mostly fell. Whatever the outcome in the next few weeks, a policy of state-directed share prices is unsustainable in the long run. If investors believe there is an official safety net to protect them from losses, the next bubble will be bigger and even harder to deflate safely. This is a fight Beijing should have avoided. It will end badly \u2013 if not this time, then next. Rocky Rolls What does Warren East bring to the job of chief executive of Rolls-Royce? Two days in, more of the same, meaning another profits warning from the engine maker. Yesterday\u2019s was the third since last October. Only two factors in the latest dip are easy to understand. Oil and gas producers are cutting budgets to respond to a lower oil price; Rolls-Royce\u2019s marine division, which makes almost two-thirds of its revenues from the offshore industry, was bound to be hit. Similarly, everyone knows demand for business jets is soft because oil sheikhs are feeling less wealthy and western sanctions are making life trickier for Russian oligarchs. The third factor, though, is the biggest and most mysterious \u2013 the speed of the fall-off in demand for Rolls\u2019 Trent 700 engine. Decline was inevitable as the engine is nearing the end of its lucrative life, to be supplanted by the Trent 7000. But Rolls-Royce needed one last hurrah from the 700 to make the progression smooth. It fully expected to get it, only to be disappointed on both volumes and prices. This looks like an old-fashioned case of over-optimism. We\u2019re not talking marginal differences. The City cut its forecasts for Rolls\u2019 2016 profits by about 30%. To compound the forecasting error, Rolls had been planning to spend \u00a31bn buying back its own shares. East has halted the process at the halfway point, an embarrassing but correct decision. How can Rolls\u2019 board form a view on whether the stock is cheap enough to buy if it can\u2019t rely on internal projections for demand in the biggest division, civil aerospace? Shareholders will hope that East\u2019s appointment, and the arrival of finance boss David Smith last November, marks the moment when the company\u2019s revenue and profit forecasts can be relied upon. It might, but there is always the threat that East\u2019s promised review of operations brings yet another adjustment to reality. On a 10-year view, Rolls remains a terrific business; the two-year outlook, however, is fuzzy.",

      "body": "<p>Nervous about the Chinese stock market? You should be. First, it looks expensive, even after a dip. Second, the authorities in Beijing, by adopting increasingly desperate measures to prop up share prices, are sending an unmistakable message that they fear a crash is a possibility.</p> <p>The latest official attempt to manipulate the stock market would be laughed out of court if it were attempted in the west. The central bank is shovelling cash towards a state-backed finance company that lends to individuals who would like to make bigger bets on the stock market than they can afford. That\u2019s right, in today\u2019s communist China, there are subsidies for stock market speculation.</p> <p>By way of further encouragement, the state itself is piling in. A state-backed wealth fund is buying blue-chip stocks. Meanwhile, supposedly independent brokers and fund managers have decided this is the ideal moment to invest the equivalent of \u00a312bn and pledge not to sell until the main Shanghai index has risen at least 20%. This extraordinary effort, apparently, is required to \u201cuphold market stability\u201d.</p> <p>So what catastrophe has befallen the Chinese stock market? Well, nothing to justify all-out panic. Having risen 150% in a year, the Shanghai Composite Index has surrendered 30% of its gains. That\u2019s how excitable developing markets often work: an enormous rise can be followed by a smaller fall. It\u2019s not unusual. And, at about 20 times earnings, the Shanghai market is not a bargain given the slow-down in growth in the Chinese economy.</p> <p>The authorities in Beijing, one assumes, know all that. But they are inventing and deploying emergency measures anyway. Why? One assumes they think a serious slide in share prices would cause financial distress among 90 million individuals with share accounts. That might damage the real economy or, conceivably, create social unrest. Alternatively, the authorities think a crash could kill Chinese companies\u2019 long-term access to capital. </p> <p>Whatever it is, Beijing has put its credibility on the line. Share prices must rise because the state, in effect, has issued an order. </p> <p>The authorities may win the immediate battle with the market, though it\u2019s by no means certain. Monday\u2019s action was mixed. Blue-chip stocks, such as banks, rose because that is where the wall of money is being directed; small companies\u2019 shares mostly fell.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome in the next few weeks, a policy of state-directed share prices is unsustainable in the long run. If investors believe there is an official safety net to protect them from losses, the next bubble will be bigger and even harder to deflate safely. </p> <p>This is a fight Beijing should have avoided. It will end badly \u2013 if not this time, then next.</p> <h2>Rocky Rolls</h2> <p>What does Warren East bring to the job of chief executive of Rolls-Royce? Two days in, more of the same, meaning another profits warning from the engine maker. Yesterday\u2019s was the third since last October.</p> <p>Only two factors in the latest dip are easy to understand. Oil and gas producers are cutting budgets to respond to a lower oil price; Rolls-Royce\u2019s marine division, which makes almost two-thirds of its revenues from the offshore industry, was bound to be hit. Similarly, everyone knows demand for business jets is soft because oil sheikhs are feeling less wealthy and western sanctions are making life trickier for Russian oligarchs.</p> <p>The third factor, though, is the biggest and most mysterious \u2013 the speed of the fall-off in demand for Rolls\u2019 Trent 700 engine. Decline was inevitable as the engine is nearing the end of its lucrative life, to be supplanted by the Trent 7000. But Rolls-Royce needed one last hurrah from the 700 to make the progression smooth. It fully expected to get it, only to be disappointed on both volumes and prices. This looks like an old-fashioned case of over-optimism. We\u2019re not talking marginal differences. The City cut its forecasts for Rolls\u2019 2016 profits by about 30%.</p> <p>To compound the forecasting error, Rolls had been planning to spend \u00a31bn buying back its own shares. East has halted the process at the halfway point, an embarrassing but correct decision. How can Rolls\u2019 board form a view on whether the stock is cheap enough to buy if it can\u2019t rely on internal projections for demand in the biggest division, civil aerospace?</p> <p>Shareholders will hope that East\u2019s appointment, and the arrival of finance boss David Smith last November, marks the moment when the company\u2019s revenue and profit forecasts can be relied upon. It might, but there is always the threat that East\u2019s promised review of operations brings yet another adjustment to reality. <br>On a 10-year view, Rolls remains a terrific business; the two-year outlook, however, is fuzzy.</p>",
