    "webTitle": "M&S style boss Belinda Earl unveils first step towards turnaround", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A year ago Belinda Earl only ever went to Marks &amp; Spencer to buy food or undies. Having worked for arch-enemy Debenhams for 18 years \u2013 before making millions from its sale \u2013 Earl says there was little to tempt her on M&amp;S's clothing rails, with too many unfashionable, poor quality items. Now, as M&amp;S's two-day-a-week style director, Earl is kitted out head to toe in M&amp;S's premium Autograph spring collection and visits stores even on her days off, as she tries to put the retailer back on the fashion map. It's a big ask. While rivals such as Next, Primark and the online store Asos are roaring ahead, M&amp;S fashions have lurched from dull to dowdy and sales have been going backwards. The stores have only become a destination shop for the over-50s. On Tuesday Earl and her team unveiled their first step towards reversing that trend, unveiling autumn collections which could cost or keep Marc Bolland's job as chief executive. If they sell well he will have bought himself some time, but if they flop he could be out of a job by Christmas. Her answer is a return to the retailer's historic values. \"We are raising the bar in terms of taste, style and quality,\" Earl said. \"It's about helping customers of every size, shape and age look their best.\" The 51-year-old plans to use her experience in rebuilding Jaeger, which she led until early last year before stepping down for health reasons, to try to resurrect M&amp;S's fashion credentials. This week's autumn collection was relatively well received and helped lift M&amp;S's share price nearly 4% to 436p \u2013 its highest level since Bolland arrived. With that under her belt, Earl is now planning a catwalk event around London fashion week to win over shoppers. \"It's about being confident about our collections and really demonstrating to customers that we have them in mind,\" she says. Earl now says that even when she first arrived there were \"hidden gems\" such as attractive dresses and well-cut trousers \u2013 but they were not given enough backing and got lost in the endless, uninspiring rails of clothing. Earl says her experience in building up the Designers at Debenhams range will help underpin the creation of much stronger, clearer brands, which is one of the M&amp;S chief executive's key aims. Bolland and his director in charge of clothing and homewares, John Dixon \u2013 neither of whom have any fashion experience \u2013 are relying on Earl to shake-up M&amp;S's clothing set-up. She first sold fashion as a Saturday girl at Debenhams when she was 16, before heading off to study business and management at university. She then completed a two-year traineeship at Harrods before returning to Debenhams and working her way up to chief executive. Her two-day-a-week job at M&amp;S \"makes me have a very efficient way of working,\", she says. \"It focuses my days and brings focus to the business as well.\" It is a tough turnaround job. Underlying sales of M&amp;S's clothing and homewares have been falling for nearly two years. The brand has been in decline for much longer than that as shoppers have turned to a whole range of cheaper, more fashionable or more luxurious alternatives. By trying to compete with fast growing rivals such as Primark on price, M&amp;S lost the high ground on quality, while its fans have got steadily older and now average 49 . About 60% of the UK's adult population buys some kind of clothing or homewares in M&amp;S every year, but everyone seems to have their own personal gripe: skirts are too long or too short, there are too many sleeveless tops and dresses, the fabrics are too flimsy, they don't wash well, the sizings are haywire. In a bid to respond, Earl says she has been listening to customers, in focus groups, through research questionnaires and in one-on-one meetings with shoppers who have written in. Someone in her team went through every question asked at a M&amp;S annual shareholder meeting over the last several years, to identify recurring complaints. Earl says that shoppers repeatedly demanded better quality and so, despite tough economic times with people holding on to their pennies, M&amp;S is upping its use of more expensive fabrics such as cashmere and silk. \"We started to look down for inspiration and we should be looking up for aspiration. Our customers are aspiring to premium and luxury brands in the fashion world,\" says Earl. M&amp;S's cheapest products won't increase in price, because the retailer has bought in bigger volumes from fewer suppliers \u2013 potentially 10% fewer \u2013 in order to get better deals on big-selling items such as T-shirts and cashmere sweaters. Basics have already been subtly improved - T-shirts, for example, will now be 2cm longer. More coats and dresses have also been added to the ranges and every store will have a dedicated department for these essentials by the autumn, a big change from now where many small and medium sized shops don't stock either. M&amp;S's in-house brands, including Autograph, Per Una and Indigo, will be given a makeover and Limited Collection has been re-branded as Limited Edition. It will focus on short blasts of \"seasonal must-haves\" as part of a longer-term bid to win back younger shoppers. Earl says: \"Our vision is to target the 30-plus customer. We know she comes into stores, maybe not always for clothing, but we have an opportunity to attract her with really good quality and pieces that are key assets to her wardrobe.\" In truth Earl's short working week means M&amp;S is relying on strong teamwork between her, Dixon and the womenswear director, Frances Russell, who previously revived M&amp;S's key lingerie ranges. Dixon, meanwhile, has arrived from the far better performing M&amp;S food business, which he turned around with a combination of product innovation, better promotions and improved efficiency from new technology and distribution systems. He aims to use the same levers to reboot fashion. \"We are working well as a team,\" says Earl. But whether they will be successful remains to be seen. As she says \"This is a big test.\"",

Jim O'Sullivan, chief US economist with High Frequency Economics, said the housing recovery is still in its beginning stages and has a long way to go to make up the ground it lost during the crash. \"I think what we've seen is rational and not exactly exuberant,\" he said, putting a twist on the old Alan Greenspan warnings of \"irrational exuberance\" as housing and stocks were rising in the late 1990s. With the housing market back, investors have been wondering how to make money on it. Many have piled into homebuilders like Toll Brothers and Lennar, but others have taken more creative investing paths. Bill Smead of Smead Capital Management said he approached the housing boom from other investments, like buying shares of Home Depot because it sells home construction equipment, or buying shares of banks including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan because they hold an inventory of foreclosed homes. He also bought shares of Comcast on the reasoning that new homeowners will need cable.",

The FSA, which imposed the \u00a330m fine, only found out about the proposed \u00a321bn takeover through the media.

Thiam earned a total package worth \u00a37.8m in 2012, a 66% increase compared with a year earlier. Shareholders voted in favour of Thiam's re-election, despite the questions, with just 1.9% voting against. The minor rebellion against the Pru's pay was similar in scale to that staged by Aviva shareholders,with 11.7% voting against its pay report at the annual meeting last week.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England's recession-busting policy of quantitative easing could end up costing the Treasury up to \u00a380bn \u2013 more than outweighing any profits it will make from the scheme, according to new research by the International Monetary Fund. Policymakers have become increasingly concerned about their \"exit strategy\" from the unprecedented measures they have used to cushion their economies from the impact of the financial crisis over the past five years. In a study of the impact of \"unconventional\" policies, including the Bank's \u00a3375bn bond-buying programme, economists at the IMF found the Bank could sustain losses of anything up to 5.5% of GDP, or almost \u00a380bn when it sells the government bonds back into the market. The Treasury announced last November it would appropriate the interest payments from the Bank's holdings of government bonds, in a move that helped to flatter the public finances. Recent Bank research suggested those cumulative gains could eventually add up to \u00a360bn. But once the economy looks healthier, the Bank is likely to want to unwind the emergency policy, by pushing up interest rates and selling off its bonds. The IMF suggests that as soon as central banks signal that they are readying themselves to halt QE, bond prices are likely to fall sharply, as investors \"run for the door\". Interest rates, which move in the opposite direction to bond prices, would jump and central banks might be forced to push up rates even further to prove they have not lost control of inflation. \"The potential sharp rise in long-term interest rates could prove difficult to control and might undermine the recovery (including through effects on financial stability and investment). It could also induce large fluctuations in capital flows and exchange rates,\" the IMF warned. The research analyses the potential losses to central banks under three possible scenarios, from a relatively benign one percentage point rise in interest rates, to a much more dramatic six percentage point increase in short-term borrowing costs. Under the most extreme scenario the losses to the exchequer would be \u00a380bn, so even if the Bank is right about the \u00a360bn gains for the Treasury from QE, that could still blow a \u00a320bn hole in the public finances.

      "bodyText": "One of the most dramatic shareholder revolts in recent years was staged on Thursday when City veteran Sir John Bond was ousted from the board of Glencore Xstrata and replaced as chairman by Tony Hayward, the former BP boss whose reputation hit rock bottom during the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The humiliation of Bond marked an extraordinary comeback for Hayward, who was forced out of BP in July 2010 after mishandling the Deepwater Horizon spill and had looked destined for a long period in the corporate wilderness. But in a dramatic scene at the start of the first annual meeting of the newly formed FTSE 100 commodity trading and mining house, Hayward was promoted from senior independent director to interim chairman and Bond was left scrambling to repair the damage to his reputation caused by the negotiations to sell Xstrata to Glencore. The once-disgraced BP boss is now temporarily chairing a FTSE 100 boardroom that has been stripped of four other non-executive directors \u2013 all formerly of Xstrata \u2013 who were also ousted on Thursday. Investors had been angered at the way Xstrata had been sold with huge additional pay awards \u2013 initially of as much as \u00a3240m \u2013 designed to retain the services of 73 of the mining group's managers. At BP, Hayward infuriated Americans when he said \"I want my life back\" in the aftermath of the explosion and oil spill that killed 11 people. It also caused pollution across the Gulf of Mexico and left the company with a compensation bill of at least $40bn. Hayward had begun his rehabilitation at cash shell Vallares, now spun into the Kurdish oil company Genel, which he runs. He took on the non-executive position at Glencore after it floated two years ago and began its courtship of Xstrata. Bond had been chairman of Xstrata and was to chair the enlarged company until a successor was found, but he stunned the first annual meeting of the new company by revealing he had failed to be elected by big institutional investors, which voted by proxy ahead of the meeting. In scenes rarely witnessed at any company, Bond handed control of the session to Hayward as the meeting began, saying it was the \"right thing for me to do\". The scale of opposition later became clear: 80% of investors voted against him, a scale of rebellion that shareholder advisory group Manifest described as unprecedented. The 71-year-old former HSBC banker later issued a statement in which he acknowledged that the retention payments for Xstrata managers had caused the revolt. \"I recognise and respect the strong opposition among many to the retention arrangements which the board felt appropriate to ensure management stability,\" said Bond. Three former Xstrata boardroom colleagues \u2013 Con Fauconnier, a former mining executive; Peter Hooley, the former finance director of Smith &amp; Nephew; and Ian Strachan, the one-time boss of engineer BTR \u2013 were all also voted down. The other non-executive from Xstrata who had been due to sit on the board, former Treasury mandarin Sir Steve Robson, refused to allow his name to go forward for the vote. Bond, one of the most senior figures in the City, admitted the takeover had been \"complex and protracted, hence the anomalous situation today of my being up for re-election when I had anticipated departing with my successor in place\". He had taken on a number of high profile roles after retiring from HSBC in 2006, including chairing Vodafone until 2011. He then joined Xstrata, where his tenure was dominated by the controversial tie-up with Glencore. The deal was subject to a number of renegotiations before finally being approved in November. His announcement that he would be not be elected came just hours after an early-morning notice to the stock exchange that Robson had resigned without standing for re-election to the new board. Robson was also on the board of Royal Bank of Scotland when it nearly collapsed. Just four directors are left on the Glencore Xstrata board, a fact that immediately sparked anxiety that Ivan Glasenberg, the founder of Glencore, would wield too much control.

A complete clear-out of Xstrata directors is the right outcome. Their handling of the saga was a shambles.

Oven sales have also increased significantly and James said the home baking craze sparked by Mary Berry and BBC2's Great British Bake Off was helping, with enough sold in the last quarter to bake 2m cupcakes. He added that the company would be in a net cash position for the first time in more than five years after having net debt of \u00a3108m last year. He said: \"We will end the year with a net cash position and that puts us in a really strong position to talk to our suppliers and stockholders and talk about growth. \"I think shareholders have had a pretty good ride and I'm glad to be able to see it.\" The shares hit a three-and-a-half-year high last month and were up more than 7% at 39p. The electricals group Comet, camera specialist Jessops and music retailer HMV collapsed into administration earlier this year. HMV was bought by the private equity group Hilco, with about 100 stores closing. Jessops has been resurrected by the Dragons Den star Peter Jones but James said about the revival: \"We're not trembling in our boots.\" Dixons competes directly with Amazon but James refused to be drawn on the online retailer's tax affairs, only saying he felt Dixons had the customer service that Amazon lacked. He said 80% of purchases involved a customer using the Dixons websites. Bubb said: \"The scale of losses at the wretched Pixmania e-commerce operation continues to amaze, but it is good to see that Dixons has the wind in its sails in the UK and Nordics.\"",

      "bodyText": "Thank you for all your comments. It was a rumbustious, lively exchange of views, as Boris Johnson might say. Graeme Wearden is back tomorrow, no doubt armed with more pictures of rioting Greeks. To anyone who missed their regular fix, I apologise. More scepticism from Michael Hewson. And its hard not see to see the whole French agenda being driven by a basic loss of confidence and search for a sugar daddy Not everyone is embracing the other side of his argument - that everyone work longer and be more entrepreneurial Francois Hollande, French prime minister, has gone on the offensive after a run of bad figures, and especially yesterday's 0.2% contraction in GDP. The triple dip recession is a blow to Paris when Hollande promised to reject austerity in favour of growth. But he's probably pushing in the wrong direction if he thinks closer political integration is on the cards and more than that, will be the saviour of France. Our Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald has seen a think tank report that urges Dublin to push for growth in the eurozone or risk further pain Henry McDonald, Dublin One of Ireland's most respected economic think-tanks has warned that Irish growth rates depend on Europe turning the corner. The Republic's Economic and Social Research Institute has projeced that growth in Irish output and jobs will continue this year and into 2014. In their latest Quarterly Economic Commentary, the ESRI predicts growth of 18% in 2013 and 2.7% in 2014. Crucially the ESRI believes unemployment could fall below 14% of the workforce. But, and it is a big but, the ESRI concludes that this relies on fellow Europeans buying the goods and services Ireland has to offer from its resilent export sector. Due to global economic uncertainty, the ESRI urges the Irish government to continue to drive down the country's massive public sector debt. By doing so it said that \"the deficit will be eliminated and the public finance contraction will not be weighing on the domestic economy\". James Knightley at ING bank believes the US unemployment and inflation figures will force the Fed chief to be a little more downbeat about the recovery, though the housing data was mixed. In terms of today\u2019s data it should be remembered that the drop in housing starts is a fall from a five year high while building permits rose 14.3% and yesterday\u2019s National Association of Home Builders reported a rise in activity. We therefore suspect that the fall in housing starts figure is a temporary blip. With the activity data moving in lots of different directions right now and inflation remaining benign it is highly unlikely that the Fed will change its policy stance anytime soon. Consequently, Bernanke is likely to adopt a cautious tone when he testifies before the Joint Economic Committee on the economic outlook next Wednesday. A clarification on US inflation. I cited the year on year increase in CPI inflation of 1.1% in the last but one post, but the world is understandably more focused on the month-on-month figure which showed the cost of living fell in April for a second month, and as Bloomberg points out, \"the first back-to-back declines in inflation since late 2008. Just for the record, the month on month decline was 0.4%, helped mainly by lower fuel costs. And there is your mega stat of the day. When we ask ourselves why is the US improving and look to the Fed and Obama stimulus, we are only partly right. Low fuel costs for a modern economy run on oil is manna from heaven. Low inflation based on low petrol prices IS the stimulus. But as Bernanke knows, you don't want inflation to low for too long or you become Japan. Over in Switzerland there were some seriously bizarre goings on this morning at the Glencore AGM. First Sir John Bond, remember him as the former HSBC boss and swashbuckling banker, took the chair, only to step down in favour of former BP boss Tony Hayward, who promptly said he would step down as soon as a permanent successor was found. This is the world's largest publicly listed miner and commodites trader, which is the largest supplier of coal to power stations worldwide. It is not a nickel and dime company. Yet it has allowed the AGM to become a farce. For more read Jill Treanor's story. It's a bad number for unemployment. The number of people who applied for benefits jumped by 32,000 to 360,000 in the week ended May 11. That's the fastest pace for new benefit claims in six months. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected claims to rise to a seasonally adjusted 330,000 from a revised 328,000 in the prior week. A Labor official told MartketWatch there was nothing unusual in the report and \"there was no evidence that reductions in federal spending under a law known as the sequester contributed to the spike\". Meanwhile inflation came in at 1.1%, which is the largest drop since 2008 and the financial crash. it will certainly give Fed chief Ben Bernanke plenty of scope for unconventional monetary policy over the coming months. See a full report on Reuters More on the EU referendum bill. A Conservative backbencher, James Wharton, has accepted the challenge of introducing a bill paving the way for a referendum on the UK's EU membership. He gained the top slot in a list of MPs able to table private member's bills and readily accepted calls to champion a referendum. He will, says the BBC, \"have full Tory support to bring forward a bill outlining the terms of a referendum to be held by 2017\". Downing Street said Mr Cameron was \"very pleased\" and would ensure the bill was given \"the full support of the Conservative Party\". See Andrew Sparrow's blog for more details The value of Lloyds Banking Group, which everyone will remember disastrously absorbed HBoS at the height of the banking disaster and is now 39% owned by the taxpayer, is on a bounce after boss Antonio Horta-Osorio said the bank was profitable again. Shares have jumped and now nestle just below the 61p level that triggers Mr Horta-Osorio's generous bonus package. There is controversy after the government arbitrarily agreed to set the 61p level, justifying it with a piece of analysisn that says it was the average price of Lloyds shares when it crashed. However, the taxpayer paid 73p for the shares and many argue we should only celebrate when that level is reached. Eurocrats will be watching developments in the UK because there are still many bust banks across the continent in need of extra funds from somewhere. Some analysts estimate that Spanish banks still need \u20ac200bn. Lenders may have recognised many of their debts on empty property developments, but have done little to recognise the debts on their distressed mortgage lending. The German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is talking and repeating his misgivings about central banks printing money. What everyone should remember about the loveable Mr Sch\u00e4uble is that he is a humble lawyer and politician who is obsessed by the German obsession with hyper-inflation. His heyday was negotiating German re-unification. Its been downhill ever since monetary unification, which hasn't worked so well. Obviously, he is not a fan of Japan's latest fiscal and monetary moves. To get the full picture on eurozone inflation there is always the eurostat website page with its country by country breakdown. As Faisal Islam points out Greece is suffering badly \u2026 When I talk to eurocrats they will often spout the usual guff about the worst being behind the euro; that it will hang together and everything, everywhere is improving. But a new book emphasises just how out of touch ambassadors, Brussels officials and government policymakers can become when they stare for too long at the macro economic figures. My colleague John Henley has written about David Stuckler and Sanjay Basu's book The Body Economic about how austerity kills. I won't recount all the grim figures on health and happiness here, suffice it to say, a cosy Brussels salary and pension is the best insulation one can have from real life. Inflation in the eurozone was confirmed by Eurostat at 1.2% for April. More interestingly was the trade figures which showed a 10% fall in imports. This stark illustration of the shocking fall in demand across the 17 member currency zone follows figures earlier this month showing that German and Italian consumers combined could bring themselves to buy only as many cars as the relatively more bouyant UK consumer. There was no increase in exports. As Reuters reports, the 10% fall in imports had one silver lining - that the eurozone's international trade balance for March rose to \u20ac22.9bn. In addition, while I'm discussing/ranting about Germany, the almost fanatical obsession with productivity, which was only knocked off course during the 1990s by unification with the east and the associated costs, is one of the main reasons the UK stayed out of the euro. How can anyone compete with the Germans. The minute you up your game, they move up a gear. There are no sacrifices they won't make to be the most powerful economy. The UK understood this truth of the modern era. That said, the country's low birth rate could be construed as a massive vote of no confidence by the country's families, and women in particular, on the German way of life. A very interesting article on CiF today by Martin Kettle on Germany and why it's better than the UK. Can't agree myself. When he says they don't obsess about immigration in the way we do, I think he must be talking to the wrong people. There are plenty of government economists in Berlin who think immigration is the only answer to a declining population, but know that to even mention it will be to stir huge protests and resentment. Also they discuss education like the Chinese, with a sense of panic that schools and colleges are merely a factory training ground when they need to generate new ideas and be creative.

But a further decline in price inflation will be yet another indication of weak demand and the need for a stimulus package, see Japan\u2019s figures earlier today. Graeme Wearden is away, so I'm in the euroblog hotseat. Its exceptionally sunny in London today. And Tokyo, where the financial weather is usually gloomy, is enjoying some rays of sunshine. Gross domestic product rose 0.9% from the previous quarter, which translates into an annualised 3.5% growth rate.

Some 37,500 roles have already been lost at RBS under the group chief executive, Stephen Hester, who was appointed after the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008, and Unite, Britain's biggest union, said 700 of the latest cutbacks had been outlined to affected staff. \"This is brutal and irresponsible behaviour from RBS which is almost entirely owned by the taxpayer,\" said Unite national officer Dominic Hook. \"It is high time that the banks took their social responsibilities seriously. Since the start of the year RBS, HSBC, Barclays and Lloyds have announced plans to slash about 6,900 jobs. The industry almost caused the economy to implode in 2008 and now it is contributing to a jobs crisis.\" HSBC warned on Wednesday that another 14,000 jobs would be lost in its operations around the world while Lloyds will have cut 40,000 since its \u00a320bn bailout by the time its latest restructuring is completed at the end of this year. McEwan said RBS, which last June was paralysed by a computer meltdown which stopped customers accessing their accounts, was investing \u00a3700m in improving services. \"Regrettably, we can only do that by restructuring the way we work in head office so that every effort is concentrated on supporting our customers and the frontline staff that serve them. This is clearly difficult news for our staff and we will do everything we can to support them, including seeking redeployment opportunities wherever possible to ensure compulsory redundancies are a last resort.\" The union said the biggest impact would be on staff in the Gogarburn head office on the outskirts of Edinburgh with the rest of the cuts spread across the country. Two departments providing support to frontline staff are being cut by 80%, the union said.",

Nine of its 17 member countries are in recession, with the steepest quarterly decline \u2013 1.3% \u2013 seen in Cyprus, which received the first tranche of a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.45bn) bailout package earlier this week.</p> <p>The grim data will ramp up the pressure on eurozone politicians to ease the pace of tax rises and spending cuts. But with Angela Merkel facing re-election in September, there is little chance of a radical shift. The German chancellor has so far resisted any easing of austerity measures.</p> <p>\"The best we can hope for in the foreseeable future is a slight slowdown in the pace of austerity, when what we actually need is a grand reversal of strategy,\" said Sony Kapoor, director of think-tank Re-Define. Germany managed to avoid a recession, but scraped growth of just 0.1%.

      "bodyText": "France slid into recession in the first three months of 2013, as the economic malaise that has crippled the crisis-hit peripheral countries of Greece, Portugal and Spain spread to the heart of the eurozone. A flurry of official figures released on Wednesday showed that output from the eurozone economy as a whole has now been in decline for six successive quarters. Nine of its 17 member countries are in recession, with the steepest quarterly decline \u2013 1.3% \u2013 seen in Cyprus, which received the first tranche of a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.45bn) bailout package earlier this week. The grim data will ramp up the pressure on eurozone politicians to ease the pace of tax rises and spending cuts. But with Angela Merkel facing re-election in September, there is little chance of a radical shift. The German chancellor has so far resisted any easing of austerity measures. \"The best we can hope for in the foreseeable future is a slight slowdown in the pace of austerity, when what we actually need is a grand reversal of strategy,\" said Sony Kapoor, director of think-tank Re-Define. Germany managed to avoid a recession, but scraped growth of just 0.1%. Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said, \"it's easy to get caught up in the drama of the individual crises in the eurozone, but behind it all it's important not to forget that it does very real damage to economic performance. What you're seeing now is exactly that.\" France double dip Almost exactly a year after Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's inauguration as president, it emerged on Wednesday that France has slipped back into recession and economists said there would be more bad news to come for the Hollande government. \"The economy will remain under pressure in the coming quarters from rising unemployment, tight credit and higher taxation,\" said Petr Zemcik, director of economic research at Moody's Analytics. Finance minister Pierre Moscovici was forced to deny that his forecast of a sickly 0.1% economic growth for 2013 as a whole was too optimistic, after Wednesday's data showed a 0.2% decline in GDP in the first quarter. \"I'm sticking to the figures,\" he said. Germany scraping growth Although Europe's largest economy avoided recession, scraping growth of 0.1% in the first quarter, it was a weaker-than-expected reading and underlined the fact that the downturn in the eurozone is affecting its traditionally powerful core countries as well as the crisis-hit periphery . Guy Foster, head of portfolio strategy at investment manager Brewin Dolphin, said the strength of the euro against the yen in recent months, as the Bank of Japan implements a massive quantitative easing programme, has not helped the export-dependent German economy. \"Germany is suffering a perfect storm. Weaker growth in China weighs on demand, while the depreciation of the yen is making supply more competitive.\" Neville Hill, economist at Credit Suisse, said, \"German GDP only rose by 0.1% quarter on quarter in Q1 after a material 0.7%q/q fall in the fourth quarter last year. Averaging out the two quarters, this is a poor performance for a competitive economy that is not facing any fiscal headwinds and suggests that weakness has spread to all European countries\" Spain down 0.5% Wednesday's figures confirmed there has been no let-up for the Spanish economy, which continues to suffer the after-effects of a catastrophic property bust, and the resulting financial crisis, which prompted Madrid to ask its eurozone partners for a bailout of its banks. The Spanish economy contracted by 0.5% in the first quarter of this year, and is now a full 2% smaller than 12 months ago. Italy down 0.5% Prime minister Enrico Letta recently warned that his country was \"dying from fiscal consolidation\", and Wednesday's figures suggested the economy remains in intensive care. GDP declined by another 0.5% in the first quarter of 2013, according yesterday's figures, slipping to a level 2.3% lower than a year earlier. Voters in Italy's recent general election appeared to reject the harsh austerity measures imposed by the technocratic government of Mario Monti, and Letta has emerged as the leader of a cross-party anti-austerity coalition. Greece five-year recession Financial turmoil in Greece may have faded from the headlines in recent months as Cyprus became the latest eurozone member to receive a bailout; but according to figures released in Athens , the economy is still contracting at an annual rate of 5.3% (no quarterly figures comparable with other countries' have yet been published). That's marginally slower than the 5.7% pace of decline in the final quarter of 2012, but suggests the economy remains deep in the doldrums, more than five years after it first slipped into recession. Netherlands \u20ac46bn spending cuts The Netherlands is another core eurozone economy feeling the chill winds of the crisis. The latest figures show that it has been contracting for three successive quarters, as the government of Mark Rutte battles to implement a \u20ac46bn (\u00a338bn) package of public spending cuts, and households struggle to cope with the impact of a property bust. Dutch GDP declined by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2013.Portugal: Like Greece, bailed-out Portugal remains deep in the red, though the pace of contraction did ease in the first quarter of 2013, with GDP declining by 0.3%, down from 1.8% in the final three months of 2012. However, with the Portuguese economy almost 4% smaller than a year ago, there is still little sign of a light at the end of the tunnel.",
