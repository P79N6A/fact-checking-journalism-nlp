Banks is also contacting customers to ensure they are prepared for any potential rises in interest rates from their historic low levels. Banks does not expect UKAR to make a profit from running the government's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme and expects to deploy about 20 staff to review applications by potential borrowers.

      "bodyText": "The investment banks tasked with allocating shares in last month's controversial Royal Mail float face a grilling by MPs over allegations they discriminated against UK pension funds and favoured foreign investors. Goldman Sachs and UBS led an offer that has been widely criticised for short-changing taxpayers by selling a major government asset on the cheap, after Royal Mail shares immediately soared on the stock exchange and continue to trade at a premium of around 70%. Those concerns have been exacerbated by the presence of sovereign wealth funds \u2013 including Kuwait, Singapore and Abu Dhabi \u2013 on the Royal Mail's share register. One senior City source, who has worked on major UK privatisations, said: \"The Royal Mail was probably a bit cheap, but it is one thing to sell it at a cut-price to UK pension funds \u2026 There was a disproportionate amount of shares that went to sovereign wealth funds.\" Senior representatives from Goldmans and UBS will appear in parliament next Wednesday to answer questions from MPs on the business, innovation and skills select committee, alongside peers from JP Morgan, Citibank, Deutsche Bank and stockbroker Panmure Gordon. The MPs' concerns over the flotation are echoed by City figures. A top UK fund manager said: \"A lot of people were very upset at their allocation, even on day zero before the shares started trading at a premium. \"It may be that the advisers did not take account of the political implications and do as good a job as they could have done.\" A source close to the committee confirmed: \"This is something the committee is aware of. It may well come up in the session.\" In the months running up to the privatisation, it is understood that Royal Mail, the government and its advisers were working with a small group of financial institutions in order to get an early idea of how the shares should be priced. That inner core of investors, which is thought to have largely excluded top UK pension fund managers, ended up with the most sizeable allocations. Among the top three new investors in Royal Mail are GIC Private, formerly known as the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, which has a 4% stake, and Kuwait Investment Office, which holds 1.42%. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has 0.09%, according to the financial data provider Thomson Reuters. However, Royal Mail's new owners also include a string of financial institutions, including the likes of UBS (Luxembourg) SA, which own shares on behalf of anonymous clients including sovereign wealth funds. Royal Mail's official share register fails to provide further detail on its new owners, as virtually all shareholders are hidden behind nominee accounts. Neither Goldman Sachs nor UBS would comment on how they had allocated the shares. The key focus of the BIS committee next Wednesday, however, will be the valuation assigned to Royal Mail, which was largely set by salesmen from Goldman Sachs and UBS, in conjunction with the government and its adviser, the investment bank Lazard. Shares in the postal service floated at 330p and immediately soared, something that had been predicted by a number of City analysts not working on the float, who are forced to calculate valuations without the breadth of information provided to official banking advisers. Royal Mail shares closed on Thursday at 557p \u2013 an increase of more than \u00a32.2bn on the company's flotation value. Gert Zonneveld, co-head of research at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said in early October that he was convinced the government's official valuation of Royal Mail at \u00a32.6bn-\u00a33.3bn - or 260p-330p a share - was a significant undervaluation, giving his initial range of \u00a33.7bn-\u00a34.5bn. \"I'm so convinced they [the government] got it wrong,\" he said. \"I think they're more than \u00a31bn too low.\" A subsequent Zonneveld note after the shares had been floated then valued Royal Mail at \u00a35.7bn, or 570p a share. Perhaps equally embarrassing for the government is the \u00a36bn valuation put on the company in early October by a computer programme called Quest, which is run by the investment bank Canaccord. Quest was designed by Terry Smith, the outspoken boss of the City brokerage firm Tullett Prebon, where Michael Fallon, the minister of state and one of the key government figures leading the float, sat on the board for eight years. Vince Cable, the business secretary, will appear in front of the committee on 27 November, accompanied by a representative from Lazard. One City source described the suggestion that sovereign wealth funds were favoured by the banks out of expediency as \"overly cynical\", as they were large, long-term investors in many shares listed on the London Stock Exchange.",

Officials from Unite said the latest cuts \u2013 which the bank insisted would be voluntary \u2013 came on top of a warning to staff in Coventry and Dartford last week that 600 roles could go. The latest cuts are taking place in the retail division \u2013 which Antony Jenkins ran until his promotion to chief executive in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal \u2013 which employs 33,600 staff across the UK. Jenkins has used a number of recent presentations to the City to set out his vision for a greater use of technology at the bank \u2013 a move that analysts believe could lead to 40,000 job cuts from the total current workforce of 140,000 .

That comes after an unexpectedly large rebound of 0.5 percent in the second quarter that pulled France out of recession. Economists had said that rebound was partially due to technical effects and that France would likely not sustain that kind of growth in the near term.</p> <p>The latest figures showed that exports, which had been a big factor in France's rebound, fell sharply. Some corporate investment was also down and household spending slowed.</p> <p>Last quarter, the French government hailed the growth figure as a proof that its reforms were beginning to bear fruit, although it cautioned that more time was needed. But many economists said that the rebound was artificially pumped up by such things as high energy use during a particularly cold winter and spring. They contended that France still needs to make significant changes to make its economy more competitive.</p> <p>For example, economists say that France's cost of labor, even after a tax credit, is still too high. State spending also needs to be cut, so France doesn't rely so heavily on taxes to meet its deficit obligations. That leaves France in a tight spot, since it's difficult to cut spending while the economy is still floundering.</p> <p>[end]</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=26&amp;date=20131114\"><strong>The full statement from INSEE is online here, including this chart</strong></a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e9f541f0-63d3-490c-a95f-062621268a5d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/14/1384414555436/6ea7820c-cc05-4db7-bfd3-8569a6f53869-460x297.png\" alt=\"French GDP components\" width=\"460\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: INSEE</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52847835e4b06f50dbc6f5e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-14T07:28:20.934Z\">7.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Germany's statistics body warned that trade was weak in the last quarter, pulling GDP growth down to +0.3%.</p> <p>Instead, \"positive impulses exclusively from inside Germany\" drove growth, the Statistics Office said.

      "bodyText": "And that's the end of the Eurogroup press conference. And also the end of this liveblog. It's been quite a day -- dominated by the news that the eurozone economy has faltered. Janet Yellen's confirmation hearing this afternoon was also a key event, with the next Federal Reserve chair surviving the ordeal and mounting a strong defence of the Fed's policies. And tonight, euro finance ministers have hailed Ireland and Spain for reaching the end of their respective programmes. They've also put more pressure on Athens to crack on with its own commitments. Coverage of the eurogroup GDP data starts back at 6.55am, with the news that the France economy had shrunk by 0.1%. At 10am we got the news that the euro area grew by just 0.1%. It's still 3% below its pre-crisis peak. Ireland's decision to choose a 'clean' exit from its bailout, and not seek a precautionary credit line, broke around 11.30am. I covered the highlights of Janet Yellen's confirmation hearing, in which she promised senators that QE would end when the US economy was strong enough. She also made it clear that lowering unemployment, and better regulating Wall Street, were top priorities. And finally, the eurogroup press conference -- and the warning to Greece to make more progress to reach a deal with its lenders. Highlights start here. Goodnight! Some more reaction and reporting from the Eurogroup presser: Another question on Ireland and Spain - does the fact they're both exiting their financial programmes mean that the European approach works? Dijsselbloem says it does indeed proof that it works, but also that it demands \"programme commitments\" (is that another nudge at Athens?) As he put it: Both Spain and Ireland have proven they have that kind of commitment. Journalists are asking for more details of the negotiations between Greece's government and the Troika. Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that he's concerned that there's not been more progress -- these talks started back in September. We might not get a deal before the end of the year, unless Athens gets moving on the four measures he identified (see here). Olli Rehn adds that there is still \"considerable progress\" to be made before Greece's aid tranche can be disbursed. Dijsselbloem goes on to acknowledge that the Greek government has been working hard -- at some cost -- but it needs to deliver on its commitments. The glass is half full, he adds. In the Q&amp;A session, Jeroen Dijsselbloem is asked about surveillance of Ireland once it ends its bailout. He explains that there will be twice-yearly visits from the ECB and the EU, but no actual supervision. Commissioner Olli Rehn also speaks, saying that the economic situation in the eurozone hasn't changed drastically since yesterday. He can't escape today's GDP figures, though, conceding that growth of just 0.1% across the area is \"modest\". Rehn also congratulates Spain and Ireland, saying that the Irish exit from its bailout sends a \"signal to other countries\". Here's the official statements: Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that the Greek government must deliver on four areas in order to reach agreement with its lenders and unlock its next aid tranche. They are: 1) achieve the prior actions, or \"milestones\" agreed in June (that would include cuts to its public sector workforce), 2) closing the fiscal gap in 2014 and 2015, 3) Implementing economic reforms 4) Improving the governance of its privatisation programme Dijsselbloem conceded that Athens has made progress, but added \" The job is not yet done. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has begun the press conference, saying it was a particularly important Eurogroup meeting because discussed two exits from financial programs - Ireland's and Spain. The Irish and Spanish people have been through very difficult periods, but I'm confident that they are on the road to recovery, says Dijsselbloem. Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup fully supports Ireland's decision to choose a 'clean' exit from its bailout, without a precautionary credit line. He also fully supports Spain's 'clean exit' from its banking support programme. A quick heads-up: the eurogroup meeting in Brussels has finished. A press conference is starting soon - it's being streamed here. Energy provider Centrica didn't benefit from the Yellen rally today, seeing another 5% wiped off its share price after hitting investors with a profit warning. British Gas's parent company said public anger over price hikes was damaging trust in the industry, and deterring new investment, adding: \"Energy suppliers and politicians both have a role to play in helping to minimise the impact of higher costs on bills and improving transparency to restore trust in the industry.\" And outsourcing firm Serco, embroiled in a series of rows and inquiries into its government work, tumbled almost 17% by close of trading. It also issued a profit warning, and announced hundreds of job cuts. My colleague Terry Macalister reports: The group, which is being scrutinised by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations it charged for tagging offenders who were in prison or dead, admitted that a moratorium on new contracts for the Ministry of Justice meant that earnings would be \"moderately lower\" in 2014 than this year. Serco earns about 25% of its revenue from British government contracts and the its shares fell by nearly 17% on Thursday. The company said it was failing to win as many new deals as expected and would cut 400 jobs at a cost of \u00a314m in 2013. Janet Yellen's defence of loose monetary policy and quantitative easing helped European stock markets closed higher tonight. Traders who followed her confirmation hearing were left with the clear impression that the Fed chair-in-waiting is in no rush to start tapering QE. The punch bowl could be here for a while... FTSE 100: up 36 points at 6666, +0.5% German DAX: up 94 points at 9149, +1% French CAC: up 43 points at 4283, 1% Italian FTSE MIB: up 27 points at 18,760, +0.15% Spanish IBEX: up 33 points at 9,708. +0.35% Capital Economics says Yellen played the 'continuity card' At her Senate nomination hearing today, the current Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen carefully defended the Fed's policy and regulatory actions over the past few years, suggesting that her approach will not differ much when she takes over as Chair from Ben Bernanke early next year. In particular, there was no indication that she would put more weight on the employment part of the Fed's dual mandate and pursue a more expansionary monetary policy. Breaking news in the UK -- Barclays is cutting around 1,700 posts in a push for greater automation at its high street branches. Jill Treanor has the story: Janet Yellen's testimony is over. It's worth noting that she repeated her concerns over the US jobs market, saying too many people have dropped out of the labour force. Asked about rising inequality since the crisis began, she replied that it's been a growing problem since the late 1980s. Democratic senator Charles Schumer seemed impressed with the Fed chair in waiting, telling Yellen that: Your Brooklyn wisdom shines through. Yellen replied that \"I never forget my roots\". A class act. Back in the UK, Fitch has downgraded the Co-op Bank's credit rating by two notches, to B (that's five notches into junk territory.) Fitch warned that Co-op could lose customers who aren't happy that two hedge funds have forced the Co-op Group to cede majority control. It also warned there's a risk that its proposed \u00a31.5bn fund raising could fail. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The Group\u2019s stake is to be cut to 30% from 100% - with bondholders led by US hedge funds Aurelius, and Silver Point taking the rest. Fitch said the new strategy could make it difficult to generate new capital, especially as the bank will not make a profit before 2014 at the earliest, in the short term . The downgrade - which coincided with the Queen officially opening the Group\u2019s new head office in Manchester - to B from BB- could be followed by another if the restructuring plan fails. Bondholders must vote through the complex restructuring by November 29 and if they failed to back it, there is a possibility it could be taken into the control of the Bank of England through a so-called resolution procedure. Fitch said there was \u201cmaterial risk to the success of the restructuring\u201d. A question about the impact of the Fed's loose monetary policy. Yellan agrees that savers are hurt by the record low interest rates today. However, to create jobs we need to get the economy back to normal. These policies will do that. Savers play many roles, she adds. Some are also parents, whose children are leaving education and looking for jobs. They can see the wider benefits. Word from Brussels... A reminder of the recent clash over America's debt ceiling - Janet Yellen warns senators that a US debt default would be catastrophic. Another good quote from earlier: Did the Fed's failure to regulate Wall Street better help cause the financial crisis, senator Warren asks. Yellen replies that the Fed has gone back and tried to learn a lot of lessons from recent years, and must make regulation an absolute top priority in future. Janet Yellen appears to be navigating the Senate banking committee hearing safely, with skill and charm. She's been defending the Fed's stimulus programme, stating the importance of healing the economy, and regulating Wall Street better. Certainly no gaffes. Senator Elizabeth Warren is speaking now, chiding the Fed's board for delegating important supervisory issues to its staff in a way it would never treat monetary issues. Yellen agrees that the Fed's supervision role is just as important as its monetary remit. Corker concludes his question by thanking Janet Yellen for her transparency and helpfulness. The Republican senator could potentially have opposed Yellen's confirmation, Bloomberg says, but perhaps he's been won over (having used his first question to make sure everyone knows she never tried to stop the Fed tightening monetary policy). Senator Bob Corker wants to know how many times Janet Yellen has voted for an interest rise. She suggests that she did so on at least 20 occasions since becoming a Fed governor in 1994. It's 27 times, he reveals (if you're going to answer your own questions, Senator, why have Dr Yellen there at all?). There is an important point behind the question, though - Corker points out that Yellen has never voted against a proposed rate rise. A reminder - there's a live video feed of Janet Yellen's testimony here on CNBC....and also here on Marketwatch, which have both been covering the full session closely. What factors influence the gold price? Janet Yellen says that gold's an asset that people like to hold when they're worried about economic conditions and financial turbulence. And asked about share prices, Yellen says they are not in \"bubble-like\" territory today. The Fed does not have a responsibility to support the stock market. Yellen is asked about the impact of Washington budget cuts and tax increases. She replies that if there was less fiscal drag, and \"I'd hope there would be less going forward\", the economy's growth rate would probably pick up. Janet Yellen tried to pour chilly water on a question about a new law to audit the Fed, saying she wouldn't welcome anything that hurt its independence. Interestingly, some Democrats are pitching questions on the question of why more ordinary Americans aren't benefitting more from the Fed's measures. No suggestion that this will won't stop them supporting her as Ben Bernanke's replacement. Yellen, who isn't giving terribly snappy answers, has generally been backing the Fed's approach under Bernanke. Members of the Senate Banking Committee are quizzing Janet Yellen on the issue of regulating Wall Street better. She says that the Fed wants to improve the way that America's largest financial institutions are regulated. Tackling the problem of banks who are \"too big to fail\" must be one of its top goals. A frankly curious few questions from republican Senator Richard Shelby to Janet Yellen, on whether the likes of [James] Tobin and [John Maynard] Keynes would have supported the Fed's massive QE programme. Yellen agrees that the size of the Fed's balance sheet is unprecedented today, before nimbly suggesting Milton Friedman as another economist who'd considered the merits of a central bank acting in this way. She denies that QE's role is to monetise government debt, saying it is designed for occasions where scope for more conventional monetary policy had run out. Shelby also dismissed the point that other central banks have used QE as well -- saying the Fed should be setting an example for the rest. That should get teeth grinding in the Bundesbank No-one wants another financial crisis, Janet Yellen says, but today she doesn't see any risk to financial stability from the Fed's bond-buying programme. Senator Mike Crapo takes the role of QE critic at the Yellen confirmation hearing. He quickly challenges Janet Yellen on the \"extreme levels\" of Fed's quantitative easing programme, citing claims that the huge bond-buying programme has only generated a tiny burst of growth. Yellen replies that the US unemployment rate was 8.1% when QE began, and the Fed was pretty pessimistic that it would fall. It's now 7.3%. Could QE carry on indefinitely, asks Crapo. No, Yellen replies. She does not see the programme as continuing forever. The Fed will keep looking at the US economy each month tyo see if it's strong enough to start slowing the programme. Back on Capitol Hill, Janet Yellen is telling senators that it is \"imperative\" that the Federal Reserve does everthing in its power to ensure a robust recovery. Yellen confirms her reputation as someone who \"gets\" the need to fight joblessness. Unemployment, she explains, can bring \"great hardship\" on those without work, on the marriages of those who suffer long spells of unemployment, and on their families. It's therefore vital that the Fed promotes a strong recovery, she added. What are the dangers of 'tapering' the Fed's bond-buying programme too soon? Yellen replies that there are dangers on both sides - from stopping too early, or from maintaining loose monetary policy for too long. Right now, the benefits of the $85bn/month bond buying exceed the costs. As the economy recovers, the Fed must bring policy back to normal. This morning's weak eurozone growth figures have cast a shadow over the monthly meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels. Greece's bailout programme will be on the agenda. Its finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, told reporters that he expected a \"constructive\" discussion, adding: Nobody can deny the progress Greece has achieved so far. Mario Draghi, meanwhile, has echoed Olli Rehn by congratulating Ireland for reaching the end of its bailout programme. Here's our preview of Janet Yellen's testimony: Janet Yellen to pledge further aid to US economy at confirmation hearing Janet Yellen's confirmation hearing is underway, and being streamed live at CNBC.com, and on Bloomberg TV (among other places). Marketwatch have uploaded Janet Yellen's full prepared testimony ahead of her confirmation hearing at the Senate Banking Committee: Text of Yellen\u2019s prepared remarks on nomination Dr Yellen has just arrived for the hearing, surrounded by a scrum of photographers. It's a very subdued start to trading on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average is up just 1 point at 15822. New York traders are waiting for Janet Yellen to begin her testimony at the Senate Banking Committee, as the nominated successor to Ben Bernanke as head of the Federal Reserve. It could be a rough ride for the current deputy Fed chief, whose prepared testimony was more dovish than some had expected (see 8.33am). European commissioner Olli Rehn has hailed Ireland's 'impressive progress' in reaching the end of its bailout programme, and resisted commenting on the decision not to seek a precautionary credit line. In a statement just released, Rehn said: I know the Irish Government has reflected very carefully on this matter. The European Commission has always made very clear that this was a decision for Ireland to take and that we would support Ireland, whichever decision was taken. While challenges remain, Ireland has made impressive progress and is well placed to make a successful and durable programme exit. Graduation from the programme will send a very clear signal to markets and international lenders that the adjustment effort undertaken in Ireland, with the support of its European and international partners, has paid off. Ireland has accumulated significant cash buffers under the programme, helped by the decision taken earlier this year by European creditors to extend the maturities on loans granted to Ireland. In short, today is a good day for Ireland and the Irish people. It provides clear evidence that determined implementation of a comprehensive reform agenda can decisively turn around a country's economic fortunes and put it back on a path of sustainable growth and rising employment. The latest economic and corporate news from America isn't too cheering. 1) The US trade deficit widened to $41.78bn in September, up from $38.7bn in August -- and rather higher than the $39bn pencilled in on Wall Street. Exports fell 0.2% during the month, while imports rose by 1.2%. 2) The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefit dropped to 339,000 last week, down from 341k the previous seven days. That's weaker than the 330k increase which economists expected. There's also bad news for workers at defence firm Lockheed Martin, which just announced 4,000 job cuts by 2015 as it closes several sites. It blamed \"continued declines in U.S. government spending\", and \"an increasingly complex global security landscape\". Here's the full statement. And the world's largest retailer, Walmart, has cut profit forecasts again in the face of rising competition from discount stores. Bloomberg has a good write-up here. Here's Dublin correspondent Henry McDonald on the news that Ireland won't ask for a safety net when its bailout programme ends next month: Ireland to exit EU-IMF bailout without precautionary line of credit Some relief for French president Francois Hollande -- France's football clubs have suspended a strike planned for the end of this month to protest at his 75% super-tax on salaries above \u20ac1,000,000. AFP has more details. On the eurozone GDP figures, my colleague Phillip Inman writes: The eurozone's economic woes persisted in the third quarter as Italy's longest recession continued and a contraction in French output dragged growth down to 0.1%. In the summer, hopes of a strong recovery were boosted by a second quarter rise in GDP of 0.3%, but the momentum in the first half of the year appears to have fizzled out. Here's the full story: Eurozone economic recovery falters in third quarter Alessandro Leipold, chief economist at the Lisbon Council think tank, challenges the suggestion that Ireland is making a 'clean' break with its bailout by deciding not to take a credit line. He reckon's it's a risky decision. Enda Kenny's decision not to ask for a credit line will have one intriguing consequence -- Ireland won't able to sign up for the European Central Bank's OMT programme (in which the ECB would buy a country's bonds to drive down its borrowing costs). Ryan McGrath, a Dublin-based bond dealer with Cantor Fitzgerald, told Reuters: Not taking a credit line is a statement of confidence by the government. It bolsters the sense that Ireland is detaching itself from the peripheral countries \"I don't think the government is being rash. The big question is what are the implications for OMT access. Back to the eurozone's (scrappy) growth figures, and our economics editor Larry Elliott highlights the weak performance from the two biggest players in the single currency: Europe's fledgling recovery did not stall in the third quarter of 2013 but it was a close run thing. Mainly due to a weaker performance by the Big Two \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 the growth rate in the euro area slipped back from 0.3% to 0.1%. Few in the financial markets expect the 17-nation single currency zone to enter a triple-dip recession, but nor is anybody predicting anything other than a prolonged period of sub-par activity in which unemployment remains at one in eight of the workforce and deflationary pressures intensify. And that, Larry concludes, means that the eurozone's 'lost decade' will drag on. Here's his full analysis: Germany and France hold back eurozone's fledgling recovery fastFT have published more quotes from Irish prime minister Enda Kenny, outlining the decision to make a clean break from its financial assistance programme without the protection of a credit line: We will exit the bailout in a strong position The government has been preparing for return to normal market funding for three years.... There are still demanding times ahead. It does not mean any windfall of cash. It does not mean our economic challenges are over. Irish prime minister Enda Kenny has confirmed that his government will exit its bailout programme without the protection of a precautionary credit line. It's quite a moment. Kenny is addressed the Irish parliament now, declaring that: This is the right decision for Ireland. It means that Ireland will make a clean exit from its \u20ac85bn financial assistance programme, which ends on 15th December. It has hit the targets set by its troika of lenders, and Kenny's government must be confident that it can walk alone. A precautionary credit line could have been sought from the European bailout mechanism. It would have given Dublin a guaranteed source of funding if it couldn't borrow at affordable rates in the wholesale money market in future. The full statement is online here. Here's the Irish government's reasoning for going it alone: The market and sovereign conditions are favourable towards Ireland with the country returning to the markets in 2012, holding over \u20ac20 billion in cash reserves at year end which we can use to ensure that we can meet our maturing commitments and funding costs till early 2015 and Irish sovereign bond yields at historically low levels; The public finances are under control in Ireland comfortably in line with EDP targets. Ireland is targeting a deficit of 4.8% in 2014 which is within the 5.1% EDP target and will deliver a primary balance or small surplus. The Government is committed to reducing the deficit to less than 3% in 2015 and putting the debt ratio on a downward path. The two pack, the six pack and the stability treaty, the introduction of the ESM, and the major efforts by the ECB to do whatever it takes to safeguard the currency, further support our efforts to make a sustainable and durable return to the markets. Domestic and international economic conditions are improving, monetary policy decisions are conducive to exit and confidence and sentiment towards Ireland has improved considerably in recent months. Meanwhile in Ireland, the government has been meeting to discuss the process of exiting its bailout programme. An announcement is expected very soon - with rumours flying that the cabinet will decide that it will not take a 'precautionary credit line' (which would have acted as a safety net in case Dublin struggled to borrow in the financial money markets). Here's another sobering fact -- the Italian economy is more than 9% smaller than before the crisis began. And Germany is the only one of the Big Four eurozone members to have clawed back all its lost growth (although France isn't far away). That's via Chris Williamson of Markit, the data provider, who comments: In terms of GDP levels, the Eurozone economy is still 3.0% smaller than its pre-crisis peak. Of the largest member states, only Germany has exceeded its prior peak, with GDP up 2.6%. The French economy remains 0.3% smaller, while Spain and Italy are also 7.4% and 9.1% smaller respectively. By comparison, the UK economy is still 2.5% smaller than its pre-crisis peak while the US is 5.3% larger. Japan has edged 0.1% up on its prior peak. Romania posted the strongest growth across the European Union in the last quarter, with a 1.6% jump in GDP. Cyprus suffered the biggest quarterly decline, shrinking by 0.8% (with the proviso that we only have annual data for Greece, where the economy is 3% smaller than a year ago). The biggest reversal was suffered by the Czech Republic, contracting by 0.5% after growth of 0.6% in Q2. Here's the full table (sorry if it's a bit small, the original is here): Here's a handy graph showing how the economic performance of major countries has diverged since the financial crisis struck in 2008. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, takes an optimistic view. The worst of the economic crisis is over, she argues, despite today's disappointing growth figures: Growth may have slowed but the Eurozone is finding its feet. It has taken a considerably longer time than the likes of the US but we are seeing signs of economic improvement. Let\u2019s not forget the journey the 17 country bloc has made since the financial crisis, given that we haven\u2019t seen the dreaded defaults in countries like Greece and Spain materialise. However, there is still a long way to go. Unemployment continues to be a fly in the ointment and the recovery won\u2019t pick up the pace overnight. More needs to be done to support the labour market from the bottom up. For months we have been calling for an extension to bank lending to SMEs across the Eurozone who are desperate for finance, and are the engine room of the Eurozone\u2019s economy. As things stand, we expect the ECB to continue to boost liquidity through another LTRO. Growth figures may be lower than expected but five years on from disaster we may have seen the worst of the economic turbulence and we are seeing signs of a global synchronised economic growth. The slowdown in eurozone growth to a near-standstill must send a chill through Brussels this morning. Analysts are warning that the recovery is even more fragile than we thought - with the weaknesses in France and Italy threatening to derail efforts to reform their economies. Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy has an uncompromising view of the meagre 0.1% rise in GDP. The \"much-trumpeted economic recovery\" has already faltered. Spiro writes: The chronic phase of the crisis in Europe's ill-managed single currency area is clear for all to see. While the slowdown extends to Germany, it's the dire state of the French and Italian economies that looms large. Outright contractions in GDP in Italy and, more worryingly, France throw the protracted nature of Europe's downturn into sharp relief - particularly at a time when Spain's economy is at least showing some signs of life. The eurozone's second and third-largest economies, which together account for nearly 40% of the bloc's output, have become the \"sick men\" of Europe, mired in economic crises of varying degrees of severity and politically unable to carry out meaningful structural reforms. What's particularly troubling is that the economic fortunes of France and Italy haven't improved since the end of the third quarter: the contraction in France's manufacturing sector deepened in October while Italian retail sales dropped at their fastest pace in three months. While Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight warns that the recovery will remain \"gradual and vulnerable\": It was particularly disappointing to see France suffer a renewed dip of 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in GDP which highlights concern about its underlying competitiveness. There was also a more than halving in the German growth rate to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter from 0.7% in the first, although the economy still looks to be in relatively decent shape. Better news saw Spain eke out marginal growth of 0.1% while the Italian economy essentially stabilized following extended contraction, although concerns persist about the ability of both countries to develop and sustain genuine recove Greece's recession may be easing, but there's no end to its unemployment crisis. Greek GDP fell by 3% in the July-September quarter compared to a year ago, which is a softer decline than the 3.7% annual contraction reported in Q2. Reuters says it's the smallest annual drop in Greek GDP in three years. Quarter-on-quarter data isn't available. The jobless rate, though, was 27.3% in August, according to separate data, matching July's rate (which was revised down from 27.6%). After six years of recession and austerity, Greece's unemployment rate remains twice the eurozone average (a record high of 12.2%). Confirmation that Cyprus's economy continues to suffer from the trauma of its bailout programme. Cypriot GDP shrank by 0.8% in Q3, which means that that 5.7% of national output has been lost over the last year. Not a surprise, as Cyprus's once-dominant banking industry has been brought to its knees this year. Capital controls still restrict how much money people can withdraw at the bank, and large depositors with over \u20ac100,000 have seen their accounts frozen, and hefty haircuts imposed. The euro has weakened this morning, dropping 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.3444. Eurozone economic growth has been lagging behind America's for most of the last two years, as this graph shows: GDP in America (where the Federal Reserve is operating much looser monetary policy than the European Central Bank) rose by around 0.7% in the third quarter. So, it's official, the eurozone's recovery from recession stumbled over the summer and early autumn with GDP rising by just 0.1% in the third quarter of the year. That's a slowdown compared to the growth of 0.3% achieved in the second quarter of the year, when the euroarea exited recession. If you've been with us all morning, you'll know that France's economy was a drag on growth, contracting by 0.1%. Germany's growth of 0.3% was in line with forecasts. But both countries reported weak exports. The official release from Eurostat is here. On a year-on-year basis, the eurozone economy remains 0.4% smaller than in the third quarter of 2012. Eurostat also reports the GDP across the wider European Union rose by 0.2% in July to September. JUST IN: The eurozone grew by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2013. Nearly time for the big number.... GDP for the eurozone as a whole. Economists expected a 0.2% rise in output across the region. Portugal's economy is still growing, but it's also suffered a sharp slowdown. Portuguese GDP rose by 0.2% in the last quarter, compared to the strong 1.1% expansion reported in Q2. Still, there should be relief in Lisbon that it remains out of recession, as its austerity programme continues. On a year-on-year basis, Portugal's economy is 1.0% smaller than a year ago. Back to the eurozone, and many analysts are pointing out that Germany's 0.3% rise in GDP was due to domestic demand. As flagged up 7.28am, Germany's statistics body reported that the balance of exports and imports had a downward effect on GDP growth. Interesting timing, given the EC yesterday announced an in-depth probe into whether Germany's large, persistent trade surplus harms the rest of the eurozone. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities writes: The [eurozone] core and semi-core is seen slowing as per the as expected German 0.3% q/q (paced exclusively by domestic demand, for those idiots at the EU wasting money on investigating Germany's Current Account surplus) and France's very unsurprising, but lower than forecast -0.1% q/q GDP. ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said Germany \"remains the stronghold of the Eurozone,\" adding: there is little reason to doubt the stability of the German economy Oliver Kolodseike of Markit reckon the German economy remains on course: Although the pace of expansion eased from the second quarter, survey data for Q4 so far suggest the German economy is on track to meet the governments\u2019 expectation of an annual 0.6% rise in 2013. Just in, a surprise fall in UK retail sales. Retail sale volumes fell by 0.7% in October, surprising analysts who'd expected that sales would have been flat compared with September. Stripping out fuel, sales were down by 0.6%, according to the Office for National Statistics. Clothing sales dropped by 2.1% during the month - suggesting the decent autumn weather deterred people from buying winter coats and the like. On the upside, sales were still 1.8% higher than a year ago. Italy's recession continues for a ninth quarter, but the end may be in sight. Italian GDP fell by 0.1% in the three months to September, in line with expectations. That means the pace of contraction slowed, following a 0.3% drop in GDP between April and June. It's the smallest quarterly drop in Italian GDP since its recession began in the third quarter of 2011 as this table shows (more details here) Italian GDP is down by 1.9% over the last year, INSEE reported. It also revised down its data for the second quarter, to show a 2.2% annual decline (from a first estimate of 2.1%). The Netherlands has emerged from recession. Dutch GDP grew by 0.1% in the third quarter of the year, according to Statistics Netherlands which also revised up its estimate for Q2 to show that GDP was flat, rather than contracting by 0.1% as first thought. The Netherlands benefited from rising exports in the last quarter, which grew 2.1% year-on-year. Household consumption was down 2.3%. On an annual basis, though, the Netherlands economy remains 0.6% smaller than a year ago. Diego Iscaro of consultancy IHS: The new contraction in activity will definitely not help President Hollande to improve his popularity among the electorate - which currently stands at a record low. Back to France. Finance minister Pierre Moscovici has insisted that the French economy is not sliding back into recession. He's sticking to his forecast of 0.1-0.2% growth this year, despite the disappointing news that GDP fell by 0.1% in July-September. Speaking on RTL Radio, Moscovici blamed one-off factors such as slowing aircraft orders (the Paris Air Show, in June, typically delivers a boost to industry), saying: The productive forces are starting up again, production is recovering We knew the third quarter would mark a pause, it's not a surprise, it's not an indicator of decline, it's not a recession. Moscovici was pretty bullish three months ago when France officially exited recession, hailing the 'encouraging signs of recovery'. To avoid a double-dip recession, France now has to grow its GDP in the current quarter. Europe's stock markets have opened strongly. Instead of fretting about the eurozone's woes, traders are taking comfort from testimony released by the next head of America's central bank overnight. In prepared remarks for the Senate Banking Committee, Janet Yellen said the US labour market and the wider economy were \"far short\" of their potential. She warned: We have made good progress, but we have farther to go to regain the ground lost in the crisis and the recession. And that's being taken as a sign that the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to slow its stimulus programme, which is pumping $85bn of new money into the US economy every month. Cue a stock market rally, sending the FTSE 100 up 1% or 66 points to 6693. Yesterday it fell on speculation that the Bank of England is closer to tightening monetary policy, because Britain's economic recovery is gathering pace. German DAX: up 0.8% French CAC: up 1.06% Italian FTSE MIB: up 0.7% Spanish IBEX: up 1% Yellen testifies before the committee at 10am local time, or 3pm GMT. Decent GDP data from Hungary -- its economy grew by 0.8% in Q3, twice as fast as expected. On an annual basis Hungarian GDP was 1.7% higher. That's the fastest rate since the first quarter of 2011 says Reuters. Austria's economy grew by 0.2% in the third quarter of the year, helped by a small rise in exports. Its WIFO statistics body also revised down Austrian GDP growth in the second quarter to 0.0%, from 0.1%. WIFO also reported that exports rose 0.2% in the last quarter, while imports were up 0.1%. That 0.1% contraction means France's economy has been outperformed by Spain for the first time since early 2009. Spain's economy grew by 0.1% in the last quarter, according to official data release on October 30. The small contraction in France, and the slowing growth in Germany, shows that the euro area economy remains weak despite dragging itself out of recession in the summer. Other countries are doing better. Overnight, Japan reported that its GDP rose by 0.5% during Q3, beating forecasts of 0.4% growth (but slower than the 0.9% in Q2). Britain grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2013, while America posted quarterly growth of around 0.7%. Here's AP's early take on the news that French GDP shrank by 0.1% in the third quarter, dashing hopes of a small expansion: French economy shrinks after surprise rebound The French economy is shrinking again, statistics showed Thursday, underscoring that it is still in trouble despite a rebound last quarter. The French national statistics agency, Insee, said that gross domestic product fell 0.1 percent in the July-to-September quarter. That comes after an unexpectedly large rebound of 0.5 percent in the second quarter that pulled France out of recession. Economists had said that rebound was partially due to technical effects and that France would likely not sustain that kind of growth in the near term. The latest figures showed that exports, which had been a big factor in France's rebound, fell sharply. Some corporate investment was also down and household spending slowed. Last quarter, the French government hailed the growth figure as a proof that its reforms were beginning to bear fruit, although it cautioned that more time was needed. But many economists said that the rebound was artificially pumped up by such things as high energy use during a particularly cold winter and spring. They contended that France still needs to make significant changes to make its economy more competitive. For example, economists say that France's cost of labor, even after a tax credit, is still too high. State spending also needs to be cut, so France doesn't rely so heavily on taxes to meet its deficit obligations. That leaves France in a tight spot, since it's difficult to cut spending while the economy is still floundering. [end] The full statement from INSEE is online here, including this chart: Germany's statistics body warned that trade was weak in the last quarter, pulling GDP growth down to +0.3%. Instead, \"positive impulses exclusively from inside Germany\" drove growth, the Statistics Office said. It reported that spending by private households and the state rose during the quarter, as did business investment. By contrast, the contribution from abroad (exports minus imports) put a brake on GDP growth. France's economy also suffered from weak trade, with exports dropping by 1.5%. The German GDP data is out, and it's more positive than the news from France. Germany's economy grew by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2013. That's in line with expectations, but is slower than the 0.7% growth achieved in the second quarter of this year. On an annual basis, the German economy is 1.1% bigger than a year ago. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Is Europe's economy healing, or is the nascent recovery that began in the summer already petering out? We'll find out this morning, with the publication of new growth data for the third quarter of 2013. And the early news is not encouraging. France's economy shrank by 0.1% in the three months to September, according to provisional data from its statistics body. That's worse than expected, following the 0.5% growth reported in Q2. The small drop in GDP was due to a sharper decline in trade, with French exports falling by 1.5%. Business investment dropped by 0.6%. It's another blow to embattled French PM Francois Hollande, just a week after S&amp;P downgraded France's credit rating. Lots more data still to come, including the first estimate of German and Italian economic growth. The full reading for the eurozone is due at 10am GMT. Economists had predicted that euro area GDP would have have risen by 0.2% - the news from France, though, may have sent them scrabbling to rework their sums.... I'll be tracking all the GDP data, reaction, and other news through the day.",

Asda is also targeting an increase in online revenue to \u00a33bn by 2018, from \u00a31bn currently. Clarke said the company would look into the possibility of opening smaller convenience stores, which is a market it has avoided to date, but that it was not a priority. While rival grocers are opening large numbers of neighbourhood stores, and Morrisons has blamed its lack of a convenience chain for a slowdown in sales, Clarke said he would not consider expanding into convenience outlets until towards the end of the five year period. An improving economic backdrop and rising consumer confidence is not feeding through to the behaviour of Asda customers, Clarke said, adding that consumers in the north east of England, Northern Ireland and South Wales were suffering the most. \"If you're a shopper about to go into Christmas, then the challenge of disposable income is still very high on your agenda. The forecast for the next five years still is incredibly challenged.\"",

The Group's stake is to be cut to 30% from 100% \u2013 with bondholders led by US funds Aurelius and Silver Point taking the rest. Fitch said the new strategy could make it difficult to generate new capital, especially as the bank will not make a profit before 2014 at the earliest. The downgrade, which coincided with the Queen's official opening of the group's new head office in Manchester, took the bank's rating to B from BB- and could be followed by a further downgrade if the restructuring plan fails. Bondholders must vote through the complex restructuring by 29 November. If they fail to back it, there is a possibility the bank could be taken under Bank of England control through a so-called resolution procedure. Fitch said there was \"material risk to the success of the restructuring\". A Co-op Bank spokesperson said: \"The Co-operative Bank notes the announcement from Fitch. The rating agency's response is anticipated and does not alter the Bank's confidence in the Recapitalisation Plan, which is focused on delivering the \u00a31.5bn of capital necessary to put the Bank back on a stronger financial footing.\" The Treasury select committee is to interview David Anderson, the former boss of the Co-op's financial services arm, next week as part of its review into why the deal to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group failed.",

      "bodyText": "Serco, the outsourcing group at the centre of a string of investigations over government contracts, has issued a profit warning and announced hundreds of job losses. The group, which is being scrutinised by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations it charged for tagging offenders who were in prison or dead, admitted that a moratorium on new contracts for the Ministry of Justice meant that earnings would be \"moderately lower\" in 2014 than this year. Serco earns about 25% of its revenue from British government contracts and the its shares fell by nearly 17% on Thursday. The company said it was failing to win as many new deals as expected and would cut 400 jobs at a cost of \u00a314m in 2013. Serco runs everything from defence establishments to prisons and medical services but said it would continue to look for further efficiencies while taking a financial hit in next year's results. \"The net impact of the above factors would lead to profits for 2014 being moderately lower than those for 2013,\" it said. Ed Casey, who took over as chief executive when Chris Hyman quit suddenly last month, said the recent problems with the UK government over alleged overcharging of electronic monitoring contracts had also affected its performance overseas. But Casey added: \"While we are clearly facing challenges and have experienced tougher conditions in recent months, we have still achieved \u00a33bn of contract awards in the year to date and made further progress in our strategy of creating a broader and more balanced portfolio.\" Recent contracts the company has secured include one for the nuclear plant operator Sellafield Ltd, another for Derriford hospital in Plymouth and support to the US air force at Alconbury in Cambridgeshire. Serco said it expected this year's adjusted operating profit to be around \u00a3325m, but its operating margin would be down slightly to 6.4%. Reactions in the City to the latest financial forecast were summed up by Joe Brent, analyst at Liberum Capital. He said: \"Awful statement and we expect yet further weakness.\" Analysts at Canaccord Financial said that despite warnings that the business was being blown off course by the rows with government the trading outlook for 2013 was worse than expected. The Canadian brokerage business urged investors to steer clear of Serco shares, adding: \"We fail to see an improvement in the group's prospects in the medium term.\" The criminal investigation by the SFO into tagging contracts with Serco and its larger rival G4S, launched at the start of November, followed claims that the two firms had charged the MoJ for monitoring offenders who were either dead, back in prison or had their tags removed. In August, City of London police were asked to investigate allegations of fraudulent behaviour by Serco staff in a separate \u00a3285m prisoner escort contract in London and East Anglia. Serco has agreed with government that it would carry out a 12 week \"corporate renewal\" process while having its business practices reviewed by Lord Gold, the senior City lawyer who investigated the Conservative party's cash for access scandal. On Thursday, Casey, who had been in charge of Serco's Americas division before taking over as group chief executive, said: \"The UK government audits and reviews are ongoing and we remain firmly committed to rebuilding the confidence of our UK government customer.\"",

So, we have a lot to catch up on, because I\u2019ve been ignoring this forever. What did I miss?</strong></p> <p>Well, Thursday, Janet Yellen is going to face the Senate banking committee. President Obama nominated her last month as the new chairman of the Federal Reserve to replace Ben Bernanke, and she\u2019ll be the first woman to ever head the Fed. Yellen has been the vice-chair of the Fed, and she has mostly had the same opinions and views as Bernanke does, so her tenure at the Fed probably won\u2019t bring any surprises \u2013 and neither will this hearing.</p> <p>The banking committee will decide whether it will recommend her as the new chairman of the Federal Reserve. This is her <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20131114a.htm\">prepared testimony</a>, where she says that the economy still needs to improve. They\u2019ll ask her tough questions. If they are satisfied with her answers, they\u2019ll send her to the full Senate for a vote.</p> <p><strong>Exciting! I have an embarrassing question, though. What does the Fed ... do, exactly? Something with money, I know.</strong></p> <p>Lots of things with money! The Fed is like the overseer of the US money factory. It makes sure the financial system is running smoothly, with no crunching gears or work stoppages.</p> <p>The Fed has two major jobs, or mandates: to create full employment, and control inflation. It generally has one way to do this: it controls interest rates. Our entire financial system is based on borrowing \u2013 by people, by banks, by companies \u2013 so by controlling interest rates the Fed exerts a lot of influence. In fact, every time you pay your credit card or put money in the savings bank, you are under the invisible thumb of the Fed. The Fed also regulates major banks, and lends money to them when they need it.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s the Fed\u2019s job to get the US to full employment? Using only interest rates? How on earth will interest rates get people hired?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, that\u2019s not working so well. You can tell by the 11 million people who are unemployed \u2013 four million of them for six months or more \u2013 and the rising number of people who are dropping out of the workforce. Only about 62% of the country is working, which is the lowest level since March 1978. Then there the 42 million on food stamps, which is a kind of collateral damage from unemployment.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the theory though?</strong></p> <p>The theory is that if the Fed keeps interest rates low, it can encourage people to borrow and spend money and banks to lend more. It increases consumption, which is part of how we measure the economy\u2019s growth.</p> <p><strong>So my Christmas shopping is an economic duty to the US! I am a shopping patriot! Be right back, I saw some nice jeans at the mall.</strong></p> <p>Not so fast. Yes, we need consumption to get the economy moving, but if you spend more than you have, you\u2019re not helping anyone and certainly not helping yourself.</p> <p><strong>But if I keep that money in the bank, it get no interest. Why not use it?</strong></p> <p>Exactly. Now you\u2019re talking like a central banker! That\u2019s what the Fed wants when it lowers interest rates.</p> <p><strong>So why should I thwart the Fed? Our interests are aligned! They want me to shop using my credit cards, and I want that too. What are you, some kind of Communist?</strong></p> <p>No, it\u2019s only that there\u2019s a limited benefit to all that spending. For one thing, if you don\u2019t pay off your bills, your credit will suffer and you\u2019ll find it harder to buy a house or car. And it\u2019s those big-ticket items \u2013 houses, cars \u2013 that really move the economy more. Also, the Fed looks at things besides consumption to judge the economy. It looks at housing, and household debt, and employment, and something called \u201chousehold formation\u201d, which is how many people are getting married and creating larger economic units.</p> <p>Also, it\u2019s terrible for older people if they don\u2019t have savings or if their bonds aren\u2019t paying good returns, which is what happens when interest rates are low. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/unconventional-monetary-policy\">The Economist estimates</a> that households globally have lost $630bn globally since the Fed started an aggressive stimulus to keep interest rates low.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ce47d069-5847-4ddf-bd3e-6d1dc39c10c8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381366867921/811fdb87-a857-476e-abb5-4f74ed3b4853-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bride and groom figurines --- Image by   Jason Stang/Corbis Adults Bride Cake Cake decoration Cake topper Clothing Decoration Dress Females Food Formal wear Kitsch Menswear Newlyweds Nobody Old-fashioned Outfit Plastic Retro Still life Suits Sweets Tradition Tuxedo Vintage Wedding Wedding cake Wedding dress White White background Women\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bride and groom express joy at forming larger economic unit. Photograph: Jason Stang/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Just for the record, I am more than an economic unit, okay? So how does the Fed keep interest rates low? And is this low-interest plan from the Fed working?</strong></p> <p>The Fed lowers interest rates using a few methods. One is that it sets a basic interest rate that governs how much banks pay to borrow from the Fed. This is the lowest interest rate possible. Then, when banks borrow from each other, they use the Fed interest rate as a kind of benchmark.</p> <p><strong>What! Banks pay almost nothing to borrow from each other? So why am I not paying the lowest possible interest rate?</strong></p> <p>Because life is not fair. Also, because banks assume they have the best credit possible. They borrow every day. Their businesses depend on it. You don\u2019t have the same credit reliability or amount of money as a bank.</p> <p><strong>Still not fair, though.</strong></p> <p>Elizabeth Warren agrees with you, but that\u2019s a discussion for another day.</p> <p><strong>So how else does the Fed keep interest rates low?</strong></p> <p>Well, for the past few years the Fed has created a stimulus program called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, or QE. It's controversial because it makes the Fed a player in the markets \u2013 a worker bee \u2013 rather than just an overseer.</p> <p><strong>What is QE all about? Be warned, this is the stuff that gives me a headache.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s actually really easy to understand. It\u2019s just the Fed buying bonds \u2013 specifically, mortgage bonds and Treasury bonds \u2013 from the market so that banks and investors go buy other things. Remember after the financial crisis, when banks were weighed down with bad mortgages and bad mortgage bonds?</p> <p><strong>Yeah \u2026 ?</strong></p> <p>Well, the banks said they weren\u2019t lending because they had all those bad mortgages weighing them down. So the Fed started buying mortgage bonds from the banks. That was the first step of QE, known as QE1. Then the Fed started buying Treasury bonds, which lowered interest rates even more. Now the Fed is buying $85bn of bonds a month, and it\u2019s been going on for so long that wags are calling it QEinfinity. People think the Fed has to stop eventually, which is called the \u201ctaper\u201d.</p> <p><strong>When will the Fed stop buying these bonds?</strong></p> <p>When the economy is good.</p> <p><strong>Is that happening?</strong></p> <p>No. As Yellen pointed out, the economy has a long way to go. In her opening statement, she said, \u201cUnemployment is down from a peak of 10%, but at 7.3% in October, it is still too high, reflecting a labor market and economy performing far short of their potential. At the same time, inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve's goal of 2% and is expected to continue to do so for some time.\"</p> <p><strong>So, more stimulus then! Will we know when tapering is coming?</strong></p> <p>Probably. The Fed has been a wild and crazy place since 2007. Before that, the Fed was known as a haven of bespectacled economists, who would debate the economy invisibly and stay out of the stock and bond markets for the most part. The chairmen were known to be men who believed the market could heal itself and enjoyed being mysterious and obscure, like Alan Greenspan, because they believed that was the best way not to be misunderstood. Greenspan is famous for a line that went something like, \u201cif you understood what I said, I must have misspoken.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Being closed and enigmatic is the best way not to be misunderstood? I don\u2019t get it. Everyone knows that misinformation and gossip rushes in to fill an informational void.</strong></p> <p>Think of The Godfather.</p> <p><strong>Oh, I get it. Silence as a gaudy show of exclusive and immense power.</strong></p> <p>Exactly. The Fed isn\u2019t like that anymore, though. It\u2019s pretty chatty. Bernanke has been all about transparency: press conferences, public statements and speeches, allowing people to see how the members of the Federal Open Market Committee vote and exposing the Fed\u2019s internal debates to all eyes.</p> <p><strong>Man, that sounds like a lot of work. Whose idea was that?</strong></p> <p>Well, actually, it was mostly Janet Yellen\u2019s. She has been the vice-chair of the Fed and she seemed to believe that the better the Fed communicated, and the more specifically it said things, the less panic and confusion there would be.</p> <p><strong>So since the Fed is so chatty, do we know if Yellen believes in this stimulus?</strong></p> <p>Yes, she\u2019s expected to continue the stimulus, because, remember, the stimulus will keep going until the economy improves, and she doesn\u2019t think the economy is improving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-91643760-2c84-410f-afea-3de6e45bdd96\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/18/1379510332105/8cd6a68f-84a8-4d1e-b171-da3943026bc2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"ben bernanke\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Bernanke is so over it.

In 2007, when the mortgage market was crashing,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/06/us-economy-credit-idUSN3127047720070906\">he started injecting money</a>&#xa0;into the financial system so that it wouldn\u2019t freeze up. In 2008, the entire financial system nearly collapsed and the Fed was in the center of all the bailouts. And since then, he\u2019s run this innovative and controversial program of \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d which means the Fed is buying $85bn of bonds a month. Also, he keeps saying that Congress needs to do its part to fix the economy, but no one in Congress seems to be listening, so the entire country has spent the past four years waiting for Super Ben to fix everything.</p> <p><strong>How can the Fed chairman fix everything in the economy?</strong></p> <p>He (or she) can\u2019t. The Fed\u2019s only tools are really interest rates and now, bond-buying.</p> <p><strong>Oh. Oy.</strong></p> <p>Yes. Oy.</p>",

The Fed also regulates major banks, and lends money to them when they need it. It\u2019s the Fed\u2019s job to get the US to full employment? Using only interest rates? How on earth will interest rates get people hired? Yeah, that\u2019s not working so well. You can tell by the 11 million people who are unemployed \u2013 four million of them for six months or more \u2013 and the rising number of people who are dropping out of the workforce. Only about 62% of the country is working, which is the lowest level since March 1978. Then there the 42 million on food stamps, which is a kind of collateral damage from unemployment. What\u2019s the theory though? The theory is that if the Fed keeps interest rates low, it can encourage people to borrow and spend money and banks to lend more. It increases consumption, which is part of how we measure the economy\u2019s growth. So my Christmas shopping is an economic duty to the US! I am a shopping patriot! Be right back, I saw some nice jeans at the mall. Not so fast. Yes, we need consumption to get the economy moving, but if you spend more than you have, you\u2019re not helping anyone and certainly not helping yourself. But if I keep that money in the bank, it get no interest. Why not use it? Exactly. Now you\u2019re talking like a central banker! That\u2019s what the Fed wants when it lowers interest rates. So why should I thwart the Fed? Our interests are aligned! They want me to shop using my credit cards, and I want that too. What are you, some kind of Communist? No, it\u2019s only that there\u2019s a limited benefit to all that spending. For one thing, if you don\u2019t pay off your bills, your credit will suffer and you\u2019ll find it harder to buy a house or car. And it\u2019s those big-ticket items \u2013 houses, cars \u2013 that really move the economy more. Also, the Fed looks at things besides consumption to judge the economy. It looks at housing, and household debt, and employment, and something called \u201chousehold formation\u201d, which is how many people are getting married and creating larger economic units. Also, it\u2019s terrible for older people if they don\u2019t have savings or if their bonds aren\u2019t paying good returns, which is what happens when interest rates are low. The Economist estimates that households globally have lost $630bn globally since the Fed started an aggressive stimulus to keep interest rates low. Just for the record, I am more than an economic unit, okay? So how does the Fed keep interest rates low? And is this low-interest plan from the Fed working? The Fed lowers interest rates using a few methods. One is that it sets a basic interest rate that governs how much banks pay to borrow from the Fed. This is the lowest interest rate possible. Then, when banks borrow from each other, they use the Fed interest rate as a kind of benchmark. What! Banks pay almost nothing to borrow from each other? So why am I not paying the lowest possible interest rate? Because life is not fair. Also, because banks assume they have the best credit possible. They borrow every day. Their businesses depend on it. You don\u2019t have the same credit reliability or amount of money as a bank. Still not fair, though. Elizabeth Warren agrees with you, but that\u2019s a discussion for another day. So how else does the Fed keep interest rates low? Well, for the past few years the Fed has created a stimulus program called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, or QE. It's controversial because it makes the Fed a player in the markets \u2013 a worker bee \u2013 rather than just an overseer. What is QE all about? Be warned, this is the stuff that gives me a headache. It\u2019s actually really easy to understand. It\u2019s just the Fed buying bonds \u2013 specifically, mortgage bonds and Treasury bonds \u2013 from the market so that banks and investors go buy other things. Remember after the financial crisis, when banks were weighed down with bad mortgages and bad mortgage bonds? Yeah \u2026 ? Well, the banks said they weren\u2019t lending because they had all those bad mortgages weighing them down. So the Fed started buying mortgage bonds from the banks. That was the first step of QE, known as QE1. Then the Fed started buying Treasury bonds, which lowered interest rates even more. Now the Fed is buying $85bn of bonds a month, and it\u2019s been going on for so long that wags are calling it QEinfinity. People think the Fed has to stop eventually, which is called the \u201ctaper\u201d. When will the Fed stop buying these bonds? When the economy is good. Is that happening? No. As Yellen pointed out, the economy has a long way to go. In her opening statement, she said, \u201cUnemployment is down from a peak of 10%, but at 7.3% in October, it is still too high, reflecting a labor market and economy performing far short of their potential. At the same time, inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve's goal of 2% and is expected to continue to do so for some time.\" So, more stimulus then! Will we know when tapering is coming? Probably. The Fed has been a wild and crazy place since 2007. Before that, the Fed was known as a haven of bespectacled economists, who would debate the economy invisibly and stay out of the stock and bond markets for the most part. The chairmen were known to be men who believed the market could heal itself and enjoyed being mysterious and obscure, like Alan Greenspan, because they believed that was the best way not to be misunderstood. Greenspan is famous for a line that went something like, \u201cif you understood what I said, I must have misspoken.\u201d Being closed and enigmatic is the best way not to be misunderstood? I don\u2019t get it. Everyone knows that misinformation and gossip rushes in to fill an informational void. Think of The Godfather. Oh, I get it. Silence as a gaudy show of exclusive and immense power. Exactly. The Fed isn\u2019t like that anymore, though. It\u2019s pretty chatty. Bernanke has been all about transparency: press conferences, public statements and speeches, allowing people to see how the members of the Federal Open Market Committee vote and exposing the Fed\u2019s internal debates to all eyes. Man, that sounds like a lot of work. Whose idea was that? Well, actually, it was mostly Janet Yellen\u2019s. She has been the vice-chair of the Fed and she seemed to believe that the better the Fed communicated, and the more specifically it said things, the less panic and confusion there would be. So since the Fed is so chatty, do we know if Yellen believes in this stimulus? Yes, she\u2019s expected to continue the stimulus, because, remember, the stimulus will keep going until the economy improves, and she doesn\u2019t think the economy is improving. Oh, I forgot to ask. Why is Bernanke giving up this wonderland of economic influence? I\u2019d grip power to my cold, dead hands. His five-year term is over in January and he\u2019s also so, so over it. Ben Bernanke is over being Fed chairman? We\u2019re just guessing, but President Obama said in June that Bernanke stayed in the job \u201ca lot longer than he wanted,\u201d which is a nice way of saying he\u2019s been chafing to go. Bernanke has also had a pretty eventful and exhausting tenure. In 2007, when the mortgage market was crashing, he started injecting money into the financial system so that it wouldn\u2019t freeze up. In 2008, the entire financial system nearly collapsed and the Fed was in the center of all the bailouts. And since then, he\u2019s run this innovative and controversial program of \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d which means the Fed is buying $85bn of bonds a month. Also, he keeps saying that Congress needs to do its part to fix the economy, but no one in Congress seems to be listening, so the entire country has spent the past four years waiting for Super Ben to fix everything. How can the Fed chairman fix everything in the economy? He (or she) can\u2019t. The Fed\u2019s only tools are really interest rates and now, bond-buying. Oh. Oy. Yes. Oy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Incoming Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen launched a staunch defence of the Fed\u2019s massive economic stimulus programme at her confirmation hearing Thursday. Yellen, expected to be the first woman to head the Fed, took questions from the Senate banking committee ahead of her confirmation, which is expected to be a formality. Poised and well-prepared, Yellen sailed through the two-hour hearing. Democratic senator Chuck Schumer said he hoped her \"Brooklyn wisdom shines through\". \"I never forget my roots,\" she replied. Yellen said the US economy had improved significantly since the 2008 financial crisis but she said that the recovery was not yet strong enough for the Fed to pull back on its $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme, known as quantitative easing. \"We have made good progress, but we have farther to go to regain the ground lost in the crisis and the recession,\" Yellen, the current Fed vice-chair, said her opening statement. \u201cUnemployment is down from a peak of 10%, but at 7.3% in October, it is still too high, reflecting a labor market and economy performing far short of their potential. At the same time, inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal of 2% and is expected to continue to do so for some time.\u201d Yellen\u2019s position attracted criticism from Republican senators worried about the unintended consequences of the Fed\u2019s bond-buying stimulus, which is aimed at keeping interest rates at record lows. Senator Mike Johanns said: \u201cI just worry that we are on a sugar high.\u201d He said stock market investors had become too dependent on the Fed programme and it was hyping certain assets, including stocks and housing. \"What am I missing here?\" he said. \"I see asset bubbles.\" \"We have to watch this very carefully, but I don't see this as an asset bubble,\" said Yellen. Senator Bob Corker said: \u201cIn many ways easy money is an elitist policy.\u201d He said there was little evidence that it had \u201ctrickled down\u201d. Yellen\u2019s appointment was widely seen as a signal that the QE programme was unlikely to be cut back in the short term, as she has been one of its staunchest supporters. The QE programme has faced mounting criticism from other members of the Fed. Yellen once again defended the programme. She said that the QE programme had boosted the stock markets but said it had also played an important role in the housing market. \u201cA strong recovery will ultimately enable the Fed to reduce its monetary accommodation and reliance on unconventional policy tools such as asset purchases. I believe that supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy,\u201d Yellen said. Yellen expressed support for Ben Bernanke's efforts to make the Fed \"a more open and transparent institution,\" and said she will also move to bolster the central bank\u2019s role as a regulator. \"We need her expertise at the helm of the Fed as our nation continues to recover from the Great Recession, completes Wall Street Reform rulemakings, and continues to enhance the stability of our financial sector,\" Senate banking committee chair Tim Johnson said.",

      "body": "<p>Incoming Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen launched a staunch defence of the Fed\u2019s massive economic stimulus programme at her confirmation hearing Thursday.</p> <p>Yellen, expected to be the first woman to head the Fed, took questions from the Senate banking committee ahead of her confirmation, which is expected to be a formality.</p> <p>Poised and well-prepared, Yellen sailed through the two-hour hearing. Democratic senator Chuck Schumer said he hoped her \"Brooklyn wisdom shines through\".</p> <p>\"I never forget my roots,\" she replied.</p> <p>Yellen said the US economy had improved significantly since the 2008 financial crisis but she said that the recovery was not yet strong enough for the Fed to pull back on its $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme, known as quantitative easing.</p> <p>\"We have made good progress, but we have farther to go to regain the ground lost in the crisis and the recession,\" Yellen, the current Fed vice-chair, said her opening statement.</p> <p>\u201cUnemployment is down from a peak of 10%, but at 7.3% in October, it is still too high, reflecting a labor market and economy performing far short of their potential. At the same time, inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal of 2% and is expected to continue to do so for some time.\u201d</p> <p>Yellen\u2019s position attracted criticism from Republican senators worried about the unintended consequences of the Fed\u2019s bond-buying stimulus, which is aimed at keeping interest rates at record lows.</p> <p>Senator Mike Johanns said: \u201cI just worry that we are on a sugar high.\u201d He said stock market investors had become too dependent on the Fed programme and it was hyping certain assets, including stocks and housing. \"What am I missing here?\" he said. \"I see asset bubbles.\"</p> <p>\"We have to watch this very carefully, but I don't see this as an asset bubble,\" said Yellen.</p> <p>Senator Bob Corker said: \u201cIn many ways easy money is an elitist policy.\u201d He said there was little evidence that it had \u201ctrickled down\u201d.</p> <p>Yellen\u2019s appointment was widely seen as a signal that the QE programme was unlikely to be cut back in the short term, as she has been one of its staunchest supporters. The QE programme has faced mounting criticism from other members of the Fed.</p> <p>Yellen once again defended the programme. She said that the QE programme had boosted the stock markets but said it had also played an important role in the housing market.</p> <p>\u201cA strong recovery will ultimately enable the Fed to reduce its monetary accommodation and reliance on unconventional policy tools such as asset purchases. I believe that supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy,\u201d Yellen said.</p> <p>Yellen expressed support for Ben Bernanke's efforts to make the Fed \"a more open and transparent institution,\" and said she will also move to bolster the central bank\u2019s role as a regulator.</p> <p>\"We need her expertise at the helm of the Fed as our nation continues to recover from the Great Recession, completes Wall Street Reform rulemakings, and continues to enhance the stability of our financial sector,\" Senate banking committee chair Tim Johnson said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone's economic woes persisted in the third quarter as Italy's longest recession continued and a contraction in French output dragged growth down to 0.1%. In the summer, hopes of a strong recovery were boosted by a second-quarter GDP rise of 0.3%, but the momentum of the first half of the year has fizzled out. The figures gave weight to fears that high unemployment, low inflation and disagreements among political leaders over further moves towards integration will keep the currency zone locked into a prolonged period of low growth. In France, a slump in exports and business investment failed to offset strong consumer spending to leave Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's socialist administration to cope with a 0.1% decline in GDP. Italy, which has faced prolonged period of political instability, was also mired in economic gloom after a 0.1% decline in GDP in the third quarter extended the country's recession from the summer of 2011 to nine quarters. Of the smaller eurozone members, Austria returned to growth after a flat summer period with a 0.2% rise in GDP, while the Netherlands, which also flatlined in the summer, nudge 0.1% higher and Finland managed a 0.4% expansion. German growth fell from 0.7% in the second quarter to 0.3%, though several analysts said the eurozone's powerhouse economy was merely returning to its expected annualised rate of 1.2% a year. Chris Williamson, chief European economist at financial data provider Markit, said the figures went \"a long way to vindicate the European Central Bank's decision to cut interest rates to re-stimulate growth across the single currency area\". Last week the ECB cut the headline interest rate to 0.25% from 0.5% in a shock move that was warmly welcomed in most eurozone capitals but was attacked by several German officials as unnecessary and undermining the strength of the single currency union. Williamson said the underlying trend showed the region's recovery \"remained on track at the start of the fourth quarter, although the upturn continues to look both fragile and weak\". The October Markit survey of purchasing managers across the eurozone remained at a level consistent with just 0.2% quarterly GDP growth, \"though most importantly it has signalled a marked turnaround in the region's economic health compared to the start of the year\".

      "bodyText": "British Gas owner Centrica has issued a profit warning as it admitted that investor confidence and public trust in the energy industry has been damaged by the storm over rising bills. The company said it was an unprecedented time for Britain's energy sector, amid public fury about sharp price hikes and Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze bills if Labour wins the next election. Last month British Gas announced a 10.4% rise in electricity prices and an 8.4% increase in the gas tariff from 23 November, and similar rises have been announced by the rest of the \"big six\" power companies. Centrica said in a trading update on Thursday: \"Investor confidence has been damaged and there is increased uncertainty over investment in the energy infrastructure that the UK needs. \"Energy suppliers and politicians both have a role to play in helping to minimise the impact of higher costs on bills and improving transparency to restore trust in the industry.\" In a warning on earnings, Centrica said market conditions remain \"challenging\", particularly in its business energy supply divisions in both Britain and the US, in UK gas-fired power generation and in UK gas storage. It said full-year profits in its British Gas business division were likely to be \"significantly lower\" than in 2012. As a result, the company said adjusted earnings per share were likely to be flat in the full year to 31 December, while analysts were forecasting 3-4% growth. \"Assuming normal weather conditions for the remainder of the year, we expect our residential energy supply margin to be slightly lower than last year, a little under 5% after tax,\" it added. British Gas supplied 15.7m households at the end of October, roughly the same as at the half-year stage, but the number of British Gas services accounts was slightly lower at 8.3m, reflecting \"pressures on household disposable income\". The company's margins are also under pressure in North America, where it has lost customers over the last six months.",
