      "bodyText": "The embattled Co-operative Group, still reeling from a banking scandal and preparing to lay off up to 5,000 employees, faces a new storm over plans to pay its chief executive more than \u00a33.5m in his first year in the job, while massively boosting the salaries and bonuses of other senior staff. The proposals will see the issue of executive pay dragged once again into the spotlight, after two leading banks last week confirmed that they were to pay hundreds of staff a million pounds or more. They also threaten to plunge the Co-op into further controversy after a disastrous recent period. Last year it revealed a \u00a31.5bn black hole in the finances of its banking division. The discovery was made several months before the Co-operative Bank's former chairman, Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister, was shamed for allegedly buying hard drugs, including crystal meth. Those revelations tarnished the Co-op brand and raised questions about how and why the previous board had appointed Flowers to such an important role. Documents marked \"Private &amp; Confidential\", seen by the Observer and prepared for the group remuneration and appointments committee, refer to the significant problems the Co-op's new executive team has inherited. They suggest that the salary packages for chief executive Euan Sutherland and his fellow directors are necessary because \"the [Co-op's] executive agenda is possibly the most complex one facing a large business in the country today\". Salary consultants brought in by the Co-op based the proposed remuneration packages on comparisons with FTSE 30 and FTSE 100-listed companies of a similar size to the mutualised group that is owned by its 8 million members. But the huge salary increases are likely to be seen by some as at odds with the history of the co-operative movement and its traditionally egalitarian ethos. Under the proposals, Sutherland will be paid a base salary of \u00a31.5m this year, plus a \u00a31.5m retention payment. With pension contributions and other extras, such as compensation for buying him out of his previous contract, Sutherland will receive \u00a33.66m this year. His predecessor, Peter Marks, received just over \u00a31.3m last year. Richard Pennycook, the chief operating officer, will receive a \u00a3900,000 salary and a retention payment of \u00a3900,000. Six other executives will be paid salaries between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a3650,000 \u2013 and the same amount in retention. In the past, senior executives of the Co-op received between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3400,000. It has also emerged that Rebecca Skitt, the Co-op's chief human resources officer, who joined in February 2013, left last month with a proposed pay-off totalling more than \u00a32m. A person familiar with the proposals said they represented a \"high noon\" for the Co-op. It is believed that not all of the board back the proposals, which are likely to play badly with some of the hundreds of elected members who sit on the Co-op's national and regional boards. \"Many are likely to be appalled,\" suggested one person familiar with their thinking. Sutherland, who became chief executive last May, has admitted that the group's full-year 2013 figures, due later this month and expected to reveal losses of \u00a32bn, will be \"pretty ugly\". To sort out its finances, the Co-op is looking to sell its pharmacies and farms and make cost savings that could see between 4,000 and 5,000 staff made redundant. Sutherland has expressed fears that the Co-op has \"lost touch with its customers and members and with the communities in which it operates \u2013 we haven't been listening\". He has questioned continued donations of up to \u00a31m a year to the Labour party and a number of its MPs. His efforts at modernising the Co-op have been treated with suspicion by some members who believe he is keen on demutualisation, a claim he strenuously denies. His supporters argue that his efforts, and those of his fellow executives, saved the bank from going under, something that would have triggered a taxpayer-funded bailout costing potentially billions of pounds. \"Last year, the Co-operative Group faced the biggest crisis in its 150-year history with the need to recapitalise its bank,\" said Ursula Lidbetter, chair of the Co-operative Group. \"We saved the bank, without recourse to the taxpayer, and we are now embarking on the long journey to revitalise the wider group. That means reducing debt, improving performance and streamlining a business that had become grossly inefficient. It is against that backdrop that we recruited Euan Sutherland and a team with the skills and experience needed at this crucial stage in our history. \"The remuneration packages of our executives are in the middle of a range of comparable companies. This represents an increase on the pay of their predecessors to reflect the greater commercial, management and turnaround experience they are bringing to bear. Euan and his team have already made a significant contribution to the group and we are confident that they will continue to do so.\" Critics question the \"bomb-proof\" nature of the remuneration packages, which will be paid out regardless of any turnaround in the Co-op's fortunes this year.\"We all want the Co-op to be strong and successful again,\" said Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman and a Co-operative Bank customer. \"But gigantic golden hellos for the new bosses send the wrong message to millions of loyal members, customers and staff. Of course, managers should be well rewarded \u2013 when they've turned the business around sustainably over the next five years.\" Last week there was anger when it emerged that almost 500 Barclays and 75 Lloyds Banking Group staff were being paid more than \u00a31m, sparking claims a bonus bonanza had returned to the City.",

      "bodyText": "This week, the chief executive of Barclays, Antony Jenkins, explained the rationale behind a \u00a3200m increase in bonuses at the bank, despite the fact that profits had fallen. There had been resignations at the bank the year before, when bonuses had been cut. He feared a \"death spiral\". Nobody wants a death spiral. Meanwhile, Lloyds and RBS handed out \u00a335m in bonuses to top management on Friday. It's time we admitted that nothing is ever going to change; bankers are always going to be rewarded way too much, for doing the wrong thing; they will continue to take risks that bring misery to everybody but themselves; they will exercise no restraint of their own, and it's extremely unlikely that EU bonus-capping measures will be effective. Far from the crash forcing reform and some kind of moral reflection on the financial sector, the opposite has happened; they know, now, that they're untouchable. Any error they make will be absorbed by the state. All they have to say is \"death spiral\" and we'll all pipe down, anything to avoid another bail out. It's pointless to kvetch about their morals \u2013 they're simply reasonable people acting on the information before them. We can question how governments arrived at this norm or the idea that no cost is too great to save these institutions. But we also have to question our own norms \u2013 after all, Barclays wouldn't exist if we didn't put our money into it. Banking won't change until we change. Six months ago, I took all my \"investable wealth\" out of normal financial circulation; I put a grand into the environment village Findhorn (these are shares), although if I'm honest, I didn't find out exactly what they did or what they wanted the money for, I'm just assuming they were environmental because someone on the website had a beard. I put \u00a32,000 into Golden Lane Housing (this is a bond), a housing association for people with a learning disability. I put \u00a35,000 into a solar energy project called Hoo Solar (this is a debenture), and because of some combination of capital returns and dividends, I got \u00a3165, which I put into SunShare Community in Nottingham. I put two grand in something for which I've lost the paperwork, but it'll turn up. I invested \u00a310,000 directly into setting up a local cafe, which is, I guess, also in the form of a debenture, but that's a moot point, given that neither the cafe's owner nor I know what debenture means. There is no element of that sentence that I don't find embarrassing, running on a spectrum from \"slightly awkward\" to \"profound shame\". I'm embarrassed to even talk about money, of course; I'm embarrassed to have \"investable income\"; I'm embarrassed that I've got money and I haven't given it away; I'm embarrassed that I haven't got more money, having been working for 19 years; I'm embarrassed that I haven't done anything with my pension; I'm embarrassed to say what the pension pot is (that it's so big and that it isn't bigger); OK, now I'm embarrassed of that embarrassment, it's \u00a3158k; I'm embarrassed at my ignorance of most financial instruments, my lack of curiosity, my mathematical ceiling and I'm embarrassed to launch a conversation that is so boring. That's just the shame off the top of my head, before I've even interrogated what money means to me in relation to love. (Our first introduction to money is, after all, that our parents give it to us; but what are their terms? Do they do it as a reward when you've pleased them, or as payment for a chore, or in a regimented weekly fashion, or exuberantly, when they're in a good mood?) Everybody who doesn't take money as the highest value of all human activity feels this embarrassment around it. Many people will say, if you're so ethical, why don't you just give it away? This is a conundrum that Jamie Hartzell faced when he was 20, in the 1980s \u2013 his father died and he inherited \u00a3100,000 that he wasn't expecting, some of which he gave away through the Network for Social Change. He now runs Ethex, an ethical stockmarket (through which I bought some of those bonds). He describes that leftie dilemma: \"I started thinking, well, if you're giving money away, you've lost control of the money, you don't know what's happening to it. If you're investing the money, it can go further, and you've still got it.\" This is how the left got its reputation for being unable to handle money \u2013 the presentation of the \"good\" person as infantile, giving money away not in a messianic style, at random, to passing lepers, but to some authority figure, like a charity, who would disperse it sensibly in ways that the good person wouldn't understand. The problem is, this leaves you at the outermost fringes of the actual world. \"We're all capitalists now,\" says Catherine Howarth, from Share Action, a pressure group trying to change the way pensions funds are invested. They're in Crucifix Lane, off Druid Street, in London Bridge, which adds to my abiding feeling that I'm entering badlands, a world in which we all have to be capitalists even if we'd rather be a liberal egalitarian. But wait: \"We've got this deadly dull thing called pensions automatic enrolment, by which we all have a stake in massive companies \u2026 We've got pension savers who are paid less than the living wage by the very companies they've invested their pension in. If the way these companies invest today is actually rapidly taking us towards uncontrolled climate change, then the very companies that are supposed to be our insurance for the future are undermining our future quality of life.\" This isn't a scenario in which we have to join them having failed to beat them. This is one in which we've already, de facto, joined the game; we've been in the game for years. We just have to stop losing. Bruce Davis, who set up Abundance, which crowdsources energy funding (this is where I bought my debenture), having previously co-founded Zopa, the peer-to-peer lender, talks about the \"social life of money\" \u2013 not the social purpose to which you put your money, though he talks about that too. Rather, the fact that money holds a different value to us, depending on its source. Earned money is different from inherited money; money you win, or that has any \"luck\" element feels unreliable, and that changes what you'll do with it. Money you get in benefits from the government is slippery and difficult to make coherent decisions about. Money you get in pension from the government, conversely, is seen as simply coming back to you from the pot you put it into, even though there is no pot, and that money was spent years ago, on some 1970s textbooks. At some point, those of us who would deny that money motivated us, or who would deny that we cared about it, have to accept that it has emotional weight. It is as much a part of my personality as it is a part of Warren Buffet's. Hartzell says: \"People tend to use money amorally. They don't think about the implications of what their money does. Or they just don't think about money full stop.\" This leads to bizarre situations \u2013 you might spend your life worrying about the environment, but have your pension invested in Shell. Collectively, we're quite good at noticing \u2013 and pointing out \u2013 the disconnect when a charity is a major shareholder in Wonga; but a personal disconnect, in which our money's activity bears no relation to our values, is something we live with. It's partly a sense of how pointlessly small your stake in the system is. It's partly a sense of impotence and fear in the face of complexity, and it's partly the active design of the system, as Hartzell explains. \"It is a law. You have to sign a declaration that says you haven't put more than 10% of your investable wealth into unlisted securities.\" Huh? I did not know that. Also, I don't know what an unlisted security is. \"What they want you to do is put your money in the hands of someone who's going to make responsible investments on your behalf, which fuels the disempowerment process. You create a regulatory system like [the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)], and then you have professionals who adopt the system, and then the regulators work with the professionals, and it becomes a closed club.\" The absurdities of this system are densely packed. The stock market has bounced back to become the only mark of respectability the government regulator will recognise. Even though its abiding principle is to sacrifice long-term benefit for short-term profit, the stock market is still wearing its metaphorical pin-striped suit. It should be in a balaclava. Meanwhile, the very characteristics of investments that make them \"social\" \u2013 that they won't go on the stock market because they want to maintain their structure, whether that's as mutual or having an asset-lock or other terms I'm not all over but sound proper \u2013 consign them to a life in the FCA's high-risk hinterland. But if money means different things in different hands, ethics can mean different things in different mouths. \"If you give your money away\", Hartzell continues, \"you're expecting a strong social or environmental return, and you're going to get a minus 100% financial return. If you invest your money, you're looking at 5% or 10%. But there's a lot of space between 5% and minus 100%. The traditional male, Wasp view, the Bill Gates view, is: 'I make money and then give it away and go down as a great philanthropist.' If everyone blended their giving and investing together, so that you aimed for a modest return, it might be more useful.\" But even if you accept that investing can be an ethical choice, what counts as ethical? I'd count investment in renewables, regardless of what the profit margin is, or how it's distributed, purely because it means returning to capitalism in a useful, literal sense: you take capital that you have and you lend it to someone building something you agree with. I'd also count peer-to-peer lending, even though there is no requirement for people to spend the money you lend ethically. They're unlikely to be using it for arms or child labour; usually they are just getting their bathrooms done. However, Hartzell disputes that there's anything inherently ethical about this stuff. \"Most crowdfunding businesses are private companies. They'll be making losses at the start, but their endgame is to be bought out by a bigger company, like Lloyds or something, and then it will change a bit. Everyone gets terribly excited about it, but really it's just a minor adjustment.\" Perhaps what I'm talking about isn't ethics so much as change \u2013 breaking the hegemony of the financial system, disrupting a system that seems purpose-built for destruction of one kind or another. Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding, it increasingly seems, are neither new ideas nor inherently ethical ones. \"It's a technology mechanism coming to the fore rather than a new way of doing things,\" Hartzell points out. \"That's what the original building societies were, they were mutuals, people came together to build houses. Credit unions have been going since 1800s.\" These aren't new ideas. They are, merely, good ideas. But most people's investments are entirely in their pension, which means they can't work outside the system; 95% of people are unavoidably in the pension fund chosen by their employer. As Catherine Howarth describes, \"Shell is the biggest single holding in most pension funds. Everybody holds a massive amount. Shell has had really crummy financial returns for five years. The financial case for drilling in the Arctic is ropey at best. Our argument is, let's have a massive campaign to make sure that our pensions funds say, 'Don't go there.' We're a small outfit, we're not going to change the world overnight, but we're doing some things which are quite well targeted.\" An hour after I spoke to Howarth, Shell announced a moratorium on drilling in the Arctic. It's just for 2014, but still \u2026 that's something. That's something beyond quarterly results and the bottom line, and the bizarre, myopic assumptions that fall under the heading \"business\". I've heard so many arguments against pension activism and ethical investing \u2013 that it's just a consumer choice, that it's politically neutering, that it's exclusive, that it's just another way of shopping at a farmer's market. And I accept it all, but still return to the fact \u2013 banks will not change; the world has to change around them.",

I put \u00a35,000 into a solar energy project called <a href=\"http://groups.energyshare.com/hoo-solar-kent/\" title=\"\">Hoo Solar</a> (this is a debenture), and because of some combination of capital returns and dividends, I got \u00a3165, which I put into <a href=\"http://www.trillionfund.com/investment-projects/sunshare-community-nottingham-2/\" title=\"\">SunShare Community</a> in Nottingham. I&#xa0;put two grand in something for which I've lost the paperwork, but it'll turn up. I invested \u00a310,000 directly into setting up a local cafe, which is, I guess, also in the form of a debenture, but that's a moot point, given that neither the cafe's owner nor I know what debenture means. There is no element of that sentence that I don't find embarrassing, running on a spectrum from \"slightly awkward\" to \"profound shame\".</p> <p>I'm embarrassed to even talk about money, of course; I'm embarrassed to have \"investable income\"; I'm embarrassed that I've got money and I haven't given it away; I'm embarrassed that I haven't got more money, having been working for 19 years; I'm embarrassed that I haven't done anything with my pension; I'm embarrassed to say what the pension pot is (that it's so big and that it isn't bigger); OK, now I'm embarrassed of that embarrassment, it's \u00a3158k; I'm embarrassed at my ignorance of most financial instruments, my lack of curiosity, my mathematical ceiling and I'm embarrassed to launch a conversation that is so boring. That's just the shame off the top of my head, before I've even interrogated what money means to me in relation to love. (Our first introduction to money is, after all, that our parents give it to us; but what are their terms? Do they do it as a reward when you've pleased them, or as payment for a chore, or in a regimented weekly fashion, or exuberantly, when they're in a good mood?)</p> <p>Everybody who doesn't take money as the highest value of all human activity feels this embarrassment around it. Many people will say, if you're so ethical, why don't you just give it away? This is a conundrum that Jamie Hartzell faced when he was 20, in the 1980s \u2013 his father died and he inherited \u00a3100,000 that he wasn't expecting, some of which he gave away through the Network for Social Change. He now runs <a href=\"https://www.ethex.org.uk/towards-a-social-stock-exchange_46.html\" title=\"\">Ethex, an ethical stockmarket</a> (through which I bought some of those bonds). He describes that leftie dilemma: \"I started thinking, well, if you're giving money away, you've lost control of the money, you don't know what's happening to it. If you're investing the money, it can go further, and you've still got it.\" This is how the left got its reputation for being unable to handle money \u2013 the presentation of the \"good\" person as infantile, giving money away not in a messianic style, at random, to passing lepers, but to some authority figure, like a charity, who would disperse it sensibly in ways that the good person wouldn't understand.</p> <p>The problem is, this leaves you at the outermost fringes of the actual world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-431572890\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/7/1394221567314/Catherine-Howarth-of-Shar-011.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Howarth of Share Action\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re all capitalists now\u2019 ... Catherine Howarth of Share Action, a pressure group trying to change the way pensions funds are invested.  Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"We're all capitalists now,\" says Catherine Howarth, from <a href=\"http://shareaction.org/\" title=\"\">Share Action</a>, a pressure group trying to change the way pensions funds are invested. They're in Crucifix Lane, off Druid Street, in London Bridge, which adds to my abiding feeling that I'm entering badlands, a world in which we all have to be capitalists even if we'd rather be a liberal egalitarian. But wait: \"We've got this deadly dull thing called pensions automatic enrolment, by which we all have a stake in massive companies \u2026 We've got pension savers who are paid less than the living wage by the very companies they've invested their pension in. If the way these companies invest today is actually rapidly taking us towards uncontrolled climate change, then the very companies that are supposed to be our insurance for the future are undermining our future quality of life.\"</p> <p>This isn't a scenario in which we have to join them having failed to beat them. This is one in which we've already, de facto, joined the game; we've been in the game for years. We just have to stop&#xa0;losing.</p> <p>Bruce Davis, who set up <a href=\"https://www.abundancegeneration.com/\" title=\"\">Abundance</a>, which crowdsources energy funding (this is where I bought my debenture), having previously co-founded <a href=\"http://www.zopa.com/\" title=\"\">Zopa</a>, the peer-to-peer lender, talks about the \"social life of money\" \u2013 not the social purpose to which you put your money, though he talks about that too. Rather, the fact that money holds a different value to us, depending on its source. Earned money is different from inherited money; money you win, or that has any \"luck\" element feels unreliable, and that changes what you'll do with it. Money you get in benefits from the government is slippery and difficult to make coherent decisions about. Money you get in pension from the government, conversely, is seen as simply coming back to you from the pot you put it into, even though there is no pot, and that money was spent years ago, on some 1970s textbooks.</p> <p>At some point, those of us who would deny that money motivated us, or who would deny that we cared about it, have to accept that it has emotional weight. It is as much a part of my personality as it is a part of Warren Buffet's.</p> <p>Hartzell says: \"People tend to use money amorally. They don't think about the implications of what their money does. Or they just don't think about money full stop.\" This leads to bizarre situations \u2013 you might spend your life worrying about the environment, but have your pension invested in Shell. Collectively, we're quite good at noticing \u2013 and pointing out \u2013 the disconnect when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/wellcome-sells-wonga-multi-million-stake\" title=\"\">a charity is a major shareholder in Wonga</a>; but a personal disconnect, in which our money's activity bears no relation to our values, is something we&#xa0;live with.</p> <p>It's partly a sense of how pointlessly small your stake in the system is. It's partly a sense of impotence and fear in the face of complexity, and it's partly the active design of the system, as Hartzell explains. \"It is a law. You have to sign a declaration that says you haven't put more than 10% of your investable wealth into unlisted securities.\" Huh? I did not know that. Also, I don't know what an unlisted security is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-431572891\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/7/1394221816620/Barclays-chief-executive--011.jpg\" alt=\"Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins says big bonuses need to go on to stop a 'death spiral' of resignations by bankers.  Photograph: Stephen Chernin/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"What they want you to do is put your money in the hands of someone who's going to make responsible investments on your behalf, which fuels the disempowerment process. You create a regulatory system like [the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)], and then you have professionals who adopt the system, and then the regulators work with the professionals, and it becomes a closed club.\"</p> <p>The absurdities of this system are densely packed. The stock market has bounced back to become the only mark of respectability the government regulator will recognise. Even though its abiding principle is to sacrifice long-term benefit for short-term profit, the stock market is still wearing its metaphorical pin-striped suit. It should be in a balaclava. Meanwhile, the very characteristics of investments that make them \"social\" \u2013 that they won't go on the stock market because they want to maintain their structure, whether that's as mutual or having an asset-lock or other terms I'm not all over but sound proper \u2013 consign them to a life in the FCA's high-risk hinterland.</p> <p>But if money means different things in different hands, ethics can&#xa0;mean different things in different&#xa0;mouths.</p> <p>\"If you give your money away\", Hartzell continues, \"you're expecting a strong social or environmental return, and you're going to get a minus 100% financial return. If you invest your money, you're looking at 5% or 10%. But there's a lot of space between 5% and minus 100%. The traditional male, Wasp view, the Bill Gates view, is: 'I&#xa0;make money and then give it away and go down as a great philanthropist.' If everyone blended their giving and investing together, so that you aimed for a modest return, it might be more useful.\"</p> <p>But even if you accept that investing can be an ethical choice, what counts as ethical? I'd count investment in renewables, regardless of what the profit margin is, or how it's distributed, purely because it means returning to capitalism in a useful, literal sense: you take capital that you have and you lend it to someone building something you agree with. I'd also count peer-to-peer lending, even though there is no requirement for people to spend the money you lend ethically. They're unlikely to be using it for arms or child labour; usually they are just getting their bathrooms done. However, Hartzell disputes that there's anything inherently ethical about this stuff.</p> <p>\"Most crowdfunding businesses are private companies. They'll be making losses at the start, but their endgame is to be bought out by a bigger company, like Lloyds or something, and then it will change a bit. Everyone gets terribly excited about it, but really it's just a minor adjustment.\"</p> <p>Perhaps what I'm talking about isn't ethics so much as change \u2013 breaking the hegemony of the financial system, disrupting a system that seems purpose-built for destruction of one kind or another. Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding, it increasingly seems, are neither new ideas nor inherently ethical ones. \"It's a technology mechanism coming to the fore rather than a new way of doing things,\" Hartzell points out. \"That's what the original building societies were, they were mutuals, people came together to build houses. Credit unions have been going since 1800s.\" These aren't new ideas. They are, merely, good ideas.</p> <p>But most people's investments are entirely in their pension, which means they can't work outside the system; 95% of people are unavoidably in the pension fund chosen by their employer. As Catherine Howarth describes, \"Shell is the biggest single holding in most pension funds. Everybody holds a massive amount. Shell has had really crummy financial returns for five years. The financial case for drilling in the Arctic is ropey at best. Our argument is, let's have a massive campaign to make sure that our pensions funds say, 'Don't go there.' We're a small outfit, we're not going to change the world overnight, but we're doing some things which are quite well targeted.\"</p> <p>An hour after I spoke to Howarth, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/shell-shelves-alaskan-arctic-drilling-oil\" title=\"\">Shell announced a moratorium on drilling in the Arctic</a>. It's just for 2014, but still \u2026 that's something. That's something beyond quarterly results and&#xa0;the bottom line, and the bizarre, myopic assumptions that fall under the heading \"business\".</p> <p>I've heard so many arguments against pension activism and ethical investing \u2013 that it's just a consumer choice, that it's politically neutering, that it's exclusive, that it's just another way of shopping at a farmer's market. And I accept it all, but&#xa0;still return to the fact \u2013 banks will not change; the world has to change around them.</p>",

Even then, critics said the specific areas of soul-searching were chosen to cause minimum fuss. By that yardstick, the Bank, under Mark Carney's leadership, has gone into overdrive when faced with allegations that officials condoned, or ignored, rigging of currency markets by banks' trading desks. An internal investigation was launched last October when the allegations were first made. This week, as a member of the Bank's staff was suspended, the investigation was booted up to the governing court's new \"oversight committee\". This committee was established only a year ago to address the worry that corporate governance at the Bank belonged to a different era and that the executives were all-powerful. It comprises solely non-executive members of the court, including Sir David Lees (former boss of engineer GKN), Sir Roger Carr (chairman of BAE Systems) and Dave Prentis (general secretary of Unison). Everybody happy? Not exactly. Andrew Tyrie, tenacious chairman of the Treasury select committee and long-standing critic of the Bank's governance arrangements, told the Financial Times that the central bank needs \"a board worthy of the name\" to investigate the foreign exchange allegations. Tyrie has a point. First, it seems very odd that Lees, Carr, Prentis &amp; co didn't insist on leading the investigation in the first place. This affair should have gone straight to the top. If Bank officials knew of attempts by banks' trading desks to manipulate rates regularly at 4pm but didn't tell their superiors, Threadneedle Street's credibility as a competent regulator would suffer immense damage. The court minutes show the executive-led investigation was discussed at the December meeting. Given what's at stake, why not at the November gathering, the first opportunity? Second, one has to wonder whether external members of the court, the supposed newly-empowered policemen of the Bank, have time to do much digging themselves. Most have big jobs elsewhere; Lees, chairman until June, is contracted to work only five days a month, even if, in practice, he does more. Law firm Travers Smith will prepare the actual report. That's not the same as appointing a judge or external senior accountant to investigate. Carney, when he appears before Tyrie's committee on Tuesday, will clearly be unable to say anything meaningful about the investigation itself. But he must give an opinion on how the Bank can avoid the suspicion it is still allowed to mark its own homework. \u2022 Essar Energy's arrival on the London market in 2010 was a big event at the time. In the midst of a flotation famine and recession on the home front, the arrival of a \u00a35bn Indian power group conjured welcome visions of growth in emerging markets. Investing in the electrification of India seemed a promising bet. From 420p at float, Essar Energy almost touched 600p within a year. Confidence was high and the founding Ruia brothers, still with a majority stake, displayed their global ambitions by buying the Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire. It's been downhill fast since then. Essar Energy's troubles have come in droves in India \u2013 tax squabbles, permit wrangles over coal mines, the decline in the rupee and tough conditions in oil refining. The shares had plunged to 60p when the Ruias' Essar Global fund, with a 78% stake, said last month it was minded to offer minority investors 70p to take the company private again. Cue a bitter row. David Cumming at shareholder Standard Life calls the buyout proposal \"cynical opportunism\". The independent directors think 70p \"clearly undervalues the company and its long-term growth prospects\". They're right. While most of Essar Energy's woes have been inflicted from outside, which makes the company a different beast from the wretched Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (taken private by its Kazakh backers last year), Essar Global simply hasn't explained why it is making its move now. There has been much muttering about how London's investment community has lost interest in the business. As a general observation, that's correct. But those shareholders who have remained on the register plainly are still engaged and think there may still be a decent investment opportunity when the Indian outlook brightens. More to the point, Essar Global was describing Essar Energy's shares as \"exceptional value\" as recently as last November when the price was 97p. If anything, the news on coal permits has been mildly positive since then, making a pitch at 70p plain mean. Under London's \"put up or shut up\" rules, Essar Global has until Friday to make its intentions clear. It may try to add a few extra pennies to the price and hope the furore dies down. But, if the Ruias really want to show they're different from ENRC, the right thing to do is to shut up, drop the buy-out attempt and allow the likes of Standard Life to continue to take their chances. Four years as a public company is no time at all when you are trying to supply Indian's long-term need for reliable energy. \u2022 Another day, another chance to buy an online retailing wonder-stock. At \u00a3560m, Boohoo.com, say its fans, is actually valued at a discount to the likes of Asos, the fashion leader, and AO World, the fridges folk with pan-European ambitions. The financial calculation is correct. Boohoo made \"adjusted\" earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of \u00a310.1m in the 10 months to December last year. Call that \u00a312m on an annualised basis and Boohoo is priced at \"only\" 47 times top-line earnings. As usual in the current climate for online retailers, demand for the shares will be strong.
