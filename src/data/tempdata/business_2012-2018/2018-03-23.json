      "bodyText": "It is not exactly the most exciting household purchase: we buy one on average every 12 years, they cost hundreds of pounds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 and they hardly enhance the look of your home. But new businesses like Eve Sleep, Simba and Casper, which look and act like tech firms, are using massive marketing budgets to make the rather dull business of buying a new mattress seem like fun and promote the idea of a \u201cbed in a box\u201d that is delivered to your front door like a pizza. While several traditional bed firms, including Feather &amp; Black and Warren Evans, have gone bust in recent months the new sellers have waded into the bed business and stolen a 5% slice of the annual market, up from zero four years ago. There are predictions that could reach 20% in the next three years. Another major player, Bensons for Beds, is struggling for survival amid financial difficulties at its parent company Steinhoff. \u201cWe believe it is a game changing shift,\u201d says Jas Bagniewski, co-founder and chief executive of British startup Eve, where sales are rising by more than 100% a year in the UK. \u201cWe have a better priced and more engaging aspirational brand, a much better customer offer and you can get it delivered next day. If you look at the more traditional brands you can see they are struggling.\u201d The three new firms all boast about the science behind their products, but they are basically just foam and/or springs like any other. The key innovation is that they squash their mattresses flat, roll them, pop them in a box and deliver them within a week or even next day \u2013 all at a price often lower than available for a similar mattress on the high street. It is a very long way from the more traditional trip to a bed specialist or department store and the embarrassing business of trying them out in public and then waiting weeks for manufacture and delivery. The new mattress firms offer a three month sale or return if they prove too hard or too soft for a good night\u2019s sleep. About 12% of Eve\u2019s mattresses are returned, down from 17% a year ago. Anyone worried that they may be buying a new mattress that someone else has previously slept on for weeks before deciding it was not for them can rest easy: those sent back are re-covered and then sold as secondhand through third-party sites such as eBay. All three of the firms started in 2014. Casper is a privately owned US firm which has already expanded to countries including the UK, Austria and Switzerland. It shares investors with tech firms like Twitter and Snapchat. Simba and Eve are UK firms, with Simba being backed by Richard Reed, an entrepreneur who has already made one fortune as a co-founder of Innocent drinks, and Richard Goldstein of the family that founded Superdrug. Eve\u2019s investors include Channel 4 and star City investor Neil Woodford. The company floated on the London AIM market last year and the company, though loss-making, is now valued at around \u00a3150m. Eve sold 32,000 mattresses last year. Patrick O\u2019Brien, an analyst at City research group GlobalData, says the new way of buying mattresses means online will account for 20% of sales by 2021. He reckons Bensons for Beds is particularly vulnerable to the new competition, because deliveries take too long, are too expensive and the store chain has failed to develop its own online alternative. But most of the traditional players are not taking the new competition lying down. John Lewis is now selling Simba on its website, while at the cheaper end of the market Argos is offering a same day delivery service and market leader Ikea\u2019s shoppers can carry their new mattress away the same day. The bed specialist Dreams has created its own bed in a box under a the brand Hyde &amp; Sleep and the company\u2019s chief executive, Mike Logue, says sales soared 256% last year. \u201cWe need to be in that space and to have that offer,\u201d he said. He reckons all the money piling into marketing mattresses will persuade Britons to replace their sleeping set-up more often than the current 12 years and could increase the market overall. He also thinks the new mattress sellers will struggle to make a profit. \u201cWhen [online specialists] \u201cspend that amount of marketing money, they are going to sell some products. The job is to try and make some money out of selling them. We are break even at best \u2013 and we are making it ourselves,\u201d he says. Eve, for instance, revealed a \u00a319m loss last year, up from \u00a311m the year before \u2013 mainly because it spent nearly half the value of its \u00a328m in sales on marketing. That would be enough to give many investors sleepless nights \u2013 but so far they are not sending their mattresses back.",

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets have been rattled again by fears of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economics after China retaliated to Donald Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on up to $60bn (\u00a342.4bn) worth of Chinese products. Hours after Trump announced the proposed import duties \u2013 which are expected to cover sectors such as robotics, hi-tech trains and aerospace \u2013 China said it had prepared retaliatory tariffs on about $3bn worth of US imports. Beijing urged Washington to negotiate a settlement as soon as possible. A statement from the Chinese commerce ministry said: \u201cChina doesn\u2019t hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one. China hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.\u201d The Chinese response sent shares in Asia tumbling on Friday, following Thursday\u2019s 723 point plunge on the Dow in New York. The Nikkei 225 in Toyko closed 4.51% lower on Friday, while shares in Hong Kong fell 2.45%, the CSI300 in Shanghai lost 2.86% and the Kospi in Seoul was down 3.37%. But shares in Europe fared better, recovering from their worst levels after what analysts said was so far a less dramatic response from China than had been feared. Geoffrey Yu, the head of the UK investment office of UBS Wealth Management, said: \u201cWe see China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs as relatively measured. Beijing is sending a clear signal that it would like to bolster its reputation as a defender of free trade and to avoid antagonising the situation further. \u201cThis week\u2019s tariff announcements are likely to cause disruption in the short-term but looking ahead, with both sides hinting that conversations are ongoing behind the scenes, we view this as the beginning of a long process towards an eventual resolution.\u201d Jasper Lawler, the head of research at London Capital Group, said: \u201c$3bn is a splash in the ocean of US-China trade. If your glass is half-full, China\u2019s measured response opens the door to negotiations. If you glass is half-empty, it opens the door to escalation.\u201d The FTSE 100 ended Friday down 0.44% at 6921.94 after falling to 6876, with the recovery helped by EU leaders approving a Brexit transition deal. Germany\u2019s Dax lost 1.77% and France\u2019s Cac closed 1.39% lower. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.77% down, giving a weekly fall of 5.67% All three major US indexes recorded their biggest declines since January 2016.. The latest US sanctions on China are in addition to the 25% and 10% tariffs on steel and aluminium announced by Trump earlier this month. With regard to the steel and aluminium tariffs, the US president has given the EU, along with Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, a temporary exemption until 1 May, while talks continue. But despite this concession, Trump was accused of \u201cputting a gun\u201d to the EU\u2019s head as Brussels called on the US administration to make the exemption permanent. The pause is being viewed in Brussels as an attempt by the White House to pile on the pressure and extract trade concessions on EU goods exported to the US. Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister, said: \u201cI have the impression that the US leader wants to negotiate with the European Union by putting a gun to our head. That\u2019s a strange way to negotiate with an ally.\u201d In response to the US tariffs on China, the Chinese foreign ministry suggested soybeans, aeroplanes, cars and cotton could be targeted. Wine, apples and ethanol could also be in the firing line, which would hit agricultural areas where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The Chinese government could also target US technology companies that manufacture products in China, such as Apple, in the hope those firms would pressure Washington to back down, said Victor Shih, a professor of political economy at University of California, San Diego.",

    "webTitle": "Pineapples set to topple avocados with Britons wanting more", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For a while avocados had it all their own way as Britons smashed them on toast and whizzed them up for smoothies but there is a new pretender to the fruit crown \u2013 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the pineapple. Supermarkets say demand for the tropical fruit is at an all time high after a dramatic reappraisal by shoppers who increasingly view it as as an ingredient for curries, barbecues and cocktails as well as fruit salads. Such is the fervour, the pineapple has overtaken the avocado as the UK\u2019s fastest growing fruit, according to supermarket giant Tesco, with sales surging nearly 15% last year. \u201cPineapples have become the fruit taste of the moment and could soon rival the avocado as a once niche fruit suddenly gaining mainstream popularity,\u201d said Tesco\u2019s fresh pineapple buyer Morgan Jaquemet. \u201cIn the last few years we have seen demand jump because of the fruit\u2019s rising popularity as a versatile and healthy food.\u201d The rise of the avocado \u2013 sales in Tesco still increased by nearly 10% last year \u2013 was fuelled by social media as trendy restaurants created Instagram-worthy brunch dishes and its reputation as a superfood won it a place in numerous fad diets. The interest in health is reflected in fruit sales which rose more than 5% to \u00a35.6bn in the year to end of February, according to the grocery market experts Kantar Worldpanel. Customs data shows the UK imported more than 168,000 tonnes of pineapples in 2017 compared with 148,000 tonnes in 2016, an increase of almost 14%. The vast majority came from Costa Rica which has more than trebled its production of the fruit over the last 15 years, leading to concerns about environmental degradation as well as the pay rates of plantation workers. \u201cThere has been a big increase in fresh pineapple exports into Europe,\u201d said Neil Murray, head of processed commodities at Agribusiness Intelligence. \u201cPeople like it and a lot of it is coming from Costa Rica, but production is probably peaking there now, as they are getting worried about the amount of land under pineapple.\u201d Britons still have a way to go if pineapple sales are to overtake the avocado. Britons munched their way through \u00a3175m worth of avocados in the last 12 months compared with spending about \u00a344m on pineapples. Tesco said pineapple flavours were popular across the board with demand for juice up by more than a fifth and sales of tinned pineapple chunks up 5% (80g of tinned or fresh pineapple counts as one of your five a day). The controversial Hawaiian pizza is also staging a comeback, Tesco said, and whether down to laziness or fears of avocado hand-style injuries, sales of ready chopped pineapple \u201cfingers\u201d were up 30%. The national hankering for pineapple has probably been fuelled by subliminal cues picked up on social media and the high street. The motif was one of the hottest trends of last summer, plastered on everything from kitsch T-shirts to pool inflatables, cushions and knick knacks. In the Georgian era, pineapples were a status symbol which could be hired from \u201cpineapple merchants\u201d to dress a house for a party. By Christmas 2017 that trend had come full circle with entire pages on Pinterest devoted to pineapples that had been adorned with fairy lights and were being used as alternative Christmas trees.",

Elliott, which has a 3.8% shareholding, told GKN\u2019s management it did not trust it to deliver the \u201cprofound cultural shift\u201d needed to meet new targets while driving through two deals. The move means that just under 10% of GKN\u2019s shareholder base has come out in favour of the hostile bid, neck-and-neck with the 9% backing GKN\u2019s board. Shareholders have until midday on Thursday to support the offer from turnaround specialist Melrose or the GKN management plan to spin off the engineering groups automotive business and combine it with the US-based Dana, leaving GKN focused on aerospace. Investors are divided. Columbia Threadneedle, which has a 3.4% holding, threw its weight behind GKN\u2019s plan this week, joining top-30 investor Jupiter Asset Management. Elliott, which has joined Aviva Investors in backing Melrose, said in a letter to GKN\u2019s executives that hostile takeover bids often pressed management teams to come up with ideas that in normal circumstances would be disregarded as \u201cpure fantasy\u201d.

On Friday, Melrose lifted a self-imposed deadline for approval by the US authorities to enable the acquisition to conclude should shareholders back it next week. Melrose said discussions with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the Defense Security Service had been constructive and included potential interim mitigation measures. A mainstay of Britain\u2019s engineering sector, GKN makes parts for the US aviation industry, such as the Boeing 737 jet and the Black Hawk helicopter, as well as components for Volkswagen and Ford cars. GKN\u2019s status as a key UK manufacturing business, it employs 60,000 people across 30 countries, has led to trade unions, clients and MPs voicing concerns about the Melrose bid. Melrose rejects critics\u2019 attempts to characterise it as an asset-stripper and instead claims it has a strong record of turning round ailing businesses. But the asset-stripper accusations have been enough to spur some MPs into action. In February the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, wrote to the business secretary, Greg Clark, who has the power to call a public interest inquiry into the deal, expressing his concern over Melrose\u2019s bid.",

Investors were relieved by a lack of nasty surprises from the retailer MPs published a report demanding tougher rules on night flights before parliament gives Heathrow expansion the go-ahead European leaders gathered in Brussels welcomed the EU\u2019s temporary exemption from tariffs on US imports... ... but Belgium\u2019s prime minister said America\u2019s negotiating stance amounted to \u201ca gun to our heads.\u201d Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, called on the US to make the exemption permanent Back in the UK, Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe put households on notice for borrowing costs to rise faster than previously thought over the next few years Wall Street opened slightly higher as investors more calmly digested China\u2019s retaliation against US trade tariffs. The Dow was up 0.4% That\u2019s all from us for today. Thank you for following the blog and for all the comments. Have a good weekend and please join us again on Monday. AM Time for another look at the markets. In the US, the Dow Jones is bucking the trend across global markets and continues to rise. Here are the latest scores on Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.4% at 24,042 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,648 And in Europe: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 6,930 Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.3% at 11,946 France\u2019s CAC: -1% at 5,115 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 22,277 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1% at 9,398 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.6% at 367 Brent crude oil prices have hit $70.03 a barrel, the highest since late January. The rise follows comments from the Saudi energy minister, who said OPEC countries would need to keep co-ordinating supply cuts with non-member countries, including Russia, into 2019. Back to the subject of trade wars... Ana Boata, senior economist at Euler Hermes, the trade credit insurer, has done some number crunching on what the dispute between the US and China might mean: The trade feud between the US and China could lead to potential export losses of $15.7bn. The US\u2019 25% tariff on imports for $60bn Chinese goods might cost China $15bn in export losses, while retaliatory Chinese tariffs on $3bn of US agrifood and steel products could see US exporters lose up to $700m. We expect vehicles and electronics to be next on the target list, while their attentions might also turn to financial services and intellectual property. US markets are slightly up after the opening bell on Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.3% at 24,029 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,649 Nasdaq: +0.1% at 7,172 Bank of England rate-setter Gertjan Vlieghe has put households on notice for borrowing costs to rise faster than previously thought over the next few years. Using a speech in Birmingham, the member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee said he saw a need for one or two rate hikes per year over the next few years, in comments likely to be seen as putting the Bank on track for raising the cost of borrowing in May. One of the seven MPC members who voted to leave rates unchanged on Thursday, he said he was increasingly confident that wage growth in Britain was just around the corner. \u201cThe data have shifted further in the direction that warrants a continuation of the removal of monetary stimulus,\u201d he said. Although he warned there was uncertainty about the strength of the economy, particularly as the UK leaves the European Union, Vlieghe said recent surveys and figures from the jobs market had convinced him of the need for higher interest rates. But despite the good news for workers from rising pay, he warned there was also a lower \u201cnew normal\u201d for wage growth, as pay rises are likely to be constrained by poor levels of productivity growth in the UK. The sluggish increase in the efficiency of British workers seen since the financial crisis - which has been poorer than other advanced economies - could mean average annual wage rises worth about 3% per year compared to about 4% previously, he said. Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics, says the durable goods data suggests business investment is in \u201chealthy shape\u201d. The 3.1% rebound in durable goods orders in February was encouraging, even if that headline figure was boosted by the more volatile transport category. Equipment investment still appears to have slowed in the first quarter overall, but the data suggest that won\u2019t last for long. The 26% in commercial aircraft orders was in line with the stronger orders reported by Boeing last month, while orders for defence aircraft also posted a big rebound. The 1.6% gain in motor vehicle orders was, however, stronger than expected given the recent declines in sales. Overall, business equipment investment still appears to have slowed in the first quarter, probably to between 6% and 8% annualised. But some slowdown appeared inevitable after the double-digit gains in the second half of last year and, in any case, the latest business surveys suggest that the outlook over the coming months remains bright. On a data-light Friday, we\u2019ve just had some stronger-than-expected numbers out of the US. Orders for durable goods - items ranging from kitchen appliances to aircraft that are expected to last three years or more - jumped 3.1% in February, as demand for transport equipment rose by 7.1%. The headline number was expected to come in at 1.5%, and growth of 3.1% followed a 3.5% fall in January, the commerce department said. Orders of non-defence related capital capital goods excluding aircraft - considered a bellwether for business spending plans - rose 1.8% last month. It was the biggest gain in five months and beat expectations of a 0.8% increase. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist, says China can\u2019t be seen to show weakness against a \u201cbully\u201d like President Trump. He told Bloomberg Television in Beijing: Particularly when you have a bully like Trump, it would not be good to respond in a weak way. We know about appeasement from Munich. It\u2019s a different kind of a war but in a trade war, appeasement could lead to more and more demands. Stiglitz, a Columbia University economics professor, said China was in a better position than the US to withstand a trade war: [China is] sitting on $3 trillion of reserves that it can use to help those adversely affected. In the United States we don\u2019t have an economic framework that is able to respond to the particular places that will be affected by a trade war. The fiscal resources of the United States are strained. US futures have reversed earlier losses suggesting Wall Street could open slightly higher. Dow Jones futures are up about 0.1% while S&amp;P futures are up 0.2%. Trevor Greetham at investment company Royal London Asset Management says now could be the time to buy shares. In a note titled \u201cthe Donald dip becomes a Trump slump\u201d, he says: Stock markets have fallen back sharply towards their February lows. While the initial bout of market weakness this year was blamed on rising wage inflation and fears of higher interest rates, this time round it\u2019s in reaction to President Trump\u2019s announcement of a range of tariffs on imports from China. Although equities have taken a battering since the market melt-up at the turn of the year when US corporate tax cuts were the focus, these moves aren\u2019t so unexpected. It\u2019s quite normal for markets to remain edgy for a month or two after such a sharp reversal and a move back towards the initial lows is not surprising. Given this weakness, we\u2019re once again adding to equities and remain overweight stocks in the multi asset funds we manage. It\u2019s noteworthy that commodity markets haven\u2019t reacted particularly badly to the tariffs spat and emerging market equities are outperforming in the sell-off, both signs that global growth remains on track. With profits growing and interest rates still below inflation in major developed economies, the fundamentals and outlook remain positive. Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU\u2019s trade commissioner, has outlined her view on the bloc\u2019s temporary exemption from US tariffs in a series of tweets. The exemption was agreed after Malmstrom travelled to Washington for talks with US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. Over in Brussels, where EU leaders are gathered for talks, positivity over the bloc\u2019s 40-day exemption on tariffs, granted by Washington, appears to be wearing thin. Belgium\u2019s Prime Minister, Charles Michel, said he was not impressed at the suspension of tariffs until 1 May: I have the impression that the US leader wants to negotiate with the European Union by putting a gun to our head. That\u2019s a strange way to negotiate with an ally. Here is our latest market roundup as China reacts to US steel tariffs: Peter Rosenstreich, a trader at Swissquote, the online bank, says markets are overreacting to \u201ctrade war hype\u201d: Markets are overreacting to President Donald Trump\u2019s threats of a trade war. Trump is using the issue for political gain, rather than actual trade repositioning. This will give him a nice bullet point for stump speeches in the 2020 campaign, but he gains little from sparking a full-blown trade conflict. Besides, the World Trade Organization is still in action. Craig Erlam at online trading site Oanda, says investors are concerned that an impending trade war will derail the global economy: For a person who\u2019s been obsessed with stock market gains since his election victory 16 months ago, US President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t appear too concerned about the impact his tariffs are having at the moment. Trump may be prepared to add the European Union to the list of those that are temporarily exempt from the tariffs \u2013 with Canada, Mexico and Australia having been allowed similar exemptions \u2013 but that has barely cushioned the blow for investors. Understandably, the prospect of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies is not particularly desirable for investors. The global economy is finally starting the tick along nicely after a decade of efforts to repair the damage of the global financial crisis and the issues that followed and now we\u2019re potentially having to deal with an entirely self-inflicted and avoidable problem. Losses have widened across European market as investors digest the prospect of a US-China trade war. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: -1% at 6,884 Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.9% at 11,877 France\u2019s CAC: -1.9% at 5,068 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.7% at 22,008 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1.5% at 9,345 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -1.5% at 364 Wall Street is also expected to open down: Dow Jones futures: -0.7% S&amp;P futures: -0.5% Nasdaq futures: -0.9% Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has called on the US to make permanent the EU\u2019s temporary exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs. He says a good trading relationship between the US and EU is essential for \u201csecurity and prosperity\u201d in both regions: China\u2019s planned retaliation against US tariffs on steel imports includes a potential 25% levy on pork imported from the US. As Bloomberg explains, this would hit the US agricultural sector, particularly in Iowa, a key battleground in the 2016 presidential election: In its initial counterstrike, China announced a 25 percent levy on US pork imports - a heavy blow to Iowa, the top pork-producing state and a political battleground that swung to Trump in 2016 after going for Democrat Barack Obama in the previous two elections. Any hit to agricultural producers\u2019 earnings would be especially painful as falling commodity prices already are hurting rural America. US farm income is forecast to drop 6.7% this year to its lowest level since 2006, according to US department of agriculture estimates that assumed normal trade relations with China. \u201cWere farmers faced with falling prices for the exports and higher prices at home because of the import tariffs, the popularity of the tariffs would diminish quickly,\u201d said Mike Jakeman, a global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cThis is a high-risk strategy for the U.S. administration and one that is likely to weaken, rather than strengthen, the global economy.\u201d EU leaders meeting in Brussels have welcomed President Trump\u2019s decision to row back on plans to impose tariffs on European steel. Washington said on Thursday tariffs would be suspended for the EU - America\u2019s biggest trading partner - Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. The tariffs are suspended until 1 May as discussions continue. A spokesman for the French government said this morning: Europe has clearly stated its intention to riposte and enter a trade war ... it\u2019s a good thing that President Trump changed his mind on tariff increases. Germany\u2019s economy minister, Peter Altmaier, said: I am very pleased that we have avoided a situation for the German steel and aluminium industry and its workers, that could have led to great uncertainty. We don\u2019t want further unilateral measures, rather we want sensible agreements. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici kept it simple: This is progress, let\u2019s keep talking. Theresa May has also welcomed the decision. Next is one of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers and the latest results for the year ending January 2018 reflect a tough trading backdrop on the UK\u2019s high streets. Pre-tax profits fell 8% to \u00a3726m, reflecting a 7.9% fall in sales in its shops. The drop was not enough to offset a 9% rise in online sales. Lord Wolfson, chief executive, said it had been an \u201cuncomfortable year\u201d, adding: In many ways 2017 was the most challenging year we have faced for 25 years. A difficult clothing market coincided with self-inflicted product ranging errors and omissions. At the same time, the business has had to manage the costs, systems requirements and opportunities of an accelerating structural shift in spending from retail stores to online. In the end our profits were in line with the forecast we issued in January 2017 and the company goes into the coming year in good financial health. However, investors are not perturbed by the fall in profits, given they were in line with expectations. In the absence of any nasty shocks, Next is now the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, up 3.3% at \u00a347.83. The FTSE 100 has fallen less than expected in early trading, currently down 33 points or 0.5% at 6,919. The losses have been limited by GlaxoSmithKline and Next, which are the top two risers this morning: Shares in the pharma giant GSK are being boosted by the decision to withdraw its interest in buying Pfizer\u2019s consumer healthcare business. GSK had been the favourite to buy the business in a multibillion-pound deal after Reckitt Benckiser pulled out. The rise in Next\u2019s shares follow the publication of its annual results, which show an 8% fall in pre-tax profits. More on that soon. And we\u2019re off... Europe\u2019s main markets have opened down, as predicted: FTSE 100: -0.5% Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.9% France\u2019s CAC: -0.9% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.2% Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.9% Tougher rules should be imposed on night flights and keeping costs down for passengers before parliament approves a third runway at Heathrow. That is the verdict of the transport select committee in a report published overnight. Concerns are centred on the environmental impact of Heathrow expansion, as Lilian Greenwood, the committee\u2019s chair, explains: At present, the draft national policy statement does not guarantee that passengers will be protected from the cost risks associated with the scheme. The secretary of state must set out how airport charges will be held down. She added: Thousands of people across London could be exposed to worse levels of noise, air quality and traffic congestion \u2013 there must be sufficient measures to protect or compensate them. Read our full story on the report: European markets are expected to follow Asia lower when they open in about 20 minutes. Here are the opening calls from traders at the spread-betting firm IG: Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group says the stand-off between the US and China is sending a chill through the markets: Despite Trump claiming that the tariffs would make the US \u201ca much stronger nation\u201d the markets are keenly aware that there will be no winners in a trade war. Worse still, the tit for tat responses that we are now seeing - and can expect to see more of - between the world\u2019s two largest economies, is damaging for their economies and the broader global economy. Good morning if you\u2019re just joining us \u2013 and hello again if you\u2019ve already been reading. It\u2019s been a very busy day so far on the stock and currency markets so here\u2019s a roundup of what\u2019s happened: Fears of a global trade war have intensified after China signalled it would retaliate against US tariffs. Beijing said it didn\u2019t want a trade war and urged the US to pull back from the brink. But it said it wasn\u2019t afraid of one and has drawn up a list of more than 100 US products that it will hit with duties if Donald Trump goes ahead with his tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium. Stock markets in Asia have fallen sharply. The Nikkei in Japan closed down 4.51% and in Hong Kong and Shanghai, where trading is still going on, the markets are down 3.18% and 3.4%. European markets are set to open down as well with FTSE 100 on course to drop 0.74% Key industrial commodities have been hit as well, with the iron ore futures price down 5% and copper at a three-month low The yen is up as the US dollar continued to slump. The pound rose against the greenback to $1.415. For a roundup here\u2019s our news story: Spreadbetters are forecasting that the FTSE100 will lose about 0.8% when trading starts in London in an hour or so. Bourses are about to open in Europe though, and they too are expected to take a hefty hit. These are the predicted openings: Germany\u2019s DAX -1.6% France\u2019s CAC -1.5% S&amp;P 0.6% The Kospi index in Seoul, South Korea has closed down 3.29%, or 82 points at 2,414. The country has a large export industry and stands to lose out if there is a trade war between the US and China. It\u2019s largest trading partner is China and the US is its second biggest. SE Kim, an employee at a construction company in Seoul, told AP: I\u2019m worried that it would affect the national economy. If the US imposes tariffs on China like that, I think there would be some damage on us in the long term as well. It\u2019s been a pretty rough few days on the financial markets. Facebook\u2019s woes are punishing the tech sector, the US Fed hiked interests rates on Wednesday and the Bank of England rate setters were split 7-2 in favour of keeping rates on hold. Only a matter of time before that changes, many believe. And now the prospect of a trade war. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets says the potential for a big selloff in the tech sector is especially worrying: Investors should be rightly fearful of [the Facebook selloff] given that the tech sector has driven most of the gains in US markets over the past 18 months. A meltdown in this sector has the potential to get very messy indeed, with related ripple out effects. This week\u2019s Fed decision to raise rates and tweak its guidance appears to have cut the rug out further from under the US dollar as policymakers adopted a safety first approach to future rate rise expectations, leaving them unchanged for this year. This appears to have caught markets off balance sending bond yields sharply lower and the US 10 and 2-year spread back towards its previous lows, though some of these declines could also be attributed to concerns about tariffs. It\u2019s worth looking again at the statement from the Chinese commerce ministry earlier today. It said that China did not want a trade war, but it was \u201cnot afraid\u201d of having one. China doesn\u2019t hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one. China hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place. The interesting thing here is that it does leave a bit of wriggle room so might not necessarily result in an all-out trade war as noted by some of our experts. The memorandum signed by Trump on Thursday allows for a 30-day consultation period that only starts once a list of Chinese goods to be taxed is published. Trump said he views the Chinese as \u201ca friend\u201d, and both sides are in talks so it could be resolved. The commerce industry said China was considering measures in two stages: a 15% hit on 120 US products, including steel pipes, dried fruit and wine worth $977m. China\u2019s list also included close to 80 fruit and nut products. Then it would levy 25% on $1.99bn of pork and recycled aluminium. The market in Tokyo is closed. It finished down 4.51%, or 974 points at 20,617. Masses of reaction from traders so let\u2019s try to roundup some of their comments. Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, sounded a slightly optimistic tone to Reuters by saying that US tariffs might not be quite as bad they appear. But then he essentially says it might get worse before it gets better: In the longer run, protectionist policies touted by the United States could be watered down, in turn limiting the negative effect on trade and the global economy. But until the United States makes such concessions, global stocks will be under pressure and the yen will appreciate, especially if China decides to confront the U.S. measures. Similarly, Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank is quoted by Associated Press saying: Beijing is extending an olive branch and urging the U.S. to resolve trade disputes through dialogue rather than tariffs. Nevertheless, the first volley of shots and retaliatory response has been set off. Paul Eitelman, senior investment strategist at Russell Investments, tells Bloomberg: It\u2019s a significant step in escalation in trade tensions between the US and China. The biggest watchpoint from here is how China responds to this and any potential escalation that creates going forward. The Australian benchmark index, the ASX200, has closed down almost 2%. The big miners, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, were among the biggest losers amid concern that demand for the country\u2019s biggest export \u2013 iron ore \u2013 will be hurt by the tariffs. Elsewhere it\u2019s an even grimmer picture. In Tokyo the Nikkei is off a whopping 4.58%. The yen has risen as invesors seek a safe haven, but that\u2019s bad news for Japan\u2019s exporters, hence the big drop in equities. Australia fears it could be hit by steel tariffs after it emerged that an exemption promised by Donald Trump would run on 1 May. The White House said Friday that Australia, Europe, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil would initially escape America\u2019s 25% steel and 10% aluminium tariffs. But that would run out in a matter of weeks \u201cpending discussions of satisfactory long-term alternative means to address the threatened impairment to US national security\u201d. The country\u2019s trade minister, Steve Ciobo, said Australia could not have a fairer deal with the US but it may find itself in the same boat as China. Here\u2019s the full story: And find out more about the EU\u2019s reprieve \u2013 temporary or otherwise \u2013 with this story from our man in Brussels, Daniel Boffey: Good afternoon/good morning and welcome to our business live blog on a tumultuous day for the world economy. China has wasted no time in signalling that it will retaliate against Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium imports. Beijing\u2019s swift response was expected and, although Asian stock markets have been battered in the wake of Trump\u2019s move, it left some room for negotiation with a plea for the US to \u201cpull back from the brink\u201d. Here are the main developments so far: China will impose duties on US pork, apples and steel pipe among other things unless a settlement could be reached Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry said it didn\u2019t want a trade war but was \u201cnot afraid of having one\u201d if the US didn\u2019t back down Asian shares fell sharply along with key commodities such as iron ore The Nikkei is down 4.4%; Hang Seng -2.8%; ASX200 in Sydney -2%; Kospi in Seoul 2.2%; CSI in Shanghai 3.2%. The FTSE100 looks set to drop nearly 1% this morning, according to futures trade, while Germany\u2019s Dax is set to drop 1.6%. The Dalian iron ore price is down 5% on fears of a drop in demand for steel Copper fell to a three-month low of $6,628.00 per tonne, but oil rose 1% on the back of more Saudi production cuts The yen and bond prices rose as the US dollar fell back The pound was up slightly at $1.416 and \u20ac1.444.",

      "bodyText": "What happened to Britain\u2019s fishing fleet? The distant water fleet that once sailed out of Aberdeen, Fleetwood and the Humber for fishing grounds around Iceland, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the Arctic was decimated in the 1970s after a change in international law established exclusive economic zones (EEZ) up to 200 miles around coastal states. After the final cod war with Iceland in 1976, Britain gradually lost access to these waters and saw a collapse in domestic fishing, even though consumer preference remained for white demersal fish like cod, hake and haddock rather than species more common to inshore waters. Why did Britain lose control of its own EEZ? When Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973, the introduction of the common fisheries policy (CFP) and a shared EEZ for the whole of the EU was largely based on existing patterns of fishing, which tended to favour continental fishermen who had stayed closer to home. In extreme cases that meant, for example, that the quota share for cod in the English Channel favoured French fisherman over British by nine to one. The UK government was seen as too weak to negotiate more favourable splits based on the actual stocks of its fish. It still has exclusive access to waters less than six miles from the coast. What was promised by Brexit? Departure from the EU was intended to restore the UK\u2019s status as an independent coastal state in fishing negotiations. The agriculture secretary, Michael Gove, has pledged to withdraw from the 1964 London fisheries convention and take back control of the zone between six and 12 miles out. Withdrawal from the CFP and control of the remaining UK EEZ up to 200 miles (or halfway, in the case of nearby countries) was intended to follow immediately after Brexit on 29 March 2019. Britain then hoped to become like Norway, which conducts annual fish negotiations on equal terms with the EU while retaining access to its markets. What happened instead? The need to negotiate a transition phase to delay the impact of a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d departure from the single market on the rest of business has forced the UK to agree to abide by all of the existing rules until at least January 2021. At negotiations last week, the EU made clear this would include maintaining the CFP rules throughout. Britain would have only a consultative role at any talks during this phase. The EU has also made any future post-Brexit trade deal conditional on maintaining access for its fisherman \u2013 something the UK industry fears means further climbdowns will follow. What happens next? The government insists the delay means Britain will only miss out on one round of annual fishing negotiations and will continue eventually to become an independent coastal state. It is likely, however, that any wider free trade agreement with the EU will include limits on Britain\u2019s ability to negotiate away existing European fishing rights inside the UK EEZ. At best, this could delay the rebalancing of quota shares demanded by British fishermen. At worst, it could make it almost impossible to change the status quo without jeopardising access to European fish consumers as well as the much more valuable free trade agreement that Britain needs for its bigger exporters in other sectors.",

Eighteen months after Sajid Javid first took responsibility for a planning decision for a new coal mine at Highthorn, the communities secretary said he had concluded the project should not go ahead. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth said the decision was the first time the UK government had rejected a planning application citing climate change as the reason. Rose Dickinson, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis is a significant victory for local residents and the climate, it means an important step forward has been taken in ending the era of fossil fuels.\u201d Explaining Javid\u2019s decision, officials said: \u201cHe concludes that overall the scheme would have an adverse effect on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change of very substantial significance, which he gives very considerable weight in the planning balance.\u201d The communities secretary said the impact on global warming, together with harm to the local landscape, outweighed the economic benefits of the mine. Banks Mining, which submitted its planning application in 2015 and had argued the project would bring substantial investment to the local area, hit out at what it branded a \u201cperverse decision\u201d. Gavin Styles, the company\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cIt has been made for purely political reasons and is totally contrary to the principles of local decision-making that previously appeared so important to Mr Javid.\u201d The company said it had not yet decided whether to appeal. The use of coal for electricity generation has plummeted in the face of carbon taxes and competition from gas, but the Highthorn site is not the UK\u2019s only proposed new coal mine. West Cumbria Mining wants to build a \u00a3200m mine at Woodhouse in Cumbria, south of Kendal, which would be the UK\u2019s first deep coal mine in several decades. The company plans to extract metallurgical coal for steel-making rather than power generation. Cumbria county council has so far postponed meetings on the project, and late May is understood to be the earliest it will decide whether to approve or reject the mine. Two coal power stations this year have already announced closure plans, after which the UK will have just six coal plants.",

      "bodyText": "Global markets have dropped sharply after China retaliated against Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, fuelling fears of an all-out trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Hours after the US president announced moves to tackle what he believes are unfair trade practices, China signalled it would hit US goods such as pork, apples and steel pipe with higher duties. China\u2019s commerce ministry urged Washington to negotiate a settlement as soon as possible but set no deadline. A ministry statement on Friday said the higher US tariffs \u201cseriously undermine\u201d the global trading system. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one,\u201d the statement said. \u201cChina hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.\u201d The news sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 724 points or 2.93% on Thursday, and the rout continued in Asian markets. The Nikkei 225 in Toyko closed 4.51% lower, while shares in Hong Kong fell 2.45%, the CSI300 in Shanghai lost 2.86% and the Kospi in Seoul was down 3.37%. In Australia, which exports more iron ore to China than any other country, the ASX200 benchmark index was off nearly 2%. In Europe, the FTSE 100 was down nearly 1% at 6883 in mid-morning trading, a new 15 month low and pushing the leading index firmly into correction territory, down 10% since its recent peak in late January. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have both dropped by about 1.8%. Despite the US move on China, the EU is one of the regions which has been given a temporary exemption from the steel tariffs. At the European summit in Brussels, the UK prime minister, Theresa May, said she welcomed the exemption and was working with other EU leaders to try and make it permanent. She said: \u201cWe will be talking about what the next steps might be. I have stayed on to talk about these next steps because the steel industry is hugely important to the UK and the British government and I want to ensure that steel workers and their jobs are properly safeguarded.\u201d In response to the US tariffs on China, the country\u2019s foreign ministry suggested soybeans, airplanes, cars and cotton could be targeted. Goods targeted for possible higher Chinese tariffs include wine, apples and ethanol, which would hit agricultural areas where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The Chinese government could also target US technology companies that manufacture products in China, such as Apple, in the hope those firms would pressure Washington to back down, said Victor Shih, a professor of political economy at University of California, San Diego. The ministry said China bought about $1bn (\u00a3700m) worth of those goods last year. They would be hit with a 15% tariff increase, mirroring the US duty hike of 15% on aluminum. A second group of products targeted for a possible 25% tariff, mirroring the higher American charge on steel, includes pork and aluminum scrap, according to the ministry. \u201cIt\u2019s already a trade war. And this war is started by the US,\u201d Cheng Dawei, a professor of international trade at Renmin University in Beijing. The Chinese government is still consulting with industry leaders on other possible retaliatory measures, she added, while China will also \u201creact on other multilateral platforms, such as World Trade Organisation and the G20\u201d. Further tariffs are likely, with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, recently delivering a nationalistic speech at the close of a parliamentary session where he secured a removal of term limits on his office. \u201cThe US action demonstrates how much damage Xi Jinping has done to the US-China relationship, he completely rejected Obama\u2019s outstretched hand and now there\u2019s broad support in Washington that something had to be done,\u201d said Ely Ratner, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump could yet impose import quotas on Australian steel and aluminium after it emerged the tariff exemption he granted Malcolm Turnbull would now have a deadline of 1 May. The Australian government has responded by declaring its deal with the US was \u201cunconditional\u201d and claiming the deadline was directed at negotiations with other nations for a more long-term rebalancing of trade. The White House on Friday confirmed Australia, Europe, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil would initially escape America\u2019s 25% steel and 10% aluminium tariffs. However, the exemption would last only until 1 May \u201cpending discussions of satisfactory long-term alternative means to address the threatened impairment to US national security\u201d. \u201cBy May 1, 2018, the president will decide whether to continue to exempt these countries from the tariffs, based on the status of the discussions,\u201d the White House said. Trade minister Steven Ciobo said the agreement between Trump and Turnbull to exempt Australian steel \u201cwas unconditional\u201d. \u201cAs the United States has acknowledged, the US could not have a fairer trade relationship than it does with Australia,\u201d he said. Before the announcement Turnbull said the threatened tariffs against China and others were the \u201cbeginning of a negotiation\u201d between the US and the rest of the world. \u201c[Trump\u2019s] contention is that trade should be fair and reciprocal, we understand that, that\u2019s the reason why Australians has been exempted from the steel tariff,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Donald Trump said, trade between Australia and the US is fair and reciprocal, there\u2019s zero tariffs on US imports into Australia, a very close security relationship, the Americans actually have a trade surplus with Australia.\u201d US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Trump\u2019s policy adviser Peter Navarro will closely monitor imports of steel and aluminium from Australia and other exempted countries. Navarro has appeared to harden the White House\u2019s position, telling CNN the exempted nations would be saddled with steel and aluminium quotas to prevent non-exempted nations attempting to find backdoor entry points to America. \u201cThis is an important thing,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cEvery country that is not facing tariffs that we are going to negotiate with will face quotas so that we protect our aluminum and steel industries. \u201cFor all countries there has to be a quota. If you don\u2019t put a quota on then any country that can do whatever they want will become a trans-shipment point for any other country.\u201d He did not specify the size of the quota. Australia\u2019s peak body representing the steel industry said it was too early to tell what the impact would be. \u201cI don\u2019t think, until the details come out, that we really know what the implications [are],\u201d Steel Institute chief executive Tony Dixon said on Friday. The announcement came as Trump heightened fears of a US-China trade war by also announcing plans to hit Chinese goods with $US60bn in tariffs. \u201cThe important thing is, no one wins from a trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to the US and China being able to negotiate a satisfactory arrangement that suits both sides.\u201d Labor frontbencher Richard Marles said it was \u201cbad news for the global economy\u201d. \u201cIt is obviously therefore bad news for us. We have to be doing everything we can to try and advocate to the US not to walk down a path of increasing tariff barriers around this economy,\u201d he told Sky News.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Financial markets have taken fright after Donald Trump fired the latest shots in an escalating trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies by announcing $60bn (\u00a342.5bn) of further tariffs on China. Amid relief in Brussels that the EU had won a temporary reprieve from Trump\u2019s already announced action to protect the US from imports of steel and aluminium, Wall Street braced itself for retaliation from China. Beijing announced it would consider higher tariffs on pork, aluminium pipe and other goods from the US, a trade worth about $3bn. Trump told reporters that the US trade deficit with Beijing was out of control at about $504bn. \u201cIt is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. It\u2019s out of control,\u201d the US president said as he signed a memorandum. \u201cWe have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on, which likewise is hundreds of billions of dollars.\u201d Just 24 hours before tariffs were to be enforced on the EU, the Trump administration announced it was exempting the bloc, along with Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, while trade talks with those nations were ongoing. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, welcomed the development in a tweet from a summit of EU leaders in Brussels. \u201cA trade war would have damaged both sides,\u201d he said. About \u00a335bn worth of Chinese imports to the US will be affected by tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium. The White House said Trump would direct the office of the US trade representative to publish a new list of proposed tariffs within 15 days. They are likely to cover sectors such as robotics, hi-tech trains and aerospace. There will then be 30 days for responses. In January Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. Peter Navarro, director of the office of trade and manufacturing policy, told reporters the US was \u201cstrategically defending itself [from] \u2026 economic aggression\u201d. US stock markets reacted negatively, with the Dow Jones dropping more than 300 points on Thursday. Caterpillar, 3M and Boeing \u2013 all with significant exposure to China \u2013 were among the biggest fallers. Bank and tech stocks also fell. At one point, the index was down 500 points, though by lunchtime in the US it had recovered on news that the tariffs would be subject to a period of consultation to be down 1.1% or 287 points. The FTSE-100 closed down 86 at 6952.59 \u2013 the first time the index has closed below 7,000 since December 2016. China has warned it would take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to defend itself. Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, referred to imports of US soybeans, aeroplanes, cotton and cars, saying they could be viewed as examples of unequal trade. The US also \u201crefuses to export what China wants\u201d, she said, possibly referring to restrictions on technology and military sales. \u201cWe are firmly against unilateralism and protectionism. China will not watch our legal interest being harmed,\u201d Hua added. Dozens of industry groups signed an open letter to the White House last weekend warning that \u201cthe imposition of sweeping tariffs would trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the US economy, provoking retaliation; stifling US agriculture, goods and services exports, and raising costs for businesses and consumers\u201d. The EU has argued in recent months that as a close ally of the US it should be exempt, and had threatened to impose a series of retaliatory measures including import duties on their products. Speaking before Trump\u2019s comments, the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, told a Senate committee that the president had personally decided \u201cto pause the imposition of tariffs with respect to those countries\u201d with which trade talks were ongoing. Trump has had few kind words to say about the EU, claiming it had made life difficult for US exporters. Earlier this month he told reporters: \u201cThe European Union has been particularly tough on the United States. They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them.\u201d As the proposed further tariffs on China were unveiled Trump called for the EU to respond to his temporary amnesty with a willingness to cut tariffs on US exports to Europe. The EU\u2019s response is among topics on the agenda at an EU leaders summit dinner on Thursday. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the EU commissioner for trade, held two days of talks with her US counterpart, Wilbur Ross, before the announcement. The reprieve for the EU was only given a cautious welcome by British steel makers. Gareth Stace, the director of UK Steel, warned that US protectionism would still have a heavy impact on European countries unless Brussels took its own measures to stem the flow of aluminium and steel into the EU. \u201cTariffs are set to divert millions of tonnes of steel away from the US towards other open markets,\u201d he said. \u201cAt 40m tonnes a year, the EU is by far the largest import market in the world and will be the obvious target for major steel exporters to the US such as Turkey and Russia.\u201d He added: \u201cThe top priority here must be for the [European] commission to swiftly introduce safeguard measures to guard against further expected import surges.\u201d",
