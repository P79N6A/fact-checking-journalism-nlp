      "bodyText": "L\u2019Or\u00e9al has confirmed it is exploring a potential sale of The Body Shop as the ethical beauty retailer revealed sliding sales and profits. The world\u2019s largest cosmetics company said it had not made any decision on the future of the Sussex-based retailer, which has more than 3,000 stores in 66 countries, but had \u201cdecided to explore all strategic options\u201d in order \u201cto give it the best opportunities and full ability to continue its development\u201d. The announcement confirms reports earlier this week that L\u2019Or\u00e9al had appointed bankers to examine a sale of The Body Shop with some private equity suitors already interested. The French beauty products company bought out the founder, Anita Roddick, in 2006 for \u00a3652m in a move that shocked supporters of the ethical firm. Roddick set up the business in Brighton in 1976 to help support her two daughters. Roddick said she had ensured The Body Shop\u2019s own principles were protected under the terms of the takeover, and insisted she could be a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d who could influence the new parent into adopting some of her ethical ideas. However, she died in 2007 and industry watchers believe there is little crossover between her business and L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s other brands. Some fans of The Body Shop are put off by its links to a vast corporate cosmetics firm. Last year, The Body Shop tried to reaffirm its ethical principles with 14 targets for 2020, including ensuring all its natural ingredients were traceable and sustainably sourced, compared with just under half today, and that 70% of its packaging did not come from fossil fuels, compared with 30% today. But the group now faces more competition than when it started out, from more upmarket ethical brands such as Dr Hauschka and Chantecaille, as well as the British rivals Lush and Neal\u2019s Yard. L\u2019Or\u00e9al, which owns a plethora of international brands including Garnier and Maybelline, reported on Thursday that The Body Shop\u2019s operating profit had dived 38% to \u20ac33.8m in the year to 31 December 2016. Sales sank nearly 5% to \u20ac920.8m. The pace of decline stepped up in the final and most important quarter of the year \u2013 sliding by 6.3% in total. Reporting its annual results on Thursday afternoon, L\u2019Or\u00e9al said The Body Shop sales at established shops had risen 0.6% over the year as it enjoyed good momentum in Europe, especially the UK. Online sales also rose. However, sluggish sales in Saudia Arabia and Hong Kong have affected the business\u2019s overall performance.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has appointed Charlotte Hogg as its second most powerful executive, in a role that hands the former financier the task of keeping a check on Britain\u2019s financial sector. Hogg has been appointed deputy governor for markets and banking, while consolidating her position at Threadneedle Street by retaining her current role as the central bank\u2019s chief operating officer. She replaces Minouche Shafik, who is becoming director of the London School of Economics. Chancellor Philip Hammond said: \u201cI\u2019m confident that her exceptional leadership skills and wide-ranging experience make her the right person to take on the position. Charlotte has done an excellent job as the Bank\u2019s first chief operating officer. She will take over this new role at a key time for the City.\u201d Hogg, 46, was brought into the bank in 2013 from the banking group Santander by governor Mark Carney to shake up the organisation, which he said needed to be more transparent and communicate its policies more clearly. Carney also wanted Hogg, who had previously spent 10 years at the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, to help him promote diversity in an organisation many believe had changed little in its 323-year history. Carney said: \u201cMany of the top priorities in markets and banking currently coincide with those of the Bank\u2019s central operational areas, meaning Charlotte is the ideal person to lead these efforts \u2026 her breadth of financial sector and operational experience will contribute valuable, broader perspectives to the Bank\u2019s policy committees\u201d. Although Hogg lacks Shafik\u2019s international connections at organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, the privately-educated, Oxford graduate will wield considerable experience of the domestic financial sector when she takes up her new position at the end of the month. She will sit on the monetary policy committee, the financial policy committee, the Bank\u2019s court of directors and the board of the main City regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority. Among her tasks will be to manage the Bank\u2019s strategy during the Brexit negotiations, which could prove to have serious consequences for the City and the banking sector. Several banks have criticised regulators for tightening rules and issuing large fines for bad behaviour. The chairman of Barclays, John McFarlane, hit out last year against the \u00a320bn in fines and taxes imposed on the Bank, forcing it to cut its dividend. In an intervention that flagged the lobbying power of the City, the chair of the Treasury select committee, Andrew Tyrie, warned in 2015 against bending to \u201cspecial pleading\u201d by banks after the Treasury moved to dilute measures to make top bank bosses more accountable. As well as her financial experience, the Oxford economics graduate is steeped in British politics through her family. Both Hogg\u2019s parents had leading roles in Sir John Major\u2019s government and her grandfather, Quintin Hogg, was a prominent Tory who almost won the Conservative party leadership following the resignation of Harold Macmillan. Her father, the Tory MP Douglas Hogg, served in the cabinet from 1995 to 1997. He stepped down in 2010 after more than 30 years in the Commons and now sits in the Lords as the 3rd Viscount Hailsham. Her mother, Sarah Hogg, is a crossbench peer. Charlotte Hogg was a economics journalist and TV presenter before heading John Major\u2019s policy unit in the mid-1990s. The appointment comes as the Bank faces the loss of another prominent woman following Kristin Forbes\u2019s decision on Thursday to turn down a second term as a member of the MPC and return to her native US. Forbes has built a reputation as a tough operator who believes that the Bank should begin to withdraw its economic stimulus before the end of the year to combat rising inflation. This view contrasts with the majority of MPC members who are expected to support historically low interest rates well into 2018. Carney is expected to search for a replacement for Forbes that maintains the gender balance to keep on track his campaign to widen access beyond an old boys\u2019 club of senior officials. In a speech on Thursday, he said he not only wanted to meet targets for more women and black and minority ethnic staff at the bank, but recruit graduates from outside Oxford and Cambridge and from poorer backgrounds. He said: \u201cHomogenous groups that pay insufficient attention to minority views are vulnerable to biases, groupthink and overoptimism. They are more likely to be influenced by the way information is presented; and to stick with underperforming projects because of prior investments. \u201cDiverse groups can overcome these ills as they are more inclined to consider novel ideas and challenge each other, enabling them to infer cause and effect and to solve problems better.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 February 2017. An earlier version said Douglas Hogg stepped down as an MP in 2010 to become the Viscount Hailsham. He succeeded to the viscountcy in 2001, and joined the House of Lords in 2015 after being given a life peerage.",

    "webTitle": "Five reasons why Waitrose is closing stores", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Waitrose total sales continue to rise in a tough grocery environmentwith the supermarket chain increasing its market share to 5.3% in the past year, as an average 250,000 more shoppers a week walked through its doors. But the upmarket grocer is closing stores and reining in expansion after operating profits fell by 10.5% to \u00a3121.3m in the six months to the end of July, even before a \u00a325m write down of property assets where it no longer wants to build stores. Its \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket rivals \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 have already pushed through restructuring plans in the face of an increasingly competitive landscape and the growth of online shopping. So why is Waitrose shutting branches? 1. Overexpansion Staines, Leek, Cardiff \u2013 these are not typical Waitrose heartlands and have not attracted the number of shoppers needed to become profitable. Rising costs and fears that shoppers will rein in their spending once Brexit-fuelled inflation kicks in only make such adventures less attractive. Shoppers are also moving away from a big weekly shop towards picking up what they need locally so sales in big supermarkets are generally in decline. Waitrose is still opening stores this year, but they will mostly be its Little Waitrose convenience outlets \u2013 a section of the market that is still growing. Most of the closures are supermarkets. When Dave Lewis took charge of Tesco in 2014, one of his first big decisions was to close 43 unprofitable stores and abandon plans to build another 49 around the country. 2. Prices The rise in popularity of discounters Aldi and Lidl has forced the entire grocery market to rethink prices and Waitrose has not been immune. Even its mainly middle-class shoppers are happy to pick up a bargain in one of the German discounters \u2013 whether it\u2019s champagne or toilet roll \u2013 and that has eaten away at Waitrose\u2019s market. In an attempt to maintain its competitive edge, Waitrose pledges to price-match Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, on thousands of branded lines. As Tesco has brought down prices, Waitrose has been forced to follow, contributing to a 1% fall in sales at established stores in the half-year to July. Other initiatives including the introduction of a basics range during the financial crisis in 2009 and a 20% discount for loyalty card holders on 10 items they regularly buy will also have squeezed profit margins. Analysts wonder how long it will be able to keep offering them a free coffee when they pop in to do their shopping. 3. Online Waitrose\u2019s more wealthy London-based shoppers have been keen adopters of online retail. Internet grocery sales rose 4.3% in the six months to July as sales in established stores fell. Picking and packing your customers\u2019 groceries is an expensive business. While Waitrose shoppers spend more than those at other chains and is profitable, it makes considerably less money online than it does in stores. The struggle to make the economics of the online grocery business stack up is illustrated by Ocado, which took 15 years to turn a profit. 4. Rising costs Last month Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of Waitrose\u2019s parent group, the John Lewis Partnership, warned that retailers would have to absorb a big chunk of the rise in the cost of importing goods since the fall in the value of sterling after the UK voted to leave the EU. That only adds to increased costs from the introduction of the new minimum wage for over-25s, the national living wage, as well as the new apprenticeship levy, which comes into force in April. This year\u2019s increase in business rates will have affected Waitrose more than many of its rivals as it particularly affected businesses in the south where the chain is mostly based. The company says its new management structure in stores will improve service by ensuring the right number of staff are working during busy times. 5. Increased competition Its not just the rise of Aldi and Lidl that has affected Waitrose. One of its biggest rivals, Marks &amp; Spencer, has also been expanding fast in recent years, opening hundreds of its Simply Food convenience stores. Those who want to treat themselves or are concerned about ethical eating also have a range of other options from organic vegetable boxes to the mainstream supermarkets\u2019 premium ranges.",

Overexpansion</strong></h2> <p>Staines, Leek, Cardiff \u2013 these are not typical Waitrose heartlands and have not attracted the number of shoppers needed to become profitable. Rising costs and fears that shoppers will rein in their spending once Brexit-fuelled inflation kicks in only make such adventures less attractive.</p> <p>Shoppers are also moving away from a big weekly shop towards picking up what they need locally so sales in big supermarkets are generally in decline. Waitrose is still opening stores this year, but they will mostly be its Little Waitrose convenience outlets \u2013 a section of the market that is still growing. </p> <p>Most of the closures are supermarkets. When Dave Lewis took charge of Tesco in 2014, one of his first big decisions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/28/tesco-names-43-stores-to-close\">was to close 43 unprofitable stores </a>and abandon plans to build another 49 around the country.</p> <h2>2. Prices</h2> <p>The rise in popularity of discounters Aldi and Lidl has forced the entire grocery market to rethink prices and Waitrose has not been immune. Even its mainly middle-class shoppers are happy to pick up a bargain in one of the German discounters \u2013 whether it\u2019s champagne or toilet roll \u2013 and that has eaten away at Waitrose\u2019s market. </p> <p>In an attempt to maintain its competitive edge, Waitrose pledges to price-match Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, on thousands of branded lines. As Tesco has brought down prices, Waitrose has been forced to follow, contributing to a 1% fall in sales at established stores in the half-year to July. </p> <p>Other initiatives including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/05/waitrose-to-expand-essential-range\">introduction of a basics range during the financial crisis in 2009</a> and a 20% discount for loyalty card holders on 10 items they regularly buy will also have squeezed profit margins. Analysts wonder how long it will be able to keep offering them a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/28/waitrose-scraps-free-tea-and-coffee-in-cafes\">free coffee</a> when they pop in to do their shopping.</p> <h2>3. Online</h2> <p>Waitrose\u2019s more wealthy London-based shoppers have been keen adopters of online retail. Internet grocery sales rose 4.3% in the six months to July as sales in established stores fell. Picking and packing your customers\u2019 groceries is an expensive business. While Waitrose shoppers spend more than those at other chains and is profitable, it makes considerably less money online than it does in stores. The struggle to make the economics of the online grocery business stack up is illustrated by<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/03/ocado-first-annual-profit-waitrose-morrisons\"> Ocado, which took 15 years to turn a profit</a>.</p> <h2>4. Rising costs</h2> <p>Last month Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of Waitrose\u2019s parent group, the John Lewis Partnership, warned that retailers would have to absorb a big chunk of the rise in the cost of importing goods since the fall in the value of sterling after the UK voted to leave the EU. </p> <p>That only adds to increased costs from the introduction of the new minimum wage for over-25s, the national living wage, as well as the new apprenticeship levy, which comes into force in April. This year\u2019s increase in business rates will have affected Waitrose more than many of its rivals as it particularly affected businesses in the south where the chain is mostly based. The company says its new management structure in stores will improve service by ensuring the right number of staff are working during busy times.</p> <h2>5. Increased competition</h2> <p>Its not just the rise of Aldi and Lidl that has affected Waitrose. One of its biggest rivals, Marks &amp; Spencer, has also been expanding fast in recent years, opening hundreds of its Simply Food convenience stores. </p> <p>Those who want to treat themselves or are concerned about ethical eating also have a range of other options from organic vegetable boxes to the mainstream supermarkets\u2019 premium ranges.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A buoyant oil price and comments from President Trump about imminent tax announcements have helped outweigh the continuing political worries surrounding forthcoming French, Dutch and German elections, and the reappearance of the Greek crisis in the headlines. So with some help from an opening rise on Wall Street, European markets ended the day in positive territory. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The bounce in markets today reminds us that it is never wise to underestimate the strength of a bull market. It is also yet another incidence of that old adage, \u2018never short a quiet market\u2019. European markets have exploded into life, helped along by rosy results from Total and SocGen. With gold out of favour and dollar yen testing the waters above Y113 again, it could be that we are on the cusp of a fresh recovery in risk assets, just a day after the market seemed poised to fall heavily. A fresh all-time high in the S&amp;P5 00 could be taken as proof that the rally is back on, but with a weekend looming traders may find it difficult to muster up much enthusiasm. Particular signs of strength are seen in US energy stocks, with the sector ETF up 1.1% today and 3% off the lows of the week. A turn in risk appetite needs the support of key sectors like this to be sustainable. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 40.68 points or 0.57% at 7229.50 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.86% to 11,642.86 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.25% to 4826.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.94% to 18,947.44 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.17% at 9438.4 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.34% to 608.79 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 121 points or 0.6% higher, around 20 points off the new all time high it reached earlier in the day. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. When it raised US interest rates in December the Federal Reserve suggested there could be three increases in 2017. But St Louis Fed president James Bullard \u2013 although a non-voting member at present \u2013 seems to disagree: Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new record high of 20,157. The US markets have been buoyed by a rise in oil prices, and comments on a forthcoming \u201cphenomenal\u201d tax announcement and rolling back regulations from President Trump. And Greece again, as IMF spokesman Gerry Rice says the fund is not asking for more austerity for the country: And: Rice has also defended the IMF after the comments earlier from European bailout boss Klaus Regling: Comments from President Trump that he will make an announcement about taxes in two to three weeks and continue to roll back regulations have given more support to the US stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up 0.32%. Back with Greece and Klaus Regling, the managing director of bailout fund the European Stability Mechanism, has taken issue with the gloomy prognosis for the country given by the IMF. Writing in the Financial Times (\u00a3) he says: For many, Greece remains synonymous with bad news. Few were surprised, therefore, when the International Monetary Fund recently stated that the country\u2019s debt was on an alarming trajectory. A sober look at the facts shows that Greece\u2019s debt situation does not have to be cause for alarm. The European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u2019s rescue funds, have disbursed \u20ac174bn to Greece. We would not have lent this amount if we did not think we would get our money back... The solution for Greece lies not in additional debt relief, but in the government implementing reforms so as to avoid delays in the issuing of the next tranche of the ESM loan. Investors understand the ESM framework and recognise the commitments of Greece\u2019s European partners. Past experience shows that making loans in exchange for reforms works. It is no coincidence that Ireland and Spain today have some of the highest growth rates in Europe and very low funding costs after successfully completing rescue loan programmes with demanding reforms. In 2016, even Greece outperformed expectations, with a higher than anticipated growth rate and a primary surplus. Further delays could put this positive trend at risk. Over in the US and Wall Street is on the rise again, boosted by higher oil prices after Wednesday\u2019s surprise fall in gasoline inventories. The Dow Jones has added 0.22% or 45 points while the Nasdaq Composite has hit a new record high, up 0.27% at 5,698. The S&amp;P 500 has added 0.21% and is just a point below its peak of 2,300 hit at the end of January. An early chance to get the latest views of the new deputy governor of the Bank of England Charlotte Hogg comes courtesy of the University of Lincoln: She will be at the university on 6 March, just days after her new appointment takes effect. They probably need to send an updated tweet, though. As the chancellor announced the appointment of one female to a senior role at Threadneedle Street, the Bank revealed another was leaving. Kristin Forbes, an external member of the rate-setting monetary policy committee, will leave the Bank on 30 June after a three-year term. Forbes will return to her role as professor of management and global economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this autumn. She was considered to be one of the most hawkish members of the MPC - in favour of tighter monetary policy - and voted against the decision of the majority of her colleagues to extend quantitative easing in August. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, thanked Forbes for her contributions on the MPC: She has brought insight, fresh thinking and academic rigour to our deliberations, as well as a fresh and engaging approach to communications. On behalf of colleagues at the Bank, I would like to wish her well as she returns to pursue her academic career at MIT on a full time basis. Forbes said: It has been an honour and a privilege to serve on the Monetary Policy Committee during these historic years. I will miss the insightful \u2013 and often intense \u2013 debates with my colleagues on the MPC, as well as the superb analysis and support of the staff. I would like to thank the Treasury and Bank of England for welcoming someone from \u2018across the pond\u2019 for this important role, as well as MIT for restructuring my responsibilities to them so that I could prioritize this role in the United Kingdom over my term. Want to know more about Charlotte Hogg, the Bank of England\u2019s new deputy governor (from March)? Fortunately my colleague Rupert Neate profiled her back in 2013. In brief: Name Charlotte Hogg Born London 26 August 1970 Education St Mary\u2019s Roman Catholic boarding school, Ascot. Studied economics and history at Hertford College, Oxford. Won a Kennedy scholarship to Harvard. Parents Douglas and Sarah Hogg. Both had leading roles in Sir John Major\u2019s government. Career to date Joined the Bank of England as a graduate trainee. Became principal at management consultant McKinsey. Managing director, Morgan Stanley. Managing director, Experian UK and Ireland. Head of retail operations, Santander. Starts as chief operating officer at the Bank of England next month, effectively No 2 to the new governor, Mark Carney. High point Winning the Aston-le-Walls horse trials on On a Par in 2010; securing the acquisition of the Goldfish credit card for Morgan Stanley in 2006. What she says \u201cYou can have too much of a good thing in one family\u201d (about not going into politics or law). What they say \u201cIt was clearly a life of intense privilege. You could not image two better-connected people than her parents. They are the ultimate power couple\u201d \u2013 family friend \u201cShe is clearly an incredibly capable and intelligent woman, so this appointment is just deserts\u201d \u2013 Dr Ruth Sealy, Cranfield School of Management Read the full profile here: Breaking: The Treasury has just announced that Charlotte Hogg will succeed Minouche Shafik as deputy governor of the Bank of England for markets and banking. Hogg is currently the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer. She will start the new role on 1 March for a renewable term of five years. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: I\u2019m delighted to appoint Charlotte Hogg as the next Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. I\u2019m confident that her exceptional leadership skills and wide-ranging experience make her the right person to take on the position. Charlotte has done an excellent job as the Bank\u2019s first chief operating officer. She will take over this new role at a key time for the City. I would like to thank Minouche Shafik for all her valuable work at the Bank, particularly on fair and effective markets. I wish her the best as she moves into her new role as Director of the London School of Economics. On the jobless claims, Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Donald Trump continues to place jobs at the heart of his successful run at the presidency, and he will breathe a sigh of relief at today\u2019s downtick in initial jobless claims which are the lowest since November 2016. Readings of sub-300,000 tend to indicate a healthy labour market, and we are currently enjoying an almost two-year stretch below that watershed - the longest since 1970. However, these figures only tell part of the story, and while unemployment may be at historic lows, the challenge facing Trump now is to deliver substantive wage growth. Over in the US, and the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits showed a surprise decrease last week. Jobless claims fell by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000, compared to expectations of a rise to around 249,000. This is close to the 43-year low of 233,000 reached early last November. Claims have remained below 300,000 for 101 straight weeks, the best run since 1970. Meanwhile Greece\u2019s labour minister Efi Achtsioglou has called the International Monetary Fund\u2019s stance on the country\u2019s bailout as \u201cproblematic\u201d and its demands \u201cunreasonable\u201d, the Kathimerini newspaper is reporting: Speaking after a visit to the Labor Inspection Corps in Alexandroulpoli, northern Greece, the minister who holds of the country\u2019s stickiest portfolios said the IMF\u2019s demand for the upfront legislation of measures to be passed if Greece fails to hit targets at the end of the bailout program is \u201ceconomically unreasonable.\u201d The government\u2019s aim, she said, is to wrap up the pending bailout review as soon as possible so that Greece can join the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing (QE) program and \u201cconsolidate the trend of improvement seen in the Greek economy this past year.\u201d \u201cFor our part, we have already implemented nearly 80 percent of the prior actions. Only labor reform is still pending precisely because of this disagreement,\u201d Achtsioglou said. Her priority, she said, \u201cis to put a brake on the autocratic practices of employers, which have intensified recently, mainly as a result of the disintegration of the institutional framework of labor relations in the 2010-2014 period.\u201d The minister reiterated the government\u2019s aim to reintroduce collective labor bargaining \u2013 something the country\u2019s creditors are staunchly opposed to \u2013 arguing that this would \u201cprovide workers with a safety net and create the conditions for healthy competition between businesses.\u201d More now from Greece, where farmers are stepping up protests over unpopular creditor-mandated austerity measures including higher taxes. In a move that will put the Greek government under further pressure to bow to their demands, farmers and stockbreeders escalated their protests today blockading the customs post at Kristallopygi on the country\u2019s border with Albania. Describing the move as symbolic, Dimitris Moskos who sits on the committee representing farmers in the region, said the blockade would last 24 hours. At least 250 stockbreeders and farmers \u2013 many on tractors \u2013 were participating in the rally. Launching nationwide protests two weeks ago, farmers vowed \u201cto go all the way\u201d in what some are calling an increasingly desperate attempt to lower tax rates, fuel prices and social security contributions. Theodoros Papaconstantinou, also representing farmers in northern Greece, said: There is no other way. People need to fight for their rights, for their social security and for decent prices for their agricultural products if they want to survive. Tax rates for the sector are being doubled from 13% to 26% while pensions are being cuts by as much as 60% by 2022. Farmers, who last week took similar action at the Greek-Macedonian border, have vowed to take their protests to Athens next, descending on the capital on Tuesday \u2013 Valentine\u2019s Day. It follows protests in Athens on Wednesday by Greek firefighters, who say a third of jobs are at risk because of hiring restrictions placed on the public sector by the terms of Greece\u2019s international bailout. Here is our full story on Twitter\u2019s results: Thomas Cook has caved in to shareholder pressure and reduced the maximum payout under a long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, after a third of investors voted against the controversial plan. Provisional results from the annual meeting showed just under 33% of the travel company\u2019s shareholders opposed its plan to pay its boss Peter Fankhauser a bonus of up to 225% of base salary, worth about \u00a31.6m a year. The firm has cut the maximum award to 165%, and said shareholders would be consulted before any payout. The share price has fallen almost 8% in the past year as Thomas Cook, along with the rest of the travel industry, was hit by a spate of terror attacks in Turkey and elsewhere in Europe. One retail investor spoke out against the \u201chuge bonus\u201d at the AGM in London. Addressing the board, Sunil Kumar Pal, who has held Thomas Cook shares for about 15 years, said: \u201cOn the one hand you say business is not going well and on the other hand you give such a huge bonus...at more than twice salary. You should review this policy.\u201d But another retail investor leapt to the company\u2019s defence, thanking the management for the job it had done. At last year\u2019s AGM, Thomas Cook also suffered a shareholder revolt over executive pay with a quarter of investors voting against, and cut Fankhauser\u2019s pay package to \u00a31.2m from \u00a34.3m. Twitter shares have fallen 10% to $16.81 after the social media site reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth since going public. Revenue rose just 1% to $717.2m, missing analysts\u2019 expectations of $740.1m. Jack Dorsey, chief executive: While revenue growth conti nues to lag audience growth we are applying the same focused approach that drove audience growth to our revenue product portfolio. This will take time, but we\u2019re moving fast to show results. Full story soon. Market update: shares in Greece are down, but major markets elsewhere in Europe are up. Greece\u2019s ATG: -0.5% at 608 FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,208 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.7% at 11,622 France\u2019s CAC: +0.8% at 4,807 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.1% at 18,782 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.6% at 9,385 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 366 Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says US markets are likely to be similarly subdued: Looking ahead to the US open and Thursday\u2019s dreary trading is set to continue, with the Dow Jones promising a meagre 0.1% increase after the bell. That keeps the Dow below 20,100, with only the jobless claims to spark any excitement as the afternoon gets underway. Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister and nemesis of Sch\u00e4uble, has given his latest view on the funding crisis engulfing his country. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said everyday life in Greece was unsustainable, with the country\u2019s European creditors going after \u201cthe little people\u201d, rather than corrupt oligarchs. The country has been put on a fiscal path which makes our everyday life unsustainable in Greece. The German finance minister agrees that no Greek government, however reformist it might be, can sustain the current debt obligations of Greece. A country in desperate need of reform has been made unreformable by unsustainable macroeconomic policies. Instead of attacking the worst cases of corruption, for six years now the creditors have been after the little people, the small pharmacists, the very poor pensioners instead of going for the oligarchies. We must come to terms with reality. The tragedy is that in 2010 a bankrupt country was given a huge loan, not to save it but in order to cynically transfer huge banking losses from the books of the Franco German banks onto the shoulders of the weakest taxpayers in Europe. It\u2019s like giving a credit card to a bankrupt entity in order to keep paying its debt, and then giving it another credit card and another. As long as you do that, Greece is unreformable and that is an indictment on the whole functioning of the eurozone Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s tough-talking finance minister, says Greece must leave the eurozone if it wants a debt cut. He told German broadcaster ARD that debt forgiveness would be in violation of European rules. We can\u2019t undertake a debt haircut for a member of the European single currency, it\u2019s ruled out by the Lisbon Treaty. For that, Greece would have to exit the currency area. The pressure on Greece to undertake reforms must be maintained so that it becomes competitive, otherwise they can\u2019t remain. The prestigious AAA credit rating is getting increasingly difficult to come by, according to Fitch. The ratings agency said it has just 11 countries on the top tier rating, compared with a record high of 16 during the period between 2004 and 2009. The financial crisis is to blame, of course. Fitch said all its triple A sovereigns had a stable outlook, suggesting there would be no downgrades over the next 12 to 24 months. The 11 countries which still make the grade: Australia Canada Denmark Germany Luxembourg Netherlands Norway Singapore Sweden Switzerland US James McCormack, global head of sovereign ratings at Fitch: This is less than 10% of Fitch\u2019s global sovereign portfolio, the smallest ever share for the rating category, and consistent with \u2018AAA\u2019 sovereigns now accounting for 40% of global government debt at end-2016, down from 48% a decade ago. Japan was the first sovereign to be stripped of its AAA rating by Fitch in 1998, followed by another six in the aftermath of the global financial crisis over the seven years since 2009: Austria Finland France Ireland Spain UK The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith says progress is essential at today\u2019s Eurogroup Working Group* meeting, if a deal is to to struck on 20 February when the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers next meet. She reports from Athens: Greek officials are calling the Euro Working Group - scheduled for this afternoon - crucial. As the latest Greek crisis plays out, today\u2019s meeting has assumed a significance that few might have expected, even if some officials are saying a solution to breaking the deadlock of stalled negotiations can now only be found at a political level. \u201cWhat we are expecting today,\u201d said one government source, \u201cis for all the sides to open their cards to see if they really want an agreement or are still stuck to their positions.\u201d The Greek government had shown it wanted to break the impasse but only \u201cso far as it can go.\u201d European officials this morning were citied in the Greek media as saying almost no progress had been made since the last Eurogroup in January. Greece\u2019s refusal to legislate fiscal measures up front - measures that would take effect when the country\u2019s current bailout expires in 2018 - and the ongoing rift between creditor institutions over what exactly Athens should do were also cited as the greatest impediments to finding a solution. If today\u2019s EWG session fails to break the deadlock it is almost certain that auditors will be unable to return to continue the review next week which in turn will limit the prospects of any deal on 20 February when euro area finance ministers next meet. *The Eurogroup Working Group is composed of representatives from eurozone countries who assist the Eurogroup (finance ministers) and its president (Jeroen Dijsselbloem) in preparing for ministers\u2019 discussions. They meet once a month, ahead of Eurogroup meetings. Greece would be better off outside the eurozone where its debts could be written off, according to a leading German politician. Christian Lindner, leader of Germany\u2019s Free Democratic Party, told the German radio station, Deutschlandfunk: It\u2019s clear that Greece needs to have its debts written off. Greece\u2019s debts can only be written off outside of the eurozone, so we\u2019re talking about Grexit. Greece\u2019s European creditors have so far refused to offer Greece debt relief, despite calls for them to do by the International Monetary Fund. It\u2019s not all about political uncertainty and market fears, sometimes it\u2019s about bees and honey... In the first UK trial of its kind, Tesco will ship discarded sugar from split bags in stores in Devon and Cornwall to a beekeepers\u2019 group. The sugar will be used to make a solution to feed Britain\u2019s bees, struggling to get enough nectar to feed themselves. Nick Bentham-Green, chairman of the Bee Improvement Programme for Cornwall said: Recent poor summers have contributed to bees struggling to get enough stores into the hives to feed their colony throughout the winter. This new scheme is a great help, especially at this time of year, and is helping towards the conservation of the native British honey bee. Full story here: Ahead of Thomas Cook\u2019s annual meeting in London at 10.30am, a shareholder group, Institutional Shareholder Services, has questioned the firm\u2019s plans to pay Fankhauser a bonus of up to 225% of his base salary, amounting to up to \u00a31.6m a year. The \u201cstrategic share incentive plan\u201d would pay out in five years\u2019 time at the earliest and depends on several sets of performance targets. The vote on this bonus plan will be binding. While the company does not expect to lose it, it could well get a bloody nose. We\u2019ve been here before. Last year, a quarter of shareholders voted against the group\u2019s remuneration plans - so Thomas Cook cut the share award to Fankhauser to 165% of base salary, from a planned 200%. It is worth noting that the standard share award at the company is 150% of base salary, but it has\u2019t paid out in recent years because the firm\u2019s performance hasn\u2019t been great. The fall in Thomas Cook\u2019s share price (now down 9.7%) is the biggest one-day drop since late June in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was a challenging time: Times are tough in the European travel industry and Thomas Cook isn\u2019t having the best of it, though the good news is things don\u2019t seem to be getting any worse. Like-for-like revenues and losses were broadly flat on last year, which probably represents a small victory against such a competitive backdrop. However there is little in its latest trading figures to suggest Thomas Cook is going to stave off a shareholder rebellion over its executive remuneration package, which looks to be brewing. Greece will take some comfort from Thomas Cook\u2019s comments this morning that bookings for holidays in the country are up more than 40%. The travel company\u2019s chief executive Peter Fankhauser said it had expanded its holiday offering to Greece and smaller destinations such as Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria and Portugal, which are also seeing double-digit growth. He said: \u201cWe are catering for 500,000 more guests this year in Greece. We have more beds, more own-brand hotels, and 2 more flights going to Greece from the UK.\u201d Thomas Cook is shifting some capacity from Spain to Greece and will secure more beds in Greece if demand continues to rise, he added. However, the company\u2019s shares dropped 9%, even though it insisted it had a \u201csolid start\u201d to the year, as investors worried about the impact of terror attacks on travel to Turkey. Like-for-like revenues in the three months to December edged up 1% to \u00a31.6bn. Operating losses improved to \u00a349m from \u00a350m a year earlier. Shares in Thomas Cook are down 9% this morning after the travel company published results for its first quarter. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said it was a \u201csolid\u201d performance for the first three months \u201cagainst at backdrop of continued uncertainty.\u201d He added: We remain cautious about the rest of the year, given the uncertain political and economic outlook. It\u2019s still relatively early in the selling cycle for summer holidays, but based on current trading, and supported by further financial benefits from implementing our strategy, we expect our full year operating results to be in line with current market expectations. One of the most striking points was that bookings to Greece have jumped 40% compared with the same period last year. Thomas Cook is laying on more holidays to the country, as UK tourists stay away from Turkey and Egypt over safety concerns. The company is also facing a potential pay revolt when shareholders vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting later today. We will bring you updates. The FTSE 100 is slightly higher in early trading, up 13 points or 0.2% at 7,201. After another closing high on Wednesday, the FTSE 250 is also up 0.2% at 18,635. Major markets across Europe are also higher: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 11,596 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 4,798 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.1% at 18,786 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 9,360 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 365 Political uncertainty has also kept equity investors guessing. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says that trying to work out which way markets are heading is like \u201cwading through treacle\u201d: Equity markets in Europe have continued to chop in and out of positive territory for most of the past few days, as rising political uncertainty serves to keep investors in limbo, though the FTSE 250 has continued to outperform, closing at another record high yesterday. So far this year equity markets across Europe for all the ups and downs seen in the last few weeks aren\u2019t too far from where they started the year, as investors try to look through the fog of politics in France, Germany, the Netherlands, as well as the banking issues in Italy and the possibility of new elections there, as well as the perennial problem child of Greece. Is it any wonder that trying to find any sort of market direction is like wading through treacle? US markets finished the day rather more mixed but only marginally below their record highs. US investors appear reluctant to throw in the towel on the Trump reflation trade quite yet, but there are signs of doubt as to whether it will actually arrive, so distracted does the new President appear to be with taking on his opponents. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Political tensions in Europe and the US are fuelling investor caution, with gold prices at three-month highs as demand for the safe have asset rises. US gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,241.30 an ounce, while spot gold hovers around $1,240 an ounce. Investors are concerned by the wave of elections coming up in Europe, not least in France where the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen - who is promising a referendum on EU memberhip - has gained strong support. In the US, uncertainty reigns over President\u2019s Trump\u2019s policies. Barnabas Gan, analyst at OCBC Bank, says gold prices are likely to rise further over the next few weeks: Gold prices will be a little bit rangebound with some upside bias for the next few weeks or so. The risk factors have not really changed so far - we\u2019re talking about Donald Trump, we\u2019re talking about the political situation in Europe and because of all these factors, we do expect market watchers to stay cautious in the months ahead to gauge how the global economy is going to perform.",

So with some help from an opening rise on Wall Street, European markets ended the day in positive territory. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The bounce in markets today reminds us that it is never wise to underestimate the strength of a bull market. It is also yet another incidence of that old adage, \u2018never short a quiet market\u2019. European markets have exploded into life, helped along by rosy results from Total and SocGen. With gold out of favour and dollar yen testing the waters above Y113 again, it could be that we are on the cusp of a fresh recovery in risk assets, just a day after the market seemed poised to fall heavily. A fresh all-time high in the S&amp;P5 00 could be taken as proof that the rally is back on, but with a weekend looming traders may find it difficult to muster up much enthusiasm. Particular signs of strength are seen in US energy stocks, with the sector ETF up 1.1% today and 3% off the lows of the week. A turn in risk appetite needs the support of key sectors like this to be sustainable.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 40.68 points or 0.57% at 7229.50</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.86% to 11,642.86</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.25% to 4826.24</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.94% to 18,947.44</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.17% at 9438.4</strong></li> <li><strong>But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.34% to 608.79</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 121 points or 0.6% higher, around 20 points off the new all time high it reached earlier in the day.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

      "bodyText": "Mark Holyoake, the businessman claiming \u00a3132m in damages from the property tycoons Christian and Nicholas Candy, has been accused of \u201cdishonesty and fraud\u201d at London\u2019s high court. The legal battle began in earnest this week after a year of pre-trial clashes. Lawyers hired by Holyoake have delved into the Candys\u2019 financial affairs, leading to accusations in court of tax evasion. The billionaire brothers, whose luxury developments have attracted oligarchs and Gulf royalty, deny the claims. In return, their advisers have raked over the collapse of Holyoake\u2019s fish import business, British Seafood. Setting out the case for the defence on Thursday, Tim Lord QC said Holyoake had given the Candys a misleading account of how much he was worth in order to borrow \u00a312m from them to develop luxury flats. Holyoake alleges he was then intimated, blackmailed and pressured into paying back \u00a337m and forgoing profits on his building project, a period mansion block in London\u2019s Grosvenor Gardens, by selling the property before it had been refurbished. Setting out what he called \u201cthe true version of events\u201d, Lord said they entailed \u201cserial dishonesty and fraud on the part of Mr Holyoake and his associates\u201d. Emails were read out in court which allegedly showed Holyoake\u2019s financial advisers complaining of \u201cconstant lying\u201d to investors, and raising concerns about \u201cthe fraud we have committed\u201d. Lord said: \u201cMr Holyoake is a man capable of saying different things to different people dependent on whether he is trying to borrow money from them or pay it back.\u201d Watching proceedings from the public gallery were two investors still owed money following the collapse of British Seafood, which collapsed in 2010 with debts of \u00a3250m. The Serious Fraud Office closed an investigation three years ago without pressing charges. The defence have uncovered documents which they claim show Holyoake told the investment firm 3i, one of the British Seafood creditors, that he had net assets of \u00a315m in December 2010. Less than a year later, a declaration of assets given to Christian Candy\u2019s Guernsey-based CPC group, as part of the loan contract, put Holyoake\u2019s worth at the much larger figure of \u00a3120m. This later declaration did not, the defence claimed, take account of money promised to 3i. \u201cThat was a dishonest thing to do and it amounted to serious fraud on CPC,\u201d said Lord. Holyoake denies the claims. The court was shown a series of emails between Holyoake and his advisers William Pym and William Lovering, partners in a firm which helped to raise money for the Grosvenor project. One message, referring to communications with architects about the date of a transfer of funds, says lying \u201cseemed to be the norm now\u201d. In another, Lovering confesses that his \u201cmoral compass is stretched beyond anywhere I can comprehend\u201d. In October 2013, allegedly responding to instructions from Holyoake to hoodwink a potential funder, the men complain that they \u201cjust struggle with the constant lying\u201d, and that they are \u201cworried about the fraud we have committed\u201d.

    "webTitle": "Thomas Cook cuts boss's payout after shareholders revolt", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook has responded to shareholder pressure and reduced the maximum payout for its chief executive under a new long-term bonus plan, after a third of investors voted against it. In the biggest revolt, 32.7% of the travel company\u2019s shareholders opposed its plan to pay Peter Fankhauser a long-term bonus of up to 225% of his base salary of \u00a3703,000, worth about \u00a31.6m a year. In response, Thomas Cook reduced the maximum potential payout to 200% under the strategic share incentive plan (SSIP), but said it would not use it this year. If used, it would replace the current long-term bonus scheme, the performance share plan (PSP), which can in exceptional circumstances pay out 200%. This year, under the PSP, Fankhauser has been awarded a long-term bonus of 165% of his base salary, which would pay out in three years\u2019 time if the company\u2019s targets are achieved. In another concession, the company said it would consult major shareholders before the SSIP is used, and on its performance targets. Nearly 22% of shareholders also voted against the group\u2019s future remuneration policy and 22.5% opposed the remuneration report. Companies have come under fresh pressure over executive pay in recent months. Earlier this week, the Church of England, a major institutional investor, said it had written to the 350 biggest companies on the stock market, warning them it would block excessive boardroom pay deals. And last month the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, warned UK companies they must match boardroom pay rises with those of workers. Thomas Cook\u2019s share price has fallen sharply over the past year as the firm, along with the rest of the travel industry, reels from the fallout from terror attacks in Turkey and elsewhere in Europe. The share price has been falling since 12 January 2016 when it was 121.7p, to 85p today, down 7.5% on the day. Standard Life, the second-biggest shareholder with 13% of the shares, voted against several remuneration resolutions, including the re-election of the remuneration committee chairman and its members. \u201cWe disagreed with the introduction of a potential payment to executives above the remuneration policy\u2019s normal upper limit. In addition, we opposed the introduction of new elements to the remuneration plan as we strongly believe these should be dealt with in the existing policy,\u201d it said. One small shareholder spoke out against the planned \u201chuge bonus\u201d at the firm\u2019s annual meeting in London. Sunil Kumar Pal, who has held Thomas Cook shares for 15 years, told the board: \u201cOn the one hand you say business is not going well and on the other hand you give such a huge bonus ... at more than twice salary. You should review this policy.\u201d Thomas Cook\u2019s chairman, Frank Meysman, defended the company\u2019s performance, saying the share price was 16p when he joined six years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way since then.\u201d Talking with Pal after the AGM, Meysman noted that Fankhauser\u2019s pay had been cut sharply last year: \u201cPeter got 30% of what he could have gotten. In the long-term plan he got nothing.\u201d At last year\u2019s AGM, Thomas Cook also suffered a shareholder revolt over executive pay, with a quarter of investors voting against the remuneration report. Fankhauser\u2019s pay package fell to \u00a31.2m last year from \u00a34.3m the previous year, as he received only a third of his potential bonus because targets were not met, and nothing from the long-term incentive plan. The travel operator said on Thursday that it had raised the price of its summer package holidays by 9% and shifted deals away from Spain, where hotel costs have soared. Holiday bookings to Greece have surged 40% while Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria and Portugal have also experienced double-digit growth.",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street is making some big bets on Donald Trump. One of the biggest is that the US president can persuade Congress to unravel the Dodd-Frank Act that he believes ties the financial services industry in knots. Bank shares have carried the US stock market higher ever since Trump said it was a priority. Another big bet is on a Trump-inspired spending spree by Congress on all manner of infrastructure projects, including the Mexican wall and on the military. This bet gets a steroid boost when traders add in the impact of huge tax cuts, albeit for the richest, trade tariffs on imports (protecting smaller US firms from competition) and a supposedly benign form of blackmail targeting major corporations that consider opening factories abroad (forcing them to locate inside the US). All these initiatives add up to the greatest economic stimulus since Ronald Reagan blew the US federal budget in the early 1980s and sent the stock market into the stratosphere. With what appears to be devil-may-care abandon, investors have moved their savings out of cash and into risky assets on a huge scale. The Dow Jones index of stocks soared above 20,000 a few weeks ago (it was worth 15,660 this time last year). In tandem, investors have expanded their lending to the corporate sector to embrace some of the riskiest businesses. These are companies that are usually forced to borrow money at sky-high interest rates after analysts have looked them up and down and agreed that they are at the greatest risk of going bust. It means the bonds they issue to investors fall well below the AAA ratings given to the safest businesses. Charmingly, they are accorded junk status and their bonds are rated CCC or less. But in the middle of a Trumpian boom, who cares about ratings? Nothing and nobody is going to go bust. There will be employment for everyone and, if there isn\u2019t, the deregulated banks will lend struggling households and businesses some more money. Figures this week show borrowings by CCC-rated companies have increased by two-thirds in the past year. There will be many on Wall Street who say: what could be better than even the most conservative investors entering the $2.2tn (\u00a31.75tn) junk bond market? Except we know that when this happens, it is a house of cards that will collapse with horrible consequences for all. To emphasise the point, there are even early signs of junk-rated businesses using cheap lending facilities to borrow more money and use it to enrich their private equity owners, a move that evokes the worst behaviour before the 2008 crash. Thankfully, the betting must be that only a few investors get hurt in the stampede, the reason being that Congress simply will not allow Trump to pursue his crazy spending plans and mania for deregulation. Trump needs to win over eight Democrats in the Senate to push through his controversial agenda and that looks increasingly unlikely as he goes about his daily routine of upsetting even moderate Republicans with his attacks on the judiciary and anyone else who stands in his way. And while he can probably secure a majority for some extra military spending and a little extra infrastructure, these things take years to result in more ships and new motorway building. So we must hope that investors rein in their search for yield and take a more sober view of the bonanza they believe lies on the horizon. It is a mirage. Greek blame game As protesters take to the streets of Athens, the blame game among those who have imposed debilitating austerity on Greece is hotting up. The International Monetary Fund aimed the first punch, arguing that the beleaguered nation had taken enough punishment. The IMF is reluctant to support the European Union\u2019s stance on Greece without a huge debt-relief package in place. In the opposite corner is the official who manages the Brussels credit card, Klaus Regling. He has ruled out debt relief, saying the solution for Greece lies in the government making further cuts in pensions and benefits. This untenable position, which ignores 25% unemployment and endemic corruption, was then undermined further by a simple untruth. Writing in the Financial Times, he said: \u201cThe eurozone\u2019s rescue funds have disbursed \u20ac174bn to Greece. We would not have lent this amount if we did not think we would get our money back.\u201d There is no way the Greeks will ever pay that money back. It will just hang over them forever while they struggle to pay the interest and sink further into the mire.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tom Brady is enjoying a better February than the company that sponsors him. The New England Patriots quarterback is celebrating winning a record-breaking fifth Superbowl in the US, but Under Armour is facing questions about whether its own run of success is over. Shares in the US maker of sportswear have fallen by around 30% in February after it warned that sales grew far less than expected in the final three months of 2016 and it had suffered its worst performance in seven years. The company, which also sponsors Sir Andy Murray and golfer Jordan Spieth, had previously reported 26 consecutive quarters of sales growth of more than 20%. Under Armour has benefited from an extraordinary increase in fitness-related consumption. This growth has included the arrival of a new fashion segment \u2013 athleisure, which revolves around wearing workout clothes as part of a casual wardrobe \u2013 but also a surge in spending on gyms, fitness classes, and other sporting activities. Kevin Plank, the chief executive of Under Armour, blamed the faltering performance on fierce competition and a wider slowdown in the retail market. Plank insisted that company can recover from the setback in the same way as Brady, who won the Superbowl again at the age of 39 after being written off by critics. Under Armour is a victim of its own success to some degree: sales still increased by 12% on the rising tide of fitness-related spending. There are also broader signs that Plank\u2019s optimism is well-founded, with statistics and industry experts suggesting the fitness market is still growing. The apparel and footwear market was worth $1.7tn (\u00a31.36tn) globally in 2016 according to Euromonitor. The industry grew by 4%, although this was the slowest growth since 2008. In the UK, the fitness market is estimated to be worth \u00a34.4bn after a 1.9% rise in fitness facilities and a 5.3% increase in the number of members in the year to the end of March 2016. For the first time ever more than 9 million people in the UK are members of fitness facilities, according to the the Leisure Database Company. The boss of Lululemon, the company that claims to have created athleisure, says this growth is part of a wider transformation in how people, particularly the millennial generation, live their lives. Lululemon was founded in Canada in 1998 and began by making clothes for yoga. However, it has now branched into high-performance products for running, cycling, swimming and other activities. Laurent Potdevin, chief executive of Lululemon, said setbacks for other companies did not mean the athleisure and fitness trend is over. \u201cYou see people coming to the market, some walking away from the market, and a couple of brands not doing well. So everybody is assuming that athleisure is down, when really what we are focused on is people wanting to live an active and mindful lifestyle,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trend. I think there is a transformation in how people want to live their life.\u201d Lululemon has more than 400 shops, including nine in London, and 12,000 employees. It wants to double revenue to $4bn by 2020, including growing sales outside North America and menswear sales to $1bn. The expansion of the fitness industry in the UK is not just about gyms but an increasingly diverse selection of fitness studios that are popping in London and the rest of the country. These include yoga studios but also US imports such as Barry\u2019s Bootcamp, a favourite of David Beckham that mixes running and weights in a high intensity one-hour class; and SoulCycle, which involves a full-body workout on a bike with music and motivational instructors. The fitness revolution has been linked to a decline in participation for traditional sports. Golf is suffering from dwindling membership numbers and TV ratings, forcing a rethink of how to attract people. FairWeather Golf in Camberley, Surrey, is an indoor facility equipped with state-on-the-art simulators allowing people to play golf courses around the world and track their golf swing and shots. The facility wants to attract as wider an audience as possible so it also offers games that appeal to children. The venue is the only place in the UK to find the RoboGolfPro, a \u00a3250,000 robot that teaches people how their golf swing should feel. Matt Edwards, the PGA head professional at FairWeather, said the company is now looking to expand beyond Surrey. \u201cAt the end of the day it encourages people to get involved,\u201d Edwards said of the facility. \u201cWe need to make golf cool again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The petroleum resource rent tax has failed to collect billions of dollars in revenue and the Turnbull government should reintroduce royalties for natural gas projects off north-west Australia, a resource tax expert has said. Dr Diane Kraal from Monash University has warned flaws in the PRRT regime mean Chevron\u2019s giant Gorgon gas project off WA will not pay the tax until \u201cat least 2030\u201d, despite decades of operation. She said modelling showed $5bn in revenue would be raised from Gorgon by 2030 if royalties were reintroduced. She urged the Coalition to do just that to ensure Australians were properly remunerated for the exploitation of their gas resources. She said her research indicated other natural gas projects in commonwealth waters should also be subject to commonwealth royalties, including Chevron\u2019s Wheatstone, Woodside\u2019s Pluto LNG project, and Inpex\u2019s Ichthys project. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced a formal review of the PRRT regime in November following a rapid decline in revenues from the tax. He acknowledged revenues from the PRRT had halved since 2012-13, while crude oil excise collections had fallen by more than half. When he announced his inquiry into the tax, he said he wanted it to be completed in time for this year\u2019s budget. It followed months of disquiet about the effectiveness of the tax and warnings from groups like the Tax Justice Network that Australia was set to blow another resources boom because the PRRT was failing to collect adequate revenue from the explosion in liquefied natural gas exports. Kraal has made six recommendations for reform of the tax. In her submission to the PRRT review, seen by Guardian Australia, she says the government ought to retain the PRRT legislation, but with significant modifications. She says the \u201ctransferability\u201d of exploration expenses ought to be overhauled. \u201cTransferability of exploration expenditure was negotiated for oil back in 1990, and is not working as intended today for gas,\u201d her submission says. \u201cGas projects only provide utility rates of return, not \u2018super profits\u2019 as found in oil. Transferability of exploration expenses should be modelled for a fairer outcome from community resources.\u201d She also calls for an overhaul of the \u201cgas transfer price\u201d method, which is used to price gas feedstock used in LNG processing. \u201cThere are alternatives, such as the use of the \u2018mid-stream breakeven price\u2019 method, or the \u2018Net Back\u2019 method alone, either of which would derive a fairer price,\u201d her submission says. \u201cAdvance Pricing Arrangements should be made transparent to the public, much like the Australian Tax Office \u2018sanitised\u2019 private rulings or interpretive decisions.\u201d Kraal\u2019s submission is based on new research which she presented at the Australasian tax conference in New Zealand mid-January. She says the research is significant for its unique review of Australia\u2019s petroleum taxation from the 1980s to the rise in the 2000s of natural gas projects for LNG export. According to the ATO, revenue from the PRRT plummeted by 32% in 2014-15, a decline of $576m, despite significant growth in export production. Last year, the Australian National Audit Office released a damning report revealing \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d with the way in which royalties were levied on offshore petroleum operations from the North West Shelf (NWS) off Western Australia. It found oil and gas companies operating in Australia may have wrongly claimed billions of dollars in tax deductions in recent years, leaving governments underpaid millions in royalties. In September, a letter cosigned by 21 union and left-leaning organisations, including the Australian Council of Social Service, the ACTU, Greenpeace, the Australia Institute, ActionAid, GetUp and the Uniting church, was sent to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Morrison calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the PRRT.",

      "bodyText": "UK rents are expected to rise faster than house prices over the next five years, bringing further misery to Britain\u2019s growing army of renters, according to a survey. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has predicted that rents will increase by just over 25% in the coming years, while property values are set to grow by less than 20%. In the three months to January, tenant demand for rental properties continued to go up. With landlords expected to scale back their portfolios in the next 12 months, tenants will have fewer properties to choose from, which is likely to push rents higher, the survey suggests. Rics said there was a lack of new listings coming on to the lettings market for the fourth quarter in a row and its members expect this to worsen. The past few months have seen a number of buy-to-let investors sell up, including Britain\u2019s biggest landlord, Fergus Wilson and his wife, Judith, who declared that the days of small buy-to-let landlords were numbered after the stamp duty increase last year and other tax changes, along with tougher mortgage rules. The Rics survey was conducted before the release of the government\u2019s housing white paper on Tuesday, which promised encouragement for private developers to build large-volume rental flats for tenants, and more long-term \u201cfamily friendly\u201d tenancies. Campaign group Generation Rent criticised the fact that these were limited to new purpose-built private rented homes and said renters on stagnant wages needed homes costing no more than one-third of their income. But Jeremy Blackburn, the head of UK policy at Rics, said ministers had listened to the organisation and stressed that the fledgling build-to-rent sector needed a \u201cturbo-boost\u201d. \u201cAt the same time, we need to stop punitive measures against our bedrock small landlords. The detail on the ban on letting agent fees is yet to come, and along with any overt forcing of longer tenancies, [it] could dampen investment in buy to let overall. The government must be careful about signalling both stop and go at the same time,\u201d he said. According to the Rics survey, a net balance of 25% of surveyors reported rising house prices in January. Property values are expected to continue their upward trend across the UK over the next 12 months, except in London, where they are expected to fall further. North-west and south-west England and northern Ireland are seeing strong growth. Supply and demand are stagnant. Rics said the number of properties for sale across the country remained close to historic lows, while a net balance of 5% of surveyors reported an increase in demand from homebuyers, the lowest reading since last August. Brian Murphy, the head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said rent increases in many areas over coming months were \u201cpotentially a good outcome for landlords who are staying in the buy-to-let game, but not so great for tenants in the private rented sector\u201d.",
