      "bodyText": "Shares in housebuilder Berkeley Group hit to a record high after it raised its dividend payout to shareholders, handing chairman Tony Pidgley a windfall of nearly \u00a3100m by 2021. The company, which specialises in upmarket homes in the south-east and London, raised its already generous 10-year dividend payback to \u00a316.34 a share from \u00a313. This boosted the value of the programme, which was first announced in 2011, by \u00a3500m to \u00a32.2bn. It means that Pidgley, who owns a 4.5% stake in the housebuilder, will get a \u00a398m dividend payout by 2021, a \u00a320m increase. Managing director Rob Perrins is in line for a \u00a324.5m payout. Perrins said the housebuilder was still investing in London and not calling the top of the market. It made an average profit of \u00a3115,000 on each home built in the past six months. Berkeley said \u00a34.34 a share had already been paid, with the remaining \u00a312 a share to be paid in annual dividends of \u00a32 a share over the next six years. Shares in Berkeley jumped more than 8% to \u00a336.30 after the announcement on Friday, an all-time high. Pidgley, who co-founded the housebuilder nearly 40 years ago and is known for his ability to read the housing market, is one of the wealthiest business executives in the UK with a fortune of more than \u00a3200m, according to the Sunday Times rich list. Berkeley awarded him a bumper cash-and-shares package of \u00a323.3m last year, part of \u00a342m of bonuses for the top five executives at the company. The higher dividend return target of \u00a316.34 a share by 2021 gives Berkeley\u2019s management a bigger hurdle to overcome to trigger one of the biggest share bonus payouts in corporate history, and suggests the company is confident this can be achieved. Berkeley\u2019s top five executives, including Pidgley, could in the next six years receive share bonuses worth a combined \u00a3550m at Friday\u2019s share price, if the dividend return target is met. Adopted from children\u2019s charity Barnardo\u2019s at the age of four by Travellers, Pidgley spent his early years living in a disused railway carriage. When he left school at the age of 15, he was barely able to read and write. He set up a haulage business and sold it at the age of 20 before founding Berkeley, which floated on the stock market in 1985. Berkeley said it was on track to deliver profits before tax of \u00a32bn in the three years to April 2018. Adjusted pretax profits, excluding a one-off profit from the sale of ground rent assets last year, were up 10% to \u00a3242m in the six months to the end of October. Berkeley sold 2,091 homes at an average selling price of \u00a3506,000 in the period. Over the last five years, Berkeley has built more than 17,750 new homes. Demand for new housing remains strong in London, it said. The firm has been selected as the Greater London Authority\u2019s preferred bidder for the 27 acre former Parcelforce site next to West Ham station in east London. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said the reiterated profit forecast \u201cis the cherry on the cake for loyal shareholders who recognise the value of the company\u2019s focus on a uniquely strong London and the south east region supported to solid demand for premium priced luxury habitation in an area where land is at a premium and property prices continue to make record highs\u201d. Ian Forrest, analyst at The Share Centre, advised investors to buy Berkeley \u201cdue to the healthy and fairly secure dividend income, excellent prospects for housing demand in London and the south east, and a long track record of delivering for investors\u201d. He added: \u201cAfter a strong rise in the share price after the general election we are advising investors to drip feed into the stock for now.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Non-Farm Payroll: US economy created 211,000 new jobs in November - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bill Gross, former chief of bond giant Pimco who now works at Janus Capital Management, also believes US interest rates will be raised this month. Speaking to Bloomberg TV earlier, Gross said the Fed is \u201ccertainly set to go\u201d. Janet Yellen and colleagues are concerned about the impact on the real economy if borrowing costs are left at record lows much longer, he added. Over to New York, and my colleague Jana Kasperkevic: The US economy added 211,000 jobs in November, slightly better than expectations, with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 5%, the US Department of Labor announced on Friday. Friday\u2019s report is the last before the Federal Reserve meets 15-16 December to determine whether it should raise interest rates. The last time the Fed raised interest rates was June 2006. Friday\u2019s job report would have had to be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the Fed to delay raising interest rates, said economists. The addition of 211,000 jobs likely paves the way for a rate hike later this month. Last month, US employers smashed expectations and added 271,000 jobs, the largest number of any month so far this year. Employers have added a robust average of 237,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. Figures from the payroll company ADP show private sector employers added 217,000 jobs in November \u2013 the most for five months. Economists expected the US economy to add 200,000 jobs in November and the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 5%, a seven-and-a-half-year low..... In other news.... the oil price has fallen sharply, on the back of reports that the OPEC group decided not to cut production, at today\u2019s meeting in Vienna. It\u2019s a complicated picture, though - there are reports that OPEC raised production limits from 30 million barrels per day to 31.5 million. However, that might just be a technical change to accommodate Indonesia\u2019s return to OPEC. This means industry watchers are a little perplexed right now: All may become clear later.... Brenda Kelly of London Capital Group, the City firm, says today\u2019s jobs report is just what the markets wanted - neither too hot, nor too cold. \u201cJudging by the market reaction, specifically 2-year yields,the market is very much expecting that this will only bolster a Fed hike this month. \u201cI think we got our Goldilocks number.\u201d [that\u2019s bad news for the bears #boomboom ] Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics is confident that US interest rates will, after nine years, be raised this month: The 211,000 gain in November\u2019s non-farm payrolls, along with the 35,000 upward revision to the gains in the preceding two months, would appear to seal an interest rate hike at the Fed\u2019s upcoming FOMC meeting, which concludes on the 16th December. Young people are still playing catch-up in the jobs market: Bloomberg\u2019s chief economist, Carl Riccadonna, believes that Federal Reserve will be very reluctant to raise interest rates a second time. The US mining industry has had a bad year, as producers are hit by the slump in raw materials prices and lay off staff. Today\u2019s report says: Employment in mining continued to decline in November (-11,000), with losses concentrated in support activities for mining (-7,000). Since a recent peak in December 2014, employment in mining has declined by 123,000. This makes mining a clear outlier: There is one wrinkle in the jobs report - the number of people \u2018under-employed\u2019 rose a little. BNP Paribas\u2019s economics team explains: One downside surprise in the report was that the number of people working part-time involuntarily increased to 6.09 million from 5.77 million, and their share of the labor force also increased, to 3.9% from 3.7% -- likely related to the seasonal retail hiring. Here\u2019s more reaction to the jobs report: There was little significant change to the US jobs market last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It says: In November, the unemployment rate held at 5.0%, and the number of unemployed persons, at 7.9 million, was essentially unchanged. Over the past 12 months, the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons are down by 0.8 percentage point and 1.1 million, respectively. Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (4.7%), adult women (4.6%), teenagers (15.7%), whites (4.3%), blacks (9.4%), Asians (3.9%), and Hispanics (6.4%) showed little or no change in November. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at 2.1 million in November and has shown little movement since June. In November, these individuals accounted for 25.7 percent of the unemployed. The full statement is here. Joseph Lake of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that the Fed won\u2019t raise rates fast unless wage growth merits it. And at 2.3%, earnings growth isn\u2019t exactly on fire. Shares on Wall Street are expected to rally a little when trading begins in 40 minutes. The Dow Jones index is tipped to rise by around 100 points, or 0.6%. Traders like this jobs report because it provides more certainty that the Fed is likely to pull the rate-hike lever this month. Here\u2019s the detail of those revisions to the non-farm payroll, showing more jobs created than expected in September and October. The dollar has strengthened against a basket of currencies. And the yield (or interest rates) on American government debt is jumping. They both indicate that investors expect a rate hike this month. The instant reaction in the markets is that the Federal Reserve has clearance to raise interest rates this month, for the first time in nine (nine!) years. US wage growth has slowed to 2.3% per year, down from 2.5% in October. That\u2019s broadly as expected. The US unemployment rate is unchanged at 5% - which is a seven and a half-year low. More good news - the jobs reports for September and October have been revised UPWARDS, to show that an extra 35,000 more people found work. Here. We. Go. The US economy created 211,000 new jobs last month, according to the eagerly awaited Non-Farm Payroll. That\u2019s slightly more than expected, and may raise the chances that the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates at its meeting on 16 December. More to follow.... Oh the tension.... Unless today\u2019s jobs report is a real shocker, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates at this month\u2019s meeting (in 12 days time). And that\u2019s why today\u2019s report may NOT be the most important non-farm payroll in history. Laura Rosner, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in New York, explains: \u201cIt would have to be a very large surprise \u2014 both in November and potentially a downward revision to October \u2014 to really change the outlook enough for the Fed to stop and reconsider the hike in December.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Weisenthal (a big fan of Jobs Day), reckons shares will rally if the Non-Farm Payroll hits forecasts. This is the biggest Jobs Report of 2015, says Conner Campbell of City firm SpreadEx. Things are set to hot up as the last non-farm payroll of, not only the year, but before December\u2019s potentially decisive FOMC meeting, finally arrives. Interestingly both the dollar and the Dow are already surging this morning; the former, understandably, is excited at the thought of an impending rate rise whilst the latter has jumped (in pre-market trading) on the hope that the months-long Fed-uncertainty may finally be coming to an end. Right! There are just under 30 minutes until the final major piece of economic news of the week - the US jobs report. As our preview explains, economist are expecting to hear that around 200,000 new jobs were added to the Non-Farm Payroll in November. A high number may well give the Federal Reserve the confidence to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006. But a weak reading, or surprisingly poor wage growth, might prove a headache for the Fed. Financial markets are already reeling from the ECB\u2019s policy meeting yesterday, when predictions of a really big stimulus push proved incorrect. Another shock today could spark some wild trading.... Bloomberg have run a good piece about how Goldman Sachs were caught out by the ECB yesterday. Here\u2019s a flavour: Less than 24 hours after predicting that a \u201cdovish surprise\u201d from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi would send the euro tumbling as much as 3%, chief currency strategist Robin Brooks is rethinking his entire weak-euro thesis after the ECB and currency markets moved against him. The euro rallied 3.1% to $1.0940 by the close of trading Thursday, the most since 2009, after Draghi delivered a stimulus package that was less aggressive than investors anticipated. \u201cToday was not the most fun day I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Brooks, who\u2019s putting his euro forecasts under review. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is the meeting sent a very confusing message.\u201d Mark Carney is now arguing that companies should have a plan to become carbon neutral: Over in Paris, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is announcing a new body to educate companies about the impact of climate change. It will be headed up by another big hitter - Michael Bloomberg. Our Economics editor Larry Elliott has the story: Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is to head a new global taskforce aimed at highlighting the financial exposure of companies to the risk of climate change. Investors, insurers, banks and consumers will be provided with more information under plans for a voluntary industry-led code announced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the G20 body that monitors and makes recommendations about the financial system, at the COP21 Paris Climate change conference on Friday. Carney is telling delegates in at COP21 that firms and investors both need to take climate change, and carbon reduction, seriously: The collective brilliance (?) of Finance Twitter reckons 211,000 new jobs were created in America last month. That\u2019s around 11,000 more than the market consensus. We\u2019ll find out who\u2019s right in two hours time (or less wrong, anyway.....) The vice-president head of the European Central Bank won\u2019t be receiving many Christmas cards from the City this year. Vitor Constancio has told CNBC that investors, not the ECB, messed up yesterday. Constancio, whose role includes saying as little as possible during ECB press conferences, was pretty candid about yesterday\u2019s meeting. He denied that hawks and doves on the governing council had clashed, and insisted that the ECB\u2019s new measures are significant. Markets, he argued, simply got their expectations wrong. They did indeed have higher expectations than were there and that\u2019s why they reacted like they reacted but that was not our intention.... After our meeting in October we said that we would reassess the degree of accommodation so we were talking about a recalibration of our measure. We were not talking about, ever, about a new type of QE2 or something like that. That\u2019s not what we were talking about.\u201d There are several important points to look for in the US jobs report, due in under three hours time. First, the total number of new jobs created in November. Estimates range from an measly 130,000 to a punchy 275,000. Anything starting with a \u201c2\u201d will indicate that the US labor market is still strengthening. Second, the unemployment rate. A further fall below the 5% hit last month might signal further tightening in the market. Third, the wage growth figures. Economists expect that wages grew by 0.2% during the month, and 2.3% year-on-year. That would be a dip on last month\u2019s 2.5% annual wage growth. Robust earnings would bolster the case for a rate hike. US Secretary of State John Kerry is visiting Athens today, and giving the country\u2019s government a show of support. Reuters has the story Speaking at the start of talks with leftist Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, Kerry said: \u201cI appreciate the way in which you have been approaching the economic reform effort and the challenges of the debt. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, and we want to try to be as helpful as we can to see Greece come out of this\u201d. Tsipras replied: \u201cI want to show you that Greece remains a(field) of stability in the region.\u201d Greece is under pressure to keep implementing the terms of its third bailout deal, so that it receives more loans and can negotiate a debt relief deal next year. City economists are putting the boot into Mario Draghi this morning, after the ECB\u2019s new stimulus package failed to excite the markets: Goldman Sachs is particularly bruised by events. Goldman told clients that the euro would tumble towards parity with the US dollar, and must have watched with growing alarm as the single currency soared.... The time-honoured game of guessing how many jobs were created in America last month is underway.... As explained in the introduction, the consensus forecast is that 201,000 new jobs were created last month. That would probably give the Federal Reserve the green light to raise interest rates this month. Sales of Volkswagen cars slumped by a fifth last month, suggesting that UK customers may be discouraged from buying VW due to the emissions scandal. Just 12,958 VW-branded cars were sold in November, down from 16,196 a year earlier. That\u2019s according to new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Other cars from the VW stable also suffered, with Audi sales down 4%, SEAT tumbling by 23%, and Skoda dropping by 10%. The overall market grew by 3.8% year-on-year. Over in Vienna, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is beginning its meeting to discuss oil production. It\u2019s quite a scrum, with reporters desperate to hear any clues about possible production cuts (although this seems unlikely) With oil price still in the low $40 per barrel range, OPEC members are actually losing money on production right now: Let\u2019s not forget that the European Central Bank DID announce new stimulus measures yesterday - not just as much as investors had expected. So the negative market reaction may just show that traders got carried away, not that Draghi fumbled the ball. As Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale puts it: Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed\u201d. So wrote Alexander Pope just for occasions like this. If we had expected nothing, we would think the ECB has eased policy, cutting the Deposit Rate to -0.3% and extending the asset-buying programming. Kit adds that the euro is still 4% weaker than in mid-October, when Draghi hinted that the ECB would ease monetary policy again. That shows that the stimulus has had an effect (even though the euro bounced back so strongly yesterday) In other news, pub chain Wetherspoon\u2019s has become the latest UK company to fall victim to hackers: European markets are sliding lower, down around 0.4% now. That adds to yesterday\u2019s rout which wiped 3.5% off the French and German markets. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors haven\u2019t got over yesterday\u2019s ECB meeting yet. Markets continue to digest an underwhelming ECB policy update due to internal committee disagreements on what was required to foster regional growth. While deposit rates went further into negative territory and the quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programme was extended, there was no QE expansion as markets were expecting to help deliver a boost to Eurozone growth and counter deflationary risks.. It\u2019s not all gloom this morning. German factory orders have beaten expectations. Industrial orders across the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy rose by 1.8% month-on-month in October, beating forecasts of a 1.2% rise. And just as importantly, September\u2019s figures have been revised higher to show a drop of 0.7%, not the 1.7% tumble first estimated. It suggests the German economy is in better shape than some recent data had suggested - which arguably backs up the ECB\u2019s decision not to launch a stronger stimulus package yesterday. The shadow of Mario the Grinch is falling over Europe\u2019s stock markets again. Shares are falling in early trading, with the FTSE 100 dropping by 0.2% or 15 points to 6260. Spain\u2019s IBEX shed 0.6%, and there are small losses in Germany and France City AM have dubbed Mario Draghi \u201cThe Grinch\u201d, blasting the ECB chief for ruining hopes of a decent Santa Rally in share prices this month. Here\u2019s a flavour of their front page story: Santa\u2019s sack was half-empty,\u201d said Ken Wattret, an economist at BNP Paribas. \u201cAs plenty of children will discover on the morning of the 25th, it\u2019s all about expectations and having built them up, the ECB unfortunately failed to deliver fully. More here: Mario the Grinch ruins Santa rally: Draghi disappoints investors with ECB rates cut When financial crisis veterans gather in a few decades time to chat about the good old days, yesterday\u2019s drama will probably get a mention: Investors appear to be losing faith in central bankers\u2019 ability to keep asset prices pumped up, after years of monetary stimulus. Chris Weston of IG fears that traders have also lost faith in ECB chief Mario Draghi, amid speculation that hawkish members of his committee blocked new stimulus: The European Central Bank (ECB) undoubtedly have lost some credibility, or at least that is the line from most economists who were all calling for a shock and awe type of approach. One question that was raised is why Mario Draghi didn\u2019t try and water down expectations somewhat in one of his recent speeches throughout November. Did he not expect such strong German opposition? We are left with a market that is now of the belief that we are unlikely to see further easing and one that is fully schooled in understanding positioning and expectations and that when a central bank fails to live up to expectations the reaction can be violent. Stock markets across Asia have fallen sharply today, as investors react to yesterday\u2019s damp squib from the European Central Bank. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has tumbled 2.1%, and China\u2019s Shanghai market was close behind, following Thursday\u2019s big selloff in Europe. The trigger, of course, was the news that the ECB did not boost its bond buying programme yesterday beyond \u20ac60bn/month (although it did extend it by six months). The small cut to bank deposit rates announced by Mario Draghi also fell short of expectations. Here\u2019s our latest report from Asia: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. After the drama and disappointment of ECB Day on Thursday, attention now turns to America. It\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll time, when we get a crucial indicator of the health of the US labor market, and thus the wider economy. The NFP will show out how many new jobs were created across the US last month (excluding the agriculture sector, where employment trends are driven by the seasons). Economists predict that the Payroll increased by 201,000 -- although guesstimates range widely. And that uncertainty means the markets could be volatile when the survey is released at 1.30pm UK time, or 8.30am on the East Coast. This is the most important data to be released before the US central bank decides whether to raise interest rates when policymakers meet in 12 days time. As this chart shows, the US unemployment rate has fallen steadily for several years to just 5%, to a point where record low interest rates look unnecessary. Fed chair Janet Yellen declared yesterday that the labor market was improving, in comments that seem to hint that the long wait for a rate hike is over. Today\u2019s NFP could seal the deal, or throw new confusion over the issue if it\u2019s weaker than expected. Also coming up today.... We\u2019ll be tracking the reaction to the European Central Bank\u2019s latest stimulus package, which failed to impress the markets yesterday. Shares have already fallen in Asia, and traders are braced for fresh losses in Europe: And in Vienna, representatives of the OPEC cartel of oil producers are holding their annual policy meeting. We\u2019re not expecting them to cut production, though, despite pressure from some members to take action to drive prices up.",

      "bodyText": "Plenty could happen between now and 16 December when the Federal Reserve has to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006. Stuff happens. As Harold Wilson once famously said, a week is a long time in politics. But barring something completely unexpected, it now looks increasingly likely that the US central bank will end its dithering and raise the cost of borrowing just before Christmas. The latest non-farm payroll data on Friday removed the last big obstacle that might have given the Fed pause for thought. Make no mistake, the US jobs market is not exactly going all guns blazing. In previous recoveries, the 211,000 jobs created last month would have been considered modest. Annual wage growth actually declined a bit, from 2.5% to 2.3%, and underemployment rose slightly. But the headline payrolls number was what interested Wall Street. It beat expectations, although not by much, and was accompanied by upward revisions to employment growth in previous months. The Fed might have been swayed by a really weak payrolls number, but this was not it. It would, therefore, now be a major surprise were the Fed to sit on its hands on 16 December. Indeed, attention has already started to focus on what happens next. With inflation weak and the labour market improving but far from booming, Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, would like to take things slowly and steadily.

      "bodyText": "The US economy added 211,000 jobs in November, slightly better than expectations, with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 5%, the US Department of Labor announced on Friday. Friday\u2019s report is the last before the Federal Reserve meets on 15-16 December to determine whether it should raise interest rates. The last time the Fed raised interest rates was June 2006. Friday\u2019s job report would have had to have been a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the Fed to delay raising interest rates, said economists. The addition of 211,000 jobs likely paves the way for a rate hike later this month. Economists expected the US economy to add 200,000 jobs in November and the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 5%, a seven-and-a-half-year low. \u201cThis is exactly what the Fed is looking for: solid job growth \u2013 better than 200,000 \u2013 plus an upward revision to both September and October numbers; decent gain in average hourly gain; unemployment rate still at 5%,\u201d said Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at PNC Financial Services Group. \u201cThis seals the deal on rate hike in couple of weeks.\u201d In October, US employers smashed expectations and added 271,000 jobs, the largest number of any month so far this year. Friday\u2019s report included upward revisions to that number: according to the Department of Labor, an additional 27,000 jobs were created in October and about 8,000 more jobs were created in September than originally believed. Employers have added a robust average of 237,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. Figures from the payroll company ADP show private sector employers added 217,000 jobs in November \u2013 the most for five months. Over the past few months, the Department of Labor has stressed wages, which it said was \u201cthe unfinished business of this recovery\u201d. In November the average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents to $25.25, following a 9-cent gain in October. \u201cWe have seen an acceleration in wage growth. It was 2.3% year-over-year in November; that\u2019s a little bit down from October,\u201d said Faucher. (In October that figure was 2.5%.) \u201cIt\u2019s certainly up from where it has been for the past few years. That\u2019s indicative of a tighter labor market and I think we will continue to see wage growth accelerate as the unemployment rate falls further. We are finally adding that piece, which is good news for consumer spending.\u201d As the unemployment rate has gone down, employers have had to offer better pay to attract better job applicants. While economists like Faucher have declared this a \u201cvery good\u201d report, not everyone agrees. \u201cWhile many people are saying this morning\u2019s report clears the way for liftoff, it still is too soon to declare victory in the economy. We won\u2019t be at full employment until we see durable acceleration of wage growth, and only once we have achieved full employment will all workers be able to get the jobs they need and the hours they want, and be better positioned to negotiate for higher pay,\u201d said Elise Gould, senior economist at left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. \u201cYes, interest rates have been low for a long time, but the Fed should not raise rates simply to scratch a seven year itch.\u201d Economists expect the Fed to announce an increase in interest rates in the coming weeks. \u201cWe will be looking, of course, carefully at tomorrow\u2019s jobs report,\u201d Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, said on Thursday while testifying before the US Congress joint economic committee. \u201cBut we can\u2019t overweight any particular number. We need to be looking at underlying trends in the data and not overweight any number.\u201d According to Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, recent jobless claims data shows no signs of labor market weakening. Last week\u2019s claims came in at 269,000 \u2013 9,000 more than the week before \u2013 but still near levels last seen in 1973. \u201cThe claims data suggest that the trend in employment growth remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down over time,\u201d said O\u2019Sullivan. Faucher, of PNC, agreed. \u201cWhen Yellen spoke on Wednesday and then again on Thursday, she talked about things that can change Fed\u2019s mind, but certainly this isn\u2019t going to change their mind. This is what they have been looking for,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Personal details of up to 657,000 customers of pub chain JD Wetherspoon have been stolen in the the latest cyber attack on a British company. Wetherspoon said the hack was made on its old website, and that \u201cextremely limited\u201d credit and debit card details were stolen for 100 customers who bought the pub chain\u2019s vouchers online before August 2014. They cannot be fraudulently used, however, as only the last four digits of the card numbers were obtained by the hackers and not the customer name and expiry date, the company said. The 656,723 customers affected were on the database with personal details such as their names, dates of birth, email addresses and mobile phone numbers. No passwords were stolen. Wetherspoons is the latest company to suffer a cyber attack. Telecoms group TalkTalk was hit in October, with almost 157,000 customers affected in its third data breach in 12 months. Five people have been arrested so far. Wetherspoon\u2019s chief executive, John Hutson, apologised to customers and staff who have been affected. He added: \u201cUnfortunately, hacking is becoming more and more sophisticated and widespread. We are determined to respond to this by increasing our efforts and investment in security and will be doing everything possible to prevent a recurrence.\u201d Some personal staff details, registered before 10 November 2011, were also stolen, but this does not include any salary, bank, tax or national insurance information. Wetherspoon has emailed customers and asked a cybersecurity specialist to investigate the data breach. The Information Commissioners Office, which regulates data protection, has been notified. The card data was not encrypted because the first 12 digits and the security number on the back of the card were not stored on the database. The data breach happened between 15 and 17 June. Wetherspoon said it had taken so long to notify customers of this breach because the data was held by a third party company that previously hosted its website, and the breached had not been discovered until 1 December. According to Wetherspoon chairman and founder Tim Martin, an anonymous email was sent to Hutson alerting him to the attack on 6 November. But it ended up in the company\u2019s spam folder, so the breach was not discovered until the company was contacted by the Financial Times on Monday, the paper said (\u00a3).",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asian shares have joined a slump in global markets after the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus package fell well short of markets\u2019 high expectations. Traders warned that the ECB\u2019s failure to deliver another big round of monetary easing meant that it had \u201clost credibility\u201d with the markets. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index tumbled 2.2% on Friday, the biggest daily drop since September, and closed with a weekly loss of 1.9%, the most in three months. Chinese stock markets were also down with the Shanghai Composite index down 1.5% and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong falling by 1.1%. The Australian share market closed down 1.5%. Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P 500 stock index saw its biggest one-day percentage decline since September on Thursday, dropping 1.4%. The French and German bourses fell more than 3.5% on Thursday and futures trading points to fresh falls on European markets when markets open again on Friday morning. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 was expected to fall 0.6%, and France\u2019s CAC40 and Germany\u2019s DAX to open down 0.8%. The drama started after the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory and extended its asset buying by six months. Its rate cut of 0.10 percentage point, to -0.30%, was smaller than a 0.15 to 0.20 percentage point cut many traders expected. The central bank did not increase the amount of government bonds it buys while the six-month extension of the programme was perceived as the bare minimum, given traders looked for an extension of one year or even making it an open-ended plan. Chris Weston of IG in Melbourne said the ECB had \u201cundoubtedly lost some credibility\u201d by failing to deliver a \u201cshock and awe\u201d approach. \u201cWe are left with a market that is now of the belief that we are unlikely to see further easing,\u201d he said. Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like doing so much sweet talking before your marriage that you set it up to be a big disappointment.\u201d The package sent traders scrambling to unwind short euro positions which they had built since late October on the expectation that ECB chief Mario Draghi would \u201cdo what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible\u201d with another round of stimulus measures. The euro jumped 3.1% on Thursday to trade at $1.094, its biggest single-day gain since March 2009. Investors are now turning their attention to the US non-farm payrolls data on Friday, which is likely to cement expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates later this month, barring surprisingly weak readings. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, speaking before Congress\u2019 joint economic committee on Thursday, said the United States may be \u201cclose to the point at which we should be raising\u201d rates. She also said the US economy needs to add fewer than 100,000 jobs a month to cover new entrants to the workforce, perhaps setting an implicit floor for jobs growth that policymakers want to see. Also attracting investor attention was the OPEC meeting later on Friday. Crude oil prices rose about 3% on the eve of the meeting, as traders hedged their positions. Brent crude futures climbed to $44.09 per barrel, having bounced back from Wednesday\u2019s three-month low of $42.43.",

      "bodyText": "Black Friday helped John Lewis record its biggest ever week of trading as sales via the department store\u2019s website soared 15.5%. The company rang up \u00a3187.7m in the week to 28 November, 4.8% more than the same week last year, as a strong day online on the Friday was followed by a 9.3% rise in stores on Saturday. John Lewis said Black Friday was its biggest single day of trading, with sales 11.9% higher than last year. The pattern of trade at the retailer suggests high street stores did not entirely miss out on the Black Friday effect. Shoppers preferred hunting out deals online on the day itself but visited shops over the weekend when many retailers continued offering discounts. Meanwhile, Sainsbury\u2019s said it had sold two and half times the value of Black Friday goods that it did last year despite a slow start to the US-inspired discount day in its stores. The supermarket did not need the extra staff and queueing systems brought in to ensure safety after a rush of customers at stores that opened in the early hours last year. But it said it would repeat its Black Friday promotions next year after the event was a profitable success. Asda toned down its Black Friday action this year as it said shoppers were fed up with quick sales. But Sainsbury\u2019s said the more relaxed pace of this year\u2019s event enabled regular shoppers to grab deals and pick up groceries at the same time. Sainsbury\u2019s only tested a handful of Black Friday deals online as its intention was to draw shoppers into stores. But it is looking at ways to cash in on internet demand next year. Five items per second passed through John Lewis\u2019s distribution centre during its peak hour as the company processed 18% more parcels than last year over Black Friday and the following weekend. Dino Rocos, the operations director, said: \u201cBlack Friday marks the first of the three peaks of Christmas and there was huge anticipation for the day this year and high expectations to meet. I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we delivered successfully for our customers. This is testament to the work of our partners both on Black Friday itself and in our forward planning.\u201d Sales of electrical items were up 5.5% compared with last year \u2013 with wearable technology such as fitness monitors up 850%. Sales of Fitbit trackers were up 1,200%. Dyson products were also in demand. John Lewis said it sold four times as many fan heaters as last year. Sales of \u201cconnected home\u201d products, such as smart washing machines, fridges or thermostats that can be controlled on the internet nearly doubled, and 3.2 televisions were sold every minute. Fashion was also popular, with women\u2019s branded clothing up 45.6% year on year.",

The pattern of trade at the retailer suggests high street stores did not entirely miss out on the Black Friday effect. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/27/mince-pies-not-mini-riots-cautious-shops-open-for-black-friday\">Shoppers preferred hunting out deals online on the day itself</a> but visited shops over the weekend when many retailers continued offering discounts. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Sainsbury\u2019s said it had sold two and half times the value of Black Friday goods that it did last year despite a slow start to the US-inspired discount day in its stores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/02/black-friday-five-lessons-for-uk-retailers\">Black Friday: five lessons for UK retailers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The supermarket did not need the extra staff and queueing systems brought in to ensure safety after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/28/black-friday-fever-police-battle-shoppers\">a rush of customers at stores that opened in the early hours last year</a>. But it said it would repeat its Black Friday promotions next year after the event was a profitable success. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/10/asda-to-step-away-from-black-friday-deals\">Asda toned down its Black Friday action this year</a> as it said shoppers were fed up with quick sales. But Sainsbury\u2019s said the more relaxed pace of this year\u2019s event enabled regular shoppers to grab deals and pick up groceries at the same time.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s only tested a handful of Black Friday deals online as its intention was to draw shoppers into stores. But it is looking at ways to cash in on internet demand next year.</p> <p>Five items per second passed through John Lewis\u2019s distribution centre during its peak hour as the company processed 18% more parcels than last year over Black Friday and the following weekend.</p> <p>Dino Rocos, the operations director, said: \u201cBlack Friday marks the first of the three peaks of Christmas and there was huge anticipation for the day this year and high expectations to meet. I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we delivered successfully for our customers. This is testament to the work of our partners both on Black Friday itself and in our forward planning.\u201d</p> <p>Sales of electrical items were up 5.5% compared with last year \u2013 with wearable technology such as fitness monitors up 850%. Sales of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/19/is-corporate-wellness-the-big-new-thing-that-will-keep-fitbit-ahead-of-the-pack\">Fitbit trackers</a> were up 1,200%. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/03/james-dyson-record-profits-bladeless-fans\">Dyson products</a> were also in demand. John Lewis said it sold four times as many fan heaters as last year.</p> <p>Sales of \u201cconnected home\u201d products, such as smart washing machines, fridges or thermostats that can be controlled on the internet nearly doubled, and 3.2 televisions were sold every minute.</p> <p>Fashion was also popular, with women\u2019s branded clothing up 45.6% year on year.</p>",

Voca Telemarketing, based in Irvine, North Ayrshire, pays its 66 staff the minimum wage of \u00a36.70 an hour, the basic rate for call centre workers across the industry. But after its accreditation from the Poverty Alliance in Scotland on behalf of the Living Wage Foundation, the company said all employees, regardless of age, would see their hourly pay rise to \u00a38.25 from 1 January. Voca, which employs staff to make sales calls on behalf of a variety of clients, including a big energy firm, said the move would help it recruit for 45 posts in January and February. Almost half of the workforce at the call centre are between 18 and 24. The company\u2019s move is a considerably better deal than the government\u2019s national living wage premium of \u00a37.20 per hour for over-25s, taking effect in April. \u201cWe are very pleased to be the first call centre in Britain to be offering all staff the voluntary living wage,\u201d said Victoria Edwards, Voca\u2019s managing director. \u201cIt is the morally and socially right course for employers to follow and together with good training will deliver staff productivity, retention and recruitment benefits. We hope our latest pay initiative sets the trend for the call centre industry as a whole where a large proportion of workers are under 25.\u201d A typical employee working 166.5 hours a month will see their gross monthly pay rise from \u00a31,115 to \u00a31,373 next month. Sarah Vero, the director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: \u201cThe best employers are voluntarily signing up to pay the living wage. We hope the leadership shown by Voca Telemarketing will encourage other call centres to review their own pay and reward packages, and consider how they too could become living wage employers.\u201d",
