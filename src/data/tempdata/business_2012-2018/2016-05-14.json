      "bodyText": "Victims of blacklisting by the construction industry, who were awarded a \u00a375m out-of-court settlement, are to demand a police investigation into their claims that key executives tried to pervert the course of justice. On Wednesday major companies, including Sir Robert McAlpine and Balfour Beatty, issued an \u201cunreserved and sincere\u201d apology in the high court to hundreds of workers for putting them on an illegal blacklist and denying them work over two decades. The companies agreed to pay sums ranging from \u00a325,000 to \u00a3200,000 to 771 people under out-of-court settlements to avoid a trial, while accepting that \u201ctheir secret vetting operation should never have happened\u201d. However, evidence disclosed before the settlement has led many of the victims to claim that there was an illegal attempt by executives at Sir Robert McAlpine to destroy evidence and cover up the involvement of key individuals when the blacklisting was discovered in 2009. The targets of the victims\u2019 intended criminal complaint include Cullum McAlpine, a director of Sir Robert McAlpine and a member of the founding family, who was chairman of the blacklisting organisation, known as the Consulting Association, when it was formed in 1993. Sir Robert McAlpine\u2019s head of human resources, David Cochrane, who was a later chairman of the association, is also at the centre of the complaint. Both deny involvement in destroying any relevant files and categorically deny attempting to pervert the course of justice. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) raided the Consulting Association on 23 February 2009, retrieving a limited number of files. Those involved in the blacklisting operation were aware that they were not to destroy any further evidence. However, a handwritten note of a meeting on 2 March 2009, which records Cochrane instructing Ian Kerr, a former Consulting Association chief executive, along with the notebook in which it was discovered, will be at the centre of the victims\u2019 case that the obligation not to destroy evidence was not met. It reads: \u201cRing everyone \u2013 Cease trading \u2013 Close down. We don\u2019t exist anymore \u2013 Destroy data \u2013 Stop processing of \u2026\u201d A second entry in Kerr\u2019s notebook read: \u201cALL mailing lists \u2013 shredded \u2013 NOT TAKEN BY ICO.\u201d In a notebook dated 23 February 2009, a handwritten note of a conversation between Kerr and Cochrane appeared to record Cochrane instructing Kerr as follows: \u201cCullum McAlpine \u2013 his name \u2013 remove this from any documents.\u201d Meanwhile, a letter dated 16 June 2009 from Kerr\u2019s wife, Mary, to Cullum McAlpine additionally stated: \u201cIt was suggested by Mr Cochrane that Ian had not kept to his side of the agreement to put himself \u2018in the frame\u2019 and keep the companies\u2019 names out of the magistrates court hearing with the promise of the payment of all outstanding debts by Sir Robert McAlpine. Ian had instructed his solicitor not to name any company in court, which is exactly what happened.\u201d During a hearing of the Scottish affairs select committee, Kerr, who died in 2012, admitted that his \u00a35,000 fine for breaches of the Data Protection Act following a magistrates court hearing in 2009 was met by Sir Robert McAlpine \u201con the basis that I had put myself at the front and took the flak, if you like, for it all, so that they wouldn\u2019t be drawn into all of this. They would remain hidden.\u201d Dave Smith, of the Blacklisting Support Group, said victims would be visiting police to make their complaints. A spokesman for Sir Robert McAlpine said: \u201cNo instructions were given to Mr Kerr or by Mr Kerr to members of the Consulting Association to destroy documents relating to [its] activities.\u201d He added that the company complied fully with the court requirement for complete disclosure of documents relating to the activities of the Consulting Association.",

      "bodyText": "2001 \u2013 THE ORGANIC FOOD BOOM BEGINS As consumer confidence in food production methods declined, amid concerns over chemical spraying and genetic modification, UK sales of organic food shot up \u2013 by 14.7% in 2001, according to the Soil Association. By 2004 we were spending \u00a31.21bn on organic produce, up from \u00a3100m a decade earlier. 2002 \u2013 RANKING THE ELITE One of the most powerful \u2013 and certainly the buzziest \u2013 ranking systems for the world\u2019s elite restaurants was dreamed up in a central London pub by the editors of Restaurant magazine and introduced as a brattish alternative to the Michelin Guide. ElBulli topped the first World\u2019s 50 Best list, with Restaurant Gordon Ramsay second. When the Fat Duck was voted No 1 in 2005, it saved Heston Blumenthal from financial ruin. 2003 \u2013 DEATH HIGHLIGHTS MICHELIN STRESS On 24 February, Bernard Loiseau, chef at the three-Michelin-starred La C\u00f4te d\u2019Or in Burgundy, killed himself with a hunting rifle. He was saddled with debts and suffered from depression, but many blamed the pressures of maintaining his Michelin ranking. Last January another three-star chef, Beno\u00eet Violier, shot himself at his home outside Lausanne. 2004 \u2013 FILM-MAKER BITES MCDONALD\u2019S When Morgan Spurlock set out to investigate the role of fast-food restaurants in the US obesity crisis, he used himself as a test case. In Super Size Me, the film-maker ate three meals a day at McDonald\u2019s for 30 days \u2013 and nothing else \u2013 losing energy, suffering mood swings and becoming generally unhealthy. McDonald\u2019s argued that Spurlock\u2019s example was extreme but the franchise quickly dropped its supersize options. 2005 \u2013 JAMIE SHAKES UP SCHOOL MEALS Jamie Oliver went into full-blown campaign mode as he set about improving standards \u2013 and battling dinner ladies \u2013 in Jamie\u2019s School Dinners. The show spawned a broader campaign called Feed Me Better, resulting in a government pledge to spend an extra \u00a3280m on school dinners over the next three years. 2006 \u2013 TESCO\u2019S GOLDEN YEAR In April, Tesco announced a \u00a32.25bn profit and claimed a 30% share of UK supermarket sales. A decade on, the picture is very different. As the discounters Aldi and Lidl saw their joint share of the market double in three years, Tesco only crept back into profit after posting a \u00a36.4bn loss in 2015. 2007 \u2013 BATTLE TO CUT FOOD WASTE A Cabinet Office review of food policy revealed that the UK threw away 4.1m tonnes of the stuff every year, at a cost of \u00a3420 per household. Gordon Brown acknowledged the problem and a campaign called Love Food, Hate Waste was launched to combat it. According to the campaign, avoidable food waste was reduced by 21% (more than 1m tonnes) from 2007-2012. A study last year stated that the UK is still the biggest offender in the EU. 2008 \u2013 HUGH\u2019S CHICKEN CAMPAIGN When Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall broadcast a series about factory-farmed chickens, Chicken Run, in January, it had an immediate effect. Sales of free-range poultry shot up by 35%, while sales of standard birds fell by 7%. According to the RSPCA, 73% of adults said they changed their buying habits after discovering the conditions under which standard chickens were raised. Two years later, on Hugh\u2019s Fish Fight, the chef challenged EU quotas that meant half of all fish caught was discarded overboard. His campaign received 870,000 signatures, OFM readers crowned him their Food Personality of the Year, and a ban on throwing fish back into the sea became European law in June 2013. 2009 \u2013 NOROVIRUS SHUTS FAT DUCK On 27 February, Heston Blumenthal was forced to close the Fat Duck for two weeks after diners reported feeling unwell. In total, 529 complained of food poisoning. The cause, according to a report by the Health Protection Agency, was the norovirus bug transmitted by contaminated shellfish. The Fat Duck received \u00a3200,000 compensation for business lost and those who fell ill were invited back as guests. 2010 \u2013 BAKE OFF TAKES OFF When the first episode of The Great British Bake Off aired, on 17 August, it attracted a relatively modest audience of 2.24 million. Who would have thought that this low-stakes baking show would become the most popular programme on British TV? Last October, 15.1 million people tuned in to watch Nadiya Hussain win the 2015 final with 16 iced buns, a raspberry mille-feuille and a showstopping Big Fat British Wedding Cake. 2011 \u2013 E COLI STRIKES IN GERMANY It took more than a month for health inspectors to locate the source of the E coli outbreak in summer that infected more than 3,000 people around Europe and killed 53. The culprit turned out to be a crop of bean sprouts from an organic farm in Lower Saxony. Fears about failings in the food supply chain were heightened in early 2013 when horse DNA was found in frozen beefburgers sold by Tesco, Iceland (traces), Aldi and Lidl. 2012 \u2013 BREADLINE BLOGGER In May 2012, Jack Monroe, an out-of-work single mother in Southend, Essex, started writing a blog. Ostensibly a collection of ultra-low-cost recipes, A Girl Called Jack also gave Monroe, whose food budget was \u00a310 a week, a platform to talk about the challenges and cruelties of life on the breadline in austerity Britain. The blog took off and Monroe went on to become an author and activist, winning an OFM award and addressing a parliamentary inquiry into rising food poverty. That problem hasn\u2019t gone away: a 2015 study showed a 19% year-on-year increase in food bank use across the UK 2013 \u2013 KALE BECOMES A THING One of the surest signs that the clean-eating trend was upon us was the news that sales of kale \u2013 the low-calorie, high-fibre vegetable beloved of wellness bloggers and health-conscious celebrities \u2013 had gone up by 40% on the previous year. Since then, endorsements from blogs such as Deliciously Ella and celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow have boosted sales of other so-called \u201csuper foods\u201d. In the 12 months to March 2016, a record \u00a3128m was spent on avocados in the UK, making them more popular than oranges. 2014 \u2013 OBESITY FIGURES SWELL According to a study in the Lancet, 67% of men and 57% of women in the UK were either overweight or obese. The problem was (and continues to be) a global one: around 2.1 billion people \u2013 nearly 30% of the planet\u2019s population \u2013 are overweight or obese. 2015 \u2013 DAIRY FARMERS IN CRISIS In 2005, there were 21,000 dairy farms in England, Scotland and Wales; 10 years later, that number had fallen to 10,500. Falling milk prices were the main cause. At the start of the year, farmers received 20p per litre, down from 33p the year before, while energy and feed costs increased. The result was a sorry situation in which milk cost less than bottled water and farmers were earning less than they were spending on production. 2016 \u2013 BRITAIN GETS A SUGAR TAX On 16 March, George Osborne introduced a tax on sugary drinks that will come into effect in April 2018. By targeting high-sugar drinks popular with children and teenagers, Osborne aims to combat youth obesity and reduce the burden on the NHS. The tax was welcomed by health organisations and Jamie Oliver, who highlighted the dangers of sweet stuff in his 2015 documentary Jamie\u2019s Sugar Rush. 12 July 2016. This article was amended on 2 June 2016 following a complaint from Iceland Foods Ltd. Iceland have asked us to clarify that while samples from two Iceland own-label burger ranges were found to contain traces of horse DNA, the level of horse DNA found of 0.1% was sufficiently low to suggest the results may have been caused by cross contamination.",

The mini Bake Off event did not perhaps have the ratings of Martin\u2019s former show Saturday Kitchen, but it cemented his new partnership with Britain\u2019s number three supermarket. The chain is hoping that the hunky Yorkshireman can do for Asda what Jamie Oliver\u2019s cockney charm did for Sainsbury\u2019s. Things have been getting pretty hot in the kitchen of late for Clarke, as a resurgent Tesco and the rapacious growth of discounters Aldi and Lidl pick off Asda\u2019s shoppers. A newly media-shy Asda will report its first-quarter sales via American parent Walmart on Thursday, and recent industry data suggests the figures will be dire. The retailer\u2019s market share has dropped from 17.3% two years ago to 16% today, according to Kantar Worldpanel. In the last three months of 2015, underlying sales tumbled by 5.8% at Asda after it lost the battle for Christmas shoppers. To outsiders, Asda does look like a business in trouble, but Bryan Roberts of retail consultancy TCC Global says the company is focusing on defending its profitability rather than its market share. \u201cSome of the other grocers have been renting market share,\u201d he says. \u201cAsda has won the price war \u2013 that\u2019s clear \u2013 but what it now needs to correct is perception. It has to walk the tightrope of offering low prices to attract the value-conscious as well as the bells and whistles that attract the higher-income shopper.\u201d He adds that work needs to be done to improve the attractiveness of its sprawling superstores. \u201cYou can\u2019t carry on losing market share on this scale for ever: you need to turn it around. It has to turn its mind to rejuvenating the proposition.\u201d Finding shoppers tiring of endless bogofs and multibuy promotions, rival grocers Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons have moved to offering customers everyday low prices (\u201cEDLP\u201d in industry jargon). It\u2019s a model that was pioneered in Britain by Asda \u2013 thanks to the might of the Walmart machine, which enables it to secure low prices by placing huge orders with suppliers \u2013 but the market shift means there is now less clear blue water between it and the competition. Asda has now embarked on \u201cproject renewal\u201d \u2013 an overhaul of the business that this year will see 95 of its superstores refurbished. This will include handing over large chunks of space to other retailers, such as French sportswear giant Decathlon. It is also pulling up to a fifth of its products off the shelves as part of a review of the 40,000 lines it carries. Tesco carried out a similar exercise last year in the face of customer defections to the low-cost, low-choice German discounters, which typically stock fewer than 2,000 products. Analysts at Morgan Stanley argue that Asda is the industry\u2019s wild card, and that if it chose to take a more aggressive stance on prices, it could put a serious dent in other retailer\u2019s profits. \u201cIn a bear case scenario, where Asda decided to reset its margin, it could lead to a halving of the industry\u2019s profit pool,\u201d cautions Morgan Stanley\u2019s Edouard Aubin. That would be very bad news for Tesco. In the year to February, Tesco made an underlying profit of \u00a3944m. That was down from \u00a34bn four years ago, and when he unveiled its full-year results, chief executive Dave Lewis was reluctant to be pinned down to a forecast for this year, amid tough market conditions. According to Morgan Stanley\u2019s monthly price survey of a 400-strong basket of goods, Asda appeared to have sharpened its prices in April, with its basket 4.5% cheaper than Tesco\u2019s. While Martin will start appearing in Asda adverts from June, the retailer is also calling on the talents of another Yorkshireman. Former Sainsbury\u2019s retail and operations director Roger Burnley arrives in the autumn after a year of gardening leave. Burnley, who was part of the famous turnaround team led by Archie Norman and Allan Leighton that revived Asda in the 1990s, will rejoin as chief operating officer, but many believe that, come 2017, he will be the star turn rather than the co-presenter as Clarke bows out.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Just six months after Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, warned that UK retailers face a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d, BHS collapsed into administration, leaving the high street with its biggest failure since the financial crisis. There are clearly unique circumstances surrounding the demise of BHS, but Lewis\u2019s warning about business rates, the national living wage and the apprenticeship levy was, without doubt, prescient. Today, he says, there are \u201csome pretty big macro challenges\u201d ahead for retailing. \u201cBusiness rates is real, the living wage for the industry will be real, the apprenticeship levy will be real.\u201d Online retailers \u2013 and the way they are taxed \u2013 present another problem. \u201cYou have got a situation that nobody likes to talk about, which is that there is a structural advantage to going digital and online if the largest single tax that we [store-based retailers] pay is a property-based rates system.\u201d This he sees as \u201ca very, very, very big challenge\u201d. The government has offered retailers an olive branch by linking the annual increase in business rates to the consumer price index instead of the higher retail price index, and has pledged to revalue properties more regularly, so that rates more accurately reflect the economic environment. But Lewis is concerned that plans to allow to councils set local business rates, rather than it being done by central government, could lead to store closures: \u201cWe don\u2019t honestly know what going local will mean. We will get different interpretations from one district to the next, which will suddenly start skewing the profitability of stores.\u201d In January 2015, a few months after he took over as chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, Lewis announced the closure of 43 Tesco stores and scrapped plans to build another 49, as part of his plan to turn the group around. The former Unilever marketing man had never run a shop when he was hired to put a stop to a three-year sales slide at Tesco. As if that was not enough of a challenge, within three weeks Lewis was engulfed in the biggest crisis in the company\u2019s history when a whistleblower alerted him to an accounting scandal. Since then, the Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into Tesco, the company made a \u00a36.4bn annual loss for 2014 \u2013 one of the biggest in British corporate history \u2013 and Lewis has axed thousands of jobs in an attempt to cut costs. Tesco\u2019s most recent results showed signs of progress. It reported pre-tax profits of \u00a3162m for the year to 27 February, which included a 0.9% rise in like-for-like sales in the final quarter of the year in the UK. That performance is a long way from Tesco\u2019s peak profit of more than \u00a34bn in 2012, and shares in the company have fallen by a third over the past year as investors realised, after an initial burst of optimism when Lewis arrived, that the grocer still faces a very long road back to full health. Nevertheless, Lewis has been handsomely rewarded for the progress made so far. On Friday it was revealed that he had picked up a bonus of almost \u00a33m on top of his \u00a31.25m salary. Tesco\u2019s UK staff are also sharing a turnaround bonus worth \u00a3185m, or 5% of their salaries. Lewis robustly defends the work that has been done so far. \u201cIf I had told you when I joined that we would take a 5% drop in like-for-like sales and turn it into positive like-for-like growth at the end of last year with prices down by more than 4%, I don\u2019t think you would have believed me. I don\u2019t think anybody would have believed me.\u201d Admitting that there is still more work to be done, the Tesco boss denies it will take as long as five years to get the retailer back on track. \u201cBut I think this is something that probably takes more than 15 months.\u201d Lewis, who turned 50 and got married last year, just as he was trying to jump-start the Tesco juggernaut, says his focus so far has been on getting existing shoppers to spend more. \u201cEverybody was commenting on how people were no longer shopping at Tesco. But when we sat down and did the analysis, really very objectively and brutally, we found that people were not leaving Tesco, but they were changing their buying behaviour. They used to shop with us six times out of 10, and now they shopped five times out of 10. They weren\u2019t avoiding Tesco; they were just doing some of their shopping elsewhere, for whatever reason. But if you are still coming into my shop, there is an opportunity to improve what I do for you when you are in.\u201d His response was to \u201cput all of the effort back into the stores. It wasn\u2019t an advertising-led campaign; it was all about doing it better in store. The first year, everything went into the service \u2013 availability, range and price.\u201d Now that Lewis appears to have steadied the ship after an \u201cunprecedented\u201d period of change at Tesco, he is planning to become more ambitious. In a bid to take on discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have stolen trade from all the leading supermarkets over the past five years, Tesco has just launched seven new \u201cfarm brands\u201d, including Redmere Farms for vegetables and Boswell Farms for beef. Lewis says he targeted items that were up to 17% cheaper at Aldi and Lidl. \u201cIt is the most aggressive investment we have made for Tesco shoppers in the past five years,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cFor us to close that price difference is a big investment.\u201d The idea is to persuade Tesco shoppers they don\u2019t need to make those extra visits to a discounter: \u201cI am now giving you something in my store that is better, at the same price. So why do you want to go and shop with somebody else?\u201d The farm brands have caused controversy, however, because Tesco invented the farm names. Farming groups have attacked the move as misleading \u2013 in that they suggest the produce comes from British farms when some of it is imported, even though the country of origin is marked on the packs. A top Irish chef has called the brands \u201can insult to real farmers\u201d. Lewis declares himself bemused by the outrage, not least because the discounters regularly create new brands closely based on existing products. \u201cThe discussion about \u2018Does this farm exist or not?\u2019 sort of forced a wry smile from me, because, actually, customers had no problem. Customers understood that the products come from farms \u2013 that was clearly true \u2013 and that no one farm that could ever supply all of Tesco.\u201d The next item on Lewis\u2019s agenda is a review of Tesco\u2019s own-label products and of the Clubcard, the loyalty scheme that helped take the retailer to the No 1 spot when it was launched by Sir Terry Leahy in the 1990s. The Clubcard has, he reckons, been used by the grocer in the wrong way for some time and needs a revamp. \u201cIt is 21 years old at the end of this year and it could probably do with being brought into the 21st century,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cWe got ourselves to a place where our pricing on shelf was not competitive, but we tried to compensate for that by giving coupons through Clubcard.\u201d That was a bad idea, according to Lewis, because most customers can\u2019t work out whether that means they are getting a good or a bad deal. Customers, he says, \u201c don\u2019t at all do that equation in their head\u201d. So he wants Clubcard to go back to its roots \u2013 as a loyalty card that is \u201ca genuine reward for loyalty \u2013 a genuine thank you, if you like\u201d. However, as the Tesco boss ploughs on with his attempts to modernise the company, the SFO investigation is still hanging over it, with the potential for hundreds of millions of pounds in fines if it is found guilty of misconduct. But he claims that prospect is not a major distraction, and he will deal with whatever the eventual outcome is. \u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cI think everybody is aware of the investigation. We are co-operating fully with it, but there are very few people inside the business who are actually dealing with it. On a day-to-day basis, 99.999% of our employees are not affected by it. \u201cFor sure we still don\u2019t know what will happen. We are completely waiting for that to materialise. I am sure we will get to a place where that comes back on to the public agenda. We will have to deal with that, and there will be an impact on the business as we do.\u201d He is not keen to expand on speculation that he might be seeking a deferred prosecution agreement with the SFO, which would allow the company to reach a settlement over the scandal. \u201cI have to say the people who are speculating know way more than I do. That is probably the best answer I can give you. I can\u2019t say anything. There isn\u2019t anything to say. There really isn\u2019t anything to say.\u201d The accounting scandal dragged the Tesco brand to its lowest depths when it emerged in September 2014. Lewis admits that it put \u201ca dent\u201d in Tesco\u2019s image but insists the standing of the brand can recover. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s better than it was a year ago, but not yet as well as it was in its heyday in the middle of the 2000s.\u201d But, he says, the corporate image and the shopping experience are two different things. \u201cWhen you talk to someone about their shopping experience and the people in their store, by and large it\u2019s really still positive. But their image of the corporation was driven by our relationship with our suppliers and the way our property strategy sometimes clashed with local communities.\u201d His response has been to \u201ccompletely \u2013 and I mean absolutely completely \u2013 redraw the relationship with our suppliers, and to take a completely different approach to property, in terms of not building any more stores and actually giving some sites back to the community\u201d. He doesn\u2019t mention that plans for most of the new stores were abandoned because they were uneconomic. \u201cThere is still more we have to do in rebuilding the brand, but we want to open people\u2019s minds to the idea that Tesco can be a different sort of place.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Just six months after Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, warned that UK retailers face a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/09/national-living-wage-business-rates-lethal-cocktail-says-tesco\" title=\"\">\u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d</a>, BHS collapsed into administration, leaving the high street with its biggest failure since the financial crisis. There are clearly unique circumstances surrounding the demise of BHS, but Lewis\u2019s warning about business rates, the national living wage and the apprenticeship levy was, without doubt, prescient.</p> <p>Today, he says, there are \u201csome pretty big macro challenges\u201d ahead for retailing. \u201cBusiness rates is real, the living wage for the industry will be real, the apprenticeship levy will be real.\u201d</p> <p>Online retailers \u2013 and the way they are taxed \u2013 present another problem. \u201cYou have got a situation that nobody likes to talk about, which is that there is a structural advantage to going digital and online if the largest single tax that we [store-based retailers] pay is a property-based rates system.\u201d This he sees as \u201ca very, very, very big challenge\u201d.</p> <p>The government has offered retailers an olive branch by linking the annual increase in business rates to the consumer price index instead of the higher retail price index, and has pledged to revalue properties more regularly, so that rates more accurately reflect the economic environment.</p> <p>But Lewis is concerned that plans to allow to councils set local business rates, rather than it being done by central government, could lead to store closures: \u201cWe don\u2019t honestly know what going local will mean. We will get different interpretations from one district to the next, which will suddenly start skewing the profitability of stores.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba530c3ae28cd1c3aafd9f3ce5009beeee333575\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba530c3ae28cd1c3aafd9f3ce5009beeee333575/0_81_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In January 2015, a few months after he took over as chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, Lewis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/jan/28/tescos-store-closures-and-abandoned-developments-interactive\" title=\"\">announced the closure of 43 Tesco stores </a> and scrapped plans to build another 49, as part of his plan to turn the group around.</p> <p>The former Unilever marketing man had never run a shop when he was hired to put a stop to a three-year sales slide at Tesco. As if that was not enough of a challenge, within three weeks Lewis was engulfed in the biggest crisis in the company\u2019s history when a whistleblower alerted him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/tesco-could-face-500m-fine-accounting-scandal-analysts-say\" title=\"\">an accounting scandal.</a></p> <p>Since then, the Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into Tesco, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/22/tesco-suffers-record-64bn-loss\" title=\"\">made a \u00a36.4bn annual loss</a> for 2014 \u2013 one of the biggest in British corporate history \u2013 and Lewis has axed thousands of jobs in an attempt to cut costs.</p> <p>Tesco\u2019s most recent results showed signs of progress. It r<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/tesco-no-longer-in-crisis-chief-executive-profit-sales-share-price\" title=\"\">eported pre-tax profits of \u00a3162m for the year to 27 February</a>, which included a 0.9% rise in like-for-like sales in the final quarter of the year in the UK.</p> <p>That performance is a long way from Tesco\u2019s peak profit of more than \u00a34bn in 2012, and shares in the company have fallen by a third over the past year as investors realised, after an initial burst of optimism when Lewis arrived, that the grocer still faces a very long road back to full health.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Lewis has been handsomely rewarded for the progress made so far. On Friday it was revealed that he had picked up<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/tesco-boss-dave-lewis-bonus-salary\" title=\"\"> a bonus of almost \u00a33m on top of his \u00a31.25m salary</a>. Tesco\u2019s UK staff are also sharing a turnaround bonus worth \u00a3185m, or 5% of their salaries.</p> <p>Lewis robustly defends the work that has been done so far. \u201cIf I had told you when I joined that we would take a 5% drop in like-for-like sales and turn it into positive like-for-like growth at the end of last year with prices down by more than 4%, I don\u2019t think you would have believed me. I don\u2019t think anybody would have believed me.\u201d</p> <p>Admitting that there is still more work to be done, the Tesco boss denies it will take as long as five years to get the retailer back on track. \u201cBut I think this is something that probably takes more than 15 months.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis, who turned 50 and got married last year, just as he was trying to jump-start the Tesco juggernaut, says his focus so far has been on getting existing shoppers to spend more.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody was commenting on how people were no longer shopping at Tesco. But when we sat down and did the analysis, really very objectively and brutally, we found that people were not leaving Tesco, but they were changing their buying behaviour. They used to shop with us six times out of 10, and now they shopped five times out of 10. They weren\u2019t avoiding Tesco; they were just doing some of their shopping elsewhere, for whatever reason. But if you are still coming into my shop, there is an opportunity to improve what I do for you when you are in.\u201d</p> <p>His response was to \u201cput all of the effort back into the stores. It wasn\u2019t an advertising-led campaign; it was all about doing it better in store. The first year, everything went into the service \u2013 availability, range and price.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Lewis appears to have steadied the ship after an \u201cunprecedented\u201d period of change at Tesco, he is planning to become more ambitious.</p> <p>In a bid to take on discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have stolen trade from all the leading supermarkets over the past five years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/21/tesco-revamps-own-label-range-fight-discounters-aldi-lidl\" title=\"\">Tesco has just launched seven new \u201cfarm brands\u201d</a>, including Redmere Farms for vegetables and Boswell Farms for beef.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d28b065d8fe4cae60a54472114c9731402078ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d28b065d8fe4cae60a54472114c9731402078ba/0_402_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco farm brand beef\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco farm brand beef</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lewis says he targeted items that were up to 17% cheaper at Aldi and Lidl. \u201cIt is the most aggressive investment we have made for Tesco shoppers in the past five years,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cFor us to close that price difference is a big investment.\u201d</p> <p>The idea is to persuade Tesco shoppers they don\u2019t need to make those extra visits to a discounter: \u201cI am now giving you something in my store that is better, at the same price. So why do you want to go and shop with somebody else?\u201d</p> <p>The farm brands have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/mar/22/tescos-fictional-farms-a-marketing-strategy-past-its-sell-by-date\" title=\"\">caused controversy</a>, however, because Tesco invented the farm names. Farming groups have attacked the move as misleading \u2013 in that they suggest the produce comes from British farms when some of it is imported, even though the country of origin is marked on the packs. A top Irish chef has called the brands <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mistereatgalway/status/714509524946825216\" title=\"\">\u201can insult to real farmers\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Lewis declares himself bemused by the outrage, not least because the discounters regularly create new brands closely based on existing products.</p> <p>\u201cThe discussion about \u2018Does this farm exist or not?\u2019 sort of forced a wry smile from me, because, actually, customers had no problem. Customers understood that the products come from farms \u2013 that was clearly true \u2013 and that no one farm that could ever supply all of Tesco.\u201d</p> <p>The next item on Lewis\u2019s agenda is a review of Tesco\u2019s own-label products and of the Clubcard, the loyalty scheme that helped take the retailer to the No&#xa0;1 spot when it was launched by Sir Terry Leahy in the 1990s.</p> <p>The Clubcard has, he reckons, been used by the grocer in the wrong way for some time and needs a revamp. \u201cIt is 21 years old at the end of this year and it could probably do with being brought into the 21st century,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cWe got ourselves to a place where our pricing on shelf was not competitive, but we tried to compensate for that by giving coupons through Clubcard.\u201d</p> <p>That was a bad idea, according to Lewis, because most customers can\u2019t work out whether that means they are getting a good or a bad deal. Customers, he says, \u201c don\u2019t at all do that equation in their head\u201d.</p> <p>So he wants Clubcard to go back to its roots \u2013 as a loyalty card that is \u201ca genuine reward for loyalty \u2013 a genuine thank you, if you like\u201d.</p> <p>However, as the Tesco boss ploughs on with his attempts to modernise the company, the SFO investigation is still hanging over it, with the potential for hundreds of millions of pounds in fines if it is found guilty of misconduct.</p> <p>But he claims that prospect is not a major distraction, and he will deal with whatever the eventual outcome is. \u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cI think everybody is aware of the investigation.

I am sure we will get to a place where that comes back on to the public agenda.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An anti-counterfeiting group said on Friday it was suspending Alibaba\u2019s membership following an uproar by some companies that view the Chinese e-commerce giant as the world\u2019s largest marketplace for fakes. The International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition also told members it had failed to inform the board of directors about conflicts of interest involving the group\u2019s president, Robert Barchiesi. Earlier it was reported Barchiesi had stock in Alibaba, had close ties to an Alibaba executive and had used family members to help run the coalition. The coalition, in a letter to members sent after the report came out, said conflicts were not disclosed to the board \u201cbecause of a weakness in our corporate governance procedures.\u201d It said the failure was not because of \u201cinaction on Bob\u2019s part,\u201d referring to Barchiesi. The coalition said it is hiring an independent firm to review its corporate governance policies. In its letter, the board said as a result of members\u2019 concerns, it was suspending a new class of membership under which Alibaba had recently joined. The move would affect two other companies that signed up under the new rules. Jennifer Kuperman, Alibaba\u2019s head of international corporate affairs, said companies such as Alibaba were important for solving the problem of counterfeiting. \u201cWhether or not we are a member of the IACC, we will continue our productive and results-oriented relationships with brands, governments and all industry partners,\u201d she said. At issue is the independence of a small but influential coalition that lobbies US officials and testifies before Congress. Alibaba\u2019s membership could help shape the global fight against counterfeits. Fakes damage companies\u2019 bottom lines, can harm consumers who unknowingly buy such products, and feed a vast underground money-laundering industry that supports criminal syndicates. In recent weeks Gucci America, Michael Kors and Tiffany have quit the Washington DC-based coalition, which has more than 250 members. Several ties between the group\u2019s president and Alibaba have been found: Barchiesi has owned Alibaba stock since its 2014 listing in New York. The IACC said the holdings represent \u201ca small percentage of his investment portfolio.\u201d Matthew Bassiur, who took over as vice president of global intellectual property enforcement at Alibaba in January, hired Barchiesi\u2019s son, Robert Barchiesi II, to work at Apple in 2011. Alibaba said that hire was made on merit. Apple declined to comment. Bassiur is a founding board member of the ICE Foundation, which supports US Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees. Since 2013, the foundation has been run by Barchiesi\u2019s other son, James Barchiesi. That same year, the foundation\u2019s board voted to award a contract for \u201cfiscal and operational management\u201d to a private company, also run by James Barchiesi. The foundation has received grants of $10,000 from the anti-counterfeiting coalition every year since 2012, tax filings show. Kuperman said Bassiur\u2019s expertise would help the company \u201cfurther instill trust in our marketplaces\u201d. \u201cWe are highly confident in his abilities and proud to have him at Alibaba in this critical global role,\u201d she said. Robert Barchiesi had also come under fire for his stewardship of the coalition and allegations of conflicts of interest on the move to include Alibaba. \u201cIt\u2019s crossed the line ethically,\u201d said Deborah Greaves, a partner at Brutzkus Gubner law firm and a coalition board member from 2011 to 2013. She said she did not know Barchiesi had stock in Alibaba until Friday. \u201cReally problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything the IACC does that makes Alibaba look better potentially drives up the price of the stock,\u201d said Greaves, whose firm is a coalition member. \u201cAs a board member, I would never have bought stock in Alibaba.\u201d The storm has laid bare the loathing some feel for a company heralded as one of communist China\u2019s greatest capitalist success stories. Critics had feared Alibaba would use IACC membership to gain legitimacy while papering over fundamental flaws in how it does business. Gucci and other brands owned by France\u2019s Kering Group allege in US court filings that Alibaba knowingly profits from the sale of fakes. Alibaba has dismissed the case as \u201cwasteful litigation\u201d. Michael Kors\u2019 general counsel has called Alibaba \u201cour most dangerous and damaging adversary\u201d. The coalition\u2019s tax filings show that, in addition to the ties to Alibaba, Robert Barchiesi runs his organization like a family business. The coalition paid companies founded and run by one of Barchiesi\u2019s sons nearly $150,000 from 2012 to 2014 for rental costs, accounting, IT support and advertising. It employs the son\u2019s wife, Kathryn Barchiesi, as a program manager. Though the coalition attests its financial statements were reviewed by an independent accountant, tax filings show the accounting firm was owned by Barchiesi\u2019s son. In a statement, the coalition said the family connections had been disclosed and the contracts were fairly valued. \u201cThe board of directors of the IACC believes that Mr Barchiesi\u2019s performance as president has been exemplary, and he has the board\u2019s full confidence and support,\u201d the statement said. The group told its members the same in its letter, which it said was a response to an anonymous letter sent to board members on Wednesday that detailed a list of concerns about governance. The letter threatened a mass walkout unless Alibaba was pushed out. The writer claimed to represent a group of concerned members, but that could not be verified. \u201cWhat you have allowed this organization to become is utterly disgusting and changes must be made immediately,\u201d the email says. The move to suspend Alibaba comes before the IACC\u2019s spring conference in Orlando next week, where the Chinese company\u2019s founder Jack Ma was scheduled to speak.",

The move would affect two other companies that signed up under the new rules.</p> <p>Jennifer Kuperman, Alibaba\u2019s head of international corporate affairs, said companies such as Alibaba were important for solving the problem of counterfeiting.</p> <p>\u201cWhether or not we are a member of the IACC, we will continue our productive and results-oriented relationships with brands, governments and all industry partners,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/14/chinese-internet-giant-alibaba-buys-south-china-morning-post-for-266m\">Chinese internet giant Alibaba buys South China Morning Post for $266m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At issue is the independence of a small but influential coalition that lobbies US officials and testifies before Congress.</p> <p>Alibaba\u2019s membership could help shape the global fight against counterfeits. Fakes damage companies\u2019 bottom lines, can harm consumers who unknowingly buy such products, and feed a vast underground money-laundering industry that supports criminal syndicates.</p> <p>In recent weeks Gucci America, Michael Kors and Tiffany have quit the Washington DC-based coalition, which has more than 250 members.</p> <p>Several ties between the group\u2019s president and Alibaba have been found:</p> <ul> <li>Barchiesi has owned Alibaba stock since its 2014 listing in New York. The IACC said the holdings represent \u201ca small percentage of his investment portfolio.\u201d</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Matthew Bassiur, who took over as vice president of global intellectual property enforcement at Alibaba in January, hired Barchiesi\u2019s son, Robert Barchiesi II, to work at Apple in 2011. Alibaba said that hire was made on merit. Apple declined to comment.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Bassiur is a founding board member of the ICE Foundation, which supports US Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees. Since 2013, the foundation has been run by Barchiesi\u2019s other son, James Barchiesi. That same year, the foundation\u2019s board voted to award a contract for \u201cfiscal and operational management\u201d to a private company, also run by James Barchiesi. The foundation has received grants of $10,000 from the anti-counterfeiting coalition every year since 2012, tax filings show.<br></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/09/yahoo-abandons-plan-sell-alibaba\">Yahoo abandons plan to sell $31bn stake in Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kuperman said Bassiur\u2019s expertise would help the company \u201cfurther instill trust in our marketplaces\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are highly confident in his abilities and proud to have him at Alibaba in this critical global role,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Robert Barchiesi had also come under fire for his stewardship of the coalition and allegations of conflicts of interest on the move to include Alibaba.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crossed the line ethically,\u201d said Deborah Greaves, a partner at Brutzkus Gubner law firm and a coalition board member from 2011 to 2013.

Gucci and other brands owned by France\u2019s Kering Group allege in US court filings that Alibaba knowingly profits from the sale of fakes. Alibaba has dismissed the case as \u201cwasteful litigation\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Kors\u2019 general counsel has called Alibaba \u201cour most dangerous and damaging adversary\u201d.</p> <p>The coalition\u2019s tax filings show that, in addition to the ties to Alibaba, Robert Barchiesi runs his organization like a family business. The coalition paid companies founded and run by one of Barchiesi\u2019s sons nearly $150,000 from 2012 to 2014 for rental costs, accounting, IT support and advertising. It employs the son\u2019s wife, Kathryn Barchiesi, as a program manager.</p> <p>Though the coalition attests its financial statements were reviewed by an independent accountant, tax filings show the accounting firm was owned by Barchiesi\u2019s son.</p> <p>In a statement, the coalition said the family connections had been disclosed and the contracts were fairly valued. \u201cThe board of directors of the IACC believes that Mr Barchiesi\u2019s performance as president has been exemplary, and he has the board\u2019s full confidence and support,\u201d the statement said. </p> <p>The group told its members the same in its letter, which it said was a response to an anonymous letter sent to board members on Wednesday that detailed a list of concerns about governance. The letter threatened a mass walkout unless Alibaba was pushed out. The writer claimed to represent a group of concerned members, but that could not be verified.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you have allowed this organization to become is utterly disgusting and changes must be made immediately,\u201d the email says.</p> <p>The move to suspend Alibaba comes before the IACC\u2019s spring conference in Orlando next week, where the Chinese company\u2019s founder Jack Ma was scheduled to speak.</p>",
