      "bodyText": "The inconclusive outcome of Britain\u2019s snap election will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations that were due to start next week, a leading credit rating agency has warned. Moody\u2019s, one of the big financial bodies that assigns credit scores to governments, said Theresa May\u2019s failure to secure an outright majority would also hurt the UK\u2019s standing on international debt markets because it was likely to result in more public borrowing. As the pound fell for the second consecutive session on Monday, a senior economist at another ratings agency, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, warned that already faltering UK economic growth would be weakened further by the latest bout of political instability. \u201cIn terms of the outlook for growth, it\u2019s clear that things are not going in the right direction,\u201d S&amp;P European chief economist Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris. \u201cThis latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u201d Six said, according to Reuters. He also played down a view in the markets that the Conservatives\u2019 reduced standing would lead to a soft Brexit deal. \u201cOn the contrary, I think it\u2019s possible to imagine a scenario, likely but not certain, in which Mrs May seeks to push for a very hard line towards the EU to show to her own party that she\u2019s holding the course,\u201d said Six. Moody\u2019s, by contrast, said the UK could well end up with a soft Brexit deal on the back of last week\u2019s election result, which saw Labour significantly increase its number of seats in parliament. But the ratings agency also warned of a delay to Brexit talks due to start on 19 June or \u201cat least a period in which no substantive issues are discussed\u201d. That would mean the UK loses precious negotiating time as the clock ticks towards an exit date set for March 2019 \u2013 two years on from May triggering article 50. \u201cThe UK government will \u2026 be under significant time pressure in these negotiations. Given the tight deadline, it will be imperative in our view for the government to secure an agreement for a transition period,\u201d said Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice president at Moody\u2019s investors service. She added that the election outcome would be widely interpreted as indicating a pronounced shift away from May\u2019s \u201chard Brexit\u201d objectives, focused on exit from the single market and EU customs union, tightening of immigration rules for EU nationals and a rejection of the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. \u201cWhile it is unclear at this stage which changes to its strategy the government will contemplate, it may be that \u2018softer\u2019 versions of Brexit will now be considered,\u201d added Muehlbronner. Moody\u2019s stripped the UK of its coveted triple A status in 2013 to put it one notch below at Aa1. The rating agency downgraded the outlook on the rating to negative from stable on 24 June last year, the day after the EU referendum. In Monday\u2019s update, it said recent political developments were \u201ccredit negative\u201d given that the government was likely to put plans to cut the deficit on hold. Economic indicators in the months following the referendum suggested businesses and consumers had shrugged off the result and the UK economy was one of the best performers among its peers in 2016. But it has slowed sharply this year and there are signs companies are growing more worried about imminent Brexit talks between a weakened UK government and the rest of the EU. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF will issue a plea on Tuesday for the government to rethink its Brexit strategy and put access to the single market and a form of customs union, along with a suitable transition period, at the heart of its negotiating strategy. \u201cThe new government\u2019s priorities must radically refocus Brexit negotiations around trade and close cooperation, ensuring a smooth exit from the EU,\u201d said EEF\u2019s chief executive, Terry Scuoler. \u201cThere are numerous ways of establishing a new relationship with the EU and, given we\u2019ve just wasted a year, the government needs to move away from its previous rhetoric and start repairing relations with EU partners.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty has on business leaders, and the consequences could \u2013 if not addressed immediately \u2013 be disastrous for the UK economy,\u201d says Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, pointing to a poll of members that showed 57% were quite or very pessimistic about the economy over the next 12 months. We heard similar predictions of gloom from the business world after last year\u2019s referendum, of course. They did not materialise, or at least not in the style imagined. The Brexit flunk was a brief affair and the Bank of England and almost every other forecaster was obliged to admit that Armageddon would not be arriving as previously advertised. Could the plot run so happily again? Don\u2019t bet a penny, or a euro cent, on it. Two factors behind last year\u2019s breeze-on-through attitude have run their course. First, real incomes are now falling. When they were rising last year, it was relatively easy for consumers not to fret about an event due to happen, in yet-to-be-defined form, in 2019. In any case, 52% of the voters had got want they wanted. Exporters, too, had to be concerned that slashing investment overnight could be costly. The gift - for them - of a lower pound had to be exploited. The second factor was that article 50 had not been triggered. Now, of course, the clock is ticking, which adds a truly dangerous current to the turmoil in Westminster. Theresa May\u2019s vision of a hard Brexit may be dying - let\u2019s hope so - but the odds must also have shortened on a chaotic Brexit in which no deal is done because consensus proves impossible. In these circumstances, it would only be natural for a board of directors to adopt extreme caution when making investment decisions. The forces pushing in the other direction look weak. The government could give the public sector a pay rise, for example, but that may not be enough to shift the dial on real incomes. The second quarter GDP figures may not be affected by the uncertainty since most surveys suggested an improvement from the first. By the autumn, however, the picture could look very different. The IoD may be overdoing it with words such as \u201cdisastrous\u201d, but it is basically right. The political mess, for as long as it lasts, is bound to damage investment. Time for a reboot on nuclear subsidies \u201cThe momentum behind these [renewable] technologies is unstoppable now,\u201d says Valentina Kretzschmar, director of research at the energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. \u201cThey [the oil companies] are recognising it is a megatrend; it\u2019s not a fad, it\u2019s not going away. There is definitely a risk to their core business.\u201d Well let\u2019s hope so. Let\u2019s also hope that government recognises that the same megatrend that is bringing down the cost of wind and solar generation has implications for the UK\u2019s nuclear programme. Even politicians obsessed by grand Hinkley Point-style projects cannot fail to have noticed some of the milestones achieved by solar and wind recently. Costs of generation are falling to a point that makes Hinkley\u2019s inflation-linked subsidies look even more of a swindle at the expensive of UK bill-payers. In the next round of auctions for government subsidies, energy experts predict offshore wind will be demonstrably cheaper than nuclear. That is for windfarms that must be operational from 2023 to 2025. Over the next 35 years \u2013 the life on Hinkley Point\u2019s index-linked contract \u2013 that pricing gap will only widen. Offshore wind will get cheaper, nuclear won\u2019t. Yes, it\u2019s true, as the nuclear lobby always objects, that increased use of wind and solar requires a corresponding increase in always-on reliable baseload supply. But that does not imply that the UK requires new nuclear capacity on anything like the scale policy currently imagines, especially if the next megatrend arrives in the form of a revolution in energy storage. It may be too late to stop Hinkley itself because so many costs have been sunk in Somerset already, but the rest of nuclear programme should be hauled in for review at the earliest opportunity. It would be Theresa May U-turn worth cheering. Keep business away from ballots It\u2019s ghastly when self-important business leaders write mass-signature letters to newspapers telling people how to vote. Writing directly to your staff is worse. Bosses at the privately-owned Storm Technologies and Jennings Racing, authors of two versions of \u201cvote Conservative\u201d dispatches, ought to know better. The latter is a bookmaker and should have remembered the admirable stance adopted by the Ladbrokes boss Jim Mullen in 2015. Mullen got the job in the middle of the campaign and immediately disassociated himself from his predecessor Richard Glynn\u2019s letter-signing tendencies. \u201cOur business is to take bets on the general election, not to tell people how to vote,\u201d said Mullen.

Technology stocks have done far better than the rest of the market this year and they were trading close to all-time highs before Friday\u2019s drop. The S&amp;P 500 technology index shed 2.7% on Friday for one of its worst days of the year. The climb has made fortunes for investors, and for tech entrepreneurs. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has seen his net worth soar by almost $20bn (\u00a316bn) in the past five months to $85.2bn. Bezos\u2019s fortune is closing in on that of Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, whose net worth is $89.3bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos could become the world\u2019s richest man if the tech stocks continue to grow. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said it was too early to say whether the last two days of trading would develop into something worse for the tech sector but added that there were worrying signs. \u201cThe tech sector has been the stock market\u2019s best performer, and some people may be taking profits or rotating their investments into different sectors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is also some concern about what the Fed will do.\u201d Stock markets have been bolstered by the huge amounts of money the Fed and other central banks have poured into bond markets in an attempt to keep interest rates at record lows. Low rates have made stock investments more attractive but the Fed has signaled that rates in the US are now on the rise, albeit from a low base. The Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday this week and its chairwoman, Janet Yellen, is expected to announce another rate rise at her press conference when the meeting concludes. \u201cEveryone fully expects a rate rise this time,\u201d said Ablin. \u201cWhat matters is what the Fed says about the rest of the year. Given their gains, tech is probably going to be the most sensitive sector to be affected by that. We will know more after Wednesday.\u201d Strong quarterly earnings have helped technology stocks fill a void left by financial and industrial stocks after a post-election rally faded. The S&amp;P 500 technology index has risen 18.5% this year and is on track to register its best yearly performance since 2014. \u201cThe real heavy lifting, or 40% of the move, that we saw was really on the back of a handful of technology stocks,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets. \u201cSo when you have a trade that is so crowded, that unwind becomes as dramatic as the one we saw on Friday.\u201d Investors saw an opportunity to book profits on Friday after Apple shares plunged amid reports that the company is using slower modems in forthcoming iPhones, compared with those used in rival phones. Shares of the world\u2019s most valuable publicly listed company were off 2.46% at $145.32 on Monday. Mizuho Securities also cut its rating on Apple\u2019s stock to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d on Monday, citing it has outperformed this year and enthusiasm over the \u201cupcoming product cycle is fully captured at current levels\u201d. Fergus Shaw, fund manager at Cerno Capital, told Reuters: \u201cThis is the nature of the tech sector.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Sterling has lost ground today as fresh signs of UK political instability rattled investors. The pound has hit a seven-month low against the euro and is close to an eight-week low against the US dollar. Here\u2019s today\u2019s lows: \u00a31 = \u20ac1.1280, lowest since November 2016 \u00a31 = $1.1265, close to the eight-week low set in Friday The selloff came as rumours swirled through Westminster that next Monday\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech might be postponed. This has highlighted that Theresa May\u2019s position in Downing Street remains vulnerable (and potentially creates a very awkward diary clash with the monarch\u2019s duties at Royal Ascot.) Political insiders are also reporting that the cabinet is split, with some members pushing for a softer Brexit plan. Business leaders have warned that confidence has been badly hit by the hung parliament delivered by last week\u2019s general election, which has left May chasing some sort of deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland. The Institute for Directors said: \u201cIt is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u2013 if not addressed immediately \u2013 be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. Rating agencies have weighed in too. Moody\u2019s warned that the hung parliament was \u2018credit negative\u2019 for the UK; a hint that Britain\u2019s credit rating could be downgraded. They said: Election result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u201d. S&amp;P\u2019s chief economist predicted that UK growth would be hurt. Harvard University added to the mix, with a study finding that most businesses want to remain in the single market. The Resolution Foundation warned that UK firms are worryingly unprepared for migration curbs. Meanwhile on Wall Street, US technology giants are suffering a second day of losses, with the Nasdaq down 1% in early trading. Is it the end of the tech boom?... ...not necessarily! Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Attention is concentrated on the ongoing rout in US tech stocks. Having been such a one-way bet so far this year, this sudden turn to the downside will have caught out more than a few over-eager latecomers. However, those rushing to proclaim the demise of one of the big rallies of not only the past year but the past eight years too need to be careful \u2013 there will be plenty of dip buyers out there who have been waiting for a pullback of this kind of size. And in Europe, the markets have just closed for the day. The FTSE 100 shed 15 points, or 0.25%, to 7511 - failing to get any benefit from the cheaper pound. The the German DAX shed almost 1% and the French CAC lost 1.2% That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool has written an interesting article on how sterling will suffer from the political crisis in Westminster. He\u2019s analysed UK economic uncertainty (measured by recording how many articles on economic and political unrest appear in the media each day), and tracked it against the value of the pound. He conclude that there is a \u2018negative relationship\u2019 between the two, with sterling suffering losses whenever It is clear that the negative relationship between policy uncertainty and the euro to sterling exchange rate is intensifying. This implies that increases in economic policy uncertainty are met with depreciations in the sterling to euro exchange rate running up to June 9, 2017. This indicates that currency markets do not feel the government has a strong negotiation position for Brexit (otherwise sterling wouldn\u2019t be so volatile). Ellington concludes that this means trouble ahead.... This, coupled with May\u2019s lack of support in the general election, should put her leadership into question, particularly when it comes to entering divorce talks with the EU. The very fact that the domestic political landscape of the UK is shrouded by yet another layer of uncertainty suggests that economic policy, the exchange rate, and indeed the wider economy, is in for a rough ride. Here\u2019s the full piece: Why the hung parliament spells economic turbulence for the UK economy The Institute of Director\u2019s warning that UK business confidence has plunged since the general election has caused quite a stir. Here\u2019s some of the best reaction: Markus Kuger, senior economist at business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet \u201cAfter the surprising election result, political and economic uncertainty in the UK has risen considerably. The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u2013 and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u2019 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results. This means that companies will have to wait even longer to assess the impact of these negotiations on their business. \u201cOur analysis indicates that uncertainty will remain high in the next 18 months, regardless of what happens in the wake of the election, and we are maintaining our risk rating of DB2d and our \u2018deteriorating\u2019 risk outlook for the UK economy. We predict that, in the long run, the election result could make a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit - which we believe would be harmful for the British economy - impossible. Jenni Hibbert, Managing Partner for Financial Services Europe &amp; Africa at executive headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles \u201cWorries about the future are not just relegated to those in financial services: we recently conducted a wide-ranging survey with hospitality CEOs, the UK\u2019s fourth largest employer accounting for 180,000 businesses in the UK, with less than one in ten confident about the future and almost half describing themselves as concerned.\u201d Former UK shadow chancellor Ed Balls has also weighed in on Brexit today by co-authoring a report which found that a bad deal would be a disaster for the UK. A survey of small UK businesses by Harvard University found that \u201calmost all\u201d business leaders wanted to retain membership of the single market and customs union, to make it easier to keep trading with the EU. Balls says: \u201cAt the time of the referendum, many British companies thought that Brexit might lead to a reduced regulatory burden. But now they\u2019re worried that if Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, the opposite will be true.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: During the election campaign, both the Labour and Conservative leadership said Britain would leave the single market after Brexit - in order to impose migration controls. However, Labour\u2019s Brexit secretary, Sir Kier Starmer, has suggested today that the UK could stay inside the single market; a reminder that there are differing views on Brexit in both major parties... Newsflash: Shares in tech companies are falling again at the start of trading on Wall Street. The Nasdaq has shed 1%, losing 64 points to 6,143, at the start of trading. That adds to Friday\u2019s 1.8% tumble, Amazon, Alphabet/Google and Apple are all leading the fallers, as concerns grow that these tech giants have become overvalue. Ouch! The pound has just hit a new seven-month low against the euro, and is falling further against the dollar too. Sterling dropped as low as \u20ac1.1280, down almost one euro cent today. That\u2019s its lowest level since last November. Sterling is also continuing to lose ground against the US dollar; it\u2019s now down 0.5% at $1.2671- close to the eight-week low hit after the general election. The selloff comes as Theresa May government fails to show a great deal of strength and stability - with the Queen\u2019s speech reportedly postponed. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, argues that the pound will suffer fresh losses as Brexit talks begin next week. He isn\u2019t convinced that a move towards a \u2018softer Brexit\u2019 will provide much support. I personally still see downside risks for the Sterling and see the potential for the market to become encouraged towards selling in the likelihood that the UK is set to begin negotiations next week and looks very unprepared for such complex negotiations. The whole reason for the UK election in the first place was so that Theresa May would have more powers to influence the Brexit process, but not only has this play backfired, the UK looks more unprepared than ever to go head-to-head with the EU as it currently stands. I personally remain bearish on the Sterling. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has also weighed in on the issue of EU migrants. She warns that British firms can\u2019t be expected to replace EU nationals with UK citizens, at a time when employment in Britain is already at record high levels. Fairbairn also told the Resolution Foundation\u2019s conference that politicians need to concentrate on the economy again.. Speaking of EU migration.... Britain\u2019s businesses are \u201ctotally unprepared\u201d for the drop in migration after Brexit, according to a new report from the Resolution Foundation today. The think tank polled more than 500 UK businesses who employ EU workers, and found that 17% expect no change to the current system of freedom of movement for EU/EEA nationals to the UK. Another 30% believe this system will be maintained for anyone from the EU who arrives in Britain with a job offer. These are \u201ctotally unrealistic expectations\u201d, warns Resolution, because: The Prime Minister in contrast has ruled out either option, stating that her government \u2013 rather than firms\u2019 demand for workers \u2013 will control migrant numbers. The Conservative Manifesto recommitted the government to reducing net migration down to the tens of thousands. The report was presented to a conference in London today, which also heard that the UK agriculture sector needs tens of thousands of season workers each year. The National Farmers Union is urging the government to consider this issue during the Brexit talks: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Another dollop of uncertainty has just landed on our plates; Downing Street are hinting that the Queen\u2019s Speech might not take place next Monday after all. Our political liveblogger Andrew Sparrow has just returned from the regular lobby briefing with Theresa May\u2019s spokesman, and reports: The spokesman said that the new leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, would be making a statement about the date of the Queen\u2019s speech in due course. The spokesman would not say anymore, but he would not confirm that it will go ahead as planned on Monday next week. It may be that the government has decided to delay it until it has agreed its deal with the DUP. A delay would be most unusual - and rather irksome for Queen Elizabeth II, who is expecting to spend most of next week at the Royal Ascot races. Sterling has fallen against every other major currency today, according to Bloomberg, which explains: The pound fell against all its Group-of-10 peers on the prospect of an unstable coalition government heading into Brexit talks with the European Union in a week\u2019s time. Betfair reckon there\u2019s a one-in-three chance that Britain will hold a second general election this year. Here are the latest odds: Year of Next General Election 2017 3.0 (2/1 or 33% chance) 2018 4.0 (3/1 or 25% chance) 2019 4.9 (4/1) 2020 8.8 (8/1) 2021 9.4 (17/2) 2022 7.6 (13/2) They\u2019ve also provided some odds for Theresa May\u2019s likely replacement: Next Conservative Leader Boris Johnson 3.4 (12/5) David Davis 4.7 (7/2) Amber Rudd 9.0 (8/1) Ruth Davidson 10.0 (9/1) Phillip Hammond 17.5 (16/1) Michael Gove 23.0 (22/1) Speculation that Theresa May might change her Brexit stance is propping up sterling, says Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. \u201cThe rise of softer Brexit speculation is another reason why the pound has not declined more sharply following the UK general election result\u201d. More here: Britain\u2019s unstable political situation means the pound will remain volatile for some times, says investment bank JP Morgan. It told its clients that: The UK delivered another electoral surprise this week with the Conservative party losing its majority in Parliament. This means the Conservatives would be reliant on the Northern Irish DUP with its 10 seats to establish a thin parliamentary majority. This raises questions about PM May\u2019s ability to deliver a hard Brexit given the desire in Northern Ireland for a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland. For sterling rates, this means markets are likely to be caught between the opposing forces of political instability associated with a Conservative minority government, and a potential softening of the Brexit stance. Moody\u2019s gloomy report on the UK\u2019s election has knocked the pound, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: \u201cSentiment around the pound took a bit of a dive in morning trading in London. After treading water around $1.274 for the last few days since the election, cable eased back below the $1.27 handle after Moody\u2019s warned that the election result is \u2018credit negative\u2019 for the UK. This seems to have woken traders from their slumber and the pound is on the defensive as we start the week. It wouldn\u2019t take much bad news from the UK political scene to force cable to take another leg lower. Still there is plenty of bid to catch on the way down as the dips are being viewed as short-term buying opportunities. Sentiment remains pretty bearish. As Moody\u2019s points out there is a chance of a softer Brexit but we must also think there is a heightened risk of a cliff-edge exit from the EU.\u201d Sterling is also dropping against the euro, losing 0.6% to \u20ac1.1322. On Friday it hit an eight-month low of \u20ac1.1285 before recovering a little. Update: the pound had now dropped below $1.27, towards the eight-week low struck on Friday morning as the election results came in. The pound is dipping back towards $1.27, down 0.2% today, as investors analyse these warnings from Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P and wait for developments in Westminster. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the drop in business confidence, and the slowdown in household spending, are worrying the City: This decline in economic indicators may have been a long time coming, yet with a weakened political mandate and Brexit negotiations about to start, it is likely that we will see the UK continue to struggle. The fallout from the UK election continues and will remain key to expectations for the pound. Newsflash from the Bank of England: Andy Haldane, the BoE\u2019s chief economist, has been reappointed to the Monetary Policy Committee. That means Haldane will continue to vote on UK interest rates and the Bank\u2019s stimulus programme until 2020. It\u2019s not a big surprise, but it is worth noting as Haldane is one of the most dovish members of the committee. Speaking of Brexit delays..... The formal Brexit talks are due to begin on 19 June, the same day as the Queen\u2019s speech.... Rating agency Moody\u2019s has also issued a report on the UK election, and it\u2019s not very cheery reading. It is titled: \u201cElection result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u201d. And it warns that negotiating to leave the EU will now be a more complicated process. Moody\u2019s fears that those talks (which are due to start next week) may be delayed, or may not focus on \u201csubstantive issues\u201d for a while as the Conservative Party tries to agree a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. Moody\u2019s is also worried that Britain\u2019s national debt will keep rising for longer, as the government wrestles with a slowing economy and the public backlash against austerity. That could be bad for Britain\u2019s credit rating, which is currently Aa1 with Moody\u2019s, one notch below AAA. But.... Moody\u2019s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be good for Britain\u2019s credit rating. Here are the key points from the report Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit. We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negative. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u201cvote against austerity\u201d. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising. However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u201csofter\u201d Brexit options, which could be credit positive. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u201ccliff\u201d risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u201chard\u201d Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought. Hence, a move towards \u201csofter\u201d versions of Brexit \u2013 potentially with continued access of some sort to the Single Market \u2013 might now be considered. And here\u2019s a chart showing why Moody\u2019s is worried about Britain\u2019s national debt: Britain\u2019s economic growth is likely to be damaged by the current political instability, according to the European chief economist of ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris that: \u201cFor the time being, the outlook remains negative.\u201d \u201cIn terms of the outlook for growth, it\u2019s clear that things are not going in the right direction. This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u201d Thanks to Reuters for the quotes....and this chart, showing how the UK economy has deteriorated recently: The shock election result has fuelled speculation that Britain may aim for a less \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit than Theresa May had planned. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg Bank explains: On the continent, most observers have taken the UK election result as a rebuke of Theresa May\u2019s hard Brexit rhetoric of the \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d kind. For example, EU Commission \u00d6ttinger has expressed hope that the UK may now agree to stay in the Customs Union and the Common Market, possibly by joining EFTA. To remain in the Common Market and thus maintain preferential access to the EU27 market (except for some financial products where regulators will insist that some activities have to be carried out under the direct sway of EU regulators), the UK would have to accept the free movement of labour and continue to pay into the EU budget like EFTA members do. Whether or not a Tory-led government could agree to that remains a very open question, though, to put it mildly. Indeed! And in the last few minutes, Brexit secretary David Davis has played down the idea that the government could soften its stance - insisting that leaving the EU meant leaving the single market. More in our Politics Live blog: Buzzfeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Traders will be watching Wall Street nervously when it opens later today, to see if technology stocks keep falling. Apple fell by 4% on Friday, while Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all shed 3% - wiping almost $100bn off their market value. The selloff comes after a long surge in tech stocks, so investors are wondering if the rally is over. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says other assets could be spooked.... Friday\u2019s sell off in some of the US\u2019s biggest tech names was sharp and severe on Friday. But was this just a bit of profit taking after a note from Goldman Sachs questioned the $600bn increase in some tech firms\u2019 market cap in the past year? This is an important question that we need answered as tech stock weakness is having an impact on other growth assets today. The MSCI emerging markets index fell on Friday, yet the Aussie dollar, which is correlated with growth assets, was relatively stable on Monday. The BBC has a good take on the IoD\u2019s business confidence survey: The uncertainty caused by the general election has led business confidence to sink \u201cthrough the floor\u201d, according to a lobby group. A snap poll of 700 members of the Institute of Directors found a \u201cdramatic drop\u201d in confidence following the hung parliament. Members saw no clear way to resolve the political impasse quickly, the IoD said. However, it found there was \u201cno desire\u201d for another election this year.... More here: Europe\u2019s stock markets are a sea of red this morning, as investors digest the tumble in UK business confidence in the last couple of days. Shares are being pulled down by worries over UK politics, and the selloff in the tech sector. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says there isn\u2019t much optimism in the City this morning. Falling around half a percent the UK index found itself back below the 7500 mark, if only just, as the Institute of Directors warned that its members were feeling pretty damn pessimistic about the state of the UK economy in the next 12 months. The pound, meanwhile, neither continued last week\u2019s decline nor substantially recovered any of those election-losses, opening 0.1% higher against the dollar and flat against the euro. The FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, has dropped by 50 points (or 0.25%) in early trading to 19,719. The IoD\u2019s gloomy warning on business confidence is helping to keep a lid on the pound this morning. Sterling is hovering around $1.274, close to Friday night\u2019s close. It tumbled by over two cents when the election exit polls came out on Thursday night. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, warns that the pound is vulnerable to political uncertainty, as prime minister May tries to cling onto power. With Theresa May scrambling to repair the self-inflicted damage suffered as a result of the election, there remains a huge amount of uncertainty around her position and with only a week to go before Brexit talks with the EU begin, I feel there may be a few more twists to come yet. May has not delivered the strong and stable government she wanted and instead looks weak and vulnerable. I find it hard to see how she recovers from this. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees, saying: Sentiment remains dented by politics following the UK\u2019s hung parliament and shift in the balance of UK political power. European stock markets have opened in the red, with the FTSE 100 losing 27 points (or 0.4%). Technology stocks are the biggest fallers, following a selloff on Wall Street on Friday night. Manish Singh of CrossBridge Capital, an investment advisory firm, isn\u2019t surprised that business confidence has fallen since the UK election. He says many business leaders are now pondering the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, after he smashed expectations and gained 32 seats. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Singh says: If you are a business, you really need to start thinking \u2018what is in the Labour manifesto?\u2019.... It will have some businesses worrying about Mr Corbyn\u2019s policies. Labour\u2019s manifesto included raising income tax on those earning over \u00a380,00 per year, increasing corporation tax, and renationalising the water companies, as well as free childcare, ending the freeze on welfare benefits and abolishing tuition fees. Singh says political instability can deter businesses from investing, especially when the Brexit talks are also hanging over them. But he also agrees that younger voters are right too feel aggrieved, as yound people in Europe will be poorer than previous generations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are set to fall this morning, as evidence piles up that Britain\u2019s mounting political uncertainty is hurting the economy. The Institute of Directors have issued a stark warning that business optimism has plunged after Theresa May lost her House of Commons majority last week. A new survey of IoD members found that 57% are either quite pessimistic or very pessimistic about the UK economy over the next 12 months. Just a fifth described themselves as optimistic -- which gives a \u2018net confidence\u2019 score of minus 37. That\u2019s a serious deterioration compared to the previous month, when 34% were optimistic and 37% pessimistic. The poll, conducted over the weekend, found that many business leaders are alarmed by the prospect of a hung parliament, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, says British politicians need to urgently refocus on the state of the economy. \u201cIt is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u2013 if not addressed immediately \u2013 be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. This chart might focus a few minds in Westminster: The IoD\u2019s survey isn\u2019t the only cause for concern this morning. Visa have reported that household spending fell last month, for the first time in almost four years. It highlights how consumers are being squeezed by rising inflation and political uncertainty, and cutting back on non-essential items. As things stand this morning, May\u2019s grip on Number 10 is looking precarious, with insiders saying she cannot lead the Conservative Party into another election. Yesterday she was savaged as a \u201cdead woman walking\u2019 by former chancellor George Osborne (who seems to be enjoying his new career in journalism). But the game isn\u2019t over, yet. Later today May will appeal to her MPs for support, in an attempt to remain as prime minister. Our political editor Heather Stewart explains: The prime minister is expected to signal to her parliamentary colleagues that she will run her government in a more collegiate, less controlling way, after sacrificing her two closest advisers, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. With many backbenchers blaming May for the party\u2019s poor performance at the polls, one senior Conservative said she would have to give a \u201cbarnstorming\u201d performance at the meeting of the party\u2019s 1922 committee of MPs to hold on to her job. Spread-betting firm IG expect the main European markets to fall by up to 0.5% this morning. While Britain is gripped by May\u2019s crisis-of-her-own-making, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron is showing us how to lead a country. The French president\u2019s En Marche party is on track for a landslide win in parliamentary elections, giving him enough muscle to start pushing through economic reforms. There\u2019s very little in the economic calendar today, alas.",

The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u2013 and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u2019 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results.

That could be bad for Britain\u2019s credit rating, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/moodys-warns-uk-credit-rating-downgrade-brexit\">currently Aa1 with Moody\u2019s, one notch below AAA</a>.</p> <p>But.... Moody\u2019s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be <strong>good</strong> for Britain\u2019s credit rating.</p> <p> Here are the key points from the report</p> <ul> <li><strong>Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. </strong>The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit.<br></li> <li><strong>We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negativ</strong>e. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u201cvote against austerity\u201d. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising.<strong><br></strong></li> <li><strong>However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u201csofter\u201d Brexit options, which could be credit positive</strong>. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u201ccliff\u201d risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u201chard\u201d Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought. Hence, a move towards \u201csofter\u201d versions of Brexit \u2013 potentially with continued access of some sort to the Single Market \u2013 might now be considered.</li> </ul> <p>And here\u2019s a chart showing why Moody\u2019s is worried about Britain\u2019s national debt:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50b814a37f829e3a931623cb4525f4a85ad62a89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b814a37f829e3a931623cb4525f4a85ad62a89/0_0_656_262/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK fiscal profile\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593e4dc7e4b0be3ed1925881\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-12T08:19:43.943Z\">9.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">S&amp;P: Election uncertainty will hurt growth</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain\u2019s economic growth is likely to be damaged by the current political instability, according to the European chief economist of ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s.</strong></p> <p>Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFor the time being, the outlook remains negative.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of the outlook for growth, it\u2019s clear that things are not going in the right direction.</p> <p>This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks to Reuters for the quotes....and this chart, showing how the UK economy has deteriorated recently:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/874178376399028224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK economic surprises index - now negative, a 1-year low, and down sharply from (admittedly high levels) just a few months ago. <a href=\"https://t.co/1XpAhs98Di\">pic.twitter.com/1XpAhs98Di</a></p>&mdash; Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/874178376399028224\">June 12, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593e4317e4b0be3ed192585c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-12T08:15:48.241Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The shock election result has fuelled speculation that Britain may aim for a less \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit than Theresa May had planned.</strong></p> <p><strong>Kalum Pickering</strong> of<strong> Berenberg Bank</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the continent, most observers have taken the UK election result as a rebuke of Theresa May\u2019s hard Brexit rhetoric of the \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d kind.</p> <p>For example, EU Commission \u00d6ttinger has expressed hope that the UK may now agree to stay in the Customs Union and the Common Market, possibly by joining EFTA.

      "bodyText": "British businesses have rejected claims by leading Brexiters that trade with the rest of the world can replace free access to European markets, arguing that quitting the single market and customs union without a trade deal with the EU will harm their growth prospects. In a report by the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Peter Sands, senior fellows at Harvard University\u2019s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, UK businesses owners warned that a bad deal, or no deal, on Brexit would be disastrous for British jobs, investment and growth. The warning comes as financial speculators circle London\u2019s stock markets and investors bet on the value of the pound, triggering a period of intense volatility while No 10 attempts to restore a sense of confidence in the government. On Friday, in the hours immediately after the surprise election result, the pound fell to an eight-week low and shares in banks, builders and retailers fell. The markets recovered as it seemed that the Conservatives had reached a deal with the DUP, but on Sunday the status of that deal looked less clear cut. Figures out this week are expected to add further pressure on Theresa May as she fends off criticism of her plans to maintain cuts to government spending and restrict public sector pay. Analysts forecast the UK\u2019s inflation rate will remain at elevated levels under May while wages remain stagnant, forcing ministers to admit that living standards will continue to plummet during the summer and most likely into the autumn. Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said: \u201cAny possibility of another election \u2013 and uncertainty over who will lead the next government \u2013 puts downward pressure on sterling in the short term.\u201d More than 50 business owners and trade associations were interviewed for the report by Balls and Sands. It found they were \u201chighly sceptical\u201d that unfettered access to the EU market would be replaced with a growth in trade with other parts of the world. Balls said: \u201cAt the time of the referendum, many British companies thought that Brexit might lead to a reduced regulatory burden. But now they\u2019re worried that if Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, the opposite will be true.\u201d Companies said they wanted to remain in the single market or customs union, and if this was unachievable they wanted an agreement that made trade as frictionless as possible. The prospect of reverting to WTO standards, which the government has suggested by saying that no deal is better than a bad deal, was of concern to many who feared a sharp increase in tariffs. Balls said: \u201cBritish companies are desperate to move beyond the empty rhetoric that \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019. They are clear that both \u2018no deal\u2019 and a \u2018bad deal\u2019 would be disastrous for British jobs, investment and growth.\u201d The study came as the first poll of UK business leaders since the election found a plunge in confidence in the economic outlook and concern over the make up of the government. The survey of almost 700 members of the Institute of Directors found 65% believed uncertainty over the makeup of the government was \u201ca significant concern\u201d for the UK economy. It also showed that 57% were pessimistic about the economy over the next 12 months, compared with 37% the previous month. Reaching a new trade deal with the EU should be the overall priority for the new government, respondents said. A survey for the Resolution Foundation found many employers were unprepared for a new era of lower migration. Of 500 employers with staff from the EU or EEA, almost half had \u201ctotally unrealistic expectations of what the post-Brexit immigration regime might be\u201d, the thinktank said. It added that 17% of firms expected no change to the system of freedom of movement, while 30% expected to see it maintained for those with a job offer. The foundation said Britain\u2019s post-Brexit migration policy should not be solely determined by what businesses wanted, but it was vital that the new government listened to them and gave them chance to prepare. Torsten Bell, the thinktank\u2019s director, said: \u201cWhatever people\u2019s views on Brexit, the journey not just the destination matter hugely to growth, jobs and living standards. Now is the time for both firms and government to focus on how we navigate that journey and the changes to our labour market it brings.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK household spending falls for first time since 2013", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Squeezed British households have cut back their spending for the first time in almost four years, according to figures that underscore the pressures from rising prices and political uncertainty. Visa, the credit and debit card processing business, said its vast database of spending patterns shows there was a drop in spending across a broad range of categories last month, including clothing, household goods, food and transport. That chimes with recent signs the UK economy is struggling to eke out growth this year and has fallen behind its peers as the effects of last summer\u2019s Brexit vote start to bite. Economists are worried that the inconclusive result of last week\u2019s snap general election will add to the mood of uncertainty among consumers and businesses alike. That will compound the pressures from the pound\u2019s sharp drop since the EU referendum, which has pushed up the cost of UK imports and stoked inflation. Official figures due this week are widely expected to confirm that workers suffered another drop in real pay in April as wage growth weakened further and failed to match rises in living costs. Separate figures for May are forecast to show inflation held at 2.7%, the highest for more than three years and well above a Bank of England target of 2%. Despite that overshoot, the Bank\u2019s policymakers meeting to set interest rates this week are likely to reaffirm that they are happy to tolerate higher inflation for now as they continue to keep borrowing costs low to shore up growth and employment. The monetary policy committee will be one member short again this month after the resignation earlier this year of the Bank\u2019s deputy governor, Charlotte Hogg, when it emerged she had breached the Bank\u2019s code of conduct. Economists polled by Reuters expect the depleted committee to vote seven to one to leave interest rates at the record low of 0.25%. Only Kristin Forbes, who leaves the MPC this month, is expected to continue voting for a rate rise to curb inflation. Her colleagues will likely emphasise the pressures on consumer spending. The figures from Visa appear to vindicate their cautious approach. The payments company said spending dropped 0.8% year-on-year in May, the first decline since September 2013. \u201cOur index clearly shows that with rising prices and stalling wage growth, more of us are starting to feel the squeeze,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, UK &amp; Ireland managing director at Visa. \u201cRetailers of non-essential goods were among the worst hit, with clothing and household goods seeing sharp declines in sales.\u201d Spending on experiences such as eating out and cinema trips continued to rise, but at a softer pace in May, according to the Visa report, compiled by data company IHS Markit. There was further evidence of consumer caution in shopper numbers for May. They showed a 1% drop in footfall, which measures people going into shops but not necessarily buying anything. It was the first such drop since February, driven by a 2% fall in high street footfall and a 1.3% decline at shopping centres. Retail parks defied the broader trend, with a 1.5% rise, according to the figures from the British Retail Consortium and retail analysts Springboard. \u201cMay was clearly a month of moderation for UK shoppers,\u201d said Springboard\u2019s Diane Wehrle. She also noted signs in the footfall data \u2013 collected from electronic sensors around the country \u2013 that fewer people were staying on past 5pm to eat out after shopping trips, a further indication households had become more cautious. Economists expect that the pressure on household finances will translate into a drop in retail sales volumes in official figures due to be released on Thursday. A Reuters poll points to a 0.8% drop in sales in May after a 2.3% jump in April when Easter holidays and warm weather appeared to buoy trade. Beyond the retail sector there have been signs of a slowdown in other parts of the economy, with official figures last week showing output in the manufacturing and construction sectors missed expectations on the latest measures. A survey from Lloyds bank on Monday will add to the mood of caution. It suggested most regions in England suffered a slowdown across manufacturing and services firms in May. Business activity in England continued to grow, but the rate of expansion fell to a three-month low, according to the Lloyds regional purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). Wales, by contrast, enjoyed a pick-up in business activity growth. Gareth Oakley at Lloyds Banking Group highlighted that the survey\u2019s price measures had come down from recent highs, easing some of the pressure on businesses. \u201cAlthough there were some signs that political uncertainty and a squeeze on household budgets from rising prices had dampened growth rates, businesses across England and Wales reported further increases in both output and new orders in May,\u201d he added.",

That will compound the pressures from the pound\u2019s sharp drop since the EU referendum, which has pushed up the cost of UK imports and stoked inflation.</p> <p>Official figures due this week are widely expected to confirm that workers suffered another drop in real pay in April as wage growth weakened further and failed to match rises in living costs. Separate figures for May are forecast to show inflation held at 2.7%, the highest for more than three years and well above a Bank of England target of 2%.</p> <p>Despite that overshoot, the Bank\u2019s policymakers meeting to set interest rates this week are likely to reaffirm that they are happy to tolerate higher inflation for now as they continue to keep borrowing costs low to shore up growth and employment. </p> <p>The monetary policy committee will be one member short again this month after the resignation earlier this year of the Bank\u2019s deputy governor, Charlotte Hogg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/14/mps-question-charlotte-hoggs-suitability-for-bank-of-england-role\">when it emerged she had breached the Bank\u2019s code of conduct</a>.</p> <p>Economists polled by Reuters expect the depleted committee to vote seven to one to leave interest rates at the record low of 0.25%.
