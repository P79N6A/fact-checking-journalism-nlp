      "bodyText": "We are now a decade from the global financial crisis and despite the huge ruction it caused to financial and economic systems around the world, governments, businesses and investors continue to act as though nothing has changed. However, one need only look at retail spending to realise households know our economic world is no longer what it once was. In the middle of 2008, things were looking good so long as you didn\u2019t look too far ahead. But the economy was very different to the one we have now. At the time, 45% of all people over 15 years of age were working full-time; this is now 42.4%. That may seem like a difference of just a few percentage points, but it is the equivalent of nearly 520,000 fewer people being employed on a full-time basis. Back then, the cash rate was at a 12-year peak of 7.25% as the Reserve Bank was worried about rising inflation. Now it\u2019s at a record low of 1.5% as the Reserve Bank wonders just when inflation will pick up. The search for inflation \u2013 and the relative return to normal of interest rates and wages growth \u2013 is something that, bizarrely, investors, and indeed the government, feel is just around the corner because of the belief that the way things used to be before the GFC is the way things still are and will remain in the years to come. We see this in the government, with its belief that the best way to address low household income growth is to cut company tax rates. We see this in the market, with its ever desperate, ever incorrect predictions that interest rates are going to start rising soon. In the pre-GFC days, if we had experienced 14 straight months of increasing full-time employment (in trend terms) as we have now, we would also have been expecting inflation and wages to be rising, and the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates to cool the economy down. And thus, despite next to bugger-all signs of inflation growth, the markets have continually sought to believe the old story still holds. In September last year, the market was predicting the cash rate would be raised twice to 2% by February next year. Analysts at ANZ and National Australia Bank even expected rates to rise twice this year. Then things calmed a bit \u2013 the reality the market expected to see didn\u2019t occur and by the end of November it was factoring barely a better than 50:50 chance of any rate rise this year. Then, as investors and speculators do, they once again got excited \u2013 surely things were on the improve, surely things were going back to the way they were \u2013 look at that employment growth! And so by the end of last month, once again the market predicted two more rate increases to 2% \u2013 not by February 2019 but this time by May 2019. And then on Thursday night, the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, gave a speech in which he told the audience the RBA\u2019s estimate for underlying inflation was for it to remain below the 2.5% midpoint of its target range for \u201cthe next couple of years\u201d. He said that if employment continued to improve and inflation returned to near the target-range midpoint, \u201cat some point it will be appropriate for interest rates in Australia to also start moving up\u201d. \u201cAt some point\u201d \u2013 central banker speak for \u201cdon\u2019t hold your breath\u201d. And just like that, once again, investors, speculators and analysts were forced to realise that things were not like they used to be, and the likelihood of any rate rise once again fell below a 50:50 chance. ANZ announced on Friday that it no longer expected a rate rise this year. And all the while, Australian households have been showing everyone that things are no longer the same and must be wondering why anyone would think differently. This week, the retail trade figures for December were released and they showed that total retail spending in 2017 was just 2.7% above the 2016 figure \u2013 the worst calendar year increase since 2011. It used to be the case that Australians would spend about 6% more each year on shopping. In the 26 years up to 2009, total calendar year retail spending grew by less than 4% only twice. In the eight years since then, it has been above 4% only twice. The Reserve Bank is plainly aware of what is happening. In its latest statement on monetary policy, released on Friday, it noted that the decline in spending on \u201cdiscretionary categories, such as hotels, cafes &amp; restaurants and recreation &amp; culture, could indicate some increased pressure on household finances\u201d. Meaning, yes inflation is low, but so low is income growth that households have to cut back on spending on fun things \u2013 to pay for essentials such as energy, rent, education and health. The central bank also noted that while employment growth had been strong over the past year, there was little sign of it translating into an income boom. It said \u201cthe gap between the lower wages of those entering into employment and those already working has widened\u201d. In a big sign that things have changed, those coming into the workforce are being paid relatively less than new workers used to be. And so as we get into the 10th year since the GFC, the \u201cnew normal\u201d of weak or non-existent household income growth remains in place. And governments and markets might do well to ponder why they believe things are returning to normal when households are clearly telling them that they are not.

      "bodyText": "Stock markets are heading for a wild ride this year as central bankers strap on their bullet-proof vests and test investors\u2019 willingness to accept higher interest rates. Last week\u2019s share price crashes, which in two days wiped $4 trillion off the value of markets around the world, was just a foretaste of the battle to come. In the days following Monday\u2019s crash, share values have recovered strongly only to dive again as competing theories about the path of interest rates and the likely impact on economic growth fight for attention. Most investors want the era of cheap borrowing to continue and many are willing to sell their shareholdings if it looks like coming to an end. Without low interest rates, they cannot borrow and invest cheaply, especially in the assets that for the past decade have gone up every year by much more than their salary \u2013 property and shares. Countless businesses have also come to rely on low borrowing costs to keep going, and investors fear they might go bust should their bank raise loan rates. Weaning companies and investors off their addiction was never going to be easy, even 10 years after central banks first put their stimulus packages in place, and despite warnings that these measures need to end. For some time, the US Federal Reserve has taken on the role of the advance guard, forging a path towards higher rates for others to follow. But its campaign got off to a faltering start. Back in 2013 it was forced to retreat when it signalled in the mildest terms that it would begin withdrawing its quantitative easing programme. The main effect of QE was to drive down long-term interest rates, allowing investors to borrow cheaply not just over one or five years, but for 30 years. And so its withdrawal was as much of a blow for some fund managers as an immediate rate rise. Wall Street and markets in Europe and Asia, where heavy selling turned into a rout, forced Fed officials to retreat. The Fed adopted a more incremental approach. It gave markets more warning and spaced out the policy decisions. As it entered 2017, US interest rates had trebled, but only from 0.25% to 0.75%. Yet the economy was booming more than ever. The Fed appeared ready to get tougher, and with justification, according to Karen Ward, chief market strategist for the UK and Europe at JP Morgan Asset Management. After the heavy lifting needed to get the industrialised world back from bankruptcy, she said, \u201ceconomies are now rested\u201d. Ward, who until recently was an adviser to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cHouseholds and businesses are feeling better about the future. They do not need a boost in quite the same way. Central banks can ease off the accelerator without troubling either growth or markets.\u201d For the past year, health checks on the global economy have reported the patient doing much better than expected. On Friday 2 February a member of the committee that sets US interest rates repeated his warning that he couldn\u2019t take much more good news without voting to calm things down. That would mean one or two more interest rates rises than most investors were expecting. Not long after Robert Kaplan spoke, figures showed US average earnings growth almost hitting 3%. It was yet another piece of good news and proved to be the tipping point for a plunge in share values, dwarfing the so-called taper-tantrum crash that greeted the Fed\u2019s first attempt at tightening its interest-rate policy. Ken Odeluga, a market analyst at investment firm City Index, says the Fed is \u201cvindicated by green shoots in personal income growth\u201d in pressing ahead with rate increases. Investors had decided that Kaplan and his Fed colleagues were, at last, likely to make good on the threat of rates as high as 3% by 2019. On the following Monday the Vix index, which forecasts stock market volatility, jumped above the 30 mark that signals a crash. The tumble on Friday 2 February became a rout. By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average had suffered its biggest ever one-day fall. Another fall of more than 1,000 points came on Thursday. Also on Thursday, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the other eight members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee said investors should bet on earlier and more frequent rate rises than previously forecast. That probably means four rate rises in the next two years, starting in May. In the Bank\u2019s quarterly inflation report, which forecasts inflation, GDP growth and the course of interest rates over the next two years, Carney said that the UK remained resilient and a return to higher borrowing costs was justified. The FTSE 100, which had tumbled from a high point above 7700 earlier in the year to 7280, slumped another 100 points. The Bank of England takes a slightly different route to the Fed in arguing its case. It says that Brexit has permanently damaged the UK economy and it will therefore be operating at full capacity at a lower GDP growth rate. Effectively, this means it takes only a low growth rate to push up inflation. Given that inflation is already above the Bank\u2019s target of 2%, it must use its main tool \u2013 higher borrowing costs \u2013 to bring down inflation. Investors can seek respite in the eurozone, where the European Central Bank is still adding to the pile of assets in its QE programme, and Japan, where the central bank is keeping rates low despite the best period for growth in more than a generation. Paul Donovan, global chief economist at Swiss investment bank UBS, says he tried to persuade investors against selling in the recent crash, telling them that higher rates were no threat to one of the best periods for growth in postwar history. \u201cHowever, growth is modest and there are no signs of overheating or of central banks tightening monetary policy too quickly,\u201d he adds. Strong growth figures from the US economy are also tempered by lack of wage growth among low-income workers, which limits the Fed\u2019s room for manoeuvre. \u201cIf you look closely at the average earnings figures from the US it shows that the lion\u2019s share is going to professional and managerial grades. It\u2019s not filtering down to the shop floor,\u201d Donovan says. The prospect of a Brexit talks collapsing does little to disturb his view; neither do policy tantrums in the White House. It is possible, he says, that in a couple of years\u2019 time, politicians will make mistakes that disturb his benign picture, but in the meantime, global growth is strong enough and broad enough to stay on course. Carney and the new Fed boss, Jerome Powell, who succeeded Janet Yellen last week, will want to stand by their rate-rise predictions, wanting investors to be the first to blink in a battle of wills. But they have a chink in their armour. Both central banks have a remit to use higher interest rates to bring down inflation above 2%, except that inflation has been running at 2.1% in the US for the past two years, and while it jumped to 3% last year in the UK, it is due to fall this year without any increase in borrowing costs. So the betting must be that without the scary prospect of rampant inflation, the Fed and the Bank of England find themselves in a war of words that only adds to stock market volatility.",

Another fall of more than 1,000 points came on Thursday.</p> <p>Also on Thursday, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the other eight members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee said investors should bet on earlier and more frequent rate rises than previously forecast. That probably means four rate rises in the next two years, starting in May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79b03b9801b83555e278a15417abf034529375e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79b03b9801b83555e278a15417abf034529375e7/0_148_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has indicated that interest rates will soon need to rise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has indicated that interest rates will soon need to rise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/08/uk-interest-rate-rise-is-coming-bank-of-england-tells-borrowers\" title=\"\">In the Bank\u2019s quarterly inflation report</a>, which forecasts inflation, GDP growth and the course of interest rates over the next two years, Carney said that the UK remained resilient and a return to higher borrowing costs was justified. The FTSE 100, which had tumbled from a high point above 7700 earlier in the year to 7280, slumped another 100 points.</p> <p>The Bank of England takes a slightly different route to the Fed in arguing its case. It says that Brexit has permanently damaged the UK economy and it will therefore be operating at full capacity at a lower GDP growth rate. Effectively, this means it takes only a low growth rate to push up inflation. Given that inflation is already above the Bank\u2019s target of 2%, it must use its main tool \u2013 higher borrowing costs \u2013 to bring down inflation.</p> <p>Investors can seek respite in the eurozone, where the European Central Bank is still adding to the pile of assets in its QE programme, and Japan, where the central bank is keeping rates low despite the best period for growth in more than a generation.</p> <p>Paul Donovan, global chief economist at Swiss investment bank UBS, says he tried to persuade investors against selling in the recent crash, telling them that higher rates were no threat to one of the best periods for growth in postwar history.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, growth is modest and there are no signs of overheating or of central banks tightening monetary policy too quickly,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Strong growth figures from the US economy are also tempered by lack of wage growth among low-income workers, which limits the Fed\u2019s room for manoeuvre. \u201cIf you look closely at the average earnings figures from the US it shows that the lion\u2019s share is going to professional and managerial grades. It\u2019s not filtering down to the shop floor,\u201d Donovan says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/07/donald-trump-says-stock-market-is-making-a-big-mistake-after-drop\">Donald Trump says stock market is making a 'big mistake' after drop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prospect of a Brexit talks collapsing does little to disturb his view; neither do policy tantrums in the White House. It is possible, he says, that in a couple of years\u2019 time, politicians will make mistakes that disturb his benign picture, but in the meantime, global growth is strong enough and broad enough to stay on course.</p> <p>Carney and the new Fed boss, Jerome Powell, who succeeded Janet Yellen last week, will want to stand by their rate-rise predictions, wanting investors to be the first to blink in a battle of wills. But they have a chink in their armour. Both central banks have a remit to use higher interest rates to bring down inflation above 2%, except that inflation has been running at 2.1% in the US for the past two years, and while it jumped to 3% last year in the UK, it is due to fall this year without any increase in borrowing costs.</p> <p>So the betting must be that without the scary prospect of rampant inflation, the Fed and the Bank of England find themselves in a war of words that only adds to stock market volatility.</p>",

Until last week the Vix was among the calmest features of the international money markets. Then suddenly it exploded into life to register the largest one-day rise in its history. The Vix is a measure of how fund managers assess the economic, political and financial pressures affecting companies listed on the US stock market and the extent to which shares will rise or fall over the next 30 days. Its proper name is the CBOE volatility index and it tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is the broadest and most respected measure of the value of America\u2019s largest companies. It is run by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, hence \u201cCBOE\u201d. For 18 months the Vix index had ignored the ebb and flow of financial news. Hardly a week went by in 2017 when someone in the City didn\u2019t comment on the Vix and marvelled at how it had remained low for such an unfeasibly long period. The general rule of thumb has been that when the Vix index rises above 30 it indicates serious unease, and a reading above 40 heralds a crisis. Its long-term average is about 20. The biggest jumps came during the 2008 financial crash, when the index rose above 90, and in 1987, following the Thatcher/Reagan deregulation of financial markets, when it reached 150. Last week it rose from around 10 points to above 30 in response to concerns that the cheap money driving economic growth may be restricted this year more than previously expected. Briefly it soared near 50 before falling back to below 30. For some time economists have agonised over whether the Vix is a portent of 2008-style mega-crashes or has become corrupted by the demands of investors who not only watch it intensely for signs of trouble, but have placed bets on the ups and downs of the index itself. There isn\u2019t much money riding on the Vix. It amounts to around $8bn. Set that against the $23 trillion value of the S&amp;P 500 and it is easy to dismiss the distorting effects of those using the Vix as a financial instrument. However, so many financial measures have been corrupted over the years, or made redundant as a measure of financial stress, that it must be legitimate to question it. The Baltic Dry index was another such measure; it was credited with signalling the 2008 crash only to fall out of favour once investors began to bet on it. That index documented spare shipping capacity, and therefore the cost of sending containers of dry goods, iron ore and metals around the world. On a long view, it has barely flickered since 2010. Last year it was bought by the Singapore Exchange; this month, reforms to it were agreed. Without going into too much detail, smaller ships have been taken out of the index and monster-sized tankers given a greater share. To illustrate how an index can be distorted, the Baltic Dry has suffered from the trend for South Korea to manufacture large ships very cheaply and at an alarming rate, regardless of demand. This has allowed ship owners to keep spare capacity in dock during the bad times and float it back into service when trade picked up. In such a market, spare capacity is less likely and price volatility becomes non-existent. The Vix may suffer from a feedback loop that stems from investors reporting low volatility because they have bet on low volatility. It is unproven whether the Vix is under the influence of anything but the genuine forecasts of investors who are part of the club that contribute their views. Nevertheless, it wouldn\u2019t be the first such measure to be corrupted. The Libor index recorded the interest rate that banks in London charged each other and in this way provided the basis for mortgage rates in the UK. The rate was arrived at by asking bank staff how much they expected to pay. Bank staff conspired to rig the rate and in doing so bagged millions of pounds in bonuses. The \u00a35.5tn of foreign exchange trades made per day were based on prices set each afternoon in a 60-second window. Traders found that if they bought and sold currencies in large amounts in this brief period, they could influence the price. The scandal was uncovered and in 2015 prompted regulators to impose large fines on a group of banks.",

      "bodyText": "Remember Quantum Leap? In the sci-fi show, time traveling scientist Sam Beckett would wake up in another era and have to work out where he was in history before solving this week\u2019s mystery. Well, that\u2019s the position the world\u2019s economists and traders are in this week. Since the end of the last recession, interest rates have been at a historic low. Now, with wages rising and the global economy booming, central banks look set to end the era of cheap money. As stock markets panic about the short-term impact on share prices, Richard Sylla, the co-author of the seminal A History of Interest Rates, poses a longer-term question: where are we? The 1950s or the 1970s? \u201cWe are certainly at a turning point,\u201d says Sylla, professor emeritus of economics at the history of financial institutions and markets at the Stern School of Business in New York. According to Sylla\u2019s studies, interest rates have trended in 20 to 30 year cycles and we are overdue a sustained period of interest rate increases. \u201cInterest rates have been abnormally low and for the first time in a long time every economy in the world is expanding. So everything tells me the trend is going to be up. The question is, what sort of trend will it be?\u201d Sylla offers two relevant historical models \u2013 the 1950s and the 1970s \u2013 periods with starkly different economic outcomes. 1950s In the early 50s, US central bankers began to gently raise interest rates after a period of sustained low rates that ran from the Great Depression through the second world war. \u201cFrom the early 50s to the early 60s, there was a gradual upward trend in interest rates that did not interfere with economic growth,\u201d Sylla explains. \u201cSome of the fastest economic growth took place in the 50s, so the idea that rising interest rates have a negative affect on the economy is probably wrong.\u201d The 1950s ushered in the golden age of capitalism. If we are as lucky this time and follow a similar course, Sylla says, we are likely to see less speculation in stocks as well as moderate increases or stable house prices. \u201cAs interest rates begin to normalize, stocks and real estate are certainly not going to be going up at the rates they have been. That\u2019s the rosy scenario \u2013 if we move from abnormally low interest rates to more normal interest rate over a period of time, even over 10 years ahead, it doesn\u2019t have to cause inflation or slow the economy. That\u2019s what we should hope for now.\u201d 1970s The alternative is the early 1970s. Under that scenario, central bankers raised the target fed funds rate higher 21 times over the course of 1973 as it attempted to tame inflation, stalling the US economy until it slid into stagflation \u2013 where prices rise faster than growth. While there is no energy crisis on the horizon, Sylla\u2019s \u201870s scenario focuses on the effect of Trump\u2019s $1.5trn tax cut at a time of almost full-employment coupled with new, multi-billion government spending allocations. In other words, a sugar rush just when the central bank is looking to gently cool, not aggressively stimulate, the economy. \u201cI see the signs of fiscal irresponsibility out there mainly in things like bitcoin and crypto-currencies but also in the stock market, which has been propped up by very low interest rates. That could turn this into a 1970s-type scenario when interest rates rose very rapidly,\u201d says Sylla. \u201cThere\u2019s a 50-50 chance inflation will heat up and that will force the Fed to raise rates faster. So it won\u2019t be a normalization or rates, it will be a more rapid rise because the Fed will start to fight the inflation.\u201d And that, Sylla predicts, could be the cause of the next recession. Increasing volatility The unfolding situation is likely contributing to the volatility we\u2019ve seen in the markets over the past week, says Simon Johnson, an MIT professor of global economics and management. \u201cThe markets are trying to grapple with the sudden realization that the Trump-Republican economic policies amount to a short-term economic stimulus in an economy that appears to have very little slack,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve put an expansionary fiscal policy into a situation where we\u2019re at or close to full employment. But the Fed was already on a course to tightening fiscal policy. It\u2019s the kind of policy mistake that did give us the complications of the 1970s. A textbook would say the Fed needs to tighten by more and faster in order to offset Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus.\u201d To Johnson, the scenario could end up looking more like the late 1960s era of Nixon and the Vietnam war when the Fed was gradually tightening interest rates but had missed the top of the cycle, allowing underlying conditions to start the 70s inflation cycle. \u201cIn that sense, perhaps we\u2019ve already fallen behind the curve,\u201d Johnson says. \u201c[Former Fed chair] Alan Greenspan\u2019s thinking was you don\u2019t wait for full capacity [in the economy] because there are long and variable lags for all of this.\u201d The Fed\u2019s policy goal of normalizing interest rates to somewhere close to their historical averages of three to four percent is not widely opposed by central bankers, not least because that would give the central bankers room to manouvre in the event of an economic shock. But, warns Johnson, Trump may not be the man to learn history\u2019s lessons. \u201cThe last thing Trump wants, as a real estate developer or a politician, is higher interest rates,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump is the ultimate loose-money president. He will likely push hard for low rates at least through the mid-terms and probably into his re-election.\u201d",

The question is, what sort of trend will it be?\u201d</p> <p>Sylla offers two relevant historical models \u2013 the 1950s and the 1970s \u2013 periods with starkly different economic outcomes. </p> <h2>1950s</h2> <p>In the early 50s, US central bankers began to gently raise interest rates after a period of sustained low rates that ran from the Great Depression through the second world war. </p> <p>\u201cFrom the early 50s to the early 60s, there was a gradual upward trend in interest rates that did not interfere with economic growth,\u201d Sylla explains. \u201cSome of the fastest economic growth took place in the 50s, so the idea that rising interest rates have a negative affect on the economy is probably wrong.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c75e4e0e132859408d1644cf4b3fac91ae11f572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c75e4e0e132859408d1644cf4b3fac91ae11f572/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new federal reserve chair Jerome Powell takes his oath of office on 5 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new federal reserve chair Jerome Powell takes his oath of office on 5 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 1950s ushered in the golden age of capitalism. If we are as lucky this time and follow a similar course, Sylla says, we are likely to see less speculation in stocks as well as moderate increases or stable house prices.</p> <p>\u201cAs interest rates begin to normalize, stocks and real estate are certainly not going to be going up at the rates they have been. That\u2019s the rosy scenario \u2013 if we move from abnormally low interest rates to more normal interest rate over a period of time, even over 10 years ahead, it doesn\u2019t have to cause inflation or slow the economy. That\u2019s what we should hope for now.\u201d </p> <h2>1970s</h2> <p>The alternative is the early 1970s. Under that scenario, central bankers raised the target fed funds rate higher 21 times over the course of 1973 as it attempted to tame inflation, stalling the US economy until it slid into stagflation \u2013 where prices rise faster than growth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything tells me the trend is going to be up. The question is, what sort of trend will it be?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While there is no energy crisis on the horizon, Sylla\u2019s \u201870s scenario focuses on the effect of Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-tax-overhaul-fact-checking-lopsided-political-arguments/\">$1.5trn tax cut</a> at a time of almost full-employment coupled with new, multi-billion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/09/us-government-shuts-down-for-second-time-in-three-weeks\">government spending allocations</a>. In other words, a sugar rush just when the central bank is looking to gently cool, not aggressively stimulate, the economy.</p> <p>\u201cI see the signs of fiscal irresponsibility out there mainly in things like bitcoin and crypto-currencies but also in the stock market, which has been propped up by very low interest rates. That could turn this into a 1970s-type scenario when interest rates rose very rapidly,\u201d says Sylla.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a 50-50 chance inflation will heat up and that will force the Fed to raise rates faster. So it won\u2019t be a normalization or rates, it will be a more rapid rise because the Fed will start to fight the inflation.\u201d And that, Sylla predicts, could be the cause of the next recession.</p> <h2>Increasing volatility </h2> <p>The unfolding situation is likely contributing to the volatility <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/09/us-stocks-heading-for-worst-week-since-financial-crisis-as-wild-ride-continues\">we\u2019ve seen in the markets</a> over the past week, says Simon Johnson, an MIT professor of global economics and management.</p> <p>\u201cThe markets are trying to grapple with the sudden realization that the Trump-Republican economic policies amount to a short-term economic stimulus in an economy that appears to have very little slack,\u201d he explains.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80bb070e93577046e7330ba05bd6e53770c2a3d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80bb070e93577046e7330ba05bd6e53770c2a3d3/0_102_4496_2698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The last thing Trump wants, as a real estate developer or a politician, is higher interest rates.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The last thing Trump wants, as a real estate developer or a politician, is higher interest rates.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa USA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve put an expansionary fiscal policy into a situation where we\u2019re at or close to full employment. But the Fed was already on a course to tightening fiscal policy. It\u2019s the kind of policy mistake that did give us the complications of the 1970s. A textbook would say the Fed needs to tighten by more and faster in order to offset Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus.\u201d </p> <p>To Johnson, the scenario could end up looking more like the late 1960s era of Nixon and the Vietnam war when the Fed was gradually tightening interest rates but had missed the top of the cycle, allowing underlying conditions to start the 70s inflation cycle. </p> <p>\u201cIn that sense, perhaps we\u2019ve already fallen behind the curve,\u201d Johnson says. \u201c[Former Fed chair] Alan Greenspan\u2019s thinking was you don\u2019t wait for full capacity [in the economy] because there are long and variable lags for all of this.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/09/how-artemis-hit-bulls-eye-by-betting-on-stock-market-collapse\">Making millions from chaos: the fund cashing in on the stock market collapse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Fed\u2019s policy goal of normalizing interest rates to somewhere close to their historical averages of three to four percent is not widely opposed by central bankers, not least because that would give the central bankers room to manouvre in the event of an economic shock. <br></p> <p>But, warns Johnson, Trump may not be the man to learn history\u2019s lessons.</p> <p>\u201cThe last thing Trump wants, as a real estate developer or a politician, is higher interest rates,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump is the ultimate loose-money president. He will likely push hard for low rates at least through the mid-terms and probably into his re-election.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Miles Brignall The security procedures of giant mobile phone company EE have been branded \u201ctotally inadequate\u201d after fraudsters hijacked a customer\u2019s phone and tried to empty his bank account. Stuart Rivett, from Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, is the latest victim of the growing problem of \u201csim swap\u201d. Fraudsters take over a victim\u2019s mobile phone by calling the company, posing as the account holder and saying their sim card has been damaged or lost. In his case, fraudsters repeatedly rang EE\u2019s customer services pretending to be him. At the third attempt, they were able to clear security and ask for Rivett\u2019s service to be \u201cswapped\u201d to a new sim. This, in effect, gave them his mobile service. Like other victims, the first Rivett knew of it was when his handset stopped working. Most troubling of all, he says, was the fraudsters\u2019 next move. They quickly used it to try to access his First Direct bank account. He suspects that only the fact that they failed the bank\u2019s voice ID verification (see box) prevented his account being emptied. Recently retired Rivett says he was shocked when he discovered the simplicity of the questions EE asked the fraudsters, and the fact they were able to make two failed attempts to access his account without arousing suspicion. \u201cIt seems that as part of the vetting, EE asked what make of phone I had and where in the world had I made calls in the previous 30 days. You don\u2019t need to be a genius to guess it might be an Apple, and that I had only been in the UK. Yet that was enough to convince EE to swap my number to a new sim.\u201d Rivett is not the first EE customer to be on the end of this fraud. In April 2016, Money featured the case of Chris Sims. Within 75 minutes of hacking his account, fraudsters had used his online banking app to empty his Halifax account of \u00a31,200 and apply for an \u00a38,000 loan. Their cases should serve as a warning to anyone who uses their mobile phone to verify themselves to their bank \u2013 by one-time passcodes or similar. Experts have warned that, as the banks have upped their security systems, fraudsters have realised mobile phone security is much easier to get around, and can be the key to accessing a bank account. EE says it \u201ctakes the safeguarding of data extremely seriously\u201d. It insists: \u201cWe have strict policies and procedures in place to prevent fraudulent activity and unauthorised access. \u201cAll requests to make account changes, including sim swap, require the caller to provide a range of details to verify their identity. In this case, the fraudster provided the correct answers, including the customer\u2019s banking details. We have apologised to Mr Rivett for any worry and inconvenience, and we\u2019re continually looking to improve our defences against this type of fraud. We advise customers to use unique and strong passwords, and to contact EE, their bank and the authorities immediately if they notice any suspicious activity.\u201d Rivett has been left wondering whether he wants to continue to use a mobile phone to connect to his bank. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that EE\u2019s security is totally inadequate and am looking to move to another provider, although I\u2019m wondering whether the others will be any better.\u201d Since the summer of 2016 First Direct has been recording phone calls from its 1.3 million customers as part of its voice ID programme, which matches the caller to their account. It looks as though this is what prevented Stuart Rivett\u2019s account from being compromised. The bank says the technology can tell if a customer is who they say they are in just two seconds. It works by cross-checking a voice\u2019s speed, cadence and pronunciation, and physical aspects including the shape of larynx, vocal tract and nasal passages. It records conversations until it has enough data to be able to ID the caller, at which point it becomes part of the security clearance. Customers have to actively opt out if they don\u2019t wish to be included. Since it was introduced, Voice ID has prevented more than 1,600 attempted frauds to date. The bank\u2019s parent firm, HSBC, also offers it. Barclays launched a similar scheme for personal customers last August.",
