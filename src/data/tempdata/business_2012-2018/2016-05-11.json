      "bodyText": "In a week in which we have the joyful collision of a budget sell and an election campaign, the narrative of lifters and leaners has returned. And just as when it was spruiked by Joe Hockey, it\u2019s once again about undermining the voice of the poorest in order to reduce welfare spending and lower taxes for the wealthy. On Monday night Duncan Storrar appeared in the audience for ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A and rather perfectly cut to the quick on the issue of fairness in the tax system. As a man on the minimum wage he didn\u2019t need graphs or tables at hand to talk about the impact of changes to the tax system. And not surprisingly the response from the conservative media, led by the Australian, has been to paint him as an example of the horror of Australia\u2019s tax and transfer system. The headline in Wednesday\u2019s Australian \u2013 \u201cABC\u2019s \u2018budget fairness\u2019 victim pays no net tax\u201d \u2013 reflects a longstanding view of the conservative side of politics and the media that we should worry about the rise of those paying no \u201cnet tax\u201d \u2013 where you balance the amount of tax paid with benefits received. Peter van Onselen, from Sky News and the Australian, for example, got himself quite worked up on Twitter, pondering: \u201cHow in the name of God is it sustainable that half the working population don\u2019t pay any income tax ... I completely give up.\u201d Of course, it is sustainable because more than half do pay income tax. Ben Phillips, from the ANU centre for social research and methods, replied to van Onselen that ABS records show that in 2013-14 \u201c65% of 18-65 [year-olds] pay personal income tax\u201d, to which van Onselen oddly replied, \u201cexactly\u201d. I guess a third now equals a half. Now it is true that around half of Australians pay less tax than they receive in government benefits \u2013 but there are a few caveats. The most recent full breakdown of government benefits, taxes and household income by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which includes not just income tax but other indirect taxes such as GST, shows that in 2009-10 the top 60% paid more tax than they received in government benefits. But when you include social benefits such as education and health only the top 40% were net tax payers: But dividing things into lots of 20% is not very precise and hides a lot, especially the age factor. Modelling by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (and actually reported last year in the Australian) found that 67% of those under 65 in 2015 were net tax payers, but this dropped to 52% when you included those aged over 65: That level was actually a fall from the 56% of net taxpayer households in 2005. But, crucially, the percentage of households aged under 65 who were net taxpayers hadn\u2019t changed over the 10 years. What had changed is that fewer over-65-year-old households were net tax payers, and such households also accounted for a greater proportion of the total due to our ageing population. Our welfare system is actually very tightly means-tested. The vast majority of cash welfare assistance goes to the poorest half. The support through services such as education and health, however, is more evenly spread: I\u2019ve argued in the past this is a good thing. When government services such as schooling and health are provided only for the poorest, they quickly become separated from the services provided to the wealthy. And because the wealthiest get no benefits, they have no care for the quality or quantity of those services and soon demand the government spends less on them \u2013 after all, the rich pay most of the tax so why should the poor benefit? We see this in the way welfare is now treated \u2013 and by extension the talk about net tax payers. The headline \u201cABC\u2019s \u2018budget fairness\u2019 victim pays no net tax\u201d might as well have the sub-heading, \u201cSo shut up you ungrateful whinger\u201d. But we should remember what we\u2019re talking about here. When we talk about the poorest half it can be easy to lose yourself in rather meaningless waffle about income quintiles and deciles. Last week the tax cut for those earning over $80,000 was labelled as a \u201cmiddle-income tax\u201d. And yet, as I noted last week, $80,000 puts you about $26,000 above the median income. When earning almost 50% more than someone on median income gets you classed as \u201cmiddle income\u201d you know things have become very skewed. Fortunately, last year the Productivity Commission looked at tax and benefits and used actual incomes. It found that around 39.5% of all families either received benefits and paid no tax, or they received more benefits than they paid in tax: The largest share of those who pay no tax and only receive benefits are those earning less than $25,000. Ninety three percent of such households are in that category and they account for 88% of all households who pay no tax but receive benefits. The commission also found that half of Australian households received no benefits at all \u2013 including two-thirds of those earning between $25,000 and $50,000. The commission found, however, only 7.7% of all households paid tax but received more in benefits \u2013 60% of whom earned less than $50,000. But even among those earning between $25,000 and $50,000, only 20% were such \u201cnet recipients\u201d. So the big problem in Australia really isn\u2019t tax and transfer churn. Is it really unsustainable that 8% of households get more welfare than they pay in tax? Indeed, the Productivity Commission has noted research that found \u201cAustralia had the lowest level of churn among 19 OECD countries for which data were available\u201d. And the problem isn\u2019t welfare spending. According the Bureau of Statistics, in 2000-01 28.1% of households were dependent upon welfare for a majority of their income; by 2013-14 this was down to 24.4%: And while our spending on welfare is very low compared with other OECD countries, we get pretty good bang for our buck, with each percent of GDP spent on social benefits reducing our inequality by more than most OECD nations: We don\u2019t have an issue in Australia of too many working people paying no tax or no net tax. Our tax system and welfare systems are both highly progressive and talk of churn through middle-class welfare is massively overstated. We are an ageing population. More people are moving into retirement \u2013 and that is where the fall in \u201cnet tax payers\u201d is coming from. Someone who pays less tax than they receive in benefits isn\u2019t bludging on the system. In Australia it almost certainly means they are earning less than the median wage, and they are part of one of the most efficient welfare systems in the world. And their views on what is fair in the system certainly deserve to be heard.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s departure from the EU would hit housebuilders\u2019 workforces hard and exacerbate the housing crisis, the boss of the UK\u2019s largest homebuilder has said. David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Developments, said: \u201cWe would much prefer that the UK stays within the EU. We have a significant part of our labour force, particularly within the London market, coming from continental Europe \u2013 the free movement of labour in the European market is a positive from our point of view.\u201d A vote to leave the EU would mean \u201ceven more pressure in terms of skills shortages\u201d, he argued. \u201cIf you ask any housebuilder what their main challenge is, they say it\u2019s labour availability.\u201d This would hamper the industry\u2019s ability to build much-needed homes, he said, echoing warnings from other housebuilders, including Berkeley Group. Thomas estimates 30-40% of Barratt\u2019s workforce in the capital hails from mainland Europe. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be unusual to find 10-plus nationalities on a London construction site, and dual language signs,\u201d he said. Two-thirds of the construction sector is backing continued EU membership, with more than half saying Brexit would lead to less foreign investment (60%) and drive up labour and material costs (55% and 53%), according to a survey by Building magazine. The Shard contractor Mace, the property firm Jones Lang LaSalle, and the UK\u2019s largest independent engineering firm, Mott MacDonald, have signed an open letter backing the vote to remain. Mott MacDonald\u2019s chairman, Keith Howells, said: \u201cWe would face quite a significant skills shortage if we opt out [of the EU]. We employ quite a number of EU nationals. A lot of young people have come here from Greece, Spain and Italy, got masters degrees and put themselves on the local market. What\u2019s the impact going to be on them? We\u2019re all in the dark.\u201d At the property developer Berkeley, which builds luxury London homes, about half of its 14,000 subcontractors come from eastern Europe, according to the chairman, Tony Pidgley. Across the UK, nearly 12% of the 2.1 million construction workers come from abroad, official figures show \u2013 mainly from the EU. Experts say the actual number is probably even higher. Poland and Romania are the most common countries of origin. The construction industry employs 324,000 fewer workers than it did in 2008, before the financial crisis and recession led to a slump in housebuilding and other construction projects, prompting companies to slash their workforces. This has made the sector heavily reliant on construction workers from eastern Europe and the rest of the EU, as it takes years to train skilled tradespeople. The number of migrant workers more than doubled in the 10 years to 2011, said Simon Light at design and consultancy firm Arcadis. \u201cThe migrant workforce has been the most effective short-term fix for the UK\u2019s construction worker shortage.\u201d A report by his firm last year found that 53,000 extra bricklayers were needed to build 200,000 homes a year. But the UK is also recruiting carpenters, joiners, plasterers and general labourers along with architects from the EU. Steve Turner of the Homebuilders Federation said: \u201cBecause the industry is reliant on labour from the EU, in the event of Brexit we would be pushing the government hard for a quota system \u2026 Considering that housing is such a priority for the government, we would anticipate that the government would listen to our concerns.\u201d He pointed to a quota system for construction workers from Ireland in the 1960s. Thomas warned that the uncertainty created by a vote to leave the EU in the 23 June referendum would also hurt investment, with housebuilders operating on a five- to 10-year basis. Barratt has invested more than \u00a33.8bn in land for new housing in the past five years. Its business has been little affected by the forthcoming EU vote, apart from the top end \u2013 reservations of \u00a31m-plus homes have slowed slightly, to 44 in the past 19 weeks, compared with 46 a year earlier. Overall, forward sales rose nearly 10% to \u00a32.8bn, underpinned by the government\u2019s latest help-to-buy scheme, which started in February. Savills, the upmarket estate agent, said there was a spike in activity in its UK prime residential business before the stamp duty increase last month, but it had slowed since then in the run-up to the referendum. Migrant construction workers in UK by nationality The most frequent nationalities of people resident in the UK and working in construction in 2014 \u2013 these people have arrived in the UK in the past 10 years, from figures by the Construction Industry Training Board: Poland: 30,120 Romania: 24,842 Lithuania: 7,569 India: 7,704 Bulgaria: 5,443 Latvia: 3,830 South Africa: 1,316 Hungary: 1,448 Australia: 937",

We employ quite a number of EU nationals. A lot of young people have come here from Greece, Spain and Italy, got masters degrees and put themselves on the local market. What\u2019s the impact going to be on them? We\u2019re all in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>At the property developer Berkeley, which builds luxury London homes, about half of its 14,000 subcontractors come from eastern Europe, according to the chairman, Tony Pidgley.</p> <p>Across the UK, nearly 12% of the 2.1 million construction workers come from abroad, official figures show \u2013 mainly from the EU. Experts say the actual number is probably even higher. Poland and Romania are the most common countries of origin.</p> <p>The construction industry employs 324,000 fewer workers than it did in 2008, before the financial crisis and recession led to a slump in housebuilding and other construction projects, prompting companies to slash their workforces. This has made the sector heavily reliant on construction workers from eastern Europe and the rest of the EU, as it takes years to train skilled tradespeople.</p> <p>The number of migrant workers more than doubled in the 10 years to 2011, said Simon Light at design and consultancy firm Arcadis. \u201cThe migrant workforce has been the most effective short-term fix for the UK\u2019s construction worker shortage.\u201d</p> <p>A report by his firm last year found that 53,000 extra bricklayers were needed to build 200,000 homes a year. But the UK is also recruiting carpenters, joiners, plasterers and general labourers along with architects from the EU.</p> <p>Steve Turner of the Homebuilders Federation said: \u201cBecause the industry is reliant on labour from the EU, in the event of Brexit we would be pushing the government hard for a quota system \u2026 Considering that housing is such a priority for the government, we would anticipate that the government would listen to our concerns.\u201d </p> <p>He pointed to a quota system for construction workers from Ireland in the 1960s. Thomas warned that the uncertainty created by a vote to leave the EU in the 23 June referendum would also hurt investment, with housebuilders operating on a five- to 10-year basis. Barratt has invested more than \u00a33.8bn in land for new housing in the past five years.</p> <p>Its business has been little affected by the forthcoming EU vote, apart from the top end \u2013 reservations of \u00a31m-plus homes have slowed slightly, to 44 in the past 19 weeks, compared with 46 a year earlier. </p> <p>Overall, forward sales rose nearly 10% to \u00a32.8bn, underpinned by the government\u2019s latest help-to-buy scheme, which started in February.</p> <p>Savills, the upmarket estate agent, said there was a spike in activity in its UK prime residential business before the stamp duty increase last month, but it had slowed since then in the run-up to the referendum. </p> <h2><strong>Migrant construction workers in UK by nationality</strong></h2> <p>The most frequent nationalities of people resident in the UK and working in construction in 2014 \u2013 these people have arrived in the UK in the past 10 years, from figures by the Construction Industry Training Board:</p> <p><strong>Poland</strong>: 30,120<br><strong>Romania</strong>: 24,842<br><strong>Lithuania</strong>: 7,569<br><strong>India</strong>: 7,704<br><strong>Bulgaria</strong>: 5,443<br><strong>Latvia</strong>: 3,830<br><strong>South Africa:</strong> 1,316<br><strong>Hungary:</strong> 1,448 <br><strong>Australia:</strong> 937</p> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "Workers and the public will for the first time be able to go online to see details of employee injuries and illnesses \u2013 for instance, the number of broken ribs or amputations - at tens of thousands of American workplaces, under a new Labor Department rule announced on Thursday. The Labor Department\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced a final rule that will require many employers to send OSHA injury and illness data that the agency will then post online. OSHA officials said the rule aims to create more transparency to help workers, companies, the public and the government know more about workplace injuries and to pressure businesses to do more to reduce job-related injuries Business groups were quick to attack the new rule, saying it was an unwelcome new employer mandate and also posed the risk of public embarrassment. David Michaels, OSHA\u2019s director, asserted that the new rule placed little additional burden on companies. \u201cEmployers don\u2019t have to do anything else than send us data that they\u2019re already collecting,\u201d he said. Rosario Palmieri, a vice-president with the National Association of Manufacturers, said that while companies pride themselves on creating safer workplaces, \u201cthis regulation will lead to the unfair and unnecessary public shaming\u201d of many businesses. \u201cThis,\u201d he added in a statement, \u201cis a misguided attempt at transparency that sacrifices employee and employer privacy.\u201d OSHA officials said the new rule was inspired by the teachings of behavioral economics. Just as restaurants have sought to improve their health and cleanliness records when cities began giving out letter grades, Michaels said, employers will do more to reduce workplace injuries and illnesses once the agency begins posting injury information about specific companies. \u201cWe will now make public all this information and try to do it in a way that really encourages employees to take action to reduce injuries,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cMaking information public affects behavior. If you\u2019re looking for a new job, you might want to work at an establishment where you don\u2019t have a high likelihood of being injured.\u201d As an example, he mentioned two nursing homes several miles apart in North Carolina \u2013 one with an injury rate five times greater than the other. At one home, one in nine workers get injured per year, at the other, one in 45 workers get injured. Under current rules, employers must keep a log of work-related injuries and illness, and those logs can be viewed by employees and the occasional OSHA inspector who visits. With the new rule, workplaces with 250 or more employees in \u201chigh-hazard industries\u201d must electronically send OSHA detailed injury and illness information. High-hazard industries include construction, manufacturing, grocery stores, freight trucking, waste collection, hospitals and nursing homes. With this information, OSHA might, for instance, post online that at a 500-employee factory, two employees suffered broken arms and three amputated fingers during the previous year. Or OSHA might post that at a hospital with 300 employees, three workers contracted hepatitis B and two slipped a disc while lifting patients. \u201cCurrently, little or no information about worker injuries and illnesses at individual employers is made public or available to OSHA,\u201d the agency said. The new rules will require 34,000 \u201chigh hazard\u201d workplaces with 250 or more employees to send OSHA information, and the agency will post the names of those workplaces and list the specific injuries \u2013 first removing any information that might personally identify individuals. Some 432,000 workplaces with 20 to 249 employees in high-hazard industries will be required to report considerably less \u2013 just the total number of injuries and illnesses and the total number of hours worked at that establishment the previous year. Associated Builders and Contractors, a nationwide association of construction companies, attacked the new rule. Greg Sizemore, its vice-president for health and safety, said, \u201cOSHA has exceeded its authority by forcing companies to reveal confidential business details to the public\u201d Sizemore also criticized the agency for disseminating \u201cdata to the public that fails to show the complete narrative of a company\u2019s safety record\u201d. The new requirements will be phased in over two years, with the first set of data to be sent to OSHA by July 2017. The new rule makes it easier for workers to report injuries and illnesses and gives workers additional remedies if employers illegally retaliate against them for reporting or seeking to report injuries. Michaels said the new rule will aid many employers by enabling them to compare their safety records with other employers, and thereby help them develop benchmarks to strive for. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, the main US union federation, praised OSHA\u2019s move. \u201cThe new OSHA injury reporting rules will bring workplace injury and illness reporting into the 21st century and provide important new protections to workers who report injuries,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cUntil now, most workplace injury records have only been available at the workplace, making it impossible to know which employers have bad or good injury records.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Companies run by ex-cricketer Phil Edmonds 'paid bribes to officials'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Companies co-founded and run by Phil Edmonds, the international cricketer turned tycoon, paid \u201cbribes\u201d to African officials and have bought assets owned by secretive offshore structures, a campaign group has claimed. The allegations, which have emerged as David Cameron prepares to host world leaders for an anti-corruption summit on Thursday, are contained within a report released by Global Witness and are based on leaked documents that have been seen by the Guardian. The cache of files suggests a Liberia business acquired by a company created by the former cricketer and his long-time business partner Andrew Groves paid inducements to local officials. Meanwhile, a separate company acquired assets from beneficiaries whose identity was hidden by complex offshore structures. Edmonds and Groves said they \u201cstrenuously deny any wrongdoing\u201d. Edmonds played in 51 Test matches for England but in recent years has carved out a reputation as a buccaneering City dealmaker alongside Groves, with whom he has raised millions of pounds by floating companies on the London Stock Exchange. In Liberia, at the pair\u2019s business Sable Mining Africa, Global Witness calculates that there were \u201cbribes and highly questionable payments\u201d totalling around $250,000 during a four-month period in 2010. The evidence includes an email sent in August 2010 by Sable\u2019s lawyer Varney Sherman and entitled: \u201cCONFIDENTIAL \u2013 Sable Mining\u2019s Account with Sherman\u201d. The message contains an attachment headed: \u201cFOR EYES ONLY \u2013 ONE COPY ONLY\u201d, which lists a series of transactions, including: \u2022 Payments that appear to have been made to several well-placed Liberian officials \u2013 some as high as $50,000. \u2022 A transfer for $75,000 that is labelled: \u201cPayment (facilitation) revised PPCC Act\u201d \u2013 seemingly a reference to the country\u2019s Public Procurement and Concession Commission Act, which impacted on mining rights. \u2022 Funds being donated to a football club connected with a high-ranking government mandarin. Sable confirmed to the Guardian that it funded the account and that the email had been received by Groves and Heine van Niekerk, who it described as \u201cthe de facto chief operating officer for Sable in west Africa\u201d. Van Niekerk was dismissed from the Liberia division in 2012 for \u201ctheft of intellectual property\u201d, just a month before he took Sable to court over a dispute involving him selling Sable a different Liberia mining business. Van Niekerk and Sable settled the case and Van Niekerk said the terms of the deal did not allow him to comment on Sable, but he added that he was not aware of any bribes being paid. His dismissal was ruled unfair in 2013 by South Africa\u2019s Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. Sherman did not respond to requests for comment. Sable added that Groves \u201cdid not pay any attention to [the email] at the time because of the fact Mr Van Niekerk was dealing with matters relating to Liberia\u201d and that the company said it only discovered the payments during an audit in February 2011. At the time of the payments, Groves was chief executive and Edmonds was chairman of Sable, which owned a 36.5% stake in the Liberia business. Sable increased its shareholding to 63.5% in October 2011. Daniel Balint-Kurti, head of special investigations at Global Witness, said: \u201cSable was able to bribe many of Liberia\u2019s top politicians, which is trying to turn the page on 14 years of civil war, corruption and most recently Ebola. This kind of corruption deprives a long-suffering population of the benefits of their resources. The case needs to be investigated and punished if the Liberia government wants its anti-corruption fight to be taken seriously \u2013 its people deserve better.\u201d Jim Cochrane, who succeeded Edmonds as chairman of Sable Mining in 2014, said: \u201cSable is committed to ensuring that its business is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner and that any breaches in internal anti-bribery policies and procedures will result in disciplinary action. Although many of the issues raised by Global Witness were subject to internal review a number of years ago, they have prompted a further review of all of these matters. We have found no evidence to support or justify this attack on the company or its directors, past and present.\u201d Separately, the Global Witness report also questions transactions within African Medical Investments, an upmarket African hospital chain, created by Edmonds and Groves. They include one deal where the leaked documents show that in February 2010 \u2013 when Edmonds was chairman and Groves a director \u2013 the company purchased a Dassault Falcon 20 private jet for $3.1m \u2013 by acquiring the shares of its South African owner Caramix (Pty) Ltd, itself owned by a British Virgin Islands firm. The plane had been transferred to Caramix from Camec, another Edmonds and Groves business venture. The documents also show that Camec had acquired the aircraft for $1.9m in 2009. In its 2011-12 annual report, the firm admitted it had \u201csignificantly\u201d over-estimated what the plane was worth before revealing that African Medical sold the subsidiary that owned the Falcon for $1.3m in 2012 \u2013 so at a loss to the company of $1.8m. A spokeswoman for Edmonds and Groves said: \u201cThere is no reason to believe that [the Falcon purchase] constituted a \u2018related party transaction\u2019 as defined by the AIM [Alternative Investment Market] rules\u201d \u2013 and added that those claims were investigated and dismissed by lawyers appointed by the independent director. She added that no close relatives of Edmonds and Groves benefited from the deal, but declined to say if the beneficiaries were extended family members.",

      "body": "<p>Companies co-founded and run by Phil Edmonds, the international cricketer turned tycoon, paid \u201cbribes\u201d to African officials and have bought assets owned by secretive offshore structures, a campaign group has claimed.</p> <p>The allegations, which have emerged as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/08/offshore-finance-emerging-countries-russia-david-cameron-summit\">David Cameron prepares to host world leaders for an anti-corruption summit</a> on Thursday, are contained within <a href=\"https://globalwitness.org/thedeceivers/\">a report released by Global Witness</a> and are based on leaked documents that have been seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>The cache of files suggests a Liberia business acquired by a company created by the former cricketer and his long-time business partner Andrew Groves paid inducements to local officials. Meanwhile, a separate company acquired assets from beneficiaries whose identity was hidden by complex offshore structures.</p> <p>Edmonds and Groves said they \u201cstrenuously deny any wrongdoing\u201d.<br></p> <p>Edmonds played in 51 Test matches for England but in recent years has carved out a reputation as a buccaneering City dealmaker alongside Groves, with whom he has raised millions of pounds by floating companies on the London Stock Exchange. </p> <p>In Liberia, at the pair\u2019s business Sable Mining Africa, Global Witness calculates that there were \u201cbribes and highly questionable payments\u201d totalling around $250,000 during a four-month period in 2010.</p> <p>The evidence includes an email sent in August 2010 by Sable\u2019s lawyer Varney Sherman and entitled: \u201cCONFIDENTIAL \u2013 Sable Mining\u2019s Account with Sherman\u201d. The message contains an attachment headed: \u201cFOR EYES ONLY \u2013 ONE COPY ONLY\u201d, which lists a series of transactions, including:</p> <p>\u2022 Payments that appear to have been made to several well-placed Liberian officials \u2013 some as high as $50,000.</p> <p>\u2022 A transfer for $75,000 that is labelled: \u201cPayment (facilitation) revised PPCC Act\u201d \u2013 seemingly a reference to the country\u2019s Public Procurement and Concession Commission Act, which impacted on mining rights.</p> <p>\u2022 Funds being donated to a football club connected with a high-ranking government mandarin.</p> <p>Sable confirmed to the Guardian that it funded the account and that the email had been received by Groves and Heine van Niekerk, who it described as \u201cthe de facto chief operating officer for Sable in west Africa\u201d.</p> <p>Van Niekerk was <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/sable-mining-afr-ltd \u2013 sblm-/rns/delta-mining-consolidated-corporate-update/201206281605554155G/\">dismissed from the Liberia division in 2012</a> for \u201ctheft of intellectual property\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9379857/Former-England-cricketer-Phil-Edmonds-colluded-with-solicitor-to-deprive-rival-of-mining-shares-court-told.html\">just a month before he took Sable to court over a dispute involving him selling Sable a different Liberia mining business</a>.</p> <p>Van Niekerk and Sable settled the case and Van Niekerk said the terms of the deal did not allow him to comment on Sable, but he added that he was not aware of any bribes being paid. His dismissal was ruled unfair in 2013 by South Africa\u2019s Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. Sherman did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Sable added that Groves \u201cdid not pay any attention to [the email] at the time because of the fact Mr Van Niekerk was dealing with matters relating to Liberia\u201d and that the company said it only discovered the payments during an audit in February 2011.</p> <p>At the time of the payments, Groves was chief executive and Edmonds was chairman of Sable, which owned a 36.5% stake in the Liberia business. Sable increased its shareholding to 63.5% in October 2011. </p> <p>Daniel Balint-Kurti, head of special investigations at Global Witness, said: \u201cSable was able to bribe many of Liberia\u2019s top politicians, which is trying to turn the page on 14 years of civil war, corruption and most recently Ebola. This kind of corruption deprives a long-suffering population of the benefits of their resources. The case needs to be investigated and punished if the Liberia government wants its anti-corruption fight to be taken seriously \u2013 its people deserve better.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jim Cochrane, who succeeded Edmonds as chairman of Sable Mining in 2014, said: \u201cSable is committed to ensuring that its business is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner and that any breaches in internal anti-bribery policies and procedures will result in disciplinary action. Although many of the issues raised by Global Witness were subject to internal review a number of years ago, they have prompted a further review of all of these matters. We have found no evidence to support or justify this attack on the company or its directors, past and present.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, the Global Witness report also questions transactions within African Medical Investments, an upmarket African hospital chain, created by Edmonds and Groves. <br></p> <p>They include one deal where the leaked documents show that in February 2010 \u2013 when Edmonds was chairman and Groves a director \u2013 the company purchased a Dassault Falcon 20 private jet for $3.1m \u2013 by acquiring the shares of its South African owner Caramix (Pty) Ltd, itself owned by a British Virgin Islands firm.</p> <p>The plane had been transferred to Caramix from Camec, another Edmonds and Groves business venture. The documents also show that Camec had acquired the aircraft for $1.9m in 2009.</p> <p>In its 2011-12 annual report, the firm admitted it had \u201csignificantly\u201d over-estimated what the plane was worth before revealing that African Medical sold the subsidiary that owned the Falcon for $1.3m in 2012 \u2013 so at a loss to the company of $1.8m.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Edmonds and Groves said: \u201cThere is no reason to believe that [the Falcon purchase] constituted a \u2018related party transaction\u2019 as defined by the AIM [Alternative Investment Market] rules\u201d \u2013 and added that those claims were investigated and dismissed by lawyers appointed by the independent director.</p> <p>She added that no close relatives of Edmonds and Groves benefited from the deal, but declined to say if the beneficiaries were extended family members.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hurrah, a pre-referendum crisis is averted: the European Commission agrees with the UK\u2019s regulatory watchdogs \u2013 Ofcom, on the telecoms beat, and the Competition and Markets Authority \u2013 that O2 and Three should not be allowed to merge. It is not clear if voters give a damn, but they should. It would have been a nonsense if UK regulators had been left to police a mobile telephony market they had judged to be irreversibly damaged by this \u00a310.25bn proposed deal. Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, has therefore taken the diplomatic course in blocking the merger, but there is no reason to assume diplomacy was her motive. This always looked to be a bad deal for UK consumers for several reasons. First, as the commission pointed out, the current set-up of four operators \u2013 BT\u2019s EE, Vodafone, Telef\u00d3nica\u2019s O2 and Hutchison\u2019s Three \u2013 is working well. Mobile prices are among the lowest in the EU and 4G technology is among the most widespread. By contrast, so-called four-to-three consolidations in other parts of Europe have led to price rises for consumers. Second, there was an obvious impediment to future investment in the fact that a merged O2 and Three would have a foot in both the industry\u2019s network-sharing arrangements. Three and EE are partners on one network; O2 and Vodafone on the other. Hutchison\u2019s idea of a remedy \u2013 renting network capacity to piggy-back operators such as Virgin, Sky and Tesco \u2013 looked overelaborate. Third, as Ofcom argued, there is little reason to think investment in next-generation technology will suffer if O2 and Three cannot combine. \u201cCompetition, not consolidation, has driven investment,\u201d it said, pointing out that the industry is hardly in a state of penury: the industry\u2019s cash-flow margins have been above 12% in the UK even while 4G networks have been rolled out. In short, this was a deal too far. Telef\u00f3nica, no doubt, will find a buyer for O2 (perhaps Liberty Global, owner of Virgin Media) if it is determined to sell. As for Hutchison and Three, sympathy is limited. Yes, it\u2019s true that BT, whose leadership in landlines has been mirrored in mobile by the purchase of EE, is a formidable beast these days. But attempting to meet that threat by pursuing a plainly anti-competitive deal was always a high-risk strategy. Get back to competing on price and innovation \u2013 when you are not wasting energy by lobbying Brussels fruitlessly, you do it well. Questions linger over BHS sale The penny seems to have dropped for Sir Philip Green. Moaning about Frank Field, chairman of the work and pensions select committee, is not a wise tactic. It is better to explain what happened in the run-up to the sale of BHS for \u00a31 in March last year. Thus Wednesday\u2019s letter addressing points made on Monday by Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, is welcome. But what did it really tell us? Well, it confirmed the impression that the regulator doesn\u2019t move quickly \u2013 perhaps because it does not have the powers to do so. Green says he \u201cexpressed his strong wish\u201d to agree \u201ca sustainable solution\u201d for the pension scheme in the week before the sale but the regulator\u2019s approach did not allow a speedy discussion. If so, that\u2019s alarming: it suggests the system cannot respond even when alarm bells are ringing. On the other hand, the regulator did not have much to work with. Even on 4 March \u2013 before a deal announced on 11 March \u2013 it was requesting basic details, such as who would be buying BHS. Since the answer turned out to be an outfit led by a thrice-bankrupt individual, Green\u2019s answer to one key question is still keenly awaited: why on earth did he think Retail Acquisitions was a suitable purchaser of a business with a large deficit in its pension fund? Standard Life faces boardroom pay embarrassment It\u2019s embarrassing for fund management houses when their own shareholders protest about excessive pay in the boardroom. That is doubly so when the firm in question is Standard Life, which, relatively speaking, has a record of using its voting muscle to tell FTSE 100 firms to rein it in. So here comes the firm\u2019s late-in-the-day attempt to avert a quarrel at its annual meeting next week. The new chief executive, Keith Skeoch, has thought hard and decided that, on reflection, the chance to earn \u00a33.5m through the 2016 long-term incentive plan is probably overdoing things. He has \u201cvoluntarily\u201d decided to make do with \u00a32.8m. Expressed as a percentage of Skeoch\u2019s \u00a3700,000 salary (which is how the game works), that\u2019s a reduction in his \u201cmaximum opportunity\u201d from 500% to 400%. He may regard that as significant, but shareholders may still beg to differ. In other Standard Life news, Skeoch\u2019s predecessor, David Nish, is still being paid until next month \u2013 even though he left last August of his own choosing. Would Standard Life\u2019s fund managers really back such payments elsewhere? One would hope not.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Keith Skeoch, the new chief executive of Standard Life, is attempting to head off a shareholder protest over his pay by cutting \u00a3700,000 off his potential \u00a33.5m bonus. The Edinburgh-based insurer announced after the stock market had closed on Wednesday that Skeoch would reduce his potential bonus to \u00a32.8m \u2013 400% of his \u00a3700,000-a-year salary \u2013 from the 500% that he had previously been awarded by the company. The move comes ahead of the annual general meeting next week, where the insurer has been braced for a row over executive pay. A clash with investors would be particularly embarrassing given that Skeoch used to run the fund management arm, Standard Life Investments, which holds stakes in companies and often speaks out on boardroom excess. The change to Skeoch\u2019s pay was announced a little over 24 hours before the deadline for shareholders to cast their votes ahead of the AGM. Skeoch\u2019s promotion was announced in June. He replaced David Nish who stood down in August. Nish is being paid his \u00a3835,000 salary and all other benefits until June 2016. As a result of his promotion, Skeoch received a \u00a3200,000 rise in his salary, taking it to \u00a3700,000, although the company said this was 16% lower than his predecessor\u2019s. The salary is topped up with a potential annual bonus of 175% of salary \u2013 lower than the 365% he stood to receive as head of the fund management arm \u2013 and a long-term incentive plan (Ltip) that promised shares worth 500% of his salary, which he has now said can be cut to 400%. There are two other potentially contentious issues that shareholders are considering: a \u00a3700,000 share award to executive Colin Clark, who has been promoted to the board; and the decision to allow Nish to continue to receive bonuses after his departure. Standard Life is hoping the cut to Skeoch\u2019s long-term bonus plan will be enough to pacify big City shareholders who have rebelled against high pay on several occasions this year. Investors voted againstpay deals at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew, and there have been big protest votes at companies such as Anglo American, Shire Pharmaceuticals and CRH. A Standard Life spokesman said: \u201cKeith takes governance and stewardship very seriously and he has actively listened to the general market sentiment expressed over recent weeks towards executive remuneration and he has decided this is the right thing to do.\u201d Sir Gerry Grimstone, chairman of Standard Life, said Skeoch felt it was important to hold the company to the same standards it expected. \u201cI thought the package was appropriate when it was arranged last year but the pay climate has changed since then.\u201d The proxy advisory group ISS has recommended voting against the pay report while another advisory group, Glass Lewis, has recommended supporting the pay. The 500% award under the Ltip had been approved in the remuneration policy that was voted on by shareholders last year.",

      "body": "<p>Keith Skeoch, the new chief executive of Standard Life, is attempting to head off a shareholder protest over his pay by cutting \u00a3700,000 off his potential \u00a33.5m bonus.</p> <p>The Edinburgh-based insurer announced after the stock market had closed on Wednesday that Skeoch would reduce his potential bonus to \u00a32.8m \u2013 400% of his \u00a3700,000-a-year salary \u2013 from the 500% that he had previously been awarded by the company.</p> <p>The move comes ahead of the annual general meeting next week, where the insurer has been braced for a row over executive pay. A clash with investors would be particularly embarrassing given that Skeoch used to run the fund management arm, Standard Life Investments, which holds stakes in companies and often speaks out on boardroom excess.</p> <p>The change to Skeoch\u2019s pay was announced a little over 24 hours before the deadline for shareholders to cast their votes ahead of the AGM. </p> <p>Skeoch\u2019s promotion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/19/standard-life-keith-skeoch-replacing-david-nish-chief-executive\">was announced in June</a>. He replaced David Nish who stood down in August. Nish is being paid his \u00a3835,000 salary and all other benefits until June 2016.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As a result of his promotion, Skeoch received a \u00a3200,000 rise in his salary, taking it to \u00a3700,000, although the company said this was 16% lower than his predecessor\u2019s. </p> <p>The salary is topped up with a potential annual bonus of 175% of salary \u2013 lower than the 365% he stood to receive as head of the fund management arm \u2013 and a long-term incentive plan (Ltip) that promised shares worth 500% of his salary, which he has now said can be cut to 400%.</p> <p>There are two other potentially contentious issues that shareholders are considering: a \u00a3700,000 share award to executive Colin Clark, who has been promoted to the board; and the decision to allow Nish to continue to receive bonuses after his departure.</p> <p>Standard Life is hoping the cut to Skeoch\u2019s long-term bonus plan will be enough to pacify big City shareholders who have rebelled against high pay on several occasions this year. Investors voted<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal\"> againstpay deals at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew</a>, and there have been big protest votes at companies such as Anglo American, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/shareholder-rebellions-shire-pay-agm-ceo-investor-anger\">Shire Pharmaceuticals and CRH</a>. </p> <p>A Standard Life spokesman said: \u201cKeith takes governance and stewardship very seriously and he has actively listened to the general market sentiment expressed over recent weeks towards executive remuneration and he has decided this is the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Gerry Grimstone, chairman of Standard Life, said Skeoch felt it was important to hold the company to the same standards it expected. \u201cI thought the package was appropriate when it was arranged last year but the pay climate has changed since then.\u201d</p> <p>The proxy advisory group ISS has recommended voting against the pay report while another advisory group, Glass Lewis, has recommended supporting the pay. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The 500% award under the Ltip had been approved in the remuneration policy that was voted on by shareholders last year. </p>",

    "webTitle": "Regulator knew I wanted to sell BHS, says Sir Philip Green", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has rebutted a claim by the head of the Pensions Regulator that it only found out about the sale of BHS after reading about it the newspapers. In the latest stage of the row over the collapse of the department store chain, Green said that Lesley Titcomb had given \u201cincorrect\u201d evidence during a hearing with MPs. Green, who announced the sale of BHS on 12 March 2015, said the regulator had been emailed on 6 February last year about his ambition to sell the loss-making business and that he had met with the body on 4 March about the sale. Pension trustees and their advisers met Dominic Chappell, the eventual buyer, in late February 2015, he added. Chris Martin, chairman of the BHS pension scheme, backed up Green\u2019s claims and said trustees had worked \u201copenly and collaboratively\u201d with the regulator since the summer of 2014. However, the Pensions Regulator hit back at Green, saying it was \u201cnot approached for clearance\u201d before the deal and was \u201cnot given sufficient information\u201d to assess the impact on the BHS pension scheme. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at up to \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m during his ownership The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS over the past 13 months. Titcomb told MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and work and pensions committee on Monday that if the Pensions Regulator had been told of the sale, it would have taken steps to ensure provisions had been taken for the pension scheme. Once the regulator learned of the sale, it launched an \u201canti-avoidance\u201d investigation into the funding of its pension scheme, which could force Green to contribute hundreds of millions of pounds towards filling the pension deficit. However, a letter to MPs from Arcadia, Green\u2019s retail business, said the regulator \u201cwas informed of the key terms of the proposed sale of BHS including as to the equity the purchaser was to inject, the existing debt to Arcadia that would be written off, the position of the BHS pension schemes and the plan for the business\u201d. Arcadia has issued the rebuttal in a letter sent by Adam Goldman, the company secretary, to MPs. Goldman said that the regulator was told the sale consideration for BHS would be \u00a31. Referring to the meeting on 4 March 2015, Goldman said: \u201cSpecifically in relation to the BHS pension schemes, Sir Philip expressed his strong wish to agree a sustainable solution and there was a discussion as to the possibility of implementing a restructuring with the approval of the TPR [the Pensions Regulator]. \u201cTPR made it clear at the meeting that it had policies to which it had to adhere and that it was not possible to depart from the policies even in the case of an urgent sale transaction. \u201cIn particular, a restructuring could not be approved by TPR unless the sponsoring employer faced imminent insolvency. \u201cIt was clear from the discussion at the meeting that a restructuring could not be agreed with TPR in the timescales available, even though the TPR had been involved in discussions since at least July 2014.\u201d The chairman of the pension scheme said trustees held further discussions with the regulator after this meeting. In a separate letter to MPs designed to \u201cclarify facts\u201d that were \u201cmisrepresented\u201d by Titcomb, Martin said: \u201cI would like to make clear to the committee that the trustees notified and kept the regulator appraised of developments relating to the sale of the company and shared information with the regulator at all stages of the sale process including joining a meeting on 4 March 2015 with representatives of both TPR and Arcadia at which the sale of BHS was discussed. \u201cThe trustees and their advisers also kept TPR updated in subsequent conference calls and emails - including an email of 10 March 2015 - in the days leading up to the announcement of the sale.\u201d However, in a response to MPs, Titcomb said the Pensions Regulator was unaware that Retail Acquisitions was the buyer, meaning it is unlikely to have known about Chappell\u2019s background as a three-time bankrupt. Titcomb said the regulator began talks with trustees over the sale of BHS in January and was told that the likely buyer was \u201ca company called Swiss Rock\u201d. Swiss Rock later changed its name to Retail Acquisitions, but the regulator says it was not informed of this change. Referring to the 4 March meeting, Titcomb said: \u201cWe discussed terms of a potential imminent sale. However, there was not sufficient information to assess the potential impact on the pension schemes.\u201d Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, said the new evidence was alarming. MPs had accused the Pensions Regulator of being toothless during the hearing with Titcomb on Monday. Field said: \u201cThis is an important intervention by Sir Philip Green. Its central message is disturbing and does nothing to change my view of the adequacy or otherwise of pension regulation. The committee has sent a copy of the letter to the Pensions Regulator. We urgently await their response.\u201d Meanwhile, Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator to BHS, is trying to find a buyer for the business. It is understood to have received at least five indicative offers for the high street retailer as a going concern before the 5pm deadline on Tuesday. Former owner Chappell is thought to be among the bidders alongside: Cascade Holdings, a BHS lighting supplier headed by Ronny Abrahams; Yousuf Bhailok, a Preston-based property entrepreneur; cut price chain B&amp;M: and Philip Day, who owns Edinburgh Woollen Mill and the Peacocks fashion retail chain. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct is understood to have held back from placing an offer at present and some other bidders are thought to be waiting in the wings. Ashley has said he would keep all stores open and not make redundancies if he made a bid, a pledge that is likely to put him at the top of the administrator\u2019s list.",

      "bodyText": "The European commission has blocked Three\u2019s \u00a310.25bn takeover of O2 on competition grounds, more than a year after the deal to form Britain\u2019s biggest mobile phone operator was announced. Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner for competition, announced the decision at a news conference on Wednesday, just over a week before the 19 May deadline. She said the takeover would probably have increased prices and reduced choice for consumers by placing too much power with one mobile operator. Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate that owns Three, agreed in March 2015 to buy O2 from Telef\u00f3nica of Spain. The deal would have transformed Three from the smallest to the biggest mobile operator in the UK. It would have given Hutchison more than 40% of UK mobile phone users, with over 30 million customers, and reduced the number of network owners from four to three: Hutchison, Vodafone and BT, which has bought EE. Vestager, who is Danish, said: \u201cThe commission has decided to block Hutchison\u2019s plan to take over O2 in the UK. \u201cThis transaction would have created a market leader, a market leader that would have had influence over mobile network infrastructure in the UK. \u201cOur investigation revealed significant competition concerns with this deal. \u201cIt would very likely have led to higher prices and less choice for UK consumers. Innovation in the very important mobile sector would then have been harmed.\u201d She said the deal would have reduced competition for customers by turning Three from a challenger into the biggest operator and given the merged company a stake in two of the three remaining networks, because Vodafone and O2 share the Beacon network. The result would have been less innovation and investment, Vestager said. Hutchison said it was deeply disappointed by the commission\u2019s decision and it would consider an appeal once it had studied the ruling in detail. The company, owned by Hong Kong\u2019s richest man, Li Ka-shing, said: \u201cWe strongly believe that the merger would have brought major benefits to the UK, not only by unlocking \u00a310bn of private sector investment in the UK\u2019s digital infrastructure but also by addressing the country\u2019s coverage issues, enhancing network capacity, speeds and price competition for consumers.\u201d The commission decided in December to take control of the competition inquiry, overruling a request from Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to decide the matter. Last month, the CMA called on the commission to block the deal or force the combined company to sell either O2 or Three to an approved buyer because, it said, Hutchison\u2019s proposed remedies were too weak. Sharon White, the head of Ofcom \u2013 the UK\u2019s communications regulator \u2013 also warned this year that the deal would harm competition. Vestager said the commission might have allowed the deal if Hutchison had agreed to the creation of a fourth large mobile operator but it refused to do so. Hutchison had offered a five-year price freeze, investment to improve coverage and reliability and a move to share some of the merged network with operators such as Sky, Virgin and Tesco. Telefonica wanted to sell O2 to reduce its debt and could try to do a deal with Liberty Global of the US, which owns Virgin Media in the UK and has said it could be interested. Imran Choudhary, director of consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \u201cFewer competitors can mean less pressure to keep prices down and this threat was obviously too great in the regulators\u2019 minds. O2 will ideally still look for a buyer and Virgin Media could certainly step in.\u201d The commission announced its decision amid fierce campaigning before next month\u2019s referendum on EU membership, increasing the political significance of the ruling. Vestager said the commission took into account the views of UK authorities, including Ofcom and the CMA, and that the decision showed Europe and the UK shared the same objectives. She denied political pressure not to overrule UK regulators had influenced the commission\u2019s decision and said the ruling had to be strong enough to stand up to a court appeal, dismissing implications that \u201cwe take it very lightly and it is kind of a game\u201d. She said: \u201cI have weighed the decision and it is 2.56kg and it is a very heavy decision. It\u2019s a lot of work that goes into this and we can\u2019t let politics go into this.\u201d Hutchison said it would concentrate on getting commission approval for its agreed \u20ac22bn (\u00a315bn) merger of its Italian subsidiary 3 Italia with its rival, Wind. But Vestager\u2019s ruling, which indicated a tougher line against mobile phone mergers, cast doubt on that deal.",

      "bodyText": "It was a down day for European stock markets as investors decided to cash in after Tuesday\u2019s gains inspired by the signs of progress in the Greek financial crisis. Some disappointing results from the US - notable Disney and Macy\u2019s - sent the US market lower and undermined sentiment elsewhere. Banking shares were also under pressure, especially in Italy after a couple of disappointing updates. But a rise in oil prices after a surprise drop in US crude inventories helped the commodity-heavy FTSE 100 outperform its peers, and even record a slight increase on the day. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 5.84 points or 0.09% at 6162.49 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.7% to 9975.32 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.5% at 4316.67 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.32% to 17,698.08 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.27% at 8663.9 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.63% to 619.06 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 125 points or 0.7%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More signs that Greece may be heading in the right direction. Bloomberg reports: The European Central Bank could discuss restoring Greek banks\u2019 access to its refinancing lines as soon as their June 2 policy meeting, people familiar with the matter said. A new waiver on Greece\u2019s junk-rated debt will probably be proposed by the ECB board once a staff-level agreement between the government and auditors representing creditor institutions is reached, the people said, asking not to be named as the matter is confidential. A spokesman for the central bank declined to comment. The Governing Council doesn\u2019t have to accept board proposals. Euro-area finance ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday signaled they could sign off on Greece\u2019s bailout review at their next meeting on May 24 once the country has legislated the final actions required for loan disbursements. Greek collateral has been without a waiver since February last year, forcing the nation\u2019s banks onto Emergency Liquidity Assistance, when the new government said it wouldn\u2019t complete its aid program at the time because of the austerity measures required. The full story is here. Here\u2019s the complete comment from Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at FOREX.com, on the US inventory numbers: The American Petroleum Institute got it completely wrong. Contrary to the API, the official data from the US Department of Energy, which has just been released, shows that crude stockpiles dropped by a surprisingly large 3.4 million barrels last week, not increase. The drawdown may well have been due to the wildfires in Canada as the latter\u2019s main export market is the US. Indeed, US crude oil imports were down by a good 5,000 barrels per day from the previous week, according to the DoE. Imports are likely to fall further this week because of the significant reduction of oil output in Canada. News that US oil production also fell, down 0.3% week-over-week, provided further support to prices. Brent crude is now up 1.7% at $46.33 a barrel following the fall in US oil inventories. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: Crude oil flew higher following the release of the latest inventory data from the EIA. This showed a fall of 3.4 million barrels compared with an expected build of 100,000 barrels. Nevertheless, the charts suggest that crude is struggling to break above resistance which comes in around $46 for WTI and $48 for Brent. There\u2019s support for both contracts around the $42 per barrel level. Oil could be consolidating now ahead of another leg higher. Crude has put in an impressive rally since the beginning of the year and needs to build a base before it can push up further. However, an alternative view is that crude is losing its upside momentum. Temporary supply disruptions won\u2019t offset the likelihood of increased production the closer we get to $50 per barrel. Meanwhile, the outlook for demand growth is a bit foggier now as there\u2019s increasing evidence that global economic activity is slowing once again. These EIA figures do not match figures from the American Petroleum Institute, which on Tuesday reported a rise in inventories. Instead of an expected rise in weekly crude stocks, the latest report from the Energy Information Administration shows a surprise fall. Crude inventories dropped 3.41m barrels to 539.98m compared to the expected 0.71m barrel increase. Weekly gasoline stocks fell by 1.23m and distillate stocks by 1.65m, both bigger than expected declines. Over in Spain, the country has received more than \u20ac10.5bn of demand for a \u20ac3bn 50-year bond it plans to issue. Meanwhile Chancellor George Osborne has told a select committee that the Treasury and Bank of England are doing a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of Brexit contingency planning. A reminder you can follow the select committee on the EU referendum in the Politics live blog. UK economic growth slowed down in the three months to April, partly due to uncertainty over the EU referendum, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. It said UK GDP grew by 0.3% in the three months to April, compared to 0.4% in the first three months of the year and 0.6% late last year. Researcher Jack Meaning said: UK economic growth continues to be subdued compared with the rates we saw at the end of last year. Some of this slowdown is undoubtedly a result of heightened uncertainty around the impending EU referendum, and so is likely to be temporary should the UK decide to remain in the EU after June 23. US markets have fallen back in early trading, with poor results from Disney and department store group Macy\u2019s weighing on sentiment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 84 points or 0.48% after a strong performance on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened down 0.2%. European markets have also edged lower, with Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.65% and France\u2019s Cac 0.61% lower. The FTSE 100 is performing better, down just 0.12%. Just a reminder, Chancellor George Osborne is about to be questioned by the Treasury Select Committee on the European referendum. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is following the hearing over at the Politics live blog: Shares in European banks are on the slide today, with Italian institutions under particular pressure following losses or falling profits from Banco Popolare and Banco Popolare di Milano. The FTSE Italia banking index is currently down 3.68%. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s piece on the problems at Italy\u2019s banks: Back with UK interest rates, and a Reuters poll of economists shows they continue to expect the first hike - of 25 basis points - will not come until the first quarter of 2017. They forecast rates will be 1% at the end of 2017 and 1.5% at the end of the following year, lower than previous expectation. In the last survey in April the figures were 1.25% and 1.75% respectively. They cited the risk of Brexit and the fragile global economy as the biggest threats to UK growth this year, expecting it to increase by 0.4% to 0.6% a quarter to the third quarter of 2017. The oil price has recovered from its earlier falls, which were prompted by continuing concerns about oversupply as Canadian oil firms restarted production following the Fort McMurray wildfires. But, ahead of the US weekly inventory data, Brent is now up 0.8% at $45.89 a barrel as Shell announced the closure of a key Nigerian pipeline, which is likely to push the country\u2019s production to its lowest level for more than two decades. The poor UK data comes, of course, a day ahead of the latest Bank of England decision on interest rates. They are expected to be kept on hold but one former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee believes a cut would be in order: Hat-tip to the Independent\u2019s Ben Chu for this chart, showing how Britain\u2019s factory output has gone into reverse in recent months: Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank confirms that Britain\u2019s factory sector is in recession again: This is the third time the industrial sector has entered a technical recession since 2008. After sharp declines during the Lehman-recession, in 2011 the sector contracted again for six quarters in a row. He blames weak global demand, and the strength of the pound. Production industries are export oriented and are thus highly sensitive to changes in global demand and exchange rates. Since 2011, goods exports to the EU \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest export market \u2013 have fallen by 20%. As this chart shows, industrial export orders are also below long-term averages, and the recent turbulence in the markets won\u2019t have helped: David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, says Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector is in \u2018long-term decline\u2019. He blamed problems at home, and abroad: \u201cDespite a modest recovery in March, longer-term trends show that both manufacturing and total industrial output remain in negative territory. While adverse global conditions remain a major challenge for manufacturing, this is now being exacerbated by a slowdown in the domestic economy Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s news story on the O2 takeover being red-carded. Newsflash from Brussels: The EC has decide to block the \u00a310.5bn takeover of mobile phone operator O2. Competition chief Margrethe Vestager has concluded that UK consumers would suffer if CK Hutchison, which already owns the Three network, also got hold of O2. Britain\u2019s industrial sector is back in recession, for the third time in eight years. Today\u2019s industrial production report shows that production shrank by 0.4% in January-March quarter. That the second quarterly contraction in a row, following steep declines in autumn 2015. We flagged up earlier that Germany, France and the Netherlands had also reported rough industrial production data this week. So with Britain\u2019s manufacturing output falling 1.9% in the last year, there are concerns that the European recovery could be in trouble. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says: \u201cThere isn\u2019t too much in the data to lift economic spirits as a small increase in manufacturing output in March doesn\u2019t change the picture of an overall weak start to the year. As ever, it\u2019s a mixed picture across different sectors with a bit more evidence that the sectors hardest hit by the oil price collapse are now bottoming out while construction related sectors seem to be holding up. \u201cBut, in line with the early warning signal from the PMI and the drop in consumer confidence, consumer facing sectors, including motor vehicles, are seeing weaker production trends at the start of the year. Whether this proves to be temporary is yet to be seen but UK manufacturers are far from alone in seeing this trend with other data from Europe suggesting that the industrial recovery is far from secure.\u201d This handy chart shows how Britain\u2019s industrial sector fared in the last three months -- not a pretty picture, alas: Today\u2019s report also shows that Britain\u2019s manufacturing output has shrunk by 0.4% over the last quarter. That\u2019s a pretty rough start to 2016, suggesting that the slowdown in the global economy hurt factories. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight remarks: The march of the makers was a veritable crawl in March and they went backwards over the first quarter! Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has suffered its biggest annual fall in output in almost three years, in another signal that the economy is weakening. Manufacturing output in March this year was 1.9% lower than in March 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics new healthcheck on the sector. It\u2019s the biggest year-on-year drop since May 2013. The fall was led by a 4% drop in the manufacture of basic metals &amp; metal products. The ONS says that iron and steel production has shrunk particularly sharply over the last year. The largest contribution to the fall within this sub-sector came from the manufacture of basic iron &amp; steel, which decreased by 37.3% compared with a year ago and contributed -0.3 percentage points to total production. Anecdotal evidence suggested shutdowns within the industry were contributing factors to the decrease. That could include the Redcar plant in the North East of England, which closed down last autumn. On a monthly basis, manufacturing output crept up by just 0.1% in March compared to April, weaker than the 0.3% which economists expected. The wider measure of industrial production, which includes mining, rose by 0.3% month-on-month but was only 0.1% higher than a year ago. Another blow to the government\u2019s \u2018March of the Makers\u2019. Although, as this chart shows, UK manufacturing has been pretty stagnant for almost 20 years: The boss of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder has warned that it could struggle to find workers if the UK leaves the European Union. David Thomas, CEO of Barratt Developments, said this morning: \u201cWe have a significant part of our labour force, particularly within the London market, coming from continental Europe \u2014 the free movement of labour in the European market is a positive from our point of view.\u201d FastFT have more details: Oversupply fears are dragging the oil price down again this morning, and helping to push shares down too. Brent crude has shed 1%, to $45.07 per barrel, with traders citing fresh fears about oil gluts. A report from the US Energy Information Administration this afternoon is expected to show that oil stockpiles have risen again, due to weaker demand and persistent overproduction. That situation could worsen again soon as Canadian oil firms are restarting production following the Fort McMurray wildfires, which forced them to stop pumping. Over in Germany, opposition is mounting against the European Central Bank\u2019s plan to stop making \u20ac500 notes. The ECB was already falling out of favour among many Germans, who are cross that record low interest rates are hurting savers. The decision to phase out the eurozone\u2019s largest note has thrown fuel on the fire, with critics claiming there\u2019s a secret plan to abolish cash. A protest against the move has been called for this Saturday, as Bloomberg explains: A group called Stoppbargeldverbot -- Stop The Ban on Cash -- affiliated to the insurgent anti-euro Alternative for Germany party, has organized the Frankfurt demonstration for May 14. Its leaders see a creeping effort by the German government, commercial banks, the European Union and the ECB to eliminate cash and to subject citizens to the electronic surveillance of their financial affairs. The ECB says printing of 500-euro notes is being halted because of concerns it facilitates criminal activities. The note will stay legal tender, other denominations will remain and Draghi has said cash will continue to have a role in payments. Nevertheless, Clemens Fuest, president of the Munich-based Ifo institute, argued on May 4 that the decision \u201cundermines trust\u201d in the central bank. \u201cWhy should we not press for this decision with the 500-euro note to be revoked?\u201d Max Otte, author of one of several books on the threat to cash published in German in the last 12 months, said in an interview. \u201cThe anti-cash lobby is very strong, and it\u2019s also an anti-citizen lobby, an anti-freedom lobby.\u201d More here: Draghi Cast as Cash Conspirator Foreshadows German Clash on Exit Today\u2019s UK industrial production report comes hot on the heels of some poor data from Europe. Yesterday Germany, France and the Netherlands all reported disappointing figures; French factory output fell 0.3%, it was down 1.3% in Germany and an alarming 2.4% in the Netherlands. The figures suggest that eurozone growth may be slipping, after starting the year relatively strongly. European markets are falling in early(ish) trading, as City investors brace for today\u2019s UK industrial production report in an hour\u2019s time. Mining shares are up in London, led by Randgold (+2.3%), but banks and travel companies are falling. Conner Campbell of Spreadex reckons yesterday\u2019s burst of optimism over Greece\u2019s bailout has petered out: The Eurozone has had a pretty fantastic start to the week, the DAX crossing 10000 as investors displayed their relief at the signs of progress in regards to the Greek debt debate. Yet the region\u2019s indices have begun to tick back this Wednesday, the DAX and CAC slipping 0.4% and 0.6% respectively. With little on the agenda until Friday\u2019s GDP data dump, and the post-Eurogroup enthusiasm unable to sustain itself for a third day in arrow, the Eurozone indices may struggle build on their early in the week spurt as the day continues. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After two days of Greek debt drama, today looks rather quieter, I\u2019m afraid. Only two items on the agenda, which will show how well (or badly) Britain\u2019s economy is performing: At 9.30am we get the UK industrial production report for March. Economists are expecting a small rise in industrial output, perhaps 0.3%, after a weak February. A disappointing number, though, will reignite concerns that the UK manufacturers are suffering from weaker overseas demand. And as CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson flags up, the steel industry has been finding life particularly tough, with thousands of jobs now on the line as Tata seeks a buyer for its British plants. We already know from the January and February data that manufacturing has come under pressure in recent months, with the Tata steel headlines keeping it in the forefront of the public\u2019s thinking, while the most recent PMI data has also been weak. Then at 3pm, the NIESR thinktank publishes its estimate for UK growth over the last three months (February to April). That may show that concerns over June\u2019s Brexit referendum have hurt the economy. We\u2019ll also be watching for Greek developments, and chewing through results from housebuilder Barratt, brewer Carlsberg, carmaker Toyota and bookmaker William Hill. Hopefully something else will come up too....",

Contrary to the API, the official data from the US Department of Energy, which has just been released, shows that crude stockpiles dropped by a surprisingly large 3.4 million barrels last week, not increase.</p> <p>The drawdown may well have been due to the wildfires in Canada as the latter\u2019s main export market is the US. Indeed, US crude oil imports were down by a good 5,000 barrels per day from the previous week, according to the DoE. Imports are likely to fall further this week because of the significant reduction of oil output in Canada. News that US oil production also fell, down 0.3% week-over-week, provided further support to prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573344d9e4b08056de8fa338\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-11T14:44:01.896Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Brent crude is now up 1.7% at $46.33 a barrel following the fall in US oil inventories. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude oil flew higher following the release of the latest inventory data from the EIA. This showed a fall of 3.4 million barrels compared with an expected build of 100,000 barrels. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the charts suggest that crude is struggling to break above resistance which comes in around $46 for WTI and $48 for Brent. There\u2019s support for both contracts around the $42 per barrel level. Oil could be consolidating now ahead of another leg higher. Crude has put in an impressive rally since the beginning of the year and needs to build a base before it can push up further. However, an alternative view is that crude is losing its upside momentum.</p> <p>Temporary supply disruptions won\u2019t offset the likelihood of increased production the closer we get to $50 per barrel. Meanwhile, the outlook for demand growth is a bit foggier now as there\u2019s increasing evidence that global economic activity is slowing once again. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57334486e4b0a3721d6056a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-11T14:41:36.581Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/status/730405903522881540\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTI?src=hash\">#WTI</a> oil has jumped on this surprise as you would expect.

      "bodyText": "Leading construction firms have formally apologised to hundreds of trade unionists for putting them on an illegal blacklist and denying them work. The firms issued the \u201cunreserved and sincere\u201d apology in the high court to bring to an end a long-running legal action by workers who had sought to uncover the truth behind the secret blacklist. The firms have agreed to pay sums understood to total about \u00a375m to 771 blacklisted workers, under out-of-court settlements to avoid a trial that was due to open this week. Payouts to individuals range from \u00a325,000 to \u00a3200,000. The blacklist was funded by more than 40 construction firms including Sir Robert McAlpine and Balfour Beatty and contained files on more than 3,200 workers. It was closed down by the information commissioner in 2009 following publication of an article in the Guardian the previous year. The firms\u2019 apology \u201cfor the distress and anxiety caused\u201d to the blacklisted workers and their families was read out by barristers on Wednesday to a packed courtroom in front of Mr Justice Supperstone. The reading was interrupted by Dave Smith, spokesman for the Blacklist Support Group, which represents many of the victimised workers. He shouted: \u201cUnder no circumstances do we consider this to be a sincere apology.\u201d About 40 blacklisted workers applauded him and chanted \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d. Later, Smith, whose group wants a public inquiry to expose fully the blacklisting conspiracy, said: \u201cThe only thing the firms are sorry for is getting caught.\u201d In the apology read to the high court in London, the firms admitted that since the late 1960s they had been \u201cinvolved in secretly collecting, storing and distributing among themselves information about workers who had, or who were applying for, work in the construction industry\u201d. They said: \u201cThe simple purpose of this operation was to create a database of information to vet particular workers in the construction industry.\u201d The firms accepted that \u201ctheir secret vetting operation should never have happened. It caused harm to the employment opportunities of many workers. The secret nature of the operation meant that those on the database had no way of establishing whether they were included in it, or any chance to challenge the information that was kept and available for dissemination.\u201d The apology outlined how files on the workers listed details such as their personal background, employment histories and \u201csuspected political affiliations or sympathies, or perceived militancy\u201d. Some files included \u201cprivate matters relating to health or personal relationships\u201d. Names of potential employees were checked against the secret files. \u201cThis process often led to the failure of an application for employment or to the dismissal of an individual if they were already employed when the relevant name coincided with a record card,\u201d the firms said. The apology listed those who had headed the secret operation since 1993 \u2013 Cullum McAlpine and David Cochrane of McAlpine, Tony Jennings of John Laing Construction, Danny O\u2019Sullivan of Kier, Stephen Quant of Skanska and Trevor Watcham of Balfour Beatty. The firms \u2013 Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O\u2019Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and Vinci \u2013 told the court that they hoped their apology meant that \u201cthis matter can be treated as a closed chapter\u201d. Members of the Blacklist Support Group said they welcomed the apology for \u201cputting on public record the shameful activities that have tarnished the reputation of an entire industry\u201d, but they were extremely sceptical about \u201cabout how genuine the apology really is\u201d. Smith said: \u201cThe financial settlements are not fair nor reasonable. Although the settlement in total is a massive victory, some individuals were forced to settle for compensation far below their actual loss due to the way the British legal system favours the rich and powerful.\u201d Roy Bentham, another member of the group, told Supperstone that he did not accept the compensation offer made to him and wanted the trial to go ahead so the evidence about the blacklisting operation would be aired in public. He said he would represent himself, but the judge rejected his application. Gesturing at other blacklisted workers in court, Bentham said: \u201cIt has been a privilege to stand beside them and this battle will go on. This will be judged in time because this hasn\u2019t been justice today \u2026 a lousy bit of compensation here and there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Government hopes of rebalancing the UK\u2019s service-sector-dominated economy have been dealt a blow with the latest official data showing industry slipping into its third downturn within a decade. A slight pickup in activity in March was not enough to offset sharp falls in output earlier in 2016 and meant production dropped for the second successive quarter \u2013 the definition of a recession. The Office for National Statistics said industrial production \u2013 which is made up of manufacturing, mining and quarrying, North Sea oil and gas, water supply and the supply of electricity and gas \u2013 is 10% lower than it was when the UK entered recession in early 2008. Manufacturing, which makes up 70% of industrial production, has been hard hit by the crisis in the steel sector, with output almost 2% lower in March 2016 than it was a year earlier. Manufacture of basic metals and metal production has dropped by 4% over the past year, contributing to the steepest fall in industrial production since May 2013. City analysts said industry\u2019s travails were likely to continue in the second quarter of 2016, with the impact of the looming EU referendum exacerbating the impact of weak global demand. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \u201cSurveys of manufacturing, services and construction point to GDP rising at an equivalent quarterly rate of 0.1% in April. Growth could be even weaker if the surveys disappoint in coming months, which seems probable given the intensifying uncertainty over the outcome of the EU referendum.\u201d David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that manufacturing remained in long-term decline, despite a modest recovery in March. \u201cWhile adverse global conditions remain a major challenge for manufacturing, this is now being exacerbated by a slowdown in the domestic economy,\u201d he said. \u201cA healthy manufacturing base remains critical to the wellbeing of the UK economy in key areas such as innovation, exports and productivity, making it vital that the sector is given more support to compete against global and domestic headwinds.\u201d Analysts had expected a more substantial 0.3% recovery since February after strong output figures from the car industry and an improvement in pharmaceuticals. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders for the first quarter of the year showed UK factories produced 443,581 cars, up 10.3% on same quarter last year. It was the strongest first-quarter performance since 2004. The wider measure of industrial production, which includes mining, rose by 0.3% month on month but was only 0.1% higher than a year ago. Mining continued to decline in March, but an increase in energy production, attributed to the colder weather that arrived in the spring after a mild winter, pushed up industrial production overall. Ruth Miller, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the next few months would be tough but an improvement later in the year was likely as the lower pound helped exporters. \u201cWhile Brexit uncertainty may be partly to blame, the sector\u2019s poor performance of late is certainly nothing new and many of the headwinds to growth in 2015 emanating from a weak global environment are still in place. But we still expect things to look up as the year progresses. \u201cSterling\u2019s recent depreciation and our expectations that global growth will pick up slightly in 2016 should allow the sector to return to modest growth later this year.\u201d",

Why have we lost so many of the higher paying jobs that factories gave? Is it the price we have to pay for believing in democracy and capitalism? Is it because we are in the EU? No, it\u2019s because we have been led by a misguided capitalist sect that treat free markets as a gift of God, rather than a tool for human beings. So let\u2019s think about how things have gone wrong, as illustrated by the latest manufacturing figures. We first let manufacturing rot. We stopped putting our backs into making things. We thought we were too advanced to have to worry about that. We broke up its capacity, raised its energy costs, we decreased the support for research and development. We were breathtakingly complacent about our inherent economic superiority. But we have continued to buy more and more things from abroad. As a result, our trade deficit is now greater than it has been at any point since 2008. Don\u2019t worry, they say, the free market will produce everything that we need, at the best price, somewhere in the world. We can even buy the essentials \u2013 the food, the energy, or the defence capacity of bullets and missiles and planes we need from abroad. The problem is that it was your job to do the making. It was how you earned money to buy other things. Now you have a lower-paid job, possibly in a retail outlet selling the things made abroad. So even if the global free market produces all you need, it will not give us, the people of the UK, a pay packet to buy things with. And if you don\u2019t have a job, what happens if resources become scarce, or those who have the goods use that position to control the actions of others? What are we doing? We are selling off more and more of the country to keep enough affluence to sustain our appetite to consume. How else will we be able to keep buying our foreign-made iPhones? Becoming isolationist is no answer. But the UK does need to take the opportunities a market economy gives us. And we are not doing that; we are letting others take advantage of our home opportunities. We need to cast off our obsession with not dirtying our hands with manufacturing and invest in our own infrastructure and training. Give jobs to our own builders and industries to make the things we need. At the moment we have historically low interest rates in an attempt to keep the economy going. The consequence is that there are very few opportunities to make money. There is a decreasing demand for the stuff we do still make. So why not have a drive to build things for the nation? Our government can and must lead in the national interest. They can make Olympic-style projects with development authorities that organise the build. This would then drive the demand our factories need. Why won\u2019t they do this? A generation of politicians have confused debt that grows because of expenditure, which needs trimming, and debt for investment that generates other income and a bigger tax take. They have confused Stalinist central planning with having a strategy for UK Plc. They confuse purpose with an aversion to markets, because they are 19th-century thinkers. We can start rebuilding the capacity and skills we need as a 21st-century manufacturing economy. We\u2019ll build stuff for ourselves and have the factories to make things for others. Then our country will have the funds to do the things it should. To appropriately care for an ageing population. To invest in homes and education for talented young people. To properly find the research and development which industry must have To compete. And you will be able to buy that IPhone-100, or even a high-tech product designed and built right here in the UK.

      "bodyText": "Nearly half a million shop workers, mostly female, are in danger of losing their jobs as a result of changes on the high street and the growth of online retailing. The group, aged between 26 and 45, are identified as a \u201clost generation\u201d in a survey conducted by the industry trade body the British Retail Consortium (BRC), published on Wednesday. The research suggests there is a gloomy outlook for the workers, many of whom are carers who need to work close to their family home, as they could find it hard to find alternative jobs. Sir Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of the BRC and the John Lewis Partnership, said the Retail 2020 report \u201cincludes some worrying findings\u201d. The retail sector, the country\u2019s largest private sector employer, is going through unprecedented upheaval as changes in shopping habits see sales move online, reducing the number of shoppers on the nation\u2019s high streets. Some 46,000 UK shops lie empty and about a third of those have been empty for more than three years. Using the benchmark of earning less than \u00a38.05 an hour, the BRC says 1.5 million people work in low-paid UK retail jobs. About 70% are female and one in five receive means-tested working age tax credits. Increasingly major retail chains are retreating from high street parades, opting instead to run fewer, larger stores that are a destination for shoppers, a trend that has contributed to the number of people employed in retail falling for the last seven years. At the same time retailers are facing rising costs \u2013 most recently from the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d \u2013 and sluggish, if any, sales growth as shoppers switch their spending power to entertainment, holidays and eating out. The rate of store closures was accelerated by the financial crisis, which claimed major high street chains such as Woolworths. The sector is braced for fresh pain following the collapse of the department store chain BHS and fashion retailer Austin Reed, which together employ more than 12,000 people. Although the chains have attracted interest from potential suitors, store closures are likely to be a feature of any rescue deal. In March, Lord Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, said trading conditions for retailers this year could be the worst since the financial crisis. Warning that 2016 could feel like \u201cwalking up the down escalator\u201d the Tory peer pointed to slowing earnings growth, weakening economic output and a possible permanent shift in consumer spending habits towards nights out, holidays and other non-retail spending. British retailers suffered their sharpest drop in sales for eight months in April as more cautious shoppers reined in spending and cold weather affected sales of spring and summer clothing, industry figures showed on Tuesday. The BRC echoed comments from Next and Sainsbury\u2019s about the \u201cexperience economy\u201d competing with shops for consumers\u2019 disposable income. The national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour for workers aged 25 or above took effect last month. Many retailers, including B&amp;Q and Waitrose, have been cutting staff benefits and pay for Sundays and bank holidays to offset the higher costs but others, such as Greggs, have said they can absorb the change without changing terms for staff. Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, predicted last year that retailers would increase prices or cut large numbers of jobs as the national living wage rises to \u00a39 by 2020. With supermarkets locked in a price war, the grocery sector, which employs about 1 million people, is likely to cut jobs by speeding up automation, Moody\u2019s said. However, it said the national living wage could benefit retailers by putting more money in the pockets of British shoppers.",

The move follows last month\u2019s announcement of the \u20ac1.2bn sale of its Hotelbeds business, and forms part of its restructuring in the wake of 2014\u2019s merger of London-listed Tui Travel and parent group Tui AG. The group also plans to sell its near 12% stake in shipping group Hapag-Lloyd. It said the specialist brands did not fit with its main holiday and cruise business which account for around 85% of its revenues. The proceeds of the sale and the Hotelbeds disposal will be invested in growth opportunities and to strengthen its balance sheet. Analysts said disappointment that there would be no cash return to shareholders helped sent Tui\u2019s shares down 23p to \u00a310.45 after the news. Meanwhile half year turnover rose 2.7% and earnings climbed 16.3%, with the UK business and cruises doing particularly well. It said summer bookings were in line with expectations, although it has seen a shift away from Turkey to other destinations. It confirmed it expected full year earnings growth of at least 10%. UBS said the revenues were lower than expected but earnings were better, which was also likely to be putting pressure on the shares: The shares have been strong into the results and [we] expect the lower revenue result could cause some softness, although EBITA is better than expected. Shore Capital\u2019s Greg Johnson said: Having recently announced the disposal of its Hotelbeds division for \u20ac1.2bn the group has today announced its intentions to dispose of its Specialist Group, which made a profit of \u20ac56m last year. Net debt at the period end was \u20ac1.5bn, which broadly marks the seasons low point for cash flow and is effectively covered by the disposal of the Hotelbeds and the likely proceeds from the Specialist Division. The current trading backdrop, interim performance and outlook are encouraging. We would expect to maintain our 2016 pretax profit estimate of \u20ac1,019m ( earnings per share \u20ac1.14) \u2013 pre any adjustment for the Hotelbeds disposal. The stock trades on a 2016 PE of 12 times. However, back-out Hotelbeds, cruises and hotels and the core tour operator trades on a mid-single digit.

And catering group Compass was also one of the climbers, up 16p to \u00a312.78 after it said it would meet full year expectations following strong demand for its services in North America and Europe. Half year revenues rose 5.8% to \u00a39.7bn, slightly down on the 5.9% growth seen in the first quarter, while operating profits after restructuring costs rose 4.8% to \u00a3724m. Chief executive Richard Cousins said: Savings from restructuring are starting to come through, and are offsetting the weakness in Offshore and Remote and some emerging markets. Therefore margins pre-restructuring were flat. Our pipeline of new contracts is encouraging and our focus on organic growth, efficiencies and cash gives us confidence in achieving another year of delivery. The company, which serves 5bn meals a year to schools, hospitals and entertainment sites, won contracts for the New Las Vegas Arena and basketball\u2019s Oracle Arena in the US and Brighterkind in the UK. In a hold note, Numis said: We are encouraged by the strong start to the year and in our view, Compass is a very high quality business and we share management\u2019s view that there are promising structural growth opportunities globally with potential for further revenue and margin growth. However, we believe that this promise is captured in the 2016 PE ratio of 21.3 times. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 19.06 points to 6137.59, with banks among the main fallers. Standard Chartered is down 12.85p at 483.10p while Royal Bank of Scotland has dropped 4.9p to 210.3p. But among the mining shares Randgold Resources has risen 150p to \u00a360.40 while Glencore - up 2.65p at 136.55p - and Rio Tinto - up 4p at \u00a320.05 - benefitted from positive recommendations from Canaccord Genuity. It said: We have revised forecasts following the recent first quarter production reports and changes to our commodity price assumptions. We have also factored in other recent news flow, in particular the planned disposal by Anglo American of its niobium and phosphates business for $1.5bn. We apply a higher commodity price deck for most commodities, and the net result is that we have raised our earnings forecasts and target prices. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: It\u2019s something of a mixed start to trade this morning, with that strong finish on Wall Street evidently counting for little. Commodity prices remain generally upbeat and although crude oil is off a little on resurgent oversupply fears, that too is holding onto the vast majority of yesterday\u2019s gains, so we do at least have the natural resources stocks scattered across the top of the board.
