      "bodyText": "G4S has sold its US subsidiary that runs the controversial Guant\u00e1namo Bay US naval base, where 149 terrorism suspects are being held without charge. The British security firm said on Wednesday that it had sold its US government solutions division, which runs all the cleaning and facilities services at the base, to an undisclosed buyer for $135m (\u00a385m). The sale comes less than three months after G4S secured a $117m contract to run the services at the base in south-eastern Cuba.

      "body": "<p>George Osborne has been handed a \u00a31.1bn windfall for next month\u2019s pre-election autumn statement after the City regulator imposed record fines on five major banks for rigging the foreign currency markets.</p> <p>The chancellor dropped the broadest of hints that the proceeds from the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s crackdown on the free-for-all culture on dealing floors would be recycled for eye-catching initiatives, saying the money would be \u201cused for the wider public good\u201d.</p> <p>Treasury sources said it was too early to say what the \u00a31.1bn would be spent on, but Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, identified the NHS and tax cuts for people on low and middle incomes as possible uses for the fines meted out to the banks.</p> <p>The windfall provides some extra leeway for the chancellor in an autumn statement that is constrained by a budget deficit on course to be close to \u00a3100bn this year \u2013 \u00a360bn more than Osborne envisaged when he arrived at the Treasury in May 2010.</p> <p>Smaller proceeds from the earlier Libor-rigging scandal were handed to armed forces charities and those involved in helping the emergency services, and the chancellor is expected to seize on the opportunity to assuage public anger at the activities of the banks.</p> <p>\u201cToday we take tough action to clean up corruption by a few so that we have a financial system that works for everyone,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a long-term plan that is fixing what went wrong in Britain\u2019s banks and our economy.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Clegg said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you what I think is going to be in the autumn statement when we haven\u2019t crossed every t and dotted every i in government, but one thing you can take from me is my emphasis on properly financing the NHS, delivering tax cuts where we can, delivering tax cuts for those in lower to middle incomes, and continuing to fill the back hole in the public finances and clear the decks for the next generation.\u201d</p> <p>The FCA found a lack of control on City dealing floors which permitted the \u00a33.5tn-a-day foreign exchange markets to be manipulated for five years, from January 2008 to as recently as October 2013.</p> <p>Exposing corruption at the heart of the world\u2019s biggest currency dealers, the City regulator fined five banks \u2013 including bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 \u00a31.1bn in a settlement co-ordinated with a major US regulator which pushed the total amount of fines up to \u00a32bn. A second US regulator\u2019s fine on three US banks pushed the day\u2019s tally to \u00a32.6bn.</p> <p>Andrea Leadsom, the City minister, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s completely disgusting. I think taxpayers will be horrified \u2026 I don\u2019t know if corruption is a strong enough word for it.\u201d</p> <p>The fines from the FCA go to Treasury coffers as a result of rule changes imposed by Osborne in the wake of the Libor rigging crisis two years ago to prevent the proceeds of misdeeds going to the City regulator as they had done in the past.</p> <p>Hundreds of currency traders across the City now face repercussions, whether by having their bonuses clawed back or by losing their jobs. The Serious Fraud Office is also investigating.</p> <p>Top bankers admitted that attempts to clean up their reputations in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis had suffered a serious setback, and warned that further fines were coming from other regulators for failures involved in currency markets.</p> <p>RBS\u2019s chief executive, Ross McEwan, apologised to consumers and admitted the conduct of up to 50 former and current employees was under investigation. \u201cTo say I\u2019m angry would be an understatement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had people working in this bank who did not know the difference between right and wrong and put their interests ahead of clients \u2026 or worse, didn\u2019t care about the distinction.\u201d</p> <p>The other banks fined are HSBC, Swiss bank UBS, and US banks Citigroup and JP Morgan.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has been handed a \u00a31.1bn windfall for next month\u2019s pre-election autumn statement after the City regulator imposed record fines on five major banks for rigging the foreign currency markets. The chancellor dropped the broadest of hints that the proceeds from the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s crackdown on the free-for-all culture on dealing floors would be recycled for eye-catching initiatives, saying the money would be \u201cused for the wider public good\u201d. Treasury sources said it was too early to say what the \u00a31.1bn would be spent on, but Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, identified the NHS and tax cuts for people on low and middle incomes as possible uses for the fines meted out to the banks. The windfall provides some extra leeway for the chancellor in an autumn statement that is constrained by a budget deficit on course to be close to \u00a3100bn this year \u2013 \u00a360bn more than Osborne envisaged when he arrived at the Treasury in May 2010. Smaller proceeds from the earlier Libor-rigging scandal were handed to armed forces charities and those involved in helping the emergency services, and the chancellor is expected to seize on the opportunity to assuage public anger at the activities of the banks. \u201cToday we take tough action to clean up corruption by a few so that we have a financial system that works for everyone,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a long-term plan that is fixing what went wrong in Britain\u2019s banks and our economy.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian, Clegg said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you what I think is going to be in the autumn statement when we haven\u2019t crossed every t and dotted every i in government, but one thing you can take from me is my emphasis on properly financing the NHS, delivering tax cuts where we can, delivering tax cuts for those in lower to middle incomes, and continuing to fill the back hole in the public finances and clear the decks for the next generation.\u201d The FCA found a lack of control on City dealing floors which permitted the \u00a33.5tn-a-day foreign exchange markets to be manipulated for five years, from January 2008 to as recently as October 2013. Exposing corruption at the heart of the world\u2019s biggest currency dealers, the City regulator fined five banks \u2013 including bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 \u00a31.1bn in a settlement co-ordinated with a major US regulator which pushed the total amount of fines up to \u00a32bn. A second US regulator\u2019s fine on three US banks pushed the day\u2019s tally to \u00a32.6bn. Andrea Leadsom, the City minister, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s completely disgusting. I think taxpayers will be horrified \u2026 I don\u2019t know if corruption is a strong enough word for it.\u201d The fines from the FCA go to Treasury coffers as a result of rule changes imposed by Osborne in the wake of the Libor rigging crisis two years ago to prevent the proceeds of misdeeds going to the City regulator as they had done in the past. Hundreds of currency traders across the City now face repercussions, whether by having their bonuses clawed back or by losing their jobs. The Serious Fraud Office is also investigating. Top bankers admitted that attempts to clean up their reputations in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis had suffered a serious setback, and warned that further fines were coming from other regulators for failures involved in currency markets. RBS\u2019s chief executive, Ross McEwan, apologised to consumers and admitted the conduct of up to 50 former and current employees was under investigation. \u201cTo say I\u2019m angry would be an understatement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had people working in this bank who did not know the difference between right and wrong and put their interests ahead of clients \u2026 or worse, didn\u2019t care about the distinction.\u201d The other banks fined are HSBC, Swiss bank UBS, and US banks Citigroup and JP Morgan. Barclays refused to sign up to the regulators\u2019 settlement at the last minute. Hundreds of pages of documents published by the regulators showed traders at different banks formed tight-knit groups in which information was shared about client activity. They used code names to identify clients without naming them. The groups used names including \u201cthe players\u201d, \u201cthe 3 musketeers\u201d, \u201c1 team, 1 dream\u201d, \u201ca co-operative\u201d and \u201cthe A-team\u201d. In chats between traders, they used phrases such as \u201cdont want other numpty\u2019s in mkt [market] to know\u201d as they discussed rates and moved the market before two crucial times, in the current markets at 1.15pm and the 4pm \u201cfix\u201d. They congratulated each other with \u201cnice job mate\u201d and \u201cyeah baby\u201d. Tracey McDermott, the FCA\u2019s director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \u201cFirms could have been in no doubt, especially after Libor, that failing to take steps to tackle the consequences of a free-for-all culture on their trading floors was unacceptable.\u201d She said that while individual consumers would not have lost out when buying foreign currency, they had lost out more broadly because of the damage to the integrity of the markets.

      "bodyText": "The International Energy Agency has warned that the current slump in oil prices will hold back investment and could create shortages in the future as overall energy demand is forecast to grow by 37% in the next 25 years. But at the same time, the organisation, which was set up in the aftermath of previous price shocks, said that while more drilling was needed, it was still important that governments wound down the world\u2019s $550bn (\u00a3346bn) of annual fossil fuel subsidies and switched support to renewable power. The IEA said oil and gas would play a continuing role as demand continued to rise, but that politicians should not shirk the need to tackle climate change, as the current trajectory of carbon use would leave humanity facing \u201ca very different\u201d world. \u201cToday\u2019s price level may offer some comfort to consumers but it will not last very long,\u201d said Fatih Birol, IEA chief economist. \u201cA well-supplied oil market in the short term should not disguise the challenges that lie ahead, as the world is set to rely more heavily on a relatively small number of producing countries.\u201d Birol, speaking at the IEA\u2019s annual World Energy Outlook, said there were already signs of a 10% cut in US spending by oil companies as a result of the slump in oil prices there to $80 per barrel. This came at a time when investment in other key future crude producers such as Iraq was close to zero. American shale oil and gas had transformed the market but post-2020 the world would increasingly find itself relying on Canada, Brazil and the politically volatile Middle East for world oil supplies, he said. Birol said countries such as Russia, China and India needed to wind down their consumer-price subsidies for fossil fuels, which deterred renewable power investment, squandered valuable energy resources and gave their citizens \u201call the wrong messages.\u201d The IEA estimates that wind, solar and other renewable technologies received subsidies of $121bn last year and this figure would rise to $230bn by 2030 before falling back to $205bn in 2040. The organisation hailed the performance of renewables as \u201cincredible\u201d and expected it to provide half of global electricity generation by 2040, with the bulk of the advances being made in China. \u201cAs our global energy system grows and transforms, signs of stress continue to emerge,\u201d said Maria van der Hoeven, the IEA\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut renewables are expected to go from strength to strength, and it is incredible that we can now see a point where they become the world\u2019s number one source of electricity generation.\u201d The IEA also gave its support to the development of new nuclear power projects, but said it was vital that governments found a permanent solution to dealing with high level radioactive waste. A separate report warned that uncertainty in the UK over subsidies for offshore windfarms had forced the industry to shelve a series of new projects. The study by the independent thinktank Green Alliance, titled UK Offshore Wind in the 2020s, argued that without a long-term commitment, the industry would be unable to achieve the economies of scale needed to bring down costs. Energy secretary Ed Davey said this week that onshore wind power was already suffering after communities secretary Eric Pickles called in 50 planning applications. Davey said the Tory minister was undermining investor confidence in an industry that employs more than 15,000 workers.",

Over in Greece political tensions are rising as the opposition once again steps up calls for early elections amid mounting controversy over Troika demands. Helena Smith reports: Racheting up the pressure on a government that is feeling increasingly wobbly in power, the radical left main opposition Syriza leader, Alexis Tsipras, said the only exit for debt-stricken Greece was fresh elections. \u201c[We have] to hold elections of deliverance and change so that the people can decide which strategy Greece should follow to get out of the crisis,\u201d the politician told his parliamentary group today. Syriza has been steadfastly leading polls and would likely emerge as the first party if snap elections were held in the event that the government fails to muster enough support to replace the outgoing president in February. The leftist spoke as pressure from international creditors mounted on Greece\u2019s coalition government. Short of bringing in radical reforms \u2013 \u201cactions\u201d that include re-negotiating the pension system and public sector jobs \u2013 foreign lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF have said, bluntly, they will not support Athens\u2019 plans to exit its bailout programme by the end of the year. \u201cA Syriza government will accept neither the prior actions nor the actions that are being presented as a fait accompli,\u201d said Tsipras hinting at the head-on confrontation that may well be looming with creditors. The bleak view is not just confined to Greece. In Brussels, Greek MEPs representing the ruling New Democracy party, also believe the government is losing ground because of its failure to enforce reforms. \u201cThe government is not implementing all the measures it has agreed to,\u201d the MEP Georgios Kyrtsos told me in the Belgian capital. \u201cGreece cannot expect to restructure its debt by 30% or 50% unless it moves faster [on reforms] and a rescheduling of the debt is absolutely necessary,\u201d said Kyrtsos, a member of the EU\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. \u201cAt the same time the opposition is living in its own world without a viable, alternative policy to offer. The Greek economy is in great difficulty.\u201d Crude oil prices continue to slide, with Brent down more than 1% at $80.73 a barrel amid talk of a large increase in US stocks last week. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia has said it wants stable oil markets and prices, and suggestions of an oil price war was just a misunderstanding. Later this month - 27 November - comes a key Opec meeting when the oil producers have to decide whether to cut output to combat the recent plunge in prices. My colleague Larry Elliott agrees with the last part of J.P. Morgan\u2019s assessment and says a rate rise is unlikely to come before next year\u2019s election. He writes: The economy is humming along. Growth will be strong this year and next. Wages have started to rise more rapidly than prices. Interest rates have been at 0.5% for more than five years. So when is the first increase in borrowing costs coming? Not yet. That was the clear message from the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, as he opened his Inflation Report press conference with a nod to Karl Marx. \u201cA spectre is now haunting Europe,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThe spectre of economic stagnation.\u201d The Bank thinks the weakness of the eurozone will affect growth in the UK, but not by much. Exports will take a bit of a hit and investment is expected to soften slightly, but the outlook is still rosy. ...But while the Bank has only slightly pared back its growth forecasts since its last Inflation Report in August, the same can\u2019t be said of inflation. Threadneedle Street did not expect inflation to come down with such a bump and expects a further moderation in the months to come. CPI inflation is forecast to be 1% in the first half of next year, with a better-than-even chance that it will slip below 1% for the first time since 2002. That would require Carney to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point away from its 2% target and what \u2013 if anything \u2013 the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee intended to do about it. The chances of Carney raising rates at the same time as he is writing letters explaining away low inflation look pretty slim. That\u2019s why George Osborne can assume that there will be no rate rise this side of the election. Full story here: The economic news may be good, but interest rates will not rise yet Despite today\u2019s dovish comments on interest rates from the Bank of England, the timing of the next rise is still uncertain, said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management: Markets interpreted the tone of today\u2019s report and associated press conference as dovish given weaker inflation forecasts and Mark Carney\u2019s downbeat view of the global economy outside of the US. This release broadly confirmed markets expectations that interest rates could be on hold until October 2015 \u2013 but it\u2019s worth remembering how much the expected timetable for rates has changed in the past six months. At the Mansion House speech back in June, Mark Carney warned markets that rates might well rise faster than what was then expected \u2013 which was interpreted by many as suggesting a rate rise before the end of 2014. Since then weaker global growth outlook and sharp fall in global inflationary pressures have pushed the expected date of the first rate rise by nearly 12 months. We have also seen a similar shift in the US. Investors should prepare for the first rate rise in the UK. We believe this will happen in 2015 and could still happen before the first rate rise in the US if UK productivity does not pick up. But the timing has slipped significantly in both countries and remains highly data dependent. We don\u2019t believe the Monetary Policy Committee would hesitate to raise interest rates earlier than expected if the economic data seems to warrant it. However, the lack of inflationary pressure means that there is now scope for rates to remain at historic lows until the second half of 2015. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the EU executive, has said he would lead a European campaign against tax avoidance and evasion, after dominating Luxembourg politics for 20 years during which the Grand Duchy got rich on the most systematic tax avoidance practices known in Europe, writes Ian Traynor. Less than a fortnight into his five-year term as the new president of the European commission, Juncker broke his silence on last week\u2019s revelations in The Guardian and other newspapers showing how the Luxembourg tax authorities exploited complex loopholes to enable multinationals to minimise their tax exposure, depriving other EU countries of tens of billions in revenue. Juncker said he had just ordered the drafting of a new EU directive on automatic exchange of information on national tax rulings between member states, and argued he had supported tax harmonisation in the EU since 1991. \u201cThis commission will fight tax evasion and tax avoidance,\u201d he declared. \u201cThis is not just words. This is very much the intention.\u201d Full story here: Jean-Claude Juncker: I will lead EU campaign against tax avoidance The European Central Bank is committed to taking further unconvential measures to boost the struggling eurozone economy, the bank\u2019s president Mario Draghi has reiterated. There had been talk that some ECB members were unhappy with Draghi\u2019s style and would, like the Germans, resist what would effectively be full blown quantitative easing. But after last week\u2019s ECB meeting, Draghi brushed aside such speculation, and speaking in Rome he ran through what the bank has already done - cutting interest rates, activating \u20ac1tn of credit lines for the banking system, the \u201cnow famous\u201d outright monetary transaction programme, the three measures of unconventionalo monetary policy including purchasing covered bonds - before adding: All these policy actions, accompanied by the expected maintenance of interest rates at their current level for a long period of time and an ongoing expansion of the ECB\u2019s balance sheet, together with the commitment by the Governing Council to take further unconventional policy actions should medium-term inflation expectations worsen or if the measures already decided on prove to be insufficient, has led to an unprecedented degree of monetary accommodation. Today, all the current and expected market interest rates over all horizons are lower than they have ever been, and lower than they are today in the United States. He also called again for further action beyond monetary and fiscal policy: A fiscal policy which, in compliance with the existing rules, may see more investment and lower taxes, together with an accommodative monetary policy are not enough to generate a revival of strong and sustainable growth without the necessary structural reforms in product and labour markets. Increased competition, the completion of Europe\u2019s single market, measures which would allow unemployed workers to quickly find a new job, thus reducing the period of unemployment, measures which would raise the level of specialisation and adapt it to the demand have long been on the economic policy agenda of many euro area countries: may the thought now make way for action. Full speech here: The economic policy of Federico Caff\u00e8 in our times The FX scandal underlines why bankers\u2019 bonuses should be subject to hefty clawbacks over many years, argues Andrew Tyrie MP, who heads up the UK parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee. Tyrie says: \u201cThis settlement also makes the strongest possible case that market participants, who are in a position seriously to harm their firm, customers or markets, should be required to defer some remuneration for long periods. It is essential to ensure that such market participants are put on contracts that leave \u2018skin in the game\u2019, some of it for long periods. \u201cWith or without an FCA regulatory intervention, they need to know that their firms may withdraw deferred remuneration when they identify involvement in misconduct or failure to report it. This was a central proposal of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. Regulators should not be swayed by complaints from banks about long deferral. Tyrie also reveals that his committee will start examining the situation next week: \u201cThe settlement is part of a much needed clean-up operation, which includes the Fair and Effective Markets Review. \u201cThe Treasury Committee will start to take evidence on this during a session with Dr Shafik, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, on the Fair and Effective Markets Review next week.\u201d And with that, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. If you\u2019re trying to get up to speed on the currency rate-fixing scandal, check out our round-up of the transcripts between FX-rigging traders. \u2018Nice work gents\u2019: FCA transcripts show forex traders\u2019 back-slapping culture It explains how traders were able to conspire to target the 4pm fix, and how they congratulated each other for doing so.... Over in America, traders are waking up to the news that JPMorgan and Citigroup have been fined for allowing their traders to manipulate the forex market. And the revelation that some traders tried to profit by triggering their own clients stop loss contracts has send shivers through Wall Street [I covered this earlier in the blog] We\u2019re running a poll, asking whether our readers think fining banks actually forces them to act better: Vote here: Will banking fines be enough to change banker behaviour? Back on the foreign exchange rigging scandal....and some lawyers are asking whether the whole affair has been wrapped up too quickly. Brian Spiro, a defence lawyer at BCL Burton Copeland, suggests that the Financial Conduct Authority may have acted too speedily. He points out that the FCA relied on information gathered by the banks and their lawyers for some of its findings. Spiro told the Financial Times that: \u201cIf they can sub it out, get a speedy result and bring money into the coffers, it\u2019s tempting to ask what more could you want?\u201d. \u201cBut some, myself included, ask: where does due process enter the equation? Do the enforcement agencies now operate within an environment solely governed by budget and pragmatism?\u201d If you watched/followed this morning\u2019s FCA\u2019s press conference, you\u2019ll know that enforcement chief Tracey McDermott has denied being too soft on the banks. The FCA has spent \u201c45 man years on this investigation\u201d, she said. And if you missed it, highlights start at 9am. Mark Carney may have reminded us that he has raised interest rates (when at the Bank of Canada), but foreign exchange traders still saw today\u2019s performance as dovish. The pound has lost nearly a cent against the US dollar today, down 0.5% to $1.583, since the BoE signalled that it might not raise interest rates until next autumn. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst for Caxton FX, predicts that sterling will continue to weaken: The Bank of England\u2019s inflation report which was released today was more dovish than expected, which lead to across the board sterling weakness. It was not drastically dovish, meaning that there was only slight weakening of the pound, but the topics of discussion were mainly on the risks presently facing the UK economy. Central to the conversation is the concern that inflation has fallen further below the target of 2% from the Monetary Policy Committee, growth concerns in the neighbouring Eurozone, the weakness of commodity prices, and a slowdown in global growth. The overall message was that forward guidance policies will continue to guide the decision of the Bank of England in regard to a next interest rate rise, and if there is an interest rate rise, it will be sustained low interest rates for a long period of time. Market participants were halfway expecting a firmer commitment from the Bank of England in regard to the timing of the next interest rate rise, but the English central bank is playing it safe, as inflation is still low and there are a number of risks going forward. In light of these developments, the pound is expected to weaken against the Dollar and a number of other currencies in the short term. Is this the first time that a Bank of England governor has alluded to The Communist Manifesto? Mark Carney\u2019s statement on the quarterly inflation report began with the warning that: A spectre is now haunting Europe \u2013 the spectre of economic stagnation, with growth disappointing again and confidence falling back. Which sounds awfully like Marx and Engels: A spectre is haunting Europe \u2014 the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies. Here\u2019s a handy summary of how the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts have changed in today\u2019s quarterly inflation report, from Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank: Growth little changed. The BoE\u2019s mean growth forecasts were 3.5%, 2.9%, 2.6%, 2.6% for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively, little changed from the previous forecasts of 3.5%, 3.0% and 2.6%........ There were some fiddly details though. Carney explained that rate setters believe that downside risks in the previous forecasts have now materialised. So rate setters cut their modal forecast, or their single most likely forecast, but did not change their mean forecast much. Inflation down in the near-term, unchanged after 2 years. The BoE cut its 2014 and 2015 inflation forecasts to 1.2% and 1.4% from 1.9% and 1.7% respectively. They left 2016 unchanged at 1.8%. The central bank published its 2017 forecast for the first time, and expects inflation at 2.0% by the end of that final year of their forecast. Unemployment down, to 5.7% and 5.4% in 2014 and 2015 from 5.9% and 5.6% respectively. For 2016 they cut unemployment to 5.3% from 5.4% and the BoE expects unemployment to end 2017 at 5.2%. Pay growth little changed. Slack now estimated at 1% of GDP, unchanged from 1% in the third quarter. And finally, Mark Carney was asked whether he is \u201coffended\u201d by suggestions that he\u2019s refusing to raise interest rates low until after the next election as a favour to George Osborne. The governor doesn\u2019t appear offended, and explains that the bank sets policy to achieve the inflation target. Does Mark Carney have any sympathy with Lord Turner\u2019s suggestion yesterday (in the FT) that the Bank of England should print more money to finance a larger government deficit to stimulate growth? No, the governor replies. I cannot think of any circumstances where a central bank in an advanced economy should do this, and engage in \u201chelicopter money\u201d, Carney replies. He says that the Bank of England plans to unwind its quantitative easing programme eventually, which means it needs an valuable asset to sell. [this is the \u00a3375bn of government debt the BoE has bought in recent years to expand the monetary supply] Simply monetising the national debt would undermine that process. And it would also remove any discipline on fiscal policy -- as politicians could simply borrow recklessly and rely on their central bank to cover the cost. Carney concludes: I can\u2019t see any circumstances where I would advocate it, even in the eurozone..... Never mind the Maastricht treaty [ruling out debt monetisation] ...just as [appropriate] policy. How concerned are you about the damage that the Forex scandal will have on the reputation of the City? We are concerned, Mark Carney replies. Deputy governor Minouche Shafik takes up the issue, saying that the Bank\u2019s review of the City will discover whether more needs to be done to improve conduct. Another question on the eurozone. Observer columnist Bill Keegan has reached page 23 of the quarterly inflation report, and a warning that: \u201cFactors pushing down growth are likely to outweigh the European Central Bank\u2019s efforts\u201d. Does that mean you have some sympathy for Mario Draghi\u2019s argument that fiscal policy must do more? Carney offers his fellow central banker some support. I would underline President Draghi\u2019s comments at Jackson Hole, about the role that fiscal policy can play, he says. Why did the Bank of England announce the firing of its chief FX dealer today? A good day to bury bad news? No, Carney replies. We followed employment law through the disciplinary procedure -- and it wasn\u2019t related to Lord Grabiner\u2019s inquiry into the FX issue. The two events \u201ccame together\u201d but there\u2019s nothing beyond that. Why no mention of forward guidance, asks Sky\u2019s Ed Conway. Is that because market participants see it as something of a joke? I have mentioned the word \u2018guidance\u2019, Mark Carney replies. Not my fault if you don\u2019t pay attention. Read the transcript.  Carney says: our view of the global economy when we began forward guidance.. have become a mainstream view. Conway tried to interject. Carney slaps him down - \u201cit\u2019s not a discussion\u201d. The forward guidance we have been giving (since August 2013) has been consistent, and proportionate. Question of the day, if not the year. Your colleague Minouche Shafik recently described herself as a wise owl, not a hawk or a dove. So what bird are you, governor? A loon, perhaps? Much guffawing in the press seats. I\u2019m a pragmatist, Carney insist, after rebuking his colleagues for giggling (You found that funny? \u201cI can\u2019t believe you found that funny.\u201d) The markets think you\u2019re being dovish today, but would you like to say anything hawkish, governor?  I\u2019m still the only G7 governor who has raised interest rates, Carney smiles. I\u2019ve just not done it here. And I know how to hit an inflation target. [he\u2019s referring to Some people - \u201csome who have spoken this morning\u201d - were calling for interest rates to rise this year. That wouldn\u2019t have been a very bright call. And we\u2019re trying to represent the views of the MPC today - sometimes I might disagree with my colleagues, but I\u2019ll try to represent the committee. How will Mark Carney explain the Bank of England\u2019s failure to keep inflation to target if, as appears likely, it falls below 1%. I\u2019ll decide what I write in my letter to the chancellor if, and when, I write it, Carney replies. At the moment, it\u2019s more likely than not than I will write it, but it\u2019s not certain. The Bank \u2018looked through\u2019 inflation when commodity prices were pushing prices up, so will they do the same now the falling oil price is pushing inflation down? Carney replies that yes, there is a symmetry, but not a \u201cblind symmetry\u201d. Which means... that at the time, the Bank was confident that the inflation spike was a temporary factor. This time, we don\u2019t expect inflation to pick up soon - partly due to pressure from overseas (ie, the eurozone) We expect inflation to only get back to our 2% target at the end of three years, Carney points out. And as the Bank is at the \u201czero lower bound\u201d, it has fewer options to loosen monetary policy to stimulate inflation (rates can hardly go much lower, but a cut is possible) What does rising real wages mean for interest rates? Carney replies that borrowing costs will rise at a gradual pace and a limited extent. Does today\u2019s unemployment data, showing wages rising ahead of prices, means the cost of living squeeze over? Carney isn\u2019t blowing any trumpets, warning that one swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer. But he does predict that wages will rise above inflation next year (especially if inflation falls below 1%). OUCH. How embarrassing is it that the Bank of England had to fire its chief FX dealer yesterday (see 8.08am for details) Mark Carney replies that the Bank holds itself to the highest standards, so it held a full inquiry into its role in the foreign exchange rigging scandal. The dismissal of an employee was for reasons unrelated to the FX investigation. It was information uncovered during the FX investigation, the governor says. He adds: We are disappointed with what Lord Graviner found over the behaviour of one employee. We have an outstanding markets division with exceptional individuals who serve the public very well, day in day out. [but] Lord Grabiner found that our chief dealer was aware that information was being shared, but he didn\u2019t pass that on. That was a mistake. He should have escalated this. But there is no evidence of deliberate misconduct. That\u2019s interesting -- I didn\u2019t realise before that the individual criticised in Lord Graviner\u2019s report was the same person fired yesterday. Does the Bank of England want the European Central Bank to do more stimulus measures? UK is getting imported disinflation from Europe. We are not seeing wider damage. We are not seeing confidence being hit, either in the financial sector or the real economy,. Carney says. Eurozone monetary policy can\u2019t do it all -- there is a role for fiscal policy, and for wide structural reforms. The FT explains how the BoE has trimmed its growth and inflation forecasts, a little: The Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s growth forecasts were revised down a little from the forecasts published in August, reflecting a weaker global economic outlook and slower housing market. But this weakness was offset by lower assumptions for interest rates leaving the growth and inflation forecasts stable three years ahead. What really matters is the broad process of monetary policy, not a specific date for the first interest rate rise, Mark Carney insists. Despite the global gloom, the Bank of England still reckons the UK can grow at above trend levels. Carney cites the prospect of wages (FINALLY) growing faster than inflation, and confidence in the recovery. The global economy has been moribund since the last quarterly inflation report three months ago, Mark Carney says. He is particularly gloomy about the eurozone -- saying that \u201cthe spectre of stagnation\u201d is haunting Europe. The pound has dipped as foreign exchange traders digest the quarterly inflation report. Breaking: the Bank of England signaled interest rates could remain on hold until next autumn as inflation is likely to fall below 1% in early 2015. That\u2019s the main message from its quarterly inflation report, which was just released. From the Bank of England, Angela Monaghan and Larry Elliott write: Plunging commodity prices and weak wage growth against a sluggish backdrop for global growth have triggered a drastic change of view on the outlook for inflation, which is now expected to take three years to return to the Bank\u2019s 2% target. The Bank\u2019s November inflation report suggested the City was right to expect rates to be left on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% until October next year. At the time of the last inflation report in August, the Bank had been signalling that a pre-election rate rise in February was most likely. \u201cThe near-term profile for inflation was markedly different from that in August, with inflation likely to remain close to 1% over the next 12 months,\u201d the Bank said in the report. The latest forecasts from Threadneedle Street suggest inflation will fall to 1% in December, and probably be below 1% at some point over the next six months. That would force governor Mark Carney to write a letter to George Osborne explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point below target. \u201cIt is more likely than not that inflation will temporarily fall below 1% at some point over the next six months, necessitating an open letter to the chancellor.\u201d The expectation that Carney will have to write to Osborne explaining low inflation would make a rise in interest rates \u2013 on hold since March 2009 \u2013 difficult to justify. Markets are likely to be taken by surprise by the tone of the November report, which is more dovish than the tone previously struck by the Bank. The Bank left its growth forecast for 2014 unchanged at 3.5%. Policymakers expect the Office for National Statistics to revise up its estimate of third-quarter growth to 0.8% from 0.7%. The Bank then expects growth to slow in the final quarter of this year, to 0.6%. Growth in 2015 has been revised slightly lower, to 2.9% from the Bank\u2019s August forecast of 3%. The Bank said the housing market outlook was weaker than it was expecting three months ago. Unemployment is expected to fall to 5.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. However, the Bank said the nature of job creation was weighing on pay growth. It said: \u201cMore recently employment growth has been concentrated among the young and the lower skilled. These changes in the composition of the workforce are likely to have weighed on the average level of pay in the economy, and therefore reduced average pay growth, in recent quarters.\u201d The press conference is just underway...... (livefeed) Nearly time for the next event of the day, the Bank of England\u2019s quarterly inflation report. It will be streamed live here. City law firm RPC has predicted that banks will face a \u201cflood\u201d of lawsuits from customers who lost out because of the manipulation in the financial markets Simon Hart, Banking Litigation Partner at RPC, says that some clients have already got in touch... \u201cThese fines and the evidence published today could trigger a flood of civil litigation from pension funds and other fund managers that lost money because of Forex manipulation moving prices against them.\u201d \u201cWe anticipate a much larger number of high value disputes against the banks because of Forex manipulation than we saw over Libor rigging because it should be much easier for market participants to prove that they lost money.\u201d \u201cThe short term nature of most Forex trades means that any manipulation will create clear winners and losers. The longer term nature of Libor positions made it harder to identify losses linked to manipulation.\u201d \u201cWe have already been speaking with a number of market participants who have been awaiting this outcome.\u201d John Mann MP has weighed in, demanding that banks pay today\u2019s fines out of their bonuses, not their profits: \u201cThis fraudulent trading has taken place over a five-year period during which time the taxpayer has had to provide massive financial assistance to the banking sector and we have clearly been taken for a fool by the bankers. \u201cWhat must happen now is that the bankers and senior managers are actually held accountable for this behaviour and RBS, the taxpayer-owned bank, must ensure that these fines are paid from its bonus pool and not simply taken from its profits.\u201d Campaigners are shocked that the foreign exchange market was being rigged five years after the financial crisis began. Here\u2019s David Hillman, Robin Hood Tax spokesperson: \u201cWhat\u2019s truly shocking is that this blatant corruption carried on for years after the financial crisis. Not content with crashing the economy banks continued manipulating markets and ripping us off while at the same time telling us they had changed. Hillman also argues that fines simply don\u2019t work as a weapon to improve standards: \u201cIt is good news the Chancellor has promised some of the \u00a32bn will be used for the wider public good but he can no longer pretend that one-off fines are enough to change banks\u2019 greed obsessed culture. It\u2019s time the Government dropped its opposition to the financial transactions tax which would make markets harder to scam and at the same time make banks contribute to the wider interests of society.\u201d Here\u2019s a very brief recap before the next event of the day, the Bank of England\u2019s quarterly inflation report. Five banks have been fined a total of \u00a32bn for their role in the manipulation of the global currency markets. The FCA found that traders at several banks conspired to rig the daily \u2018fix\u2019 -- and may even have tried to trigger their own clients\u2019 stop losses contracts. Here\u2019s an explanation. This video is worth watching too. The chancellor, George Osborne, has condemned the \u201ccorruption\u201d laid bare today, and promised to use the funds for the public good. Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom has called the behaviour \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Transcripts have shown traders congratulating each other, \u2018doffing hats\u2019, and warning about letting \u2018numpty\u2019s\u2019 in on their secrets. The banks involved have admitted that the conduct was unacceptable. RBS is investigating 50 current or former staff. A separate investigation has found that the Bank of England did nothing wrong, although its top FX dealer has been fired for unknown reasons. At a press conference, the FCA has denied being too lenient with the banks, and warned that the City must work hard to rebuild its image with the public. The latest UK unemployment data hit the wires while I was on that FCA call. The top line is that the jobless rate remained at a six-year low of 6.0%, and wages are finally growing faster than inflation again All the details are in Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics liveblog. And that\u2019s the end of the FCA\u2019s press conference (highlights start here). No big fireworks, but notable that financial reporters aren\u2019t terribly impressed with the regulator\u2019s conduct. Rightly so? After all....why did this scandal run for so long? Why should banks get a 30% discount for putting their hands up? And will bonuses actually be held back at banks which allowed their traders to manipulate the forex market for so long? How much money has the FCA now raised from the banking sector since the financial crisis began, and where will today\u2019s fines go? Full details of historic fines are on the FCA\u2019s website, and today\u2019s money will go to the Treasury (once the regulator\u2019s costs are deducted) How many firms are still being investigated? Only Barclays. What\u2019s the status of the Libor investigation? (which began several years ago). Investigations are ongoing, and ongoing criminal prosecutions are underway, scheduled to run until 2016 and beyond. Does the failure to get a settlement with Barclays mean the FCA has failed to get the co-ordinated agreement it wanted? No, Tracey McDermott insists. We wanted to get a co-ordinated settlement with as many firms as possible. Barclays chose not to take part. But this is the biggest fine we\u2019ve ever imposed. We don\u2019t see this as a failure at all. Could any of the deferred prosecution agreements that banks currently hold with the US Department of Justice have been broken by the FX scandal? Tracey McDermott replies that the FCA is in \u2018close\u2019 talks with US regulators over this issue..... Have the UK banks actually suffered any reputational damage through the series of scandals that have rocked the City? After all, they\u2019ve got roughly the same number of customers since the financial criss began? Martin Wheatley insists that banks have suffered damage to their public image. But he agrees that they have not suffered a major loss of customers. One of our broader concerns is giving customers the power, or reshaping the market, so that this could happen, he adds. Are the days of London \u2018gold-plating\u2019 international financial standards over? Wheatley says that the only way to improve standards is through international agreements, even though London controls around 40% of the FX market. Isn\u2019t it simply absurd that the FX market was not regulated properly for so long? Not sure that you can say it\u2019s absurd, Wheatley replies. Some markets have very firm regulation from outside, and others have relied on self-regulation. What we are seeing is that self-regulation does not work....in markets where there are very large rewards, he concludes. How much damage has been caused to the reputation of the City? These scandals do hurt market confidence, Wheatley replies. The Fair and Effective Markets Review will get to the core of what needs to change, and help rebuild confidence. Does the fact that the FX market was being manipulated until October 2013 show that banks learned nothing from Libor? Martin Wheatley replies that the FCA is concerned that the affair went on too long. He insists, though, that banks have learned some lessons from recent scandals. Who decided to pursue a \u2018group approach\u2019 to the investigation? The FCA did, Wheatley replied. We didn\u2019t want a repeat of the Libor investigation, which dragged on a long time. We want to get changes made quickly. Should bank bonuses be cut? The FCA\u2019s Clive Adamson explains that the FCA reviews banks\u2019 bonus proposals and any \u201cmalice adjustments\u201d they are planning to make. We would expect firms to think hard about this during this bonus round, he concludes. Why should banks get a 30% discount on their fines for settling early, when the evidence of misconduct is so clear? Tracey McDermott says the FCA\u2019s policy is clear and open, and similar to criminal law where offenders get a sentence reduction for settling early. It incentivises early settlement on proper terms rather than incentivising fighting all the way, she concludes. Does the FCA reject the suggestion that some of this collusion was to do with day-to-day market operation, rather than something worse? Clive Adamson, the FCA\u2019s director of supervision, isn\u2019t convinced by this argument. This is about something fundamental about how these firms ran their business, Adamson says. Have consumers lost out? Wheatley explains that FX traders were moving FX rates by two or three basis points. That\u2019s a smaller margin than you or I would normally get at the airport. It\u2019s hard to draw a threat through to consumers, he adds. Why did it take the regulator so long to spot that this misconduct was taking place? It\u2019s not fair to say we took too long, Tracey McDermott replies. We took action once we were alerted to the problems, and have conducted our probe within a year. We don\u2019t accept that the regulator took too long, she insists. Martin Wheatley adds that these markets, like Libor, are often out of the public eye. But not the regulators eye, surely? Why did some bank shares rise this morning? Markets don\u2019t like uncertainty, Wheatley replies. Could there be criminal charges against individuals? The Serious Fraud Office is already investigating. The FCA explains that spot FX trading isn\u2019t directly within its jurisdiction. We will be looking at the conduct of individuals within the extent that we can, they add. Onto questions. What happens next, and what\u2019s the plan for banks who have not settled today? Tracey McDermott, the FCA\u2019s director of enforcement and financial crime, says that the issue is now closed with the five banks who have settled. She can\u2019t speculate about what might happen with other banks. \u201cThe industry must prove it has changed if it is ever to recover the trust it has lost,\u201d Martin Wheatley concludes. Wheatley says the UK\u2019s \u201cFair and effective market review\u201d will continue. We expect firms to put conduct at the heart of their business, and improve standards from the trading floor to the boardroom, he adds. Some FX traders have abused the trust of their employers and the regulator, Martin Wheatley adds. Martin Wheatley, of the FCA, begins the press conference by confirming that today\u2019s fines, totalling \u00a31.1bn, are the biggest in the regulators\u2019 history. It reflects the serious of the failings we have uncovered, and which put the integrity of Britain\u2019s financial system at risk, he says. Over in Canary Wharf, the Financial Conduct Authority is beginning a press briefing on today\u2019s fines. I\u2019ll cover the key points in this blog. It\u2019s being streamed live here City editor Jill Treanor writes: The corruption of the world\u2019s biggest currency dealers was laid bare on Wednesday when regulators imposed \u00a32bn of fines on five major banks for rigging the \u00a33.5tn a day foreign exchange markets. Regulators said they had found a \u201cfree for all culture\u201d rife on their trading floors which allowed the markets to be rigged for five years, from January 2008 to October 2013. The much-anticipated record settlement with US and UK regulators did not include Barclays, which remains in discussions with other regulators. Each of the fines imposed on Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Citibank, JP Morgan and UBS were records for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), smashing the penalties imposed over the last two years for Libor rigging...... Here\u2019s Jill full story: Foreign exchange fines: banks handed \u00a32bn in penalties for market rigging A JP Morgan spokesperson has responded thus (via the WSJ): \u201cThe trader conduct described in today\u2019s settlements is unacceptable. In addition to making significant improvements to our systems and controls, we have spent a lot of time reinforcing the high standards of conduct expected of our people. Although the settlements acknowledge our progress, further training and enhancements are ongoing and will remain a priority.\u201d Banking analyst Sandy Chen of Cenkos reckons that Barclays failed to settle today because of the non-prosecution agreement it currently holds with the US Department of Justice, dating back to the Libor scandal. He adds: Barclays doesn\u2019t have much bargaining power versus the US DOJ and other regulators, in our view; the risks are that (1) Barclays\u2019 \u00a3500m of forex provisions won\u2019t be enough, and (2) the LIBOR NPA unravels. Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom has pledged that the traders responsible for manipulating the FX market \u201cwill not be back in a dealing room on a big salary\u201d and \u201ceverything that can be done to punish this type of behaviour\u201d will be done. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s completely disgusting. I think taxpayers will be horrified... I don\u2019t know if corruption is a strong enough word for it.\u201d She said it was particularly bad that this was going on among a small group of foreign exchange traders at a time when taxpayers were bailing out the banks. As flagged up earlier, the FCA probe found wrong-doing took place between early 2008 and October 2013. The FCA has produced a very good video, explaining in some detail how the foreign exchange market works, and how traders conspired to manipulate it. Well worth watching, so I\u2019ve embedded it (if it doesn\u2019t work for you, it\u2019s also online here) And shares in UBS have risen by 0.7% in early trading. Shares in Barclays have fallen 1% in early trading in London, as traders ponder why the bank has not settled with regulators. RBS are down just 0.1%, and HSBC are down 0.4%. The Bank of England has declared that its own investigation into the forex rigging scandal found no evidence of wrong-doing at Britain\u2019s central bank. The BoE had been accused of turning a blind eye to FX manipulation, but it insists that an inquiry by British lawyer Lord Grabiner found no evidence of \u201cunlawful or improper behaviour\u201d. Lord Grabiner did find that one official knew that bank traders were sharing information about client orders, and failed to escalate that issue. However, that was merely an \u201cerror in judgment that deserved criticism\u201d, but not an act of \u201cbad faith\u201d. So that\u2019s OK then. However, it did fire its chief foreign exchange dealer yesterday, but won\u2019t say why exactly. A Bank of England spokesperson explains: \u201cFollowing a disciplinary process unrelated to Lord Grabiner\u2019s investigation, the Bank\u2019s Chief FX Dealer, who was suspended in March, was dismissed on 11 November for serious misconduct relating to a failure to adhere to the Bank\u2019s internal policies. \u201cThe individual\u2019s dismissal was not at all related to the allegations investigated by Lord Grabiner, but as a result of information that came to light during the course of the Bank\u2019s initial internal review into allegations relating to the FX market and Bank staff. This information related to the Bank\u2019s internal policies, not to FX.\u201d Banking analyst Christopher Wheeler reckons Barclays\u2019 shareholders may be alarmed that it has not settled with the FCA and the CFTC, and is instead pursuing its own path. He also reckons the five banks fined today have got off lightly: The FCA has also released transcripts from private chat rooms. Its settlement with HSBC shows traders at different banks chatting before the daily 4pm forex fix. The transcripts show traders agreeing to \u201cteam whack\u201d a currency, and congratulating each other afterwards. One of the most alarming elements of the foreign exchange rigging scandal is that firms are accused of triggering their own clients\u2019 stop loss orders. Those orders are meant to help a company manage the risk of Forex rate movements -- if a currency moves too much one way or another, they are \u2018stopped\u2019 out of the market, with a fixed loss. But, as the FCA\u2019s settlement with HSBC shows, this provided an incentive for unscrupulous traders to move the FX rates to trigger stop losses and bank a profit. The FCA says: These attempts involved inappropriate disclosures to traders at other firms concerning details of the size, direction and level of client stop loss orders. The traders involved would trade in a manner aimed at manipulating the spot FX rate, such that the stop loss order was triggered. HSBC would potentially profit from this activity because if successful it would, for example, have sold the particular currency to its client pursuant to the stop loss order at a higher rate than it had bought that currency in the market. Here\u2019s a better link to the CFTC\u2019s transcripts of private chat room conversations (the 7.25am link may not work, sorry) This transcript shows FX traders at three banks discussing whether to invite a fourth into their chatroom. One trader urges caution, as we don\u2019t want \u201cother numpty\u2019s (sic) in the market\u201d to know what they\u2019re up to. A numpty is slang for a stupid or dozy person. Who\u2019s the numpty now?.... No financial scandal is complete without a set of juicy transcripts showing traders breaking the rules with abandon. And today, we have several examples of employees at several banks discussing how to rig the FX rates, in private chat rooms. Here\u2019s an example, of traders from two banks \u201cdouble teaming\u201d to manipulate the daily fix, as both needed to buy euros that day. And here\u2019s an example of traders at four different banks sharing information before the daily fix: There\u2019s more here on the CFTC\u2019s website. Royal Bank of Scotland says that it is reviewing the conduct of \u201cover 50 current and former members of trading staff around the world\u201d. Dozens of supervisors and senior management responsible and accountable for this business are also under the spotlight, it says. Three staff have already been suspended. Philip Hampton, RBS Chairman, says the bank fully accepts the regulators\u2019 criticism, and \u201ccondemns the actions of those employees responsible\u201d Today is a stark reminder of the importance of culture and integrity in banking and we will rightly be judged on the strength of our response. We take these criticisms extremely seriously and are acting to ensure that our employees adhere to the highest standards and that our systems and controls are fit for purpose The Chancellor George Osborne has declared that today\u2019s fines for currency manipulation will help clean up \u201ccorruption\u201d in the financial markets. \u201cToday we take tough action to clean up corruption by a few so that we have a financial system that works for everyone. It\u2019s part of a long term plan that is fixing what went wrong in Britain\u2019s banks and our economy. \u201cA number of traders have been suspended or fired, and the Serious Fraud Office are conducting criminal investigations. The banks that employed them face big fines - and I will ensure that these fines are used for the wider public good. As Jill Treanor wrote last night, the \u00a31.1bn windfall will go into the \u201cconsolidated fund\u201d used for general purposes, so we don\u2019t know what the \u201cwider public good\u201d will mean. In the past, the government has used fines from Libor rigging to make donations to armed forces charities and the emergency service. So how did traders at some of the world\u2019s largest banks conspire to rig the currency markets? Well, it all centres on what\u2019s called the \u201cdaily fix\u201d -- a process that takes place at 4pm London time each day. The fix (an unfortunate term, under the circumstances) records exactly what value that major currencies are trading at. Regulators have found that traders at different banks shared information about what orders they were putting through. This allowed them to profit, because they could predict how the FX rates would move around 4pm. Many clients like to trade around the daily fix, so huge orders can be flowing through the market at that time. Regulators have found that traders at different Banks formed \u201ctight knit groups\u201d in which information was shared about client activity, including using code names to identify clients without naming them. These groups were described as, for example,\u201cthe players\u201d, \u201cthe 3 musketeers\u201d, \u201c1 team, 1 dream\u201d, \u201ca co-operative\u201d and \u201cthe A-team\u201d. The FCA explains: Traders shared the information obtained through these groups to help them work out their trading strategies. They then attempted to manipulate fix rates and trigger client \u201cstop loss\u201d orders (which are designed to limit the losses a client could face if exposed to adverse currency rate movements). This involved traders attempting to manipulate the relevant currency rate in the market, for example, to ensure that the rate at which the bank had agreed to sell a particular currency to its clients was higher than the average rate it had bought that currency for in the market. If successful, the bank would profit. Remarkably, this misconduct took place over more than five years, and only ended a year ago. And here\u2019s how the fines from America\u2019s CFTC break down: $310m on both Citibank and JPMorgan, $290 million each on Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS and $275 million on HSBC.. The FCA also says that it will \u201cprogress our investigation\u201d into Barclays. As City editor Jill Treanor explains, Barclays was expected to settle with the FCA and CFTC, but has now got it alone... The Financial Conduct Authority has issued a pretty damning statement into the misconduct at these five banks. It declared that: At the heart of today\u2019s action is our finding that the failings at these Banks undermine confidence in the UK financial system and put its integrity at risk. It has found that Citibank, HSBC, JPMorgan, RBS and UBS were all guilty of \u201cineffective controls\u201d, which allowed traders to put their own interests ahead of their clients The FCA also blasts the banks for failing to manage \u201cobvious risks\u201d around confidentiality, conflicts of interest and trading conduct. And here\u2019s how these record fines break down: Citi: \u00a3225m HSBC: \u00a3216m JPMorgan Chase Bank: \u00a3222m RBS: \u00a3217m UBS: \u00a3233m Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, says the regulator is not prepared to tolerate conduct which \u201cimperils market integrity or the wider UK financial system\u201d Today\u2019s record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right. They must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits or leave the ethics of their conduct to compliance to worry about. Today\u2019s fines are the largest ever imposed by the FCA, or its predecessor the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and this is the first time the FCA has pursued a settlement with a group of banks in this way. Good morning. It\u2019s another dark day for the banking sector, with several of the world\u2019s biggest financial institutions being fined for their role in rigging the global foreign exchange market. In the last few moments, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have announced fines totalling around \u00a32bn, or $3.1bn, against HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, JP Morgan and Citigroup. The UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has imposed fines totalling \u00a31.1bn, and America\u2019s CFTC has imposed fines of an additional $1.4bn, (\u00a3900m). All five banks have been penalised because their staff colluded to fix the official rates at which currencies were trading against each other in the international markets. We had been expecting six banks to be fined, but Barclays does not appear on the list. I\u2019ll be covering all the reaction to this latest scandal to hit the financial sector.",

That was the clear message from the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, as <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2014/irspnote141112.pdf\">he opened his Inflation Report press conference with a nod to Karl Marx</a>. \u201cA spectre is now haunting Europe,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThe spectre of economic stagnation.\u201d</p> <p>The Bank thinks the weakness of the eurozone will affect growth in the UK, but not by much. Exports will take a bit of a hit and investment is expected to soften slightly, but the outlook is still rosy.</p> <p>...But while the Bank has only slightly pared back its growth forecasts since its last Inflation Report in August, the same can\u2019t be said of inflation.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street did not expect inflation to come down with such a bump and expects a further moderation in the months to come. CPI inflation is forecast to be 1% in the first half of next year, with a better-than-even chance that it will slip below 1% for the first time since 2002.</p> <p>That would require Carney to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point away from its 2% target and what \u2013 if anything \u2013 the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee intended to do about it. The chances of Carney raising rates at the same time as he is writing letters explaining away low inflation look pretty slim. That\u2019s why George Osborne can assume that there will be no rate rise this side of the election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Full story here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/12/economic-news-interest-rates-bank-of-england\">The economic news may be good, but interest rates will not rise yet</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54637539e4b0f33efafdaa63\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-12T15:00:17.401Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Despite today\u2019s dovish comments on interest rates from the Bank of England, the timing of the next rise is still uncertain, </strong>said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets interpreted the tone of today\u2019s report and associated press conference as dovish given weaker inflation forecasts and Mark Carney\u2019s downbeat view of the global economy outside of the US.</p> <p>This release broadly confirmed markets expectations that interest rates could be on hold until October 2015 \u2013 but it\u2019s worth remembering how much the expected timetable for rates has changed in the past six months. At the Mansion House speech back in June, Mark Carney warned markets that rates might well rise faster than what was then expected \u2013 which was interpreted by many as suggesting a rate rise before the end of 2014. Since then weaker global growth outlook and sharp fall in global inflationary pressures have pushed the expected date of the first rate rise by nearly 12 months. We have also seen a similar shift in the US.</p> <p>Investors should prepare for the first rate rise in the UK. We believe this will happen in 2015 and could still happen before the first rate rise in the US if UK productivity does not pick up. But the timing has slipped significantly in both countries and remains highly data dependent.</p> <p>We don\u2019t believe the Monetary Policy Committee would hesitate to raise interest rates earlier than expected if the economic data seems to warrant it. However, the lack of inflationary pressure means that there is now scope for rates to remain at historic lows until the second half of 2015.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54637365e4b0058909044dc9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-12T14:53:19.453Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the EU executive, has said he would lead a European campaign against tax avoidance and evasion</strong>, after dominating Luxembourg politics for 20 years during which the Grand Duchy got rich on the most systematic tax avoidance practices known in Europe, <em><strong>writes Ian Traynor.</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d8f5743150050f4e1eeb29e7400e9b3e51c5c29b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/12/1415803921839/d9343ac0-95bc-4ec4-824f-bd4b36696fd7-309x420.jpeg\" alt=\"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.

Central to the conversation is the concern that inflation has fallen further below the target of 2% from the Monetary Policy Committee, growth concerns in the neighbouring Eurozone, the weakness of commodity prices, and a slowdown in global growth. The overall message was that forward guidance policies will continue to guide the decision of the Bank of England in regard to a next interest rate rise, and if there is an interest rate rise, it will be sustained low interest rates for a long period of time.</p> <p>Market participants were halfway expecting a firmer commitment from the Bank of England in regard to the timing of the next interest rate rise, but the English central bank is playing it safe, as inflation is still low and there are a number of risks going forward.

At the time of the last inflation report in August, the Bank had been signalling that a pre-election rate rise in February was most likely.</p> <p>\u201cThe near-term profile for inflation was markedly different from that in August, with inflation likely to remain close to 1% over the next 12 months,\u201d the Bank said in the report.</p> <p>The latest forecasts from Threadneedle Street suggest inflation will fall to 1% in December, and probably be below 1% at some point over the next six months.</p> <p>That would force governor Mark Carney to write a letter to George Osborne explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point below target.</p> <p>\u201cIt is more likely than not that inflation will temporarily fall below 1% at some point over the next six months, necessitating an open letter to the chancellor.\u201d</p> <p>The expectation that Carney will have to write to Osborne explaining low inflation would make a rise in interest rates\u00ad \u2013 on hold since March 2009 \u2013 difficult to justify.</p> <p>Markets are likely to be taken by surprise by the tone of the November report, which is more dovish than the tone previously struck by the Bank.</p> <p>The Bank left its growth forecast for 2014 unchanged at 3.5%. Policymakers expect the Office for National Statistics to revise up its estimate of third-quarter growth to 0.8% from 0.7%. The Bank then expects growth to slow in the final quarter of this year, to 0.6%.</p> <p>Growth in 2015 has been revised slightly lower, to 2.9% from the Bank\u2019s August forecast of 3%.</p> <p>The Bank said the housing market outlook was weaker than it was expecting three months ago.</p> <p>Unemployment is expected to fall to 5.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015.</p> <p>However, the Bank said the nature of job creation was weighing on pay growth.</p> <p>It said: \u201cMore recently employment growth has been concentrated among the young and the lower skilled. These changes in the composition of the workforce are likely to have weighed on the average level of pay in the economy, and therefore reduced average pay growth, in recent quarters.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>The press conference is just underway......

Many clients like to trade around the daily fix, so huge orders can be flowing through the market at that time.</p> <p>Regulators have found that traders at different Banks formed \u201ctight knit groups\u201d in which information was shared about client activity, including using code names to identify clients without naming them. </p> <p><strong>These groups were described as, for example,<em>\u201cthe players</em>\u201d, \u201c<em>the 3 musketeers</em>\u201d, \u201c<em>1 team, 1 dream</em>\u201d, \u201c<em>a co-operative</em>\u201d and \u201c<em>the A-team</em>\u201d.</strong></p> <p>The FCA explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Traders shared the information obtained through these groups to help them work out their trading strategies. </p> <p>They then attempted to manipulate fix rates and trigger client \u201cstop loss\u201d orders (which are designed to limit the losses a client could face if exposed to adverse currency rate movements). This involved traders attempting to manipulate the relevant currency rate in the market, for example, to ensure that the rate at which the bank had agreed to sell a particular currency to its clients was higher than the average rate it had bought that currency for in the market. </p> <p>If successful, the bank would profit.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54630290e4b0bdf90169261c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-12T06:48:09.381Z\">6.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Remarkably, this misconduct took place over more than five years, and only ended a year ago.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/statuses/532413923447021569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>FCA says the problems took place between January 2008 and October 2013</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/532413923447021569\">November 12, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54630171e4b04484e8579357\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-12T06:45:03.366Z\">6.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s how the fines from America\u2019s CFTC break down:</p> <p>$310m on both Citibank and JPMorgan, $290 million each on Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS and $275 million on HSBC..</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5462ff68e4b0c6f7ffe34b4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-12T06:38:17.905Z\">6.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FCA also says that it will \u201cprogress our investigation\u201d into Barclays.</p> <p>As City editor Jill Treanor explains, Barclays was expected to settle with the FCA and CFTC, but has now got it alone...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/statuses/532413593204326401\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The FCA agreement had expected to include Barclays: regulator says &quot;will progress investigation in to that firm&quot;</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/532413593204326401\">November 12, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/statuses/532415304522272768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Barclays says had been offered the same deal as others but has decided to do a settlement with a broader group of regulators</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/532415304522272768\">November 12, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5462fd08e4b0f33efafda9ff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-12T06:33:43.599Z\">6.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FCA record fines: the details</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Financial Conduct Authority has issued a pretty damning statement into the misconduct at these five banks.

      "bodyText": "The rigging of foreign exchange markets is a bigger scandal than Libor. It lacks the element of surprise since it is no longer news that some traders will lie and cheat when inadequately supervised. But that\u2019s what makes it bigger. Forex-rigging continued to happen after the Libor scandal broke. Note the end-date of the investigations overseen by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the US\u2019s commodities futures and trading commission: 15 October 2013. The deterrent impact of Libor seems to have been zero. What were these banks\u2019 managements doing to honour their worthy words about cleansing the rotten culture in trading rooms? As FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley noted wearily, monitoring employees\u2019 chat rooms \u201cis not a complex thing to do\u201d. Quite. The existence of potential conflicts of interest between a bank and its clients is obvious in currency markets. So too is the scope for collusion. You do not have to be Sherlock Holmes to suspect that chat-room exchanges such as these might indicate dodgy practices: \u201chow can I make free money with no fcking heads up\u201d; \u201cjust about to slam some stops\u201d; \u201clets double team em\u201d. Yet this garbage was bandied about for years. Did managements really not know, or even suspect, something was wrong? Did they just turn a blind eye? Or did they take comfort in the false notion that the forex market is so big and so liquid that it would be impossible to rig? All possible explanations are alarming. In a rational world, the customers would move their business to firms with higher standards. That is not going to happen because investment banking is almost a closed shop. The five firms involved in today\u2019s settlement plus Barclays, which is yet to settle, are six of the biggest banks in the world. But if fines (paid by shareholders anyway) don\u2019t improve behaviour, and if bank managements can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, police their trading floors competently, what\u2019s left? Criminal convictions for fraudulent behaviour are one great hope \u2013 rightly so because the threat of time in jail is the surest way to concentrate minds on trading floors. We wait to see what the Serious Fraud Office delivers. But regulators must also look beyond endless fines. The FCA, we are told, considered imposing suspensions on the banks from trading forex on behalf of clients but decided against. Some of the offending acts were considered too ancient and there was a fear of disrupting a critical financial market. OK, but a three-month temporary ban on trading forex would improve behaviour faster than any fine. Managements would fear being sacked. Shareholders might wake up and demand proof of root-and-branch reform. Or big banks might break themselves up into easier-to-manage units. Heavy-handed? You bet, but six years after the financial crash, some of the world\u2019s biggest banks are still out of control. In other fields, firms with shoddy practices fear the loss of their licence to operate. Big banks don\u2019t, but should. Sainsbury\u2019s sad slogan \u201cMaking Sainsbury\u2019s great again\u201d was an excellent strap line from a decade ago \u2013 it conveyed confidence and a sense of purpose. \u201cEvolving to win\u201d \u2013 the latest effort \u2013 is ugly and sounds timid. Unfortunately, timidity \u2013 or, at least, defensive thinking \u2013 seems to be the new order of things at Sainsbury\u2019s. New chief executive Mike Coupe\u2019s strategy is sharper than his slogan, but it contained little to suggest that sales or profits can return to growth any time soon. Announcing \u00a3150m of lower prices is sensible. Sainsbury\u2019s role in supermarket-land is not to be the price-setter, but nor can it afford to stray far from the pack. More price cuts may be needed when Tesco gets serious. A more aggressive attack on internal costs represents good housekeeping. And a halving of annual capital expenditure to \u00a3500m-\u00a3550m is just common sense. The new dividend policy \u2013 pay out half the earnings, whatever they are \u2013 is imaginative and more shareholder-friendly than Tesco\u2019s straight 75% slash. But it also underlines the uncertainty: dividends will just track earnings mechanically. There are no promises beyond that. Meanwhile, 25% of the stores are deemed either too big or in the wrong place, thus a \u00a3628m charge to cover impairments on current property and undeveloped land. Top marks for candour, but that\u2019s worrying, even if third parties can be recruited to fill the empty aisles with their own offers. Mind you, Tesco, home of white elephant hypermarkets, has more to worry about on the property front. That\u2019s next year\u2019s story.

Carol Fairweather, Burberry\u2019s finance director, repeatedly refused to answer questions about how much the company paid the 12-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham as the company announced an 11% drop in profits. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to comment on what arrangements were paid to Romeo,\u201d Fairweather said on a conference call with journalists on Wednesday. \u201cThere are marketing budgets, and they [people in the marketing department] are making those decisions. I don\u2019t sign off every invoice that comes into the building.\u201d She was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the marketing department\u2019s decision to hire Romeo, and said there had been almost 5m hits on YouTube. Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s chief executive and chief creative officer, has described Romeo\u2019s performance in the video as that of a \u201clittle superstar\u201d. Bailey, who was not available to speak to the media on Wednesday, has said previously: \u201cIt continues to be an utter joy working with Romeo \u2013 he has charm, style and energy. I\u2019m delighted that he\u2019s the lead role in our festive campaign.\u201d The Mail on Sunday reported Romeo earned \u00a345,000 for staring in the advert. The deal, which works out at \u00a393.75 a minute for an eight-hour day, was negotiated by Simon Fuller, the former Spice Girls manager. Burberry\u2019s sales in the six months to the end of September rose by 7% to \u00a31.1bn, but pre-tax profits dropped 11% from \u00a3159m to \u00a3142m largely due to a \u00a331m loss on foreign currencies. The company, which is known for its trademark trenchcoats but also sells \u00a314,000 alligator bowling bags and \u00a395 babies\u2019 booties, warned that sales growth is slowing in Asia with are \u201cpockets of weakness in Europe\u201d. \u201cLooking ahead, in a more difficult external environment, we continue to focus on the things that we can control,\u201d said Bailey, who was handed a \u00a37.6m golden hello when he was promoted to the top job. \u201cThrough authentic products, great customer experiences and a culture of continuous improvement and innovation, we remain confident of Burberry\u2019s sustained outperformance.\u201d Burberry\u2019s shares were down 1% to \u00a315.13 at midday on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "A year-long improvement in the unemployment rate stalled in September, according to official figures, fuelling concerns of a sharper than expected slowdown in the UK\u2019s economic recovery. A rise in employment of 112,000 was unable to bring down the unemployment rate from the 6% recorded in August, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. But wages picked up more strongly than forecast and one measure of average weekly earnings jumped marginally ahead of inflation. The figures will cheer ministers, who have waited anxiously for a return to growth in real wages. In the three months to September 2014 wages increased by 1.3% when bonuses are excluded, compared to an inflation rate of 1.2% in September. Cutbacks in bonus payments alongside a shift to low-paid work and self-employment have proved a drag on average wage rises over the last year, undermining predictions that the recovery in growth since the beginning of 2013 would quickly feed through into higher wages. Some economists preferred to highlight figures for September alone, which revealed an even bigger boost to pay of 1.8% year on year, excluding bonuses \u2013 the strongest in over two years. Most analysts said the small quarter-on-quarter rise in wages was unlikely to shift the majority view of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets base interest rates. The committee has kept rates at 0.5% in response to the failure of wages to rise consistently above inflation.

At the end of one such effort, traders in chat rooms congratulated themselves: \u201cnice work gents...I don my hat\u201d \u201cHooray nice team work\u201d \u201cbravo...cudnt been better\u201d \u201chave that my son...v nice mate\u201d \u201cdont mess with our ccy [currency]\u201d The 4pm fix is used by fund managers and other major investors to get a price for a range of currencies and it\u2019s based on trading activity 30 seconds before and after 4pm. One of the traders quipped: \u201cthere you go ... go early, move it, hold it, push it.\u201d HSBC, one of the five banks fined on Wednesday, stated: \u201cloved that mate... worked lovely... pity we couldn\u2019t get it below the 00\u201d and \u201cwe need a few more of those for me to get back on track this month\u201d. So what are they talking about? The \u201c00\u201d is a reference to the sterling dollar rate \u2013 in this instance 1.6000. The FCA provides an example of the trading activity that took place in the period between 3.32pm and 4.01pm and which allowed HSBC to generate profits of $160,000. Between 3.32pm and the start of the fixing window \u2013 30 seconds before 4pm \u2013 the pound dollar rate fell from 1.6044 to 1.6009. The FCA said HSBC sold \u00a370m in advance of this 4pm fix to take advantage of the expected downward movement in the fix rate because of the chat that had taken place beforehand when traders had discussed the orders they had received. One trader said they intended to \u201cbash the fck out of it\u201d. In the first five seconds of the fix window, HSBC then entered nine orders to sell \u00a3101m, and the rate fell from 1.6009 to 1.600. HSBC sold \u00a3311m in total during the fix window and the rate was finally published at 1.6003. One RBS trader described the information discussed in the chat rooms as \u201ca 3 way relationship built on immense trust\u201d and, thanking a trader at another firm, wrote: \u201ccheers for saying you were the same way helped me go early.\u201d Traders trying to remove orders that might have moved the market against them talked about \u201ctaking out the filth\u201d and \u201cclearing the decks\u201d. One transcript shows traders at three banks discussing whether to invite a fourth into their chat room. One trader urges caution, as they don\u2019t want \u201cother numpty\u2019s in the market\u201d to know what they\u2019re up to. The trader adds: \u201cbut not only that \u201cis he gonna protect us \u201clike we protect each other against our own branches\u201d Other transcripts show traders discussing \u201ccable\u201d, the word used in the City to describe the exchange rate between dollar and sterling, which is also known as \u201cbetty\u201d. One trader says at 2.50pm: \u201cearly days but im a seller cable at fix.\u201d At 3.35pm another says: \u201cget lumpy cable at the fix ok.\u201d Another says: \u201cyeah baby.\u201d After the fix closes they say: \u201cnice job mate\u201d \u201chaha\u201d \u201ci sold a lot up there \u201csweet nice job\u201d \u201cbravo\u201d",

In the UK, UBS was fined \u00a3233m, with \u00a3225m for Citibank, JPMorgan at \u00a3222m, RBS at \u00a3217m, and \u00a3216m for HSBC. Barclays has yet to settle.

The US regulators have imposed a string of fines and penalties on banks since the onset of the banking crisis \u2013 some of which date back to the sale of mortgage bonds linked to the subprime debt crisis in 2007.

      "bodyText": "The corruption of the world\u2019s biggest currency dealers was laid bare on Wednesday when regulators imposed \u00a32.6bn of fines on six major banks for rigging the \u00a33.5tn-a-day foreign exchange markets. Two UK and US regulators said they had found a \u201cfree for all culture\u201d rife on trading floors which allowed the markets to be rigged for five years, from January 2008 to October 2013. The much-anticipated record settlement did not include Barclays, which remains in discussions with other regulators. Each of the fines imposed on Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Citibank, JP Morgan and UBS were records for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), smashing the penalties imposed over the last two years for Libor rigging. The chancellor, George Osborne, said: \u201cToday we take tough action to clean up corruption by a few so that we have a financial system that works for everyone. It\u2019s part of a long-term plan that is fixing what went wrong in Britain\u2019s banks and our economy.\u201d Osborne will take a share of the fines for the Treasury and said they would be \u201cused for the wider public good\u201d. In the UK, UBS was handed the biggest fine, at \u00a3233m, followed by \u00a3225m for Citibank, JPMorgan at \u00a3222m, RBS at \u00a3217m, and \u00a3216m for HSBC. Barclays has yet to settle. In the US, the regulator fined Citibank and JP Morgan $310m each, $290m each for RBS and UBS, and $275m for HSBC. A second US regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, also imposed separate fines on JP Morgan, Citi and Bank of America taking the day\u2019s tally to \u00a32.6bn. Andrea Leadsom, a Treasury minister, said people who have done wrong \u201cwill not be back in a dealing room on a big salary\u201d and \u201ceverything that can be done to punish this type of behaviour\u201d will be done. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s completely disgusting. I think taxpayers will be horrified ... I don\u2019t know if corruption is a strong enough word for it.\u201d Leadsom said it was particularly bad that this was going on at a time when taxpayers were bailing out the banks. Announcing the first ever co-ordinated regulatory action, the FCA\u2019s Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \u201cFirms could have been in no doubt, especially after Libor, that failing to take steps to tackle the consequences of a free for all culture on their trading floors was unacceptable.\u201d The settlement was co-ordinated with the US regulator, the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission, which published transcripts of traders discussing foreign exchange rates on private chatrooms. In one, a trader writes \u201cdont want other numpty\u2019s in mkt to know\u201d. The traders make remarks such as \u201cnice job mate\u201d and \u201cyeah baby\u201d as they discuss the rates. Traders at different banks formed tight-knit groups in which information was shared about client activity, including using code names to identify clients without naming them. These groups were described as, for example, \u201cthe players\u201d, \u201cthe 3 musketeers\u201d, \u201c1 team, 1 dream\u201d, \u201ca co-operative\u201d and \u201cthe A-team\u201d. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan apologised to consumers: \u201cTo say I\u2019m angry would be an understatement. We had people working in this bank who did not know the difference between right and wrong and put their interests ahead of clients.\u201d Martin Wheatley, boss of the FCA, said the regulator would \u201cnot tolerate conduct which imperils market integrity or the wider UK financial system\u201d. He said that \u201cfirms must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits or leave the ethics of their conduct to compliance to worry about\u201d. Wheatley added: \u201cSenior management commitments to change need to become a reality in every area of their business.\u201d The Bank of England also published its report by Lord Grabiner into whether Threadneedle Street officials knew about the behaviour of traders. It concluded that there was no evidence that any official was involved in unlawful or improper behaviour but said there was an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d by one official who knew that bank traders were sharing information. However, after trawling through emails, the Bank of England said its chief foreign exchange dealer \u2013 suspended since March \u2013 had been dismissed. \u201cThe individual\u2019s dismissal was not at all related to the allegations investigated by Lord Grabiner, but as a result of information that came to light during the course of the Bank\u2019s initial internal review into allegations relating to the FX market and Bank staff. This information related to the Bank\u2019s internal policies, not to FX,\u201d the Bank of England said. RBS, 81% owned by the taxpayer, said it was continuing an investigation into the matter and is reviewing the conduct of 50 current and former employees, three of whom have been suspended. It pledged to make a public statement on the progress of the investigation by the end of the year. \u201cToday is a stark reminder of the importance of culture and integrity in banking and we will rightly be judged on the strength of our response,\u201d said RBS\u2019s outgoing chairman, Sir Philip Hampton. The bank pledged to look at clawing back bonuses and the impact on bonuses for \u201csenior management\u201d. No payouts of current bonuses will take place until the internal investigation is completed. RBS had received complaints from two clients \u2013 in October 2010 and January 2012 \u2013 about the activities, and in November 2011 one of its traders raised concerns, which were not heeded.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stockholm\u2019s street magazine vendors no longer need to ask if passers-by can spare some change anymore \u2013 they take cards instead. In the most cashless society on the planet, sellers of Sweden\u2019s answer to the Big Issue have been equipped with portable card readers to accept virtual payments. \u201cMore and more sellers were telling us that people wanted a copy of the magazine but weren\u2019t carrying cash,\u201d says Pia Stolt of Situation Stockholm, the street paper sold by homeless vendors in Sweden\u2019s capital. \u201cIt got to the point where we had to do something, so we worked with Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle and came up with a way to sell the magazine electronically. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how it would turn out, or whether people would be reluctant to give their credit card information to a homeless person,\u201d says Stolt, \u201cbut the results have been great \u2013 vendors\u2019 sales are up 59%.\u201d \u201cSwedes are pretty trusting and we\u2019re used to embracing new technology so this was the perfect solution,\u201d says Stolt. \u201cThe cashless society campaign we\u2019re seeing in Sweden is definitely a good move as far as we are concerned \u2013 it\u2019s unstoppable.\u201d The country\u2019s highest-profile cash-free campaigner is Abba\u2019s Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus. After his son was robbed several years ago, Ulvaeus became an evangelist for the electronic payment movement, claiming that cash was the primary cause of crime and that \u201call activity in the black economy requires cash\u201d. The man who composed Money, Money, Money has been living cash-free for more than a year and says the only thing he misses is \u201ca coin to borrow a trolley at the supermarket\u201d. Abba the Museum has operated cash-free since opening in May 2013 and Ulvaeus says Sweden \u201ccould and should be the first cashless society in the world\u201d. Four out of five purchases are now made electronically in Sweden, according to associate professor of industrial dynamics at Sweden\u2019s Royal Institute of Technology, Niklas Arvidsson \u2013 and going totally cash-free is the next step. \u201cBanks and merchants invested heavily in card payment systems in the 1990s and these days consumers are used to it,\u201d says Arvidsson. While London\u2019s buses went cash-free earlier this year, bus fares disappeared several years ago in Stockholm after public transport unions declared that handling cash had become a \u201cwork environment problem\u201d. \u201cBus drivers were getting attacked for their fares and so Stockholm banned cash on public transport,\u201d says Arvidsson. \u201cThere was also a spate of bank robberies, so four years ago, the banks began to move away from cash. Now, five of Sweden\u2019s six big banks \u2013 all except Handelsbanken \u2013 operate cash free wherever possible.\u201d The Swedish financial sector has become more cost efficient and the number of armed robberies has hit a 30-year low, according to the Swedish Bankers\u2019 Association. \u201cPeople trust each other, the government and the banks more in Sweden,\u201d says Arvidsson, \u201cplus we have very little corruption \u2013 so we don\u2019t need to have physical cash in our hands to feel safe.\u201d The drive to a cashless society is supported by the UN Capital Development Fund\u2019s Better Than Cash Alliance which aims to accelerate the shift to electronic payments, funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, MasterCard and Visa among others. But it\u2019s Sweden that is blazing the trail. \u201cWe\u2019re leading the world in cashless trading,\u201d says Bengt Nilervall from the Swedish Federation of Trade. \u201cIt\u2019s safer this way and it saves us money, as handling money and transporting cash is costly. The Payment Card Industry [PCI] has taken many security measures to ensure that people are safe and we have good protection in place, so Swedes feel confident paying electronically.\u201d There is, however, concern about how well Sweden\u2019s 1.8 million pensioners \u2013 out of a total population of 10m \u2013 will adapt. \u201cA lot of elderly people feel excluded when you need to use cash cards or your mobile phone to take a bus or use public toilets,\u201d says Johanna H\u00e5ll\u00e9n of the Swedish National Pensioners\u2019 Organisation. \u201cOnly 50% of our members use cash-cards everywhere and 7% never use cash-cards. So we want the government to take things slowly.\u201d The digital payment revolution is also a challenge for tourists, who need pre-paid tickets or a mobile registered in Sweden to catch a bus in the capital. Many have also endured mild chaos at the one of the country\u2019s first cashless festivals this summer when the payment system broke down and people ended up resorting to old-fashioned IOUs. \u201cThere\u2019s a worry about fraud as well,\u201d says Stockholm based private security expert Bj\u00f6rn Ericsson. \u201cWith figures from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention showing that fraud has more than doubled in the last decade.\u201d In light of the NSA revelations, some are uncomfortable about the idea that big businesses can trace their every electronic footprint. \u201cBut most Swedes do rely on \u2018the system\u2019,\u201d says Ericsson, \u201cI seldom hear anybody talk about Snowden and the circumstances around the [NSA] matter anymore.\u201d The one thing that may put the brakes on a brave new cash-free world is Swedes\u2019 sentimentality when it comes to their coins and notes. \u201cA recent survey I worked on showed that two-thirds of Swedes think carrying cash is a human right,\u201d says Arvidsson. \u201cWe like having our own currency and it fits in with the identity of being a Swede; we\u2019re even releasing new banknotes in 2015. So people like to know their cash is there, even if they don\u2019t necessarily use it.\u201d Sweden\u2019s other firsts 1661 First bank notes in Europe introduced 1718 Women granted right to vote in Age of Liberty [although universal suffrage doesn\u2019t arrive until 1921] 1955 Ikea sells first flatpack furniture 1971 ABBA formed, becoming the first group from a non-English speaking country to achieve global success (and fleetingly make flared catsuits cool) 2008 Inaugural commercial music streaming service, Spotify, launches 2014 Sweden awarded first place at the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Information Technology Report for advances in digital technology and ranked first for sustainability in the Global Green Economy Index",
