John Lewis would be pushing its luck with Rocket Man, but I\u2019m Still Standing would work. Diamond\u2019s hindsight is less than crystal clear Bob Diamond emerges from The Bank That Lived a Little, Philip Augar\u2019s superb recent history of modern Barclays, as a more rounded individual than you might expect. The ultra-competitive American with a blind-spot on bonuses is fully present, of course. But Diamond also led Barclays\u2019 creation of an investment bank that could compete on Wall Street, a challenge that defeated every other UK bank that tried. That required skill as well as ambition. So Diamond\u2019s reflections 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers ought to be noteworthy. Unfortunately, he has offered an absurdly self-serving account. First, Diamond argued in an interview with the BBC that the public should be angry with Royal Bank of Scotland for requiring bail-outs but \u201cHSBC and Barclays deserve credit for raising capital privately\u201d and not putting themselves at risk. Come on, Barclays enjoyed a huge slice of luck in 2007 when it lost the battle with RBS to buy ABN Amro, the deal that holed the Edinburgh-based bank. The supposed safety features in Barclays\u2019 version \u2013 paying in shares, not cash, and buying all of ABN, not just the rotten wholesale division \u2013 could easily have failed. Even Barclays\u2019 directors glimpsed danger. Augar records the board fretting in September 2007, in the early days of the credit crisis, that RBS would pull out. Barclays was also lucky that then-chancellor Alistair Darling killed the next adventure \u2013 the 11th-hour attempt to buy Lehman before its bankruptcy, as opposed to picking up some non-toxic pieces afterwards. That would not have ended well. And it\u2019s not as if Barclays got no help from the UK public. It raised its capital privately (and controversially) in the Middle East but, like all big UK banks, Barclays benefitted from credit guarantees underwritten by the UK government. Second, he still defends the culture of Barclays. \u201cI don\u2019t think the reprehensible behaviour of a few people out of 160,000 employees is representative of the culture we had at Barclays \u2013 I think we had a very strong culture,\u201d he told the BBC. Yes, there were worse culprits who paid even bigger conduct penalties. But recall a line from City lawyer Anthony Salz\u2019s in-depth review in 2013: \u201cThe culture that emerged tended to favour transactions over relationships, the short term over sustainability, and financial over other business purposes.\u201d That is not what most people would call \u201cstrong\u201d. Third, Diamond now says he fears banks have become too cautious in their risk-taking and so can\u2019t support growth in the economy. Try telling that to Barclays\u2019 shareholders as they look at a share price of 172p versus 700p in the old days. At the last count, there were \u00a3180bn of risk-weighted assets in Barclays\u2019 corporate and investment bank, which sounds like quite enough risk, especially as the successors have yet to work out how to make consistent returns from Diamond\u2019s creation. He is free to push his glossy account, of course. But it would be alarming if today\u2019s bankers pine for his vision. Sadly, one suspects many do.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Frank Lowy \u2013 the billionaire Westfield founder and bearer of one of Australia\u2019s best-known migrant stories \u2013 has condemned a growing hostility towards migrants and migration in Australian public debate, and urged the country to embrace \u201can ambitious migration program\u201d. \u201cI have \u2026 been disturbed by the negative tone of the debate over immigration ... there is a rising crescendo of opinion from columnists and politicians saying we should reduce our immigration intake,\u201d Lowy said. Lowy, 87, fled Nazi persecution in Czechoslovakia and Hungary as a child. He arrived in Australia via Palestine and Israel in 1952, where he went into business, founding the company that became the Westfield shopping empire, which he ran for more than five decades. He is the benefactor behind the eponymous Lowy Institute, to which he gave its annual address on Thursday night, saying he had previously maintained a commitment to keep private his own opinions but that he now felt motivated to speak publicly. \u201cIf I am ever to speak at a Lowy Institute event, then this is the time,\u201d he said. Lowy described migration as an \u201cact of ambition, imagination and bravery\u201d. \u201cTo imagine a better life for yourself and your family and to leave behind all that is familiar requires a special kind of courage,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia needs more of that courage.\u201d He said the significant reduction in migration last year \u2013 and the rhetorical replacement of migration \u201ctargets\u201d with \u201cceilings\u201d \u2013 was a troubling trend for Australia\u2019s future prosperity, diversity and global standing. \u201cWe are focusing too much on the problems and forgetting about the opportunities of immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us learn from our history. Immigration has been great for Australia in the past. I believe it will be great for Australia in the future. \u201cI believe in a big Australia. I am an advocate for an ambitious immigration program. \u201cWe are all familiar with the differences between the Australia of the 1950s and the Australia of today. We are richer, more productive and more interesting now than we were then. \u201cThis change would not have been possible without a big immigration program.\u201d The level of permanent migration to Australia fell to its lowest level in a decade last year, with about 162,000 permanent visas granted last financial year, compared with about 190,000 in the preceding four years. A number of politicians, including former prime minister Tony Abbott, have called for substantial and sustained cuts to immigration. Lowy said his views were shaped by his own childhood experience. \u201cAs a child I learned what it meant to be persecuted. But, even then, at the worst of times, I knew there was good in the world. \u201cI saw my mother share our meagre food supplies with neighbours. I saw her risk her life, and mine, to practise our religion. \u201cAs a boy I stood at the doorway of our hiding place in Budapest and watched Russian troops fight house by house to liberate the city and therefore rescue us from certain death.\u201d In a wide-ranging speech, Lowy expounded on the Australia-US alliance, saying the US president, Donald Trump, had made the partnership more \u201ccomplicated\u201d but that Australia\u2019s allegiance was to the United States, not to a single president. \u201cI regret that Mr Trump does not see the great advantages that flow to America from its alliances and the global trading system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd personally, given my life experiences, I feel more comfortable when the president of the United States is an advocate of democracy, not a friend of authoritarians.\u201d Lowy said Australia must work to develop a co-operative relationship with Beijing but not allow itself to be dictated to. \u201cThere will also be occasions on which we disagree with China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd on those occasions the best approach is to be forthright. \u201cIf you don\u2019t look after your own interests, the person across the table certainly won\u2019t.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Widow sues DPD over courier husband's death", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The delivery company DPD is being sued over the death of a driver who collapsed after he missed hospital appointments because he feared the company\u2019s practice of charging drivers \u00a3150 for missing work. The widow of Don Lane is demanding compensation from the firm which delivers parcels for retailers including Marks and Spencer and John Lewis. Lane, who had diabetes, died suddenly in January from the disease. DPD charged him \u00a3150 when he attended one specialist renal appointment and he then missed others. He collapsed twice during rounds, including once while driving. Ruth Lane has lodged a claim at the employment tribunal in Bristol which alleges that Lane was ill and vomiting blood but attended work due to his fear of being fined for failing to attend work without permission. He completed his route but collapsed with a heart attack when he got home and died shortly afterwards in hospital. The claim also highlights the pressure Lane faced from DPD\u2019s system of allocating short windows for each delivery which give customers certainty about when parcels will arrive. Lane\u2019s death was raised in parliament where both Labour and Conservatives reacted with outrage. It led to DPD promising to scrap the \u00a3150 charges and offering couriers sick pay. The company made \u00a3110m profit in the UK in 2016. Ruth Lane alleges her husband was bogusly self-employed and should have been classed as an employee with access to sick pay, holiday pay and the minimum wage. If the employment tribunal rules in her favour, DPD could be forced to change its entire business model which relies on self-employed couriers, which it describes as franchisees, being paid per parcel. A similar claim of bogus self-employment was upheld in the employment tribunal against the minicab firm Uber in 2017. Ruth Lane also alleges that DPD breached the Equalities Act by not adjusting its procedures to accommodate Lane\u2019s health condition. Her claim, on behalf of her husband\u2019s estate and filed by the solicitors Leigh Day, states: \u201cDPD\u2019s refusal to give permission for the claimant to take time off to attend these appointments meant that his disability was not properly monitored and that he did not have the opportunity to receive the appropriate treatments for his disability and related conditions, ultimately resulting in his death.\u201d It also says Lane was given a rural route with long drives between stops, when he should have been given a more urban route with shorter stops to allow him to take more regular breaks and buy food. Lane collapsed twice at work with hypoglycemia, the first time at the wheel of his van, after which he was taken to hospital, the claim states. After the second collapse, three months before his death, his wife confronted his manager, Matt Poore. She complained that Lane\u2019s route had not been changed despite his repeated requests. When Poore denied this, Ruth said other drivers had been given new routes which were local and less demanding, which Poore also denied. She pointed out that he needed regular meal breaks to maintain his blood sugar levels and Poore said this would be possible. However, the claim says, Lane and other DPD couriers started working to a system known by them as \u201cprecise\u201d, which introduced shorter delivery windows that could not be changed by the driver. Lane often struggled to meet the required timeframes and complete all his deliveries. He was told he could be \u201cbreached\u201d for missing slots and that three breaches could result in dismissal. A spokesman for DPD said the company was \u201cunable to comment on any potential employment tribunal matters\u201d. He said drivers would be able to apply for a worker contract, rather than self-employment, from later this month. The contract would be for an average \u00a328,800 per annum, based on a five-day week, with 28 days\u2019 paid holiday, a pension and sick pay.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House of Fraser customers who were promised refunds for undelivered goods in the wake of the department store\u2019s collapse are to lose their money after its new owner, Sports Direct, reneged on the offer. In August, six days after the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, controversially paid administrators \u00a390m for the department store group, House of Fraser told online customers that it was cancelling and refunding orders that were yet to be sent out. However, this week the company said customers would have to join the long list of other unsecured creditors applying to the administrator EY for payment. A spokesperson for House of Fraser said: \u201cWe cannot comment on individual cases, however the correct course of action for customers who have issues regarding goods purchased prior to 10 August is to contact the administrators at EY.\u201d The store group made its refund offer via its official social media channels on 16 August after customers expressed their anger that it had continued to take online orders while management staff had been discussing when to call in administrators. It said shoppers would receive an email in \u201ca couple of days\u201d. In recent weeks, customers have used the store\u2019s Facebook page and other social media sites to complain that they have not been contacted and/or received refunds. Charlotte Kerr\u2019s post on Facebook is typical: \u201cIt\u2019s been nearly a month and I still haven\u2019t heard anything, my emails are being ignored and my credit card company has told me that I have to keep pursuing a refund from HoF. Not sure how I\u2019m supposed to do that when they\u2019re ignoring all attempts to contact them.\u201d The promise of refunds came the day after House of Fraser shut down its website amid a dispute over payment between Sports Direct and XPO, the company that delivered online orders. The website was expected to reopen this week after a deal was agreed with XPO, but was still closed on Thursday afternoon. Shoppers who have tried to return faulty goods have found them returned by Royal Mail after House of Fraser\u2019s warehouse refused to accept them. Holders of the House of Fraser gift cards who were told to send them to a Glasgow office are still waiting to hear whether they will be replaced, as previously suggested. Sports Direct has no legal obligation to refund orders made before House of Fraser went into administration. EY said there was little prospect of customers awaiting goods receiving any money back from the administration process. A spokeswoman said it could be a few pence for each pound spent, if that, and any payments would take at least 12 months. She suggested affected customers should be claiming from their card or payment providers first. The Guardian has repeatedly asked House of Fraser to clarify its position on refunds, but the retailer has declined to respond. Steve Nowottny, of MoneySavingExpert, said House of Fraser customers had been left in limbo. \u201cWhile there\u2019s often confusion in this sort of situation, communication to House of Fraser customers has been particularly poor, with many unanswered questions over online orders, gift cards and return rights,\u201d Nowottny said. \u201cHouse of Fraser needs to act straight away to ensure that customers who have been left sometimes hundreds of pounds out of pocket are refunded immediately.\u201d Last week one customer who had ordered an undelivered sofa entered the Darlington store with friends and removed the sofa she had bought. Staff called the police, who pulled over her van as she drove home, but officers let her continue when she showed them the receipt.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned of the mounting risks to the British economy from a no-deal Brexit, with firms already putting investments on hold. As the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to keep rates on hold at 0.75%, it warned there had been increasing signs of stress linked to Brexit since its last meeting a month ago. Despite an improving picture for economic growth in recent weeks and stronger wage growth for British workers, the Bank\u2019s regional network of agents found businesses had begun putting spending plans on hold or were diverting it to other countries. Suggesting investment intentions for the year ahead had deteriorated, the Bank said \u201cconcern focused on the possibility of increased trade frictions with the EU after withdrawal\u201d. The MPC also noted rising levels of volatility in sterling, adding that there had been an \u201cincrease in perceived downside risks to the exchange rate\u201d among City traders caused by the mounting likelihood of no deal. Despite leaving rates on hold on Thursday, the MPC suggested rate increases could be required in future if the economy continues to recover from the slowdown seen earlier this year. Threadneedle Street had been expected to leave interest rates unchanged after raising the cost of borrowing last month to the highest level seen since the last recession almost a decade ago. This was the first meeting of the MPC since Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, agreed to extend his tenure until January 2020 to help smooth the process of Brexit. There had been weeks of speculation as to whether Carney, the former governor of Canada\u2019s central bank who took the Bank of England job in 2013, would agree to an extension of his term given the uncertainty over Brexit. On Thursday Carney attended a special meeting of the cabinet chaired by Theresa May and focused on how a no-deal Brexit could be handled.",

      "bodyText": "The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, has clashed with senior business leaders after he attacked struggling companies for blaming Brexit on their woes. Business organisations hit back after Raab told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Brexit was becoming a scapegoat for underperforming firms. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s probably rather easy at this moment in time for any business which isn\u2019t doing rather well to point to Brexit. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that some of the uncertainty around these negotiations will have an impact on business \u2013 that\u2019s why we are putting all our energy into getting the good deal we want with our EU friends and partners. \u201cAll I\u2019m gently saying it\u2019s rather easy for a business to blame Brexit and the politicians rather than taking responsibility for their own situation.\u201d The Institute of Directors, which represents executives and senior board members across the country, said firms were \u201cwell within their rights to raise concerns [about Brexit], and these should not be dismissed out of hand\u201d. The Conservatives are traditionally viewed as the party of business, yet relations have deteriorated over the party\u2019s handling of Brexit as company bosses grow increasingly concerned over the risk of no deal. The CBI director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, tweeted after Raab\u2019s comments that firms had shown remarkable resilience amid the uncertainty of Brexit. \u201c[It\u2019s] important politicians on all sides recognise this and show confidence in UK business. The world is watching,\u201d she said. Raab noted that official figures this week showed economic growth accelerating, while wage growth has also picked up and is now ahead of inflation. The Brexit secretary also took a swipe at companies that have blamed the fall in sterling for pushing up prices. \u201cActually, inflation has come down to 2.5%, some people said it would hit 4%.,\u201d he said. His comments came after the John Lewis Partnership saw its profits all but wiped out in the past six months. The group, which also owns the Waitrose grocery chain, said: \u201cWith the level of uncertainty facing consumers and the economy, in part due to ongoing Brexit negotiations, forecasting is particularly difficult but we continue to expect full year profits to be substantially lower than last year for the partnership as a whole.\u201d The department store group\u2019s chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, blamed heavy discounting by rivals that forced John Lewis to follow suit due to its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d promise. He said costs had surged due to the weak pound, which is still 13% below its pre-referendum levels. Responding to Raab\u2019s comments, Mayfield said: \u201cI didn\u2019t actually say that Brexit is to blame for our results. But the fact is that sterling is weaker and one of the factors in that is uncertainty.\u201d Since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, a number of companies have blamed poor performance on the uncertainty created by the vote, along with the weaker pound for raising their costs, amid growing fears that the UK could crash out of the EU without a deal. However, the Morrisons chief executive, David Potts, insisted the supermarket group had not seen any change in consumer behaviour, when asked if Brexit was affecting sales. He said: \u201cConsumers are a little bit more concerned about the country\u2019s macroeconomic position rather than feeling the pinch in their own circumstances in which they feel fairly confident.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons is to launch its own vegan ready meals late next month as it tries to tap into the growing trend for shunning meat and animal products. The UK\u2019s fourth-biggest supermarket group, previously known for its pies and fresh meat slaughtered at its abattoirs, said it would be stocking bean \u201cnon carne\u201d \u2013 an alternative to chilli con carne \u2013 \u201cveggies in blankets\u201d and vegan cheeses, including a dairy-free Red Leicester, all under a new specialist own label. David Potts, the Morrisons chief executive, said the foray into vegan foods was part of attempts to broaden the supermarket\u2019s appeal, especially among young people, as it tries to build on its strongest sales growth in nearly a decade, helped by the summer heatwave, the World Cup and the popularity of its locally sourced foods. \u201cThis will be a great thing for Amazon Prime customers to tuck into,\u201d he said, referring to a deal under which he said Morrisons supplied eight out 10 fresh groceries sold via the online retailer\u2019s UK site. Sales at stores open more than a year rose 6.3% in the three months to 5 August, marking a nine-year high. The figure includes wholesale and retail sales and excludes fuel. Sales were up 4.9% in the six months to August. Potts credited the growth in underlying sales to a 30% increase in sales of local foods in the first half, such as Yorkshire squeaky cheese, Plumgarths sausages and Voakes pies, and the popularity of the \u201cwonky\u201d range of misshapen fruit and vegetables, which Morrisons sells at a lower price to cut down on food waste. Potts said transactions had ticked up to more than half a million a week. The chain\u2019s performance was also aided by the accelerated rollout of its deal to supply food and other goods to McColl\u2019s, the convenience shop and newsagent group. Sales in Morrisons stores rose 2.5% on a like-for-like basis in the second quarter, and 2.1% in the first half. Profits before tax for the first half fell 29% to \u00a3142m as a result of one-off costs related to bond sales and the automation of ordering systems. Excluding these costs, profits rose 9% to \u00a3193m. Morrisons said it would pay a special dividend of 2p a share to investors for the half year, on top of a 4p special dividend announced in March. Potts said food inflation was broadly flat. While dairy and wheat prices have gone up following the dry summer, Morrisons has cut the price of mince, chicken and sausages to compete with the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Potts said Morrisons would be adjusting the specification on fruit, vegetables and flowers in autumn so it could accept smaller produce due to the dry summer. \u201c[We will] sell what Britain has grown through the summer. It will be a wonky autumn and Christmas,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The John Lewis Partnership has been hit by the fight for survival on the high street after heavy discounting by struggling rivals helped trigger a 99% fall in first-half profits at the retailer. The employee-owned business, which also includes the Waitrose supermarket chain as well as the eponymous department stores, said pretax profits before one-off items fell to \u00a31.2m in the six months to 28 July, from \u00a383m a year in the same period a year earlier. The dive was largely prompted by the first pretax loss at the John Lewis department stores in at least a decade. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the partnership, said the results had been hit by heavy discounting at other retailers, which forces its department stores to lower prices under their signature \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d pledge. He said: \u201cThese are challenging times in retail \u2026 gross margin has been squeezed in what has been the most promotional market we\u2019ve seen in almost a decade.\u201d The company added that the \u201clevel of uncertainty facing consumers and the economy, in part due to ongoing Brexit negotiations\u201d made it difficult to forecast trading for the next six months but it expected full-year profits to be down. The group said the main reason for its fall in profits was the \u00a340m cost to its department stores of matching twice as many discount extravaganzas than in the same period last year. The discounts came as House of Fraser headed towards administration last month before being rescued by Sports Direct while Debenhams struggle for survival as shoppers switched to buying online. John Lewis\u2019s department stores slumped to a \u00a319.3m first-half loss compared with a \u00a354.4m profit a year before as it invested in IT systems and new stores alongside price cuts. Sales rose 0.8% to \u00a32bn. Mayfield said that despite the hit to profits from matching discounts \u2013 especially in fashion and beauty \u2013 the company would be sticking with its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d pledge. \u201cIn terms of trust it is extremely valuable,\u201d he said. Waitrose profits were also down, falling 12.2% to \u00a396.4m in the first half despite a 2.1% rise in sales to \u00a33.4bn. Mayfield said the supermarket chain expected a rise in profits for the full year as rejigs of its product ranges, including new breads and cheeses, brought in more shoppers. The supermarket also enjoyed a 23% rise in online grocery sales and said it expected to continue to increase profits from the home delivery service. Mayfield, who came under fire from Brexit minister Dominic Raab for using Britain\u2019s planned EU exit as an excuse for poor trading, denied he had blamed Brexit for John Lewis\u2019s troubles. But Mayfield saidthat the weakness of the pound, which dived in value after the Brexit vote, had increased costs for the business. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually say that Brexit is to blame for our results. But the fact is that sterling is weaker and one of the factors in that is uncertainty,\u201d he said. Earlier Mayfield told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he hoped not to see a no-deal Brexit: \u201cThat would be a very bad outcome for the UK and the consequences are extremely unpredictable.\u201d He made clear that it wasn\u2019t possible for Waitrose to stockpile goods to prepare for any interruption in food deliveries from the EU caused by a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIt rots, and you waste it,\u201d he said. However, he indicated that John Lewis was keeping a tight control on costs and hoarding cash, giving it the \u201chighest liquidity position in a long time\u201d so it had the resources available to cope with any \u201ctight squeeze\u201d. Mayfield said the group was looking at all areas where it could strip back costs but said he was not expecting to make \u201clarge scale job cuts\u201d after more than 1,800 redundancies last year. Despite rumours that John Lewis has spent \u00a35m on hiring Elton John for its Christmas ad campaign this year, Mayfield said the department store had not spent \u201ca penny more\u201d than last year on its advertising. He later told reporters: \u201cWe are not sitting back feeling sorry for ourselves, we are getting on and developing our business. \u201cWe are setting out to sow the seeds of success in difficult times. We have done that before and I think we are going to do that again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s our news story on Turkey\u2019s blockbuster interest rate hike Good night! GW In the City, the FTSE 100 index of top shares has ended the day down 0.4% at 7,281 points, a drop of 31 points. Time for a quick recap. Turkey\u2019s central bank has defied political pressure and unleashed a huge interest rate hike. Borrowing costs have been raised to 24%, from 17.75%, just hours after president Erdo\u011fan demanded lower interest rates. The news sent the lira soaring, as traders welcomed this show of strength by the Central Bank of Turkey. The Bank of England was rather less dramatic, voting to leave UK interest rates at their current rate of 0.75%. The BoE also warned that Brexit uncertainty is becoming a more significant problem for companies. The European Central Bank trimmed its growth forecasts, and flagged up that protectionism and emerging market turbulence is a growing threat. It still plans to freeze its bond-buying stimulus programme in December, though. Moody\u2019s, the rating agency, has warned that a No-Deal Brexit would hurt the UK, possibly pushing it into recession. Moody\u2019s also said automotive, airlines, aerospace and chemical-making companies would be worst hit. John Lewis has seen its profits evaporate in the last six months, plunging by almost 99% to \u00a31.2m. It blamed tough competition, adding that Brexit uncertainty made forecasting future prospect difficult. Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary hit back, saying businesses should stop blaming the EU exit for their own problems. Dominic Raab\u2019s comments may not help smooth relations between Westminster and UK Plc, as business leaders fret about a cliff-edge Brexit..... Just in: president Trump has claimed that China\u2019s markets are \u201ccollapsing\u201d, as he denies feeling pressure to reach a trade deal. He\u2019s not right -- China\u2019s stock market did hit 31-month lows this week, but it\u2019s not entirely given up the ghost. And if it had, it would be bad news for the entire global economy, not a reason to brag. Agathe Demarais, Turkey analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says today\u2019s Turkish interest rate hike is a \u201cwelcome signal\u201d. However, it won\u2019t fix all Turkey\u2019s economic challenges. Here\u2019s her take: \u201cThe Turkish central bank hiked rates by a whopping 625 basis point, to 24%. In doing so the central bank aims at sending a clear signal of independence and credibility to international financial markets. It also signals that normalising monetary policy conditions is a higher priority than propping up fast decelerating economic growth in the wake of the August currency crisis.\u201d \u201cThe rate hike is a welcome signal for international financial markets. In addition, the recent sharp depreciation of the lira means that previously high external imbalances are quickly narrowing, which should have a positive impact on the Turkish currency.\u201d \u201cHowever, the lira will remain under pressure in the coming months owing to tightening global liquidity conditions and tensions between Turkey and the US. In addition, Turkish corporates remain highly indebted in foreign currency, which means that the local currency value of their debt repayments has spiked over the last few weeks. Some corporates might experience issues in repaying their external debt in the coming months, which will weigh on economic growth.\u201d Back in the markets, the American dollar has fallen after today\u2019s US inflation data was weaker than expected. That\u2019s giving a range of battered emerging market currencies some relief, with the Turkish lira leading the charge. The pound is also benefitting, rising by 0.5% to $1.311. Get in touch.... Asked about Italy\u2019s populist government, Draghi insists firmly that several Italian ministers have pledged to stick with EU budget rules. He also doesn\u2019t see signs of contagion from Italy to other eurozone countries. Good point! Draghi wasn\u2019t ECB back then, of course. Q: What do you think of Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s proposal to make the euro a reserve currency, challenging the US dollar? Draghi says he is interested to see more details on the proposals, and is ready to work with the Commission on their plans. Q: Looking back a decade ago, what did you learn from the Lehman Brothers collapse? Draghi says the financial crisis actually began earlier than 2008. The first serious signs of a crisis date back to September 2007 [the month in which the credit crunch blew up, claiming Northern Rock]. Looking back, Draghi cited the \u201cextraordinary cooperation\u201d and \u201cunprecedented international effort\u201d between countries to tackle the global crisis. Draghi adds that while measure have been taken to make finance safer, risks have moved from the financial sector to the world of shadow banking. Q: How much of a threat are the problems in emerging markets to the eurozone, and the world economy, and is it due to US monetary policy? Draghi says the spillovers from Turkey and Argentina have \u201cnot been substantial\u201d. The countries most vulnerable are those with the weakest economic fundamentals, he adds. Q: The ECB\u2019s new forecasts show inflation hovering around 1.7% in the next few years - is that consistent with your mandate? Yes, it\u2019s consistent with the mandate, says Draghi crisply, reminding reporters that the mandate is to keep inflation \u201cclose to, but below 2%\u201d. As rumoured yesterday, the ECB has trimmed its growth forecasts. It now expects GDP to only increase by 2% this year (down from 2.1%) and by 1.8% next year (down from 1.9%). It\u2019s inflation forecasts are unchanged, though. Back in Frankfurt, Mario Draghi has warned that risks from protectionism, and emerging market volatility, have risen. But still, he argues that the risks to the euro area growth outlook are \u201cbroadly balanced\u201d. Just in: US inflation rose by less than expected last month. Prices only increased by 0.2%, compared to forecasts of 0.3%. That pulled the annual inflation rate down at 2.7%, versus expectations of 2.8%, down from 2.9% in July. Over in Frankfurt, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is giving his press conference. He confirms that the ECB left interest rates unchanged, and intents to leave them at their present record lows until at least next summer. Draghi also confirms that the ECB expects to stop buying new bonds through its asset purchase scheme after December, but will keep re-investing the proceeds from the scheme \u201cfor an extended period of time\u201d, and as long as needed to maintain \u201cfavourable liquidity conditions\u201d and \u201can ample degree of monetary accommodation\u201d. Paul Greer, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, says the Turkish central bank should have acted sooner to raise rates and strengthen the lira. However, he also fears today\u2019s rate hike will drive the economy into recession. \u201cGoing forward the focus will now fall on Turkish growth which is slowing very quickly as the economy, and the current account deficit in particular, rebalances. Today\u2019s move, while helping to moderate inflationary pressures, will accelerate the slowdown and probably push Turkey into a recession. The next challenge for Turkey will be how does the economy deal with this slowdown, particularly in the banking sector where capital ratios have been eroded and asset quality will further diminish. Relief that Turkey\u2019s central bank has delivered such a chunky interest rate hike is driving shares up in Istanbul. The benchmark BIST 100 index has gained 1.5%, as trader express optimism that Turkish inflation could be tamed. Now it\u2019s the European Central Bank\u2019s turn. The ECB has left its interest rates at current record lows, meaning the headline cost of borrowing sticks at just zero. The governing council has also confirmed that it will halve the pace of its stimulus programme in October, to \u20ac15bn per month of bonds per month, ending it in December. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Turkey\u2019s interest rate hike is a show of strength from the country\u2019s central bank, in the face of political pressure: It represents a major and important reassertion of the central bank\u2019s independence and shows they will not be bullied by politicians, although to a large degree its hand was forced by the 18% print on August inflation. There was also a commitment to do more if necessary and that will be regarded as a sign that policymakers are serious, although it\u2019s maybe a tad short of being a \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 type commitment \u2013 indeed the move on the lira only takes it back to where it was at the end of August. The Turkish lira has been through a roller-coaster ride today: BOOM! The Turkish central bank has announced a massive increase in borrowing costs. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has hiked its benchmark interest rate to a blistering 24%, up from 17.75%. The CBRT said it was acting to bring price stability under control, after seeing inflation hit 17.9% last month. It also vowed to impose further monetary tightening if needed. This news has sent the lira surging against the US dollar, jumping to 6.1 lira to $1, from 6.5 earlier today. This is a real show of independence by the central bank, given Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s demands for rates to be cut (see earlier post). How will the Turkish president respond?... The Bank of England is also worried by the rising risks of a full-blown trade war, and its impact on emerging markets. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee say:: The global economy still appears to be growing at above-trend rates, although recent developments are likely to have increased downside risks around global growth to some degree. In emerging market economies, indicators of growth have continued to soften and financial conditions have tightened further, in some cases markedly. Recent announcements of further protectionist measures by the United States and China, if implemented, could have a somewhat more negative impact on global growth than was anticipated at the time of the August Report. The Bank of England has warned that uncertainty over Brexit has risen recently. The Bank\u2019s regional agents have detected that UK businesses are more worried, which chimes with other economic data -- and also fits with today\u2019s warning from Moody\u2019s. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting say: Most indicators of exports and investment intentions had held up in recent months, although there had been a sharp fall in the IHS Markit/CIPS goods export orders index in August. Some respondents to that survey, and the associated equivalents for the service and construction sectors, had noted uncertainty around the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. And reports from the Bank\u2019s Agents had also suggested that companies were becoming more uncertain about the economic outlook and were considering their Brexit contingency plans more carefully. Only a small minority of companies had started to implement plans such as increasing stocks of components imported from the European Union or reassessing their transport and logistics arrangements. It would be important to monitor closely such developments, and their possible impact on broader economic indicators, over coming months Newsflash: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates on hold at 0.75%. It has also left its quantitative easing programme unchanged. Hold onto your hats.. we\u2019re about to get the Turkish and UK interest rate decisions... Over in Turkey, president Erdo\u011fan has made an astonishing intervention ahead of today\u2019s interest rate decision. Erdo\u011fan attacked the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, saying it had failed to bring down inflation (which hit a 15-year high last month). Erdo\u011fans says: \u201cAs of today I have not seen the central bank fix inflation rates as they promised.\u201d And he then repeats his argument that higher interest rates cause inflation, rather than curbing it (as conventional economics has it). Damning interest rates as a \u201ctool of exploitation\u201d, the president says: \u201cInterest rates are the cause, inflation is the result. If you say \u2018inflation is cause, the rate is the result\u2019, you do not know this business, friend,\u201d These comments have sent the lira slumping against the US dollar, as traders worry that Turkey\u2019s central bank might not raise interest rates today after all... Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been spotted leaving Downing Street, where he must have been attending today\u2019s cabinet meeting to discuss a no-deal. You may wonder how Carney can also be setting UK interest rates... but actually the BoE voted yesterday. Here\u2019s the full quote from John Lewis chairman Charlie Mayfield, as he refuses to get into a verbal punch-up with Dominic Raab: \u201cThis whole thing is so frothy. I didn\u2019t say Brexit was the reason for our result. The fact is sterling is weaker, it\u2019s more expensive to import goods... so we have to absorb that within our margin. I\u2019m not going to get into some sort of ding-dong with the secretary of state for all things EU.\u201d Here\u2019s our guide to what\u2019s gone wrong at John Lewis: John Lewis chairman Charlie Mayfield has held a conference call with journalists to discuss its plunge in profits. He\u2019s declined to get into a war of words with Dominic Raab over the \u2018blaming Brexit\u2019 row. Instead, he\u2019s revealed quite how tough the last few months have been, with JL\u2019s department stores making their first half-year loss in at least 10 years. Moody\u2019s chief credit officer for Europe, Colin Ellis, is concerned that the risks of a no-deal Brexit have risen. He says: \u201cWe still think the UK and the EU will eventually reach an agreement to preserve many - but not all - of their current trading arrangements, particularly around trade in goods. However, we believe the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without any agreement has risen materially. \u201cThe precise impact of a \u2018no deal\u2019 outcome is impossible to define because both the UK and the EU would likely take swift steps to limit short-term disruption. But it would clearly pose more significant credit challenges than a negotiated exit.\u201d Breaking: Credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned that Britain\u2019s economy would suffer significant harm if the country leaves the EU without a deal. In awkward timing for Dominic Raab, Moody\u2019s warns that many companies would be hurt, hinting it could slash their credit rating. The agency also predicts that the pound would plunge -- which would drive inflation up and create even more pain for retailers such as John Lewis. A Hard Brexit could also drag the country into recession, it adds. Here are the key points from today\u2019s Moody\u2019s report: UK Sovereign: It would damage the UK\u2019s economic, fiscal and institutional strength. The immediate impact would likely be seen first in a sharp fall in the value of the British pound, leading to temporarily higher inflation and a squeeze on real wages over the two or three years following Brexit. This in turn would weigh on consumer spending and depress growth, with a risk of the UK entering recession. EU Sovereigns: EU countries including Ireland, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Malta could experience negative consequences, particularly in areas such as trade. Corporates: In the UK, it would be significantly credit negative for a number of sectors due to factors such as tariffs, the weaker pound and regulatory changes. The most severely affected sectors would be automotive, airlines, aerospace and chemicals. Later today the government will publish new impact papers outlining the impact on the UK if a Brexit deal isn\u2019t reached, including the impact on driving licences, passports and phone bills. Our Politics live blog will be tracking all the details: Financial blogger Lotty Burns has more sympathy than Dominic Raab for John Lewis\u2019s predicament: European credit analyst Tomas Hirst suggests Dominic Raab should resist the temptation to put the boot into British businesses -- as the weak pound is causing real problems for importers. Here\u2019s a video clip of Dominic Raab criticising businesses who are \u201ctempted to blame Brexit\u201d for disappointing results: Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has launched a stinging attack on John Lewis for daring to suggest that Brexit uncertainty is hurting. Asked on the Today Programme about businesses\u2019s concerns about the Brexit negotiations, Raab insisted that Britain\u2019s economy was a sunny place: \u201cIt\u2019s probably rather easy at this moment in time for any business which isn\u2019t doing rather well to point to Brexit. But let me just give you the facts. This week we\u2019ve had economic growth accelerating, we\u2019ve had real wages accelerating\u2026 Q: But growth is still the lowest in the G7... Raab interjects: We\u2019ve had Anglo-Dutch firm Relx revise its structure to be based in the UK. Q: But John Lewis says the fall in sterling has created inflationary pressures, which has pushed their prices up. Raab take another swing at grumbling retailers, declaring: Actually inflation has come down to 2.5%, some people said it would hit 4% I don\u2019t doubt that uncertainty around these negotiations will have an impact on business. That\u2019s why we are putting all our energy into getting the good deal that we want with our EU friends and partners, while making sure we manage the risks if it doesn\u2019t happen. All I\u2019m gently saying it\u2019s rather easy for a business to blame Brexit and the politicians rather than taking responsibility for their own situation. I\u2019m sure John Lewis would argue they are taking responsibility, with plans to invest up to \u00a3500m in the business. Also, if Raab actually reads the JL statement, he\u2019ll see they blame tough competition and investment costs rather than Brexit.... John Lewis\u2019s chairman, Charlie Mayfield, told the Today Programme that cost inflation has surged due to the weak pound (which is still 13% below its pre-referendum levels). He also warned that Waitrose wouldn\u2019t simply be able to stockpile all its food after Britain leaves the EU, explaining: \u201cThe thing about stockpiling food (for Waitrose) is the stuff that\u2019s most sensitive to these things is actually perishable, so you can\u2019t really stockpile it, it rots, and you waste it. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re looking at all our import and export arrangements and so that we\u2019re prepared as we can be. Mayfield also warned that: \u201cThe other thing is we\u2019re making sure the business is financially sound so we have the highest liquidity position in a long time, in terms of having cash and resources available because there\u2019s so much uncertainty and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, you don\u2019t want to find yourself in a tight squeeze. \u201cI really hope it won\u2019t (be a no-deal Brexit). I\u2019ve said before that would be a very bad outcome for the UK and the consequences are extremely unpredictable. John Lewis Partnership chairman Charlie Mayfield has taken to the airwaves with a rallying cry to staff and customers. Mayfield told BBC Radio that JLP won\u2019t be \u201cnot hunkering\u201d, even though UK retail is pretty tough today. \u201cYou don\u2019t succeed by retrenching so if anything we are investing more and pushing on with differentiation,. The simple truth is that times like these call for cool heads and really determined ambition.\u201d John Lewis also warns that profits in the second half of the financial year (to the end of January 2019) will be sharply lower than a year ago. It says: With the level of uncertainty facing consumers and the economy, in part due to ongoing Brexit negotiations, forecasting is particularly difficult but we continue to expect full year profits to be substantially lower than last year for the Partnership as a whole. We expect profit growth in Waitrose &amp; Partners will be offset by the continuing margin pressure in John Lewis &amp; Partners and by incremental costs of investment. John Lewis says its department stores suffered from falling demand for \u201cbig ticket and bespoke items\u201d, as consumers cut back. This dragged sales at its \u201cHome\u201d division down by 4.2%. Fashion sales rose by 1.2%, though, due to higher demand for womenswear, while sales of electrical items and technology jumped by 7.8%. Here\u2019s the top line from John Lewis today: John Lewis\u2019s pledge to match other retailers\u2019 prices has also hit its bottom line this year. The company says the plunge in profits... ...reflects our decision not to pass on to our customers all cost price inflation from a weaker exchange rate and from our Never Knowingly Undersold promise, where we have seen an unprecedented level of price matching as other retailers have discounted heavily. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the John Lewis figures: Breaking: the John Lewis Partnership has seen its profits all-but wiped out in the last six months. The group, which owns Waitrose and the John Lewis department stores, has reported a 99% slump in pre-tax profits (before exceptional items) to just \u00a31.2m in the first half of the year. That\u2019s down from aroud \u00a383m a year earlier. It blames the tough retail conditions, saying profitability has been eroded by \u201cthe most promotional market we\u2019ve seen in almost a decade\u201d. That means discounting, as retailers have struggled to get shoppers to part with their money. The costs of new shops and higher IT spending also ate into profits. Showing a gift for understatement, chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield, adds: \u201cThese are challenging times in retail. Our profits before exceptionals are in line with what we said they would be at our Strategy Update in June. We\u2019re continuing to improve our offer for customers while ensuring we have the financial strength to continue developing our business going forward. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a huuuuge day for central bank news. Policymakers at the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Turkey are all meeting today to set monetary policy, and potentially unleash a few fireworks too. Having raised interest rates to 0.75% last month, the BoE isn\u2019t likely to do it again today. But it may drop some hints about when the next rate hike may come. We may also get an update on the Bank\u2019s views on Brexit, now that governor Mark Carney has agreed to extend his term until January 2020. The European Central Bank won\u2019t be raising interest rates today either. But it will be downgrading its growth forecast for the region, according to a leak yesterday. That could make for an awkward meeting today, as the ECB recently agreed to end its stimulus programme in December. And what about Turkey? With inflation sizzling, and its currency crashing to record lows last month, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has every excuse to hike borrowing costs substantially. However, there are political ramifications - president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is a strident opponent of high interest rates. So today\u2019s meeting is real test of the CBRT\u2019s independence. On balance, traders expect a sharp rise in Turkey\u2019s benchmark rates, from 17.75% to perhaps 21%. That would make life a lot tougher for borrowers, but could also strengthen the ailing lira. Kathleen Brooks, research director at Capital Index, says there is a lot resting on today\u2019s decision. A rate rise would be symbolic for the global financial community. One reason why the lira fell so sharply over the summer was partly due to fears about the political atmosphere and President Erdogan taking control of the central bank for his own economic benefit. He spoke out vociferously against rate hikes, saying that higher interest rates did not dampen inflation, which goes against traditional economic theory. He also placed his son-in-law in the finance ministry, both things spooked investors\u2019 and triggered the Turkish financial market crisis. If the CBRT can revert back to traditional economic methods for deciding policy, without Presidential interference, then global investors may regain confidence in the economic management of the country and return to its financial markets. It\u2019s also a big day for Britain\u2019s struggling retail sector, with John Lewis and Morrison\u2019s reporting results.

With inflation sizzling, and its currency crashing to record lows last month, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has every excuse to hike borrowing costs substantially.

      "bodyText": "Turkey\u2018s central bank has raised its key interest rate to 24% in a dramatic bid to control rocketing inflation and prevent a currency crisis. Ignoring calls for restraint from President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the bank raised its main short-term rate from 17.5% following weeks of pressure from international investors. Financial markets have grown increasingly concerned that Turkey is in danger of adding its name to the list of countries seeking a rescue loan from the International Monetary Fund. Argentina agreed a loan earlier in the summer with the IMF and only last month called on the Washington-based lender to release the funds earlier to to ease concerns that the country would not be able to meet its debt obligations over the next year. South Africa, Indonesia and Mexico are also among a group of emerging market economies that have seen their currencies tumble as investors desert countries that have grown quickly using large amounts of borrowed funds. The Turkish lira began to recover shortly after the rate hike, strengthening by 3% to 6.16 against the dollar. Inflation also soared this month to a 15-year high of almost 18%. The currency has plunged in recent months and even after Thursday\u2019s rise was down almost 39% against the dollar this year. Investors have focused their concerns on Ankara following Erdo\u011fan\u2019s re-election and his grab for control of the country\u2019s economy. The leader placed his son-in-law as head of the finance ministry and in a separate move has attempted to take control of the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. A growing crisis became acute earlier this year following the detention of an American pastor on espionage and terror-related charges, which prompted Donald Trump to double the import tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium. The central bank\u2019s interest rate hike, which surprised investors with its magnitude, comes amid growing concerns that Erdo\u011fan is pursuing policies that will eventually bankrupt the country. Erdo\u011fan has long been pressuring the bank to keep interest rates low to encourage economic growth. Growth slowed to an annual rate of 5.2% in the second quarter, from the first quarter\u2019s 7.4%. Addressing a meeting of Turkish tradespeople in Ankara on Thursday, before the rate decision was announced, Erdo\u011fan said the central bank is independent and takes its own decisions. He repeated however, his belief that interest rates should be cut, calling them an \u201cinstrument for exploitation\u201d. \u201cMy sensitivities concerning interest rates are the same, nothing has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m saying let\u2019s cut these high interest rates.\u201d He criticised the central bank, saying it had consistently miscalculated inflation targets and again portrayed the currency crisis as a foreign conspiracy. In a bid to shore up the Turkish lira, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government issued a decree on Thursday banning the use of foreign currency in the sale and renting of property and the leasing of vehicles. In a statement, the central bank noted that the local economy was weakening while inflation was rising. The rate hike could squeeze growth further, but independent experts say it is needed to contain inflation of about 18% and support the currency. \u201cThe central bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective,\u201d the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee said in a statement. \u201cTight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.\u201d",

Failure to agree a deal with Brussels \u2013 which has become increasingly likely as Theresa May faces the threat of rebellion from eurosceptic Conservative MPs \u2013 would lead to a sharp fall in the value of the pound, triggering higher inflation and a squeeze on real wages lasting for as long as three years, it warned. Outlining widespread potential damage for the economy, similar to warnings made ahead of the Brexit vote, the ratings agency said the squeeze on household finances from a spike in inflation would have the knock-on effect of lowering consumer spending. This would depress economic growth, potentially tipping the country into recession. Moody\u2019s said a no-deal scenario would be \u201ccredit negative\u201d for businesses in a wide range of industrial sectors, including car manufacturers, airlines, aerospace firms and the chemicals industry. Large companies rely on strong credit ratings from agencies like Moody\u2019s, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Fitch, which assess the ability of nations and businesses to repay their debts. Higher credit scores from these organisations enable these groups to borrow money for less on the international financial markets, giving a reasonable indication to investors they are able to repay their debts. The banking industry could also see its credit strength deteriorate, while Transport for London would face the threat of lower passenger numbers affecting income due to a fall in migration, lower employment and a weaker economy. Universities may also struggle to attract staff and students, Moody\u2019s added. The capital\u2019s transport authority said earlier this year it was facing a \u00a31bn deficit from a surprise fall in passenger numbers. While there would be widespread negative consequences for Britain from crashing out without a deal, Moody\u2019s said such a scenario would also affect other EU countries with close trading links to the UK. Those in close proximity such as Ireland and the Netherlands would be affected, as well as nations with historical ties to Britain such as Cyprus and Malta. The ratings agency said it was not a foregone conclusion that Britain\u2019s creditworthiness would be damaged by a no-deal Brexit, should the government take sufficient steps to cushion the blow from leaving without a deal. Colin Ellis, Moody\u2019s chief credit officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said it would be impossible to fully assess the impact of no-deal Brexit, although he warned: \u201cIt would clearly pose more significant credit challenges than a negotiated exit.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s energy watchdog has warned there is a risk of oil prices spiralling higher in the coming months, posing extra costs for drivers and a dilemma for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he looks to raise fuel duty. Recent crude prices of $70-$80 a barrel could be tested by the prospect of oil exports from Venezuela and Iran declining, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. \u201cWe are entering a very crucial period for the oil market\u2026. Things are tightening up.\u201d The IEA warning will be unwelcome news for motorists who have already been hit by a series of rises that have taken petrol and diesel prices to four-year highs. In August, the average price for a litre of petrol was 129.67p and 132.33p for diesel, owing to increases in oil prices and a weakened pound. Simon Williams of the RAC said: \u201cFuel prices are teetering on the brink. If oil supply gets any tighter or the pound gets any weaker against the dollar we could see the price of a litre of fuel climb to very unwelcome heights \u2013 potentially close to the record highs of 2012.\u2019\u201d The prospect of higher prices at forecourts also creates a problem for Hammond, who is considering raising fuel duty in the budget to increase public spending. The tax has been frozen since 2011. The chancellor is already facing criticism from Conservative MPs and motoring groups for hinting that a rise is coming. \u201cI do understand that the rise in oil prices and the feed-through that has had to the pump does represent a very real pressure for the motorist, which we will take into account,\u201d he said this week. But Hammond told MPs that while the fuel duty freeze had saved motorists money, it was necessary to look at \u201cthe other side of this coin\u201d because the Treasury had missed out on \u00a346bn in lost revenue as a result. The IEA said supply problems in Venezuela and Libya, and the impact on Iran from further US sanctions could cancel out oil cartel Opec\u2019s drive to increase production and ease prices. \u201cIf Venezuelan and Iranian exports do continue to fall, markets could tighten and oil prices could rise without offsetting production increases from elsewhere,\u201d the group said. The main oil-producing countries have begun pumping more crude after an agreement in June to raise production, the IEA found, with global output hitting a record level of 100m barrels a day in August. The international benchmark for oil prices, Brent crude, was trading at $78 a barrel on Thursday. Oil market observers at HSBC said this week that the possibility of $100 a barrel was \u201cnot out of the question, given the increasing lack of global spare capacity\u201d. Analysts at UBS bank said $100 prices would push up global inflation to 4% compared with 3% at lower prices.",

Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, accused the government of \u201cfailing to find a voice\u201d in discussions about compensation for British boats that are prevented from harvesting in a disputed territory during a period when the French are banned under domestic law. It was announced on Wednesday that the talks had ended without a deal, risking a return to recent skirmishes in the Baie de Seine, north of Normandy, with the French navy on standby to prevent further clashes. George Eustice, the fisheries minister, has written to the French government to suggest reverting to an agreement previously in place for boats over 15 metres, which he said would be preferable to no agreement at all.

About 35 French boats confronted five British vessels more than 12 miles off the Normandy coast, with stones thrown and craft rammed as they tried to protect stocks of shellfish. Under EU law, large British boats are not allowed to fish within 12 miles of the French coast, but smaller vessels can dredge for scallops in the 40-mile stretch of international waters known as the Baie de Seine, while the French have access only from November to February.",

      "bodyText": "British Airways has offloaded \u00a34.4bn in pension liabilities to an insurance company in a bid to cap its pension responsibilities. Legal &amp; General will effectively take over the liabilities for 22,000 British Airways pensioners in the largest deal of its kind in the UK. The aim of the \u201cbulk annuity\u201d deal is to protect British Airways from higher pension costs in future, which could happen because of poor investment returns or unexpected increases in life expectancy. For years, British Airways has struggled to shed its reputation as a company with a huge and costly pension scheme with an airline attached. Shares in its parent company, IAG, were up nearly 0.5% on Thursday morning, its first rise since a calamitous data breach sent shares diving last week. The BA pensioners affected are in the Airways Pension Scheme (APS) which, according to the 2017 annual report, had total liabilities of \u00a37.7bn. Virginia Holmes, chair of the trustee board for APS, said the deal would reduce risk and increase security for members. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the culmination of much hard work undertaken over several months and we are pleased to be taking this step in the scheme\u2019s de-risking journey,\u201d she said. The airline\u2019s largest defined-benefit scheme, New Airways Pension Scheme, had liabilities of \u00a319.8bn and a deficit of \u00a33.7bn, according to that scheme\u2019s annual report. The BA deal is the latest in a string of bulk annuity transactions that have involved insurers take on partial responsibility for pensions at companies including EMI, Boots, Littlewoods, National Grid, M&amp;S and WPP. Nigel Wilson, L&amp;G chief executive, said further transactions are planned in the next few months to remove legacy liabilities. \u201cThe second half of 2018 is likely to be a record six months for our PRT [pensions risk transfer] business,\u201d he said. The BA deal comes as the airline continues to battle with the fallout from the theft of 380,000 customers\u2019 details by hackers last week. Cyber security firm RiskIQ said it had found 22 lines of code injected in the BA website by the hacker group Magecart which could have been the cause of the breach, and which was similar to the attack on Ticketmaster\u2019s website earlier this year. Class action law firms are seeking BA customers affected by the breach, saying they could be in line for up to \u00a31,250 in compensation even if they have not suffered a direct financial loss. Your Lawyers, a consumer rights law firm, says the compensation would be for the distress BA customers may have experienced. \u201cCrucially, this is on top of any compensation customers may receive from British Airways as a result of stolen money,\u201d it said. Your Lawyers is collaborating with SPG, the British arm of a US law firm, to launch a no-win, no-fee case against the airline that, according to reports, could seek payouts of up to \u00a3500m.",

So what has gone wrong at the high street stalwart? 1. The \u2018never knowingly undersold\u2019 pledge The group\u2019s fabled pledge forces it to cut prices to match those of competitors, which have embarked on the highest level of discounting in almost 10 years. The John Lewis chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe biggest single reason for the decline in profits is all about margin. This year there has been twice as many extravaganza days as there were a year ago and actually the discounts have been even deeper.\u201d 2. Surging costs due to weaker pound Mayfield also blamed a rise in the cost of buying goods overseas due to the weak pound, which is still 13% below its levels before the Brexit referendum. 3. High street malaise and Brexit uncertainty John Lewis says its department stores suffered from falling demand for \u201cbig ticket and bespoke items\u201d, as consumers cut back on non-essential spending. Its woes reflect those of the rest of the high street, which has been hit by business failures, mass store closures and tens of thousands of job losses this year. Consumers have been reluctant to spend, with wages struggling to keep up with inflation and growing fears of a no-deal Brexit. Despite a recent pickup in pay growth, weekly wages are still lower than before the financial crisis in 2008. The slowdown in the housing market and a shift towards renting has also meant less demand for large homewares such as sofas and washing machines. The summer heatwave and the World Cup provided a temporary boost to some chains, though. 4. Shift to online shopping High street retailers have to adjust to a world where consumers prefer the convenience of doing their shopping online, from food to clothes. The shift has not only meant that fewer shoppers bother to visit physical stores but also required traditional retailers to invest millions of pounds in new IT systems and distribution facilities for home deliveries. 5. The decline of department stores Other department store chains are also in trouble \u2013 namely House of Fraser and Debenhams, while BHS collapsed two years ago. Retail experts say some department stores have not changed in 10 or 20 years, failing to spruce up shop floors and product ranges. The advent of online shopping has eroded department stores\u2019 main selling point of offering different brands under the same roof. The ability to compare prices of branded items online in seconds has also ramped up price competition between different operators.",

      "bodyText": "Brussels has redoubled efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing with proposals to give the European Banking Authority (EBA) a powerful new mandate to impose sanctions directly on the banks of member states. A series of measuresthat would make Europe\u2019s banking supervisor the ultimate arbiter in the most serious cross-border money-laundering cases were announced to coincide with the European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s annual state of the union speech on Wednesday. Europe is under pressure to respond following a series of recent scandals including the collapse of ABLV Bank in Latvia and the freezing of assets at Pilatus Bank in Malta following allegations of sanctions busting by its Iranian owner. Investigations such as the Panama Papers and the Global Laundromat series, which revealed the movement of $21bn (\u00a316bn) in dirty funds from Russia, have underlined how poor supervision by member states and a lack of cross-border cooperation between law enforcement agencies is allowing money to flow from countries with high levels of corruption into Europe. \u201cAnti-money laundering supervision has failed all too often in the EU,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president for financial services policy at the commission. He said enhancing the powers of the EBA would ensure \u201cdifferent supervisors cooperate and exchange information and that anti-money laundering rules are enforced effectively across EU countries\u201d. The proposals, which must be agreed by member states and the European parliament, would be fast tracked by amending existing legislation. The EBA would be able to order national regulators to investigate breaches and specify remedies such as sanctions. If national regulators failed to act, the commission explained in a memo on Wednesday, the EBA would have the power to step in \u201cto address decisions directly\u201d to banks. The EBA\u2019s head office is in London, but it will relocate to Paris after Britain leaves the EU in March. The agency would be asked to act as a data hub, collecting information on money-laundering risks and trends and fostering exchange of information between national authorities. It would also facilitate cooperation with non-EU countries in cross-border cases. The commission wants a new, permanent committee to bring together national anti-money laundering supervisors. \u201cSeveral recent cases of money laundering in European banks have given rise to concerns that gaps remain in the union\u2019s supervisory framework,\u201d the commission said in its briefing. It also highlighted \u201cdelayed supervisory reactions and shortcomings with respect to cooperation and information sharing\u201d both at domestic level, between prudential and anti-money laundering authorities, and across borders between authorities in different member states or countries outside of Europe. Members of the European parliament have been calling for the creation of a single cross-border agency to step in when national regulators fail to police their banks. Concerns about regulatory failings have not been limited to smaller member states. In September, an investigation commissioned by Denmark\u2019s largest bank found $30bn of Russian and other former Soviet bloc money was pumped through its Estonian branch in a single year. The MEP Molly Scott Cato, a member of the economic and monetary affairs committee, welcomed the proposals. \u201cWe need this proposal to be brought into law urgently \u2013 and certainly during this parliamentary mandate \u2013 to protect the integrity of the European financial system,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "The financial crisis has had a lasting impact on the UK economy and people\u2019s incomes, with annual wages still \u00a3760 lower than they were a decade ago , according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The institute\u2019s analysis shows median annual earnings fell to \u00a323,327 last year, 3.2% lower than in 2008 when the average wage was \u00a324,088. People in their 20s and 30s have taken the biggest hit. Those aged 30 to 39 have seen their earnings fall by 7.2% to an average of \u00a326,442, while those aged 22 to 29 have suffered a 4.6% cut to \u00a321,408. People in their 60s have had the smallest impact on their earnings, which at \u00a318,637 are just \u00a3129 lower than they were in 2008, a dip of 0.7%. Those in their 50s took a 1.8% cut to \u00a325,069. The IFS said that had incomes continued to grow at the same rate as the decade before the crash, the average household income would now be \u00a329,900, \u00a34,200 higher than it is. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThis dramatic slump in the wages of workers shows the disastrous impact of nearly a decade of austerity on living standards, with people massively losing out during the years of Tory rule.\u201d He added: \u201cThe next Labour government will end austerity and introduce a real living wage to stop the fall in real wages for workers.\u201d The institute calculated that the UK economy is 16%, or \u00a3300bn, smaller than it would have been had it followed the pre-crisis trend. As a result, GDP a head is \u00a35,900 lower than it might have been. The IFS said what has proved most remarkable about the crisis and recession was not its initial scale but the persistence of its effects. It says: \u201cWhile the economy has been growing for eight years now, it has been growing only slowly by historic standards. While the government\u2019s deficit, which ballooned to record levels by 2010, is now relatively low, public debt is double its pre-crisis level relative to the size of the economy.\u201d It was currently about \u00a31 tn higher than it was. Jonathan Cribb, a senior research economist at the IFS, and Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, talked of an \u201castonishing decade\u201d. \u201cThe UK economy has broken record after record, and not generally in a good way: record low earnings growth, record low interest rates, record low productivity growth, record public borrowing followed by record cuts in public spending,\u201d they said. \u201cOn the upside, employment levels are remarkably high and, in spite of how it may feel, the gap between rich and poor has actually narrowed somewhat, but the gap between old and young has grown and grown.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Adani has ditched plans to build a new rail line from Abbot Point to get coal out of Queensland\u2019s Galilee Basin, opting for a cut-price solution using existing lines. The Indian miner had planned to build a new 388km line from its controversial Carmichael mine to Abbot Point for export, but now says it will \u201cinstead leverage existing rail infrastructure\u201d. The new proposal will make use of the existing Aurizon rail infrastructure that runs to Abbot Point. A new narrow-gauge rail line of about 200 km would be constructed to connect the existing network to the Carmichael mine site, reducing the length of the track Adani would have to build by 188km, and significantly reducing the cost. Adani\u2019s original proposal was for a 388km standard gauge track that was expected to cost $2.3bn. The move follows the Queensland government\u2019s decision to veto any federal loan to support that aspect of the project. \u201cBy connecting to the existing network we can fast-track project delivery, reduce capital expenditure and deliver coal more quickly to countries in Asia,\u201d Adani Mining\u2019s chief executive, Lucas Dow, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re 100% committed to getting the Carmichael project off the ground.\u201d The company said its Plan B solution would follow the same route, meaning existing approvals and land use agreements could be used. During the 2017 state election campaign, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, stepped in to veto any loan for the rail project from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. Palaszczuk initially said the decision was to avoid the perception of a conflict of interest after it was revealed her then partner, Shaun Drabsch, worked on the loan application with his employer, PricewaterhouseCoopers. She later said it was to meet a 2015 election promise not to allow any taxpayer funds to be spent on the mine. Adani is still trying to drum up the money it needs to fund the mine. Australia\u2019s big four banks have refused to put up money, forcing the company to look for funding overseas. A spokesman for the premier said Adani\u2019s announcement was \u201ca matter for Adani\u201d. \u201cWhat the company does is a matter for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe premier\u2019s consistently said that the project has to stand on its own two feet.\u201d Christian Slattery, stop Adani campaigner for the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the announcement was a signal \u201cthe company is more serious than ever about building its climate-damaging coal mine.\u201d \u201cOur elected representatives can\u2019t keep hiding. We need them to stand beside ordinary Australians, not billionaire mining companies, and put a stop to this proposed coal mine.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not as easy being a brand as it used to be. In the age of social media, intensely partisan consumers are ready to repuporse every piece of news into a salvo in the neverending culture war. One day you\u2019re on top of the world, the next your pizza chain CEO is forced to resign for using the N-word in a media training exercise. That\u2019s before we even get to all the perils of social media, where one errant tweet can create a media maelstrom, or else spark a boycott from either the left, as we\u2019ve seen with Chick-fil-A, or the right, as we\u2019ve seen with Keurig and Nike and the NFL, to name but a fraction. Some brands keep things slow and steady on the other hand. That\u2019s where the Harris Poll\u2019s annual EquiTrend Study comes in. Now in its 30th year, the poll attempts to measure brand health over time across a variety of consumer fields. To do so they judge on three criteria: familiarity, quality and purchase consideration. This year, they say, 77,000 US consumers rated 3,000 brands to crown a winner in each category. The results range from predictable, to surprising, to downright weird. Many of the food categories are all over the map. Favorite coffee shop goes to Krispy Kreme, who apparently serve coffee, while the nation\u2019s favorite Mexican goes to Taco Bell, who apparently serve Mexican food. The California-based pizza chain Blaze Pizza is an upstart, but not necessarily controversial choice, while Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries is a respectable result as well. In a rare tie, Panera and Subway share the top sandwich shop spot, although the poll was probably conducted before Subway just announced the end of their $5 foot long promotion, so those results might not hold next year. Brand loyalty, as the people behind the poll will tell you, can be a fickle thing. Being the biggest player in a particular field isn\u2019t necessarily bulletproof in terms of consumer satisfaction or loyalty anymore it turns out, as the Harris Poll CEO, John Gerzema, explained in a statement. Consumers are more apt to align themselves with quality smaller brands this year. There\u2019s a reason why you see the word \u201ccraft\u201d thrown around so much now after all. \u201cThe EQ study reveals that brand equity is no longer guaranteed by size or media impressions,\u201d Gerzema said. \u201cThis is actually a time when being \u2018big\u2019 is code for being the establishment. As private label and the popularity of craft products rises, brands are now differentiated on their values, personal connection and their ability to build community.\u201d And to not be overtly racist, it probably goes without saying. The trend toward smaller names doesn\u2019t hold steady across all categories. Some of the largest companies maintain their place of primacy, of course. Honda tops the list of full line automotive brands, while The Home Depot takes the honors for hardware and home store. Verizon Wireless is the favored wireless carrier, and Visa is the most trusted way to pay for all of those things. Entertainment options tend toward the familiar as well, with HBO coming in as the top pay television network, ESPN the best for sports and PBS the favored network. But, and here is where things get a little weird, the Weather Channel is the top TV news channel. Considering how the climate has gone crazy of late, a trend that seems unlikely to dissipate, perhaps that makes more sense than it seems at first blush. The only thing more volatile than the climate itself might be the political winds when it comes to brands\u2019 standing in the cultural conversation. But if the results of the poll are any indication, protests online might not be quite as influential as they seem. The top coffee maker of the year was Keurig. The top chicken restaurant?
