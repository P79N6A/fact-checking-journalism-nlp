Bank rate-setter Martin Weale suggested last week that if unemployment is falling rapidly at the point when the 7% threshold is breached, he would regard that as a reason to tighten policy.</p> <p>The details of the data suggested the jobs market has strengthened markedly over the past six months. The number of people employed across the economy has hit a fresh record high above 30 million, while there are more vacancies than at any time since the summer of 2008, before the UK slipped into recession.&#xa0;</p> <p>On the claimant count, which measures the number of people in receipt of out-of-work benefits, the number of people unemployed fell to 1.27 million, its lowest level since January 2009.</p> <p>Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThis is an extremely strong set of labour market data, indicating that unemployment is currently coming down rapidly in reaction to the economy\u2019s markedly improved performance in recent months and much healthier business confidence.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In total, 485,000 new jobs have been created over the past year.</p> <p>Despite the improving conditions in the labour market, there is little evidence that the prolonged squeeze on wages is easing. The ONS said total pay rose at an annual rate of 0.9% in October, or 0.8% including bonuses. That compares with an inflation rate of 2.2% in the same month, suggesting that on average, living standards are continuing to fall.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52b179b8e4b008af53c5c8c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-18T10:39:54.720Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-265b613b-9521-4eb8-9762-5bf4dcf96af2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/18/1387362792169/c3fb0e52-02c5-4726-a8d5-6ac516b581e2-460x255.png\" alt=\"UK unemployment rate\" width=\"460\" height=\"255\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A bit of history - this graph shows how the UK jobless rate climbed sharply in 2009 once Britain tumbled into recession</p> <p>After stabilising in 2010, it&#xa0;rose further in 2011 as the economy stumbled and flirted with a double-dip recession (a time when the government's fiscal consolidation programme was picking up speed),.</p> <p>It has been recovering for most of this year, as the wider economy improved.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52b17aa5e4b008af53c5c8c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-18T10:38:14.735Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>TUC economist Duncan Weldon (a leading voice on the real wage crisis) is tweeting some important points about the unemployment data, including the lack of progress in increasing productivity:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/413243352780259328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Strong labour market data. 3 causes for concern - weak pay, productivity (hours up more than output) &amp; what it means for monetary policy.</p>&mdash; Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/413243352780259328\">December 18, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/413248914863575040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ianjsilvera\">@ianjsilvera</a> productivity and pay are the big concerns.</p>&mdash; Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/413248914863575040\">December 18, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/413253700627349504\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Employment rises will boost Govt&#39;s prefered living standards measure (Real Household Dispos Income) but median incomes still under pressure.</p>&mdash; Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/413253700627349504\">December 18, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52b178ade4b008af53c5c8c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-18T10:28:48.703Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This chart shows the rise in the employment total, and the fall in the jobless count.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-59ccd323-f78c-4419-8e10-765ac98cdee0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/18/1387362517629/b6fa5548-5b97-4b23-bb05-fef65bdfe927-460x315.png\" alt=\"UK unemployment stats\" width=\"460\" height=\"315\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK unemployment stats Photograph: /ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-18T10:32:19.166Z\">at 10.32am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52b17681e4b0a4c35bcc03ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-18T10:26:21.647Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong>, chief UK economist at&#xa0;IHS Global Insight. says today's data shows \"broad, strong improvement\".

      "bodyText": "Here's out story on the Federal Reserve decision to taper economic stimulus on heels of strong jobs growth Here's a closing summary. Britain's economic recovery continues as the country's unemployment rate slid to just 7.4%, its lowest level since April 2009, but real wages continued to shrink. In an unexpected move, almost 100,000 people left the ranks of the unemployed in the three months to October, and the claimant count fell by 36,500 in November. The full report is online here. The total number of people in work hit 30 million for the first time. The proportion of public sector workers in the economy hit a record low (since 1999). The news was hailed by the government as proof that its economic plan is working, but the opposition pointed out that the cost of living crisis continues, with more part-time workers keen to work full time than ever before. There was a clash over the stats in the Commons. Average wages rose by just 0.9% in the quarter, meaning pay packets actually shrank by 1.3% in real terms once inflation is factored in. Economists and business leaders broadly welcomed the news, but many pointed to the weak pay growth (see Duncan Weldon of the TUC). The Unite union warned that the recovery is simply passing many people by. And the boss of QinetiQ said more needs to be done to fight youth unemployment. And the drop in the unemployment count also means the Bank of England may have to consider raising interest rates sooner than expected. The pound has rallied over a cent against the dollar today, to $1.639. Scroll back to 9.30am onwards for lots of charts and suchlike. In other news.... Britain's new Banking Reforms bill has received Royal Assent European finance ministers are trying to agree banking union rules, at their final meeting of 2013 The Bank of England has confirmed that the UK will embrace plastic banknotes from 2016 Angela Merkel has warned that the eurozone crisis not over, and insisted that treaty changes may be neeed to ensure stability (speech here.....analysis here) And news that China has clamped down on bitcoin has sent its value tumbling. Thanks for reading, and for the comments. Stay tuned to our site for details of the Federal Reserve's meeting tonight. I'll be back tomorrow to round up the reaction. Cheers. GW Back to the eurozone briefly -- Nina Schick of the Open Europe thinktank has analysed Angela Merkel's speech to the Bundestag this morning, ahead of a meeting of EU leaders tomorrow. She explains that Merkel told MPs that Europe needs banking union (but a more 'watered down' version than other countries), tough new contracts to ensure other countries stick to the rules, and a new treaty to bind it all together. As Nina puts it: Translation: if you want us to underwrite the euro, we need 'see-you-in-court' style supervisory powers, firmly grounded in law. That means, EU treaty change. More here: Merkel: If you want more Europe, be prepared for EU treaty change Over in the Criminal Courts of Justice in Dublin, three former senior bankers have been charged with conspiracy to defraud in the run-up to the country's banking crisis. The trio includes the ex-chief executive of one of the country's largest lenders. Reuters has the details: Former CEO of Irish Life and Permanent, Denis Casey, the lender's former finance director Peter Fitzpatrick and former head of treasury at Anglo Irish Bank, John Bowe, were granted bail by Dublin's district court and are due to appear again next March. All three replied \"no\" when the charges were put to them by police earlier on Wednesday, the court heard. They will be able to lodge an official plea ahead of their trial.No-one has so far been jailed for any part in the country's banking crisis that began in 2008 and eventually cost taxpayers more than \u20ac60bn, or about two-fifths of national output. The charges came ahead of the opening of a trial next year of three other senior executives at Anglo Irish Bank, which was nationalised in early 2009. A representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions told the court on Wednesday there was \"no factual connection\" between the two cases. All three men are accused of conspiracy to defraud between March and September 2008, that they conspired with each other to transfer 7.2 billion euros ($9.9 billion) between Anglo, Irish Life and Permanent and its Irish Life Assurance subsidiary, Dublin's district court heard. Irish Life &amp; Permanent has said it had deposited between 6 billion euros and 7 billion with Anglo in September 2008 to provide \"exceptional support\" at a time when the world's financial sector was hit badly by the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Irish Life and Permanent was effectively nationalised in 2011. Bowe faces a second charge of false accounting in December 2008, under the Theft and Fraud Offences Act, the court heard. European Commission present Jose Manuel Barroso has taken to Twitter to urge EU ministers to make progress over banking union, as they meet in Brussels. Or a slug of mulled wine, perhaps? A Single Resolution Mechanism is a key step towards banking union. It would ideally include one system for Europe's banks, one authority to decide when a bank had failed, and one fund to pay for the clean-up . Unfortunately, there's not much sign of festivities yet. Instead, a senior ECB official has dampened spirits by criticising the deal reached overnight over the 'backstop' fund to pay for failed banks. The FT has the details: Vitor Const\u00e2ncio, the European Central Bank\u2019s vice-president argued [the deal] failed to provide any emergency funding during the 10-year \u201ctransition period\u201d before a new \u20ac55bn resolution fund is fully in place, in 2025. \u201cYou should flesh out this possibility of the fund borrowing in the markets, to have bridge financing to complete a resolution process, with the proper strength of guarantees to make that process very quick and as cheap as possible,\u201d Mr Const\u00e2ncio said at the opening of Wednesday\u2019s deliberations. The Treasury has also created an interactive timeline showing the key developments in the banking sector over the last three years. It's online here - from the early days of the coalition government to today's news that the Banking Bill has received Royal AscentAssent*. Good stuff (including several videos from our site) * - thanks to the kind academic who flagged up this typo, and for suggesting I was thinking of our debt mountain... The biggest shake up of Britain's banking sector in many years reached the statute book today, as the Banking Reform Bill receives Royal Assent. The Act includes a swathe of measures to clean up the sector and (hopefully) avoid a repeat of the damage caused by the financial crisis. They include new controls to force senior bankers to take the blame if things go wrong, and a robust 'ringfence' to keep riskier investment banking operations away from the retail side. Much of the bill was based on the Independent Commission on Banking. Its author, Sir John Vickers, warned that the task of repairing the global banking sector is not over, saying: With key Independent Commission on Banking recommendations now in law, the UK is at the forefront of banking reform. The international reform effort still has further to go - to ensure that banks have deeper capacity to absorb losses, and to build safer structures for banks in the rest of Europe. A timely reminder, as EU finance ministers discuss the push towards Banking Union in Brussels today. The Treasury also produced a graphic showing the various measures introduced this parliament to put Britain's banks on a better footing. Today's drop in the unemployment rate to 7.4% shows the Bank of England was \"spectacularly wrong\" back in August when it predicted we wouldn't see 7% unemployment for three years. So says economics editor Larry Elliott, taking Mark Carney to task for not even commenting on the welcome improvement today: Larry writes: The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, had the perfect opportunity to comment on this good news when he appeared in public to announce new the move to new plastic bank notes. So did Carney say he was pleased that more people were finding work? He did not. Did he joke that unemployment was on course to hit the 7% mark before the new polymer notes are introduced in 2016. He did not. In fact, the governor declined to answer questions about unemployment at all. He was there to talk about bank notes and that was it. The reticence on the part of the governor is not perhaps as surprising as it seems. Getting economic forecasts wrong is becoming an embarrassing habit for the Bank. It failed to spot that Britain was in recession in 2008, was taken unawares by the flat-lining of 2011 and 2012, and has now under-estimated the strength of the pick-up. Using unemployment as the basis for forward guidance on interest rates was always going to be problematical. The jobless rate does not move in the smooth, linear way assumed by the Bank: it tends to move up and down quickly depending on the state of the economy. Clearly, the economy now has a real head of steam behind it: it is unlikely but not totally out of the question that unemployment could hit 7% by the end of 2013. Some time in 2014 looks more more likely, though... The pound remains high this lunchtime, up more than one cent against the US dollar at $1.636. Expectations are growing that Britain's first interest rate rise since the crisis will come sooner than Bank of England governor Mark Carney has indicated, given today's strong jobs data. Robert Wood of Berenberg Bank reckons that says the jobless rate could fall from today's 7.4% to 7% (the threshold for a possible rate rise) in 2014 -- not the third quarter of 2015 as the Bank expected. Wood writes: A huge jobs gain, chunky fall in the unemployment rate and another big fall in jobless claims signals a strong recovery is underway and raises the risk of an earlier rate hike than the BoE have indicated. These figures pose risks to our forecast that unemployment will not hit 7% until Q2 2015 and that the first rate hike will come in Q3 2015. At this rate, it is not impossible that the threshold will be reached sometime next year. That being said, wage growth remains very subdued. We also have full details of the Bank of England's decision to switch to using plastic banknotes in 2016. After a public consultation in which 87% of the 13,000 respondents backed the new-style currency, the Bank said it would introduce \"polymer\" notes, as it prefers to call them, in two years' time, starting with the new \u00a35 note featuring Winston Churchill in 2016 and the Jane Austen \u00a310 a year later. Speaking at a press conference in the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, Carney said: \"Our polymer notes will combine the best of progress and tradition. They will be more secure from counterfeiting and more resistant to damage while celebrating the history and tradition that is important both to the Bank and the nation as a whole.\" The Bank is also opening up the process of choosing famous faces for future bank notes (a response to the row over the lack of a single female face (her Majesty aside) on bank notes, until Jane Austen's \u00a310 arrives). A new advisory committee, with a majority of independent members, will now suggest a theme \u2013 such as scientific achievement. The public will be invited to suggest specific figures for inclusion. However, democracy only goes so far -- the governor will retain the final decision over which person is featured. So, no chance of rigging the ballot, guys. Lots of other stuff has been occurring... For starters, my colleague Alex Hern has nailed the story of bitcoin's tumble today: The price of bitcoin has plummeted following an announcement from China's largest bitcoin exchange that it would no longer be accepting new yuan deposits. BTC China said that due to action by a third-party payment provider, YeePay, it could no longer accept deposits in the Chinese currency, although it would still be able to process withdrawals. BTC's chief executive, Bobby Lee, said that YeePay gave notice on Wednesday morning Shanghai time that it would no longer provide services. Lee blamed government regulation for the decision. China's central bank warned in early December that bitcoin was not legally protected and had no \"real meaning\", and barred financial institutions from using the currency. On Tuesday, the central bank extended that ban to payment companies like YeePay, and gave them until Chinese New Year, which begins on 31 January, to comply. At publication time, the value of one bitcoin on BTC China stands at \u00a52,630 (\u00a3266.02), down from a high of \u00a57,395 (\u00a3741.70) in late November. Bitcoin has dropped against other currencies in the same period, falling from \u00a3750 to \u00a3300 in the UK and from $1242 to $480 in the US. Bitcoin plummets as China's largest exchange blocks new deposits This page on the ONS website is useful if you want even more details on the UK labour market. The FT's Chris Giles makes an important point -- if next month's labour market data shows the same pace of recovery, the unemployment rate could hit 7.1%. That would be just a whisker from 7% level at which the Bank of England would consider an interest rate rise. Over in Parliament, Ed Miliband has welcomed today's unemployment data - but pointed out that there are more part-time workers than ever before who'd rather have a full time job (as reported at 11.18am). The prime minister says that today's data shows an \"encouraging picture\", with 99,000 fewer people unemployed in the three months to October, and the claimant count down 36,700 in November. We can now say that 1.2 million new jobs have been created since the last election, David Cameron adds. The government's plan is working. But Miliband points out that real wages have shrunk over the last year, and many people are fighting to hold down insecure jobs. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering all the action here: David Cameron at PMQs: Politics live blog Miliband says Cameron did not answer the question. It is good the economy is creating more job. But too many are part-time or insecure. Is it a worry that average wages are \u00a3364 lower than last year? Cameron says 70% of new jobs are full-time jobs. But there is more to do. It is all very well standing up at the despatch box, but Miliband said there would be 1m fewer jobs. We are waiting for him to correct the record. The only way to get more money in people's pockets is to keep on with the economic plan. What's his? They're now trading blows over energy bills, childcare costs, tax.... Cameron saying his economic plan is working, while Miliband is pointing to the cost of living crisis. With almost a million young adults out of work, how do we solve the youth unemployment crisis? Leo Quinn, CEO of defence and security firm QinetiQ, says industry needs to take the lead by hiring more apprentices and graduates and giving them the skills needed. He's a founding member of The 5% Club, set up to get bosses to tackle this issue . Quinn said: Angela Merkel said recently youth unemployment is the biggest crisis facing Europe. Today\u2019s figures show that this remains stubbornly the case here in the UK. While total unemployment is falling, youth unemployment in this country has remained at worrying levels of around one million. This represents the potential loss of an entire generation to both our society and our economy. We urge industry to step up to the plate and commit to recruiting more young people, including apprentices and graduates, in their organisations. Government can only do so much from the supply side. At 20.5%, Britain's youth unemployment rate is a little better than the eurozone average of 24.4%. It's worse than Germany (7.8%), Austria (9.4%) and the Netherlands (11.6%), according to the latest Eurostat data. Industry body, the CBI, says that the economic growth seen earlier this year is now feeding into the labout market: Neil Carberry, CBI Director of Employment and Skills, said: The stronger economic growth we have seen recently seems to be increasing the speed of job creation. With employment rising in almost all regions, led by full-time jobs and across most sectors, real progress is being made. Our own employment survey shows this positive trend looks set to continue, with more than half of firms expecting to create new jobs next year, including more graduate and apprenticeship opportunities. But other experts are pointing to falling real wages as the main black cloud in today's jobs data: Matthew Whittaker, Senior Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: Today\u2019s jobs statistics are resounding good news \u2013 it is encouraging to see the employment rate increasing, unemployment falling, and inactivity at its lowest level since 1991. Once again, however, the positive story on jobs is not matched by good news on pay. This week\u2019s announcement of a fall in inflation will ease the pressure on pay packets to a degree, but wage growth itself still remains historically weak. Until that picks up, analysts are right to worry about the sustainability of the recovery\u2014with pressure on household incomes from other sources, consumer spending rests heavily on a return to solid wage growth. The percentage of people in employment who work in the public sector has fallen to the lowest since records began (in 1999), at 18.8% of the workforce. This graph shows how the NHS is the biggest single employer: As a raw total, the 5.7 million public sector workers is the lowest since early 2002: The Unite union fears that today's data shows that \"ordinary people\" are missing out on the recovery. General secretary Len McCluskey pointed to the meagre 0.8% rise in average earnings, and the rise in part time workers who'd rather be full time, saying: Unemployment falling will be welcome relief to many, but the underlying trends point to a growing part-time, low wage economy where the recovery is passing ordinary people by. Behind the headlines are hardworking people struggling to find a decent week\u2019s work and make ends meet as the world of work becomes more insecure and inflation continues to outstrip wages. Unemployment may be falling, but Cameron and Osborne\u2019s cost of living crisis is deepening and forcing working people to food banks this Christmas. The government needs to boost the minimum wage and invest to create a high skilled economy where people are paid a decent wage for a decent day\u2019s work. And this chart explains why economists are worried about Britain's productivity, which has failed to rebound even though the recession is over: The big fear is that the British economy is slipping back, towards a situation where more people do lower paid, less productive jobs (my colleague Larry Elliott literally co-wrote the book on it: Going South) Today's report confirms another trend -- Britain's public sector continues to steadily shrink as a share of the overall workforce: There's another record figure in today's data, but it's not one to celebrate. For August to October 2013, there were 1.47 million employees and self-employed people who were working part-time because they could not find a full-time job, the highest figure since records began in 1992. The Work Foundation says there are encouraging signs in today's data, but no signs for complacency over youth unemployment. Senior researcher Dr Benjamin Reid explains: Today\u2019s labour market figures are encouraging. A quarter of a million new jobs, and unemployment down almost 100,000, suggest the economy is finally in full recovery mode. It looks like improvements in the overall labour market are at last starting to trickle through and make an impact on the rate of youth unemployment, down 0.1% for the key 18-24 group. But now is not the time to be complacent. We will need many more months of job creation before we can say that the UK's youth unemployment crisis is in full remission. Apologies - I failed to link to today's report. It's online here. And here's the prime minister's tweet hailing the news that over 30 million people are in work, a record high (note earlier proviso about rising population) Rachel Reeves MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, has welcomed the fall in UK unemployment -- before swiftly moving onto one of Labour's key issues; that wage growth is still not matching inflation. Reeves said: Today\u2019s fall in unemployment is welcome, but families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and on average working people are now \u00a31,600 a year worse off under this out-of-touch Government. Today\u2019s figures show prices have now risen much faster than wages for 41 of the 42 months since David Cameron became Prime Minister. Youth unemployment is still unacceptably high at over 900,000 and the number of people in part time jobs who want to work full time has risen again, to a record high of 1.5 million. Labour would act to tackle the high levels of youth unemployment with a compulsory jobs guarantee, funded by repeating the tax on bank bonuses, and limiting pension tax relief for the very highest earners. This would guarantee real paid work for young people unemployed for a year and also for all adults unemployed for two years \u2013 work they would have to take or lose their benefits. And here's the graph from the ONS that confirms that Britain's been experiencing falling real pay since 2009: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has declined to comment on today's surprise tumble in the UK jobless rate, at the press conference announcing the UK's move to plastic banknotes. Speaking of which... Observer economics editor Heather Stewart sums up today's jobless data: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has slipped to a four-and-a-half year low of 7.4%, edging closer to the \u201cthreshold\u201d at which the Bank of England has said it will consider raising interest rates. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that unemployment in the three months to October was 2.39 million, or 7.4% of the working age population, down from 7.6% in the three months to September. Under the Bank\u2019s policy of forward guidance, governor Mark Carney promised not to consider raising interest rates until unemployment has fallen below 7%. When the policy was announced, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee expected that to take three years; but their latest prediction is that it could be as soon as 2015. Sterling jumped after the unemployment data was released, rising by almost a cent against the dollar, to $1.635, as investors bet on an earlier-than-expected rate rise. Bank rate-setter Martin Weale suggested last week that if unemployment is falling rapidly at the point when the 7% threshold is breached, he would regard that as a reason to tighten policy. The details of the data suggested the jobs market has strengthened markedly over the past six months. The number of people employed across the economy has hit a fresh record high above 30 million, while there are more vacancies than at any time since the summer of 2008, before the UK slipped into recession. On the claimant count, which measures the number of people in receipt of out-of-work benefits, the number of people unemployed fell to 1.27 million, its lowest level since January 2009. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThis is an extremely strong set of labour market data, indicating that unemployment is currently coming down rapidly in reaction to the economy\u2019s markedly improved performance in recent months and much healthier business confidence.\u201d In total, 485,000 new jobs have been created over the past year. Despite the improving conditions in the labour market, there is little evidence that the prolonged squeeze on wages is easing. The ONS said total pay rose at an annual rate of 0.9% in October, or 0.8% including bonuses. That compares with an inflation rate of 2.2% in the same month, suggesting that on average, living standards are continuing to fall. A bit of history - this graph shows how the UK jobless rate climbed sharply in 2009 once Britain tumbled into recession After stabilising in 2010, it rose further in 2011 as the economy stumbled and flirted with a double-dip recession (a time when the government's fiscal consolidation programme was picking up speed),. It has been recovering for most of this year, as the wider economy improved. TUC economist Duncan Weldon (a leading voice on the real wage crisis) is tweeting some important points about the unemployment data, including the lack of progress in increasing productivity: This chart shows the rise in the employment total, and the fall in the jobless count. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight. says today's data shows \"broad, strong improvement\". He's hopeful that recent economic growth is feeding into the labour market. He says: This is an extremely strong set of labour market data, indicating that unemployment is currently coming down rapidly in reaction to the economy\u2019s markedly improved performance in recent months and much healthier business confidence. Markedly rising employment is supportive to hopes that that a decent rate of growth can be sustained over the coming months, although a concern remains that the squeeze on consumers\u2019 spending power is currently only easing gradually. That's an important point -- while real wages are shrinking, consumers remain stretched. It could take until the middle of 2014 for wage growth to finally catch up with inflation, Archer reckons. Reaction to the jobless data is flooding in.... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company, World First, was disappointed to see no real improvement in take-home pay. The good news from the jobs market keeps on coming with the jobless rate at a 4.5 year low, according to the latest data. Continual and strong improvements in services, manufacturing and construction sectors have been evident throughout Q3 and Q4, and the momentum that we are seeing can hopefully continue into 2014 and beyond. Unfortunately the strength seen in jobs numbers cannot and is not being replicated in wage negotiations. We were hoping to see that wages excluding bonuses had also increased this month, a bi-product of increased productivity and business sentiment. Unfortunately this hasn\u2019t happened and remains at record lows\u2026 Today's data also shows that Britain's youth unemployment rate has fallen, but not to levels that allow any complacency over the risk of a lost generation. The ONS reported that there were 941,000 unemployed people aged 16-24 in Britain (of whom a third were in full-time education, it said) for the period between August and October. That pushed the youth unemployment rate down to 20.5%, from 21% in the three months to July. Speaking of the Bank of England, it has just confirmed that future British bank notes will be made of plastic, not paper (as we reported last night). More on that later. Employment minister Esther McVey has said the economy is on the \"right path\", following the fall in the jobless rate to a four and a half-year low. McVey told Sky News that today's unemployment data was a good sign: We can say today, we have hit a record high of the number of people in employment, with 30 million people in work. She also tried to calm fears that the Bank of England might raise interest rates soon, pointing out that the 7% level set in its forward guidance is not a trigger for action (as governor Mark Carney reiterated last night) The total number of people in work in Britain has hit a new record high of 30 million, but the overall employment rate is still below the level reached before the financial crisis. That's because the population has increased since 2008: Here's the key points from the Office for National Statistics: \u2022 The number of people in employment increased by 250,000 to reach 30.09 million. \u2022 The number of unemployed people fell by 99,000 to reach 2.39 million \u2022 The number of economically inactive people aged from 16 to 64 fell by 45,000 to reach 8.92 million. Some instant reaction Another crucial point -- at 7.4%, the jobless rate has fallen closer to the 7% threshold set by the Bank of England in its forward guidance. Once it hits that point, the Bank could start to consider an interest rate rise (although 7% is not a trigger). The pound has jumped by nearly a whole cent against the US dollar, to $1.635 -- that suggests the City is betting on an earlier rate rise. At first glance, this data looks like surprisingly good news on almost every front -- unemployment has fallen sharper than expected to 7.4%, while the number of people in work climbed again in the three months to October to a new record high of over 30 million. The government will surely claim this is another sign that the UK is recovering. The average earnings figures shows exactly why it doesn't feel like a recovery. Average earnings rose by 1.1% in October - which is an encouraging sign -- but with inflation at 2.2% that month, it means real wages fell by 1.1%. But the broad picture is still encouraging. The UK unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in four and a half years, to 7.4% in the three months to October. Today's data is much better than economists had expected, with the total of people out of work hitting its lowest level since April 2009, at below 2.4 million. More details: The total out of work fell by 99,000, to 2.388 million. The claimant count fell by 36,700 in November, to 1.269m Ands the employment total has hit 30,086m, up by 250,000 in the three months to October. But pay still lags behind the rising cost of living. Average earnings excluding rose by 0.8% in the three months to October, and by 1.1% in October alone,. while inflation is now 2.1%. More to follow! Over in Germany, Angela Merkel has warned that the eurozone crisis has not yet been fixed, in her first big speech to the Bundestag since being sworn in as chancellor for a third term. Reuters reports: German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a speech in parliament on Wednesday that the euro zone crisis had not yet been overcome but that first signs of success were evident, especially in countries like Ireland and Spain. Speaking a day after being sworn in for her third term, Merkel also called for European member states to commit to binding economic reform contracts, saying the founding flaws of the single currency union needed to be addressed urgently. \"Clearly the euro zone debt crisis is not yet overcome. One cannot emphasise this often enough. But we are seeing first successes and we are convinced it can be overcome permanently,\" she said in the Bundestag chamber. Merkel said she did not believe the necessary changes to European structures could be implemented without changes to the EU treaty. Nina Schick of Open Europe tweets the key points While we wait for the UK unemployment data (due at 9.30am), this graphic from last month shows how average weekly earnings failed to track the rising cost of living this summer, especially in the public sector (there's a larger version online here) The Bitcoin price has slumped this morning after the People's Bank of China reportedly ordered third-party payment agencies to stop working with Bitcoin exchanges. The move effectively blocks people in China from buying new bitcoins from an exchange, in Beijing's latest clampdown on the virtual currency. The world's largest bitcoin exchange -- BTC China -- said it has now stopped accepting deposits in Chinese yuan (the WSJ has more details). This helped send the price of the virtual cryptographic currency tumbling below $600 this morning. Last week it was trading around $1,200. BTC China's boss says there's no reason for bitcoin holders to panic: European stock markets are all positive this morning, ahead of tonight's Federal Reserve meeting. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 27 points or 0.4% at 6,512 \u2022 German DAX: up 50 points or 0.55% at 9,135 \u2022 French CAC: up 13 points or 0.33% at 4,082 That suggests investors believe the Fed will resist cutting its bond-buying stimulus programme today, and wait until 2014. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says: The consensus looks weighted towards the Fed waiting until early next year but delivering stronger hints as to actual timing. Also coming up this morning -- the Bank of England will announce whether it will switch Britain's bank notes from paper to plastic. The decision comes at 10am, but as my colleague Katie Allen reports, we believe the Bank's has decided that plastic is fantastic: The Bank of England will announce plans on Wednesday to press ahead with switching to plastic banknotes, starting with the new Sir Winston Churchill \u00a35 note in 2016. The decision on polymer notes will mark the beginning of the end for 320 years of paper notes from the Bank. The move by Threadneedle Street follows Bank governor Mark Carney's native Canada, where plastic notes are being rolled out, and Australia, where they have been in circulation for more than two decades. Here's the full story: Sterling to go plastic, Bank of England decides It was another late night session for eurozone finance ministers, and our friends in the Brussels press pack. But it was worth it -- the politicians agreed the details of one key outstanding part of European banking union, the backstop that would be used to close down a failed bank. The deal is a compromise, between those countries (eg Germany) that wanted banks to provide the funds, and those (eg France) who hoped to tap Europe's bailout funds. Ministers have agreed that European banks will provide \u20ac55bn of cash for the Single Resolution Fund, over the next decade. In the meantime, should the SRF prove inadequate, governments could impose new levies on the banks - or use public funds. If all else failed, they could tap the bailout fund - the European Stability Mechanism. As the FT's Peter Spiegel reports, there was relief in Brussels - where finance ministers from across the EU meet today. \u201cWe have reached a crucial breakthrough,\u201d said Olli Rehn, the EU commissioner in charge of economic affairs, adding that it should allow finance ministers from all 28 countries to reach a final deal on Wednesday and a \u201cpeaceful Christmas.\u201d FT: Eurozone agrees \u2018backstop\u2019 for failing banks Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet agrees that the deal is significant: While Michael Hewson of CMC Markets flags up that the squeeze in earnings will continue into next year: The release of the latest average earnings numbers for the three months to October are expected to show a rise of 0.9%, still well below the long term average. As the UK economy continues to improve the hope is that recent growth will feed through into wage increases in 2014, but for now there doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence of that. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale agrees that today's UK unemployment data will show that real wages are falling, with pay rises not matching inflation: Today's UK jobless data (due at 9.30am) is likely to show another drop in the number of people receiving unemployment benefit, while the number of people in work will probably hit a new record high. But there will also be gloomy news on the pay front, I fear. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicts appreciable improvement in both the claimant count and the wider ILO measure of unemployment. He said: Specifically, we see claimant count unemployment falling by a further 35,000 in November after a drop of 41,700 in October to be at a 58-month low of 1.2714 million. This is seen taking the claimant count unemployment rate down to 3.8% in November from 3.9% in October. Meanwhile, unemployment on the Labour Force Survey/International Labour Organization measure is seen falling by 47,000 in the three months to October to 2.440 million, which would be the lowest level since the three months to April 2011. The headline unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 7.6%, although there is chatter that it could possibly drop to 7.5%. But the earnings section of the report will confirm that the pay squeeze continues. Annual wage increases have been running at around 0.8% - even it that improves, it won't get close to the inflation rate of 2.1%. That means another fall in real wages. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Will we be wishing ourselves a merry Dectaper tonight? After weeks of anticipation, the Federal Reserve will decide whether the US economy is strong enough for it to start slowing its stimulus programme. The Fed is currently pumping $85bn of new money into the US economy each month in an attempt to help growth (driving stock markets to current highs), and the decision on whether to slow (or 'taper') the scheme is going to be tight. It could also give new guidance on its thresholds for future interest rate rise, and tweak its economic forecasts. The Federal Open Market Committee's decision comes at 7pm GMT, followed by a press conference, so traders are going to spend the day waiting nervously. As Chris Weston of IG puts it: Everything boils down to the FOMC meeting and Ben Bernanke\u2019s press conference 30 minutes later. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics reckons the Fed may well dip its toe into tapering, cutting its programme by perhaps $10bn to $75bn/month. He said: We suspect the renewed strength of employment growth in the past few months will be just enough to persuade the Fed to begin tapering its monthly asset purchases at the two-day FOMC meeting (19.00 GMT), which ends today. It will be a close call, however. In the meantime, there's plenty at home and abroad to keep us occupied through the day. What's coming up? We get the latest UK unemployment data, at 9.30am. That will show whether Britain's labour market continues to recover, and whether there was any progress in raising wages to combat the cost of living crisis. The minutes of the Bank of England's last meeting are also published at 9.30am..... German investor confidence data (the IFO survey) is released this morning. European finance ministers will be meeting in Brussels today to debate the nitty-gritty of banking union, after eurozone ministers made a breakthrough on some key details last night (more to follow). I'll be tracking the main events through the day (although we might hand over to our US colleagues for the Fed decision, as there's 12 hours to wait....)",

With negotiations deadlocked, the sense in Bali this month was that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was several hours and one fresh stalemate away from irrelevance.</p> <p>Two weeks later the WTO's director-general, Roberto Azev\u00eado, is in bullish mood as he gives his first big set-piece interview since ministers from 159 countries signed off on a modest package of reforms to the global trading system.</p> <p>Where once there was concern that the WTO would become a Geneva museum piece, his talk now is of using Bali as the springboard to complete the Doha round of trade liberalisation talks.</p> <p>Asked whether the WTO has been reborn in the past fortnight, he replies: \"I wouldn't say reborn because it wasn't dead. But it has been reinvigorated that's for sure.\"</p> <p>Azev\u00eado, a Brazilian career diplomat before taking over at the WTO in September, says a deal centred on improving customs procedures has provided \"the belief and the confidence that we can do business\".</p> <p>Trade experts say a dose of realism is needed. After 12 years of stalemate, ministers in Bali managed to pick the low-hanging fruit from the Doha agenda \u2013 an ambitious programme named after the Qatar city where it was launched in 2001. The bulk of the negotiations \u2013 complex and intensely political \u2013 remain to be completed. But now that the WTO has got its mojo back, a relieved Azev\u00eado insists further breakthroughs are possible.</p> <p>\"The pressure was incredible. Everybody knew what the consequences of failure would be. It would cost the system dearly. I was relieved but there was also a sense of incredible responsibility because the question now is 'What next?'</p> <p>\"This is the beginning of the road. The road only gets tougher from here. So my emotions were relief, happiness, but at the same time feeling that there was a lot of hard work ahead.\"</p> <p>Azev\u00eado, 56, explains why Bali did not join the long list of failed WTO summits in the 20 years since the last multilateral deal was signed. Firstly, there was recognition that agreement on the entire Doha agenda, which involves agriculture, manufacturing and services, was a non-starter.</p> <p>\"We identified a problem, that we were not in a position to conclude the Doha round in the way we had been negotiating before, so we tried to do it in a different way. There was a reality check where we looked at areas that were promising and doable.\"</p> <p>Secondly, he found a way of conducting the talks that avoided alienating the bulk of the membership.</p> <p>\"Things changed several weeks before Bali, particularly in the process,\" said Azev\u00eado. \"That was important. We would normally have a mechanism where we negotiate in small formats, then that outcome is multilateralised to the rest of the membership on a take it or leave it basis. We changed that a little bit.</p> <p>\"It doesn't mean we didn't have meetings of small groups, but we changed the participants to include those that had particularly difficulties in each issue. It was not a club that was deciding everything. We had all the interested parties in the inner circle, and this included big countries and small countries, developed countries and developing countries. It didn't matter what the size was: what mattered was the degree of sensitivity.</p> <p>\"Once there was understanding in a small group each issue was discussed in an open format. It was painstakingly slow because of the number of countries. The common wisdom was that open ended meetings were no go. We proved that wrong.\"</p> <p>Finally, the sense of crisis helped to concentrate minds. \"Before we left for Bali, a delegation of small countries came to me and said whatever happens don't let this thing drop. It was a very clear message from them. There was a lot of instinct involved, determining what would work and when. Some times I had the solution to the key problem but I didn't provide it. I knew that if I gave the solution too early they would shred it apart but that if we waited until the 11th hour in Bali they would take it.\"</p> <p>The WTO's critics fall into two camps. There are those who see it as an organisation dedicated to delivering for western multinationals at the expense of poor people. Conversely, there are those so frustrated by the snail-like pace of WTO talks that they are seeking to cut bilateral deals such as the EU-US trade partnership.</p> <p>Azev\u00eado rejects both criticisms. \"For the first time there was a package on the table that was supported by large, medium, small and the smallest countries. Everyone. They all wanted a deal.\"</p> <p>He added that the transpacific and transatlantic trade deals being discussed involved countries where markets were already pretty much open.</p> <p>\"The big frontier involves the big emerging players \u2013 China, India, Brazil. They are the people you want to do business with and it is here at the WTO that you are going to get them round the table.\"</p> <p>At Bali's conclusion of the meeting, ministers gave Azev\u00eado 12 months to piece together a road map for the conclusion of the Doha round. So how long has he got to finish the job?</p> <p>\"Not 12 years,\" he said. \"I am not going to take bets about how long it will take. But the world changes really rapidly, in terms of business, politics and culture. You can't have a system that takes two to three decades to respond. It has to be quicker than that but I am not going to be specific because that would put a sword over my head.\"</p> <p>Some say Doha is like Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the never-ending court case in Dickens' Bleak House. So will the talks ever be concluded? \"I hope so in some shape or form. Developing countries want it. Developed countries want it.\"</p> <h2><strong>New terms of trade: pledges that will open borders</strong></h2> <p><strong>The package of measures agreed&#xa0;by the&#xa0;WTO in Bali has three main elements:</strong></p> <p><strong>Trade facilitation </strong></p> <p>This is a binding pledge by all WTO countries to make it easier for goods to cross borders. It involves simplifying customs procedures, removing red tape and rooting out corruption. Hailed by the WTO as one of the biggest reforms since it was founded in 1995, benefits to the global economy have been estimated at between $400bn (\u00a3244bn) and $1tn. Poorer countries will be given time and financial help to improve infrastructure and training.</p> <p><strong>Food security </strong></p> <p>Talks in Bali almost foundered owing to US pressure on India to stop stockpiling subsidised grain. New Delhi said the domestic support was needed to feed India's poor. A \"peace clause\" was agreed in which India was allowed to keep its regime in place but only the basis that the agreement was temporary, with a permanent deal to be concluded within four years.</p> <p><strong>Help for the least developed countries. </strong></p> <p>Many Western countries have already agreed duty-free and quota-free access to their markets for goods from more than 30 of the world's poorest countries. Those that have not done so for at least 97% of products \"shall seek\" to improve product coverage. In addition, there will be simplified \"rules of origin\" for the world's poorest countries. The WTO says these will help the least well off countries identify products as their own goods, making it easier to get preferential treatment in importing countries.</p>",

Asked whether the WTO has been reborn in the past fortnight, he replies: \"I wouldn't say reborn because it wasn't dead. But it has been reinvigorated that's for sure.\" Azev\u00eado, a Brazilian career diplomat before taking over at the WTO in September, says a deal centred on improving customs procedures has provided \"the belief and the confidence that we can do business\". Trade experts say a dose of realism is needed. After 12 years of stalemate, ministers in Bali managed to pick the low-hanging fruit from the Doha agenda \u2013 an ambitious programme named after the Qatar city where it was launched in 2001. The bulk of the negotiations \u2013 complex and intensely political \u2013 remain to be completed. But now that the WTO has got its mojo back, a relieved Azev\u00eado insists further breakthroughs are possible. \"The pressure was incredible. Everybody knew what the consequences of failure would be. It would cost the system dearly. I was relieved but there was also a sense of incredible responsibility because the question now is 'What next?' \"This is the beginning of the road. The road only gets tougher from here. So my emotions were relief, happiness, but at the same time feeling that there was a lot of hard work ahead.\" Azev\u00eado, 56, explains why Bali did not join the long list of failed WTO summits in the 20 years since the last multilateral deal was signed. Firstly, there was recognition that agreement on the entire Doha agenda, which involves agriculture, manufacturing and services, was a non-starter. \"We identified a problem, that we were not in a position to conclude the Doha round in the way we had been negotiating before, so we tried to do it in a different way. There was a reality check where we looked at areas that were promising and doable.\" Secondly, he found a way of conducting the talks that avoided alienating the bulk of the membership. \"Things changed several weeks before Bali, particularly in the process,\" said Azev\u00eado. \"That was important. We would normally have a mechanism where we negotiate in small formats, then that outcome is multilateralised to the rest of the membership on a take it or leave it basis. We changed that a little bit. \"It doesn't mean we didn't have meetings of small groups, but we changed the participants to include those that had particularly difficulties in each issue. It was not a club that was deciding everything. We had all the interested parties in the inner circle, and this included big countries and small countries, developed countries and developing countries. It didn't matter what the size was: what mattered was the degree of sensitivity. \"Once there was understanding in a small group each issue was discussed in an open format. It was painstakingly slow because of the number of countries. The common wisdom was that open ended meetings were no go. We proved that wrong.\" Finally, the sense of crisis helped to concentrate minds. \"Before we left for Bali, a delegation of small countries came to me and said whatever happens don't let this thing drop. It was a very clear message from them. There was a lot of instinct involved, determining what would work and when. Some times I had the solution to the key problem but I didn't provide it. I knew that if I gave the solution too early they would shred it apart but that if we waited until the 11th hour in Bali they would take it.\" The WTO's critics fall into two camps. There are those who see it as an organisation dedicated to delivering for western multinationals at the expense of poor people. Conversely, there are those so frustrated by the snail-like pace of WTO talks that they are seeking to cut bilateral deals such as the EU-US trade partnership. Azev\u00eado rejects both criticisms. \"For the first time there was a package on the table that was supported by large, medium, small and the smallest countries. Everyone. They all wanted a deal.\" He added that the transpacific and transatlantic trade deals being discussed involved countries where markets were already pretty much open. \"The big frontier involves the big emerging players \u2013 China, India, Brazil. They are the people you want to do business with and it is here at the WTO that you are going to get them round the table.\" At Bali's conclusion of the meeting, ministers gave Azev\u00eado 12 months to piece together a road map for the conclusion of the Doha round. So how long has he got to finish the job? \"Not 12 years,\" he said. \"I am not going to take bets about how long it will take. But the world changes really rapidly, in terms of business, politics and culture. You can't have a system that takes two to three decades to respond. It has to be quicker than that but I am not going to be specific because that would put a sword over my head.\" Some say Doha is like Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the never-ending court case in Dickens' Bleak House. So will the talks ever be concluded? \"I hope so in some shape or form. Developing countries want it. Developed countries want it.\" New terms of trade: pledges that will open borders The package of measures agreed by the WTO in Bali has three main elements: Trade facilitation This is a binding pledge by all WTO countries to make it easier for goods to cross borders. It involves simplifying customs procedures, removing red tape and rooting out corruption. Hailed by the WTO as one of the biggest reforms since it was founded in 1995, benefits to the global economy have been estimated at between $400bn (\u00a3244bn) and $1tn. Poorer countries will be given time and financial help to improve infrastructure and training. Food security Talks in Bali almost foundered owing to US pressure on India to stop stockpiling subsidised grain. New Delhi said the domestic support was needed to feed India's poor. A \"peace clause\" was agreed in which India was allowed to keep its regime in place but only the basis that the agreement was temporary, with a permanent deal to be concluded within four years. Help for the least developed countries. Many Western countries have already agreed duty-free and quota-free access to their markets for goods from more than 30 of the world's poorest countries. Those that have not done so for at least 97% of products \"shall seek\" to improve product coverage. In addition, there will be simplified \"rules of origin\" for the world's poorest countries. The WTO says these will help the least well off countries identify products as their own goods, making it easier to get preferential treatment in importing countries.",

Finally Vectura added 16.25p to 137.25p after it announced its partner Sandoz had received Danish approval for the sale of an inhaled lung drug, AirFluSal Forspiro, that analysts say could be a generic copy of GlaxoSmithKline's blockbuster drug Advair. Investec analyst Nicholas Keher said: We believe this is a generic of Seretide [Advair] and see it as a material value driver for Vectura. Un-risked, this now adds 22p to our target price. However, as previously highlighted, given time and assuming approvals are achieved globally for the portfolio, we think this stock could be worth 270p on a two year view. Buy.",

    "webTitle": "Hinkley Point C nuclear subsidy plan queried by European commission", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European commission has started an investigation into UK plans to subsidise the construction and operation of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, in a challenge to the government's plans to overhaul Britain's creaking energy infrastructure. On the day royal assent was finally given to the coalition's controversial Energy Act, the EU's executive arm expressed doubts that British ministers could justify state aid to nuclear which it estimated could reach \u00a317bn. The EC warned of the risk of a \"subsidy race\" between member states and Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, vice-president for competition policy, described the aid package as a complex measure of an unprecedented nature and scale. \"The commission therefore needs to investigate thoroughly its impact on the UK and the EU internal energy markets, and is requesting all interested parties to submit their observations.\" The British government has always denied that the financial support is a subsidy and said it was needed for the proposed nuclear plant because the market is faced with an unprecedented situation, the aims of combating climate change and assuring energy security. But there has been speculation in Brussels that the commission has made up its mind that the Hinkley move is in effect an unfair subsidy, with the only question being what kind of changes or sanctions it may demand or impose on Britain. G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the European union's energy commissioner, warned last month that the 35-year subsidy regime \"may be a problem\" while earlier describing the UK nuclear project in an unguarded moment as \"Soviet\" in style. The financial support for EDF and its Chinese partners includes a \u00a310bn loan guarantee plus an inflation-linked \"strike price\" of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years \u2013 twice the current price for electricity in Britain. Ed Davey, energy and climate change secretary, shrugged off the commission announcement, saying it was standard for large investment projects and was always part of the process for Hinkley. \"We will use this period to demonstrate how the project meets state aid rules and provides good value for consumers while cutting carbon in the energy sector.\" EDF, the French state-owned company that will operate Hinkley Point C, said it was looking forward to putting its case direct to Brussels. \"This investigation gives the government and others the opportunity to show that electricity market reform in the UK is essential to deliver the investment needed for the country's low carbon energy future at a price that is fair for customers,\" it said a statement. \"Without this reform, the investment will not take place. The Hinkley Point C agreement is proof that this reform works to attract the investment needed to secure Britain's future electricity supply.\" The Energy Act not only underpins the Hinkley strike price but also provides a range of incentives including support for wind power and biomass to attract \u00a3110bn needed to replace current generating capacity and upgrade the national grid. Critics have attacked it for being too complex and expensive to implement. The UK energy regulator, Ofgem, appointed Dermot Nolan as its next chief executive. Nolan will join Ofgem in March from the Commission for Energy Regulation in Ireland and comes at a time of unprecedented political heat around soaring bills and alleged power market malfunction.",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The European commission has started an investigation into UK plans to subsidise the construction and operation of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, in a challenge to the government's plans to overhaul Britain's creaking energy infrastructure.</p> <p>On the day royal assent was finally given to the coalition's controversial Energy Act, the EU's executive arm expressed doubts that British ministers could justify state aid to nuclear which it estimated could reach \u00a317bn.</p> <p>The EC warned of the risk of a \"subsidy race\" between member states and Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, vice-president for competition policy, described the aid package as a complex measure of an unprecedented nature and scale.</p> <p>\"The commission therefore needs to investigate thoroughly its impact on the UK and the EU internal energy markets, and is requesting all interested parties to submit their observations.\"</p> <p>The British government has always denied that the financial support is a subsidy and said it was needed for the proposed nuclear plant because the market is faced with an unprecedented situation, the aims of combating climate change and assuring energy security.</p> <p>But there has been speculation in Brussels that the commission has made up its mind that the Hinkley move is in effect an unfair subsidy, with the only question being what kind of changes or sanctions it may demand or impose on Britain.</p> <p>G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the European union's energy commissioner, warned last month that the 35-year subsidy regime \"may be a problem\" while earlier describing the UK nuclear project in an unguarded moment as \"Soviet\" in style. The financial support for EDF and its Chinese partners includes a \u00a310bn loan guarantee plus an inflation-linked \"strike price\" of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years \u2013 twice the current price for electricity in Britain.</p> <p>Ed Davey, energy and climate change secretary, shrugged off the commission announcement, saying it was standard for large investment projects and was always part of the process for Hinkley.</p> <p>\"We will use this period to demonstrate how the project meets state aid rules and provides good value for consumers while cutting carbon in the energy sector.\"</p> <p>EDF, the French state-owned company that will operate Hinkley Point C, said it was looking forward to putting its case direct to Brussels. \"This investigation gives the government and others the opportunity to show that electricity market reform in the UK is essential to deliver the investment needed for the country's low carbon energy future at a price that is fair for customers,\" it said a statement. \"Without this reform, the investment will not take place. The Hinkley Point C agreement is proof that this reform works to attract the investment needed to secure Britain's future electricity supply.\"</p> <p>The Energy Act not only underpins the Hinkley strike price but also provides a range of incentives including support for wind power and biomass to attract \u00a3110bn needed to replace current generating capacity and upgrade the national grid. Critics have attacked it for being too complex and expensive to implement.</p> <p>The UK energy regulator, Ofgem, appointed Dermot Nolan as its next chief executive. Nolan will join Ofgem in March from the Commission for Energy Regulation in Ireland and comes at a time of unprecedented political heat around soaring bills and alleged power market malfunction.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England switches to plastic pound notes with Churchill fiver", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has formally announced that Britain will switch to using plastic banknotes in 2016, ending 320 years of paper money. After a public consultation in which 87% of the 13,000 respondents backed the new-style currency, the Bank said it would introduce \"polymer\" notes, as it prefers to call them, in two years' time, starting with the new \u00a35 note featuring Winston Churchill in 2016 and the Jane Austen \u00a310 a year later. Speaking at a press conference in the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, Carney said: \"Our polymer notes will combine the best of progress and tradition. They will be more secure from counterfeiting and more resistant to damage while celebrating the history and tradition that is important both to the Bank and the nation as a whole.\" The move follows Carney's native Canada, where plastic notes are being rolled out, and Australia, where they have been in circulation for more than two decades. Carney launched a public consultation on polymer banknotes, seen as cleaner and more durable, shortly after arriving at the Bank this summer. However, the Bank's notes division has been considering plastic money for several years. Bank officials have been touring shopping centres and business groups around the country with prototype notes to canvas public opinion. The Bank has promoted its polymer notes, featuring a see-through window and other new security features, as less threadbare and tougher to counterfeit. It has sought to quell concerns about the environmental impact of printing on plastic by suggesting they can last up to two-and-a-half times longer than the cotton-paper notes in circulation at the moment. The durability will also compensate for the higher production costs and save an estimated \u00a3100m, the Bank claims. Its laboratory tests showed polymer banknotes only begin to shrink and melt at 120C, so they would fare better in washing machines but could be damaged by a hot iron. Carney has also announced that the Bank will follow new procedures when selecting the historical characters to appear on future notes, to avoid the furore it faced earlier this year, when the announcement of the Churchill \u00a35 note appeared to suggest that no women \u2013 other than the Queen \u2013 would feature on any denomination. A new advisory committee, with a majority of independent members, will now suggest a theme \u2013 such as scientific achievement \u2013 and the public will be invited to suggest specific figures for inclusion. However, the governor will retain the final decision over which person is featured. \"These changes will ensure that the characters on our banknotes are fully representative of the history and diversity of this great nation, while having the necessary public respect and legitimacy.\" The move is the latest in a long line of changes for banknotes, first issued in return for deposits by the Bank when it was first established in 1694 to raise money for William III's war against France. Colour \u00a35 notes replaced white ones in the 1950s; the first portrayal of a monarch came in 1960, when the Queen appeared on a new \u00a31 note; and the introduction of historical figures such as William Shakespeare started in the 1970s. As part of the preparation for this latest change, banknote officials have already been working with retailers and the operators of vending machines and cashpoints. Link, which runs the UK cash machine network, said its machines would need new cassettes to hold the plastic notes, because they will be smaller, and not because of the change in material. The 15% reduction in size for Churchill notes compared with the current Elizabeth Fry fiver brings English notes into line with sizes in other countries. But they will remain larger than existing euro notes and the different denominations of sterling will retain tiered sizes to help blind people differentiate between them. The Bank concedes no note is counterfeit-proof but says copying the new polymer notes will be slower and more expensive.",

      "bodyText": "BP has reported a \"significant oil discovery\" in the Gulf of Mexico, its first major find since the deadly rig explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in US history. The company said it had hit oil at depths close to 9,150 metres (30,000ft) at its Gila prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, about 300 miles south-west of New Orleans. The announcement marks the first big oil discovery since US regulators lifted a five-month ban on deep-water drilling in 2010 after the Macondo well blowout; it follows two finds in the Gulf in 2006 and 2009. The discovery, whose commercial potential remains unclear, came as BP revealed a $1bn (\u00a3650m) write-off from its Pitanga well off the coast of Brazil, which never yielded the lucrative fossil fuels the company had hoped for. The oil company admitted it would not recover the $850m it paid to buy the Pitanga well, nor a further $230m spent on developing it. BP said 2013 had been its most successful year for oil exploration for almost a decade: it had investigated 15 wells, making seven potentially commercial discoveries. The company expects to spend around $4bn a year exploring and drilling new wells in the Gulf of Mexico over the next decade, a figure roughly equivalent to the sum it has set aside for clean-up costs, fines and compensation related to the disaster, which killed 11 people and released 4m barrels of oil into the sea. The final bill will not become clear until a US court judgment next year. BP, which employs 2,300 people in the Gulf of Mexico, had seven wells in 2012, up from five in 2011, a further sign of the drilling revival in the region since the spill. While fracking and cheap gas have captured public attention, big oil companies have been moving back to the Gulf, building new rigs. A record 807 oil permits for the Gulf were issued in the first nine months of this year, up 14% on 2012, according to Bloomberg. BP continues to fight a ban on competing for US government contracts that was imposed following the oil rig explosion, recently winning the support of the British government. \"The Gila discovery is a further sign that momentum is returning to BP's drilling operations and well execution in the Gulf of Mexico,\" said Richard Morrison, regional resident of BP's Gulf of Mexico business. The US oil major ConocoPhillips has a minority stake in the Gila prospect.",

The company says it has to cut the cost of each car it builds by $3,800 to compete with other Toyota plants. It has a total workforce of about 4,200, including about 2,500 production workers.</p> <p>After that ruling, Yasuda warned that Holden's planned closure in 2017 would put Toyota's Australian manufacturing operations under under unprecedented pressure: \"A decision will be made next year on the next-generation Camry and export program and we need to take urgent action if we want to stay at the negotiating table for future investments.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday the government's mid-year budget update pushed ahead with a planned $500m cut to the government's Automotive Transformation Scheme between now and 2017\u201118. The Productivity Commission's draft recommendations on industry assistance are not due until January, although the commission is expected to release some information on the global automotive sector on Friday.</p> <p>One of the changes sought by Toyota is to reduce the 21-day Christmas break taken under the workplace agreement covering its Altona assembly plant in Melbourne's western suburbs.</p> <p>The company argues that is the longest Christmas break taken at any of Toyota's plants. It wants employees to take a minimum of 10 consecutive days which must include Christmas Eve and New Year's Day, with the ability to vary the shutdown to meet business needs from year to year.</p> <p>The shutdown time is partly skewed due to Australia combining a Christmas-new year shutdown with summer holidays, in contrast with northern hemisphere car plants. But Toyota Australia argues that the length of its production break causes supply backlogs to the Middle East, which then have to be made up by working overtime the rest of the year.</p>",

A company spokeswoman, Beck Angel, said Toyota did not want to enter the political debate \u2013 as Labor's industry spokesman, Kim Carr, said local manufacturing operations of Toyota Australia looked \u201cvery bleak\" in the wake of the Holden closure. \"We are doing everything that we can to continue building cars in Australia,\" Angel said. \"Our goal is to secure the next generation Camry and maintain our export program. This has not changed. \u201cA decision will be made sometime next year on future investments and we must continue with our transformation journey if we want to become globally competitive. \u201cThis is why it is more important than ever before that we continue to work closely with our key stakeholders, suppliers and the government to secure our manufacturing future in Australia.\u201d Toyota Australia is expected to decide this week whether it will appeal against a federal court ruling that blocked management from seeking employee approval for a package of workplace changes to cut costs and boost productivity. The company says it has to cut the cost of each car it builds by $3,800 to compete with other Toyota plants. It has a total workforce of about 4,200, including about 2,500 production workers. After that ruling, Yasuda warned that Holden's planned closure in 2017 would put Toyota's Australian manufacturing operations under under unprecedented pressure: \"A decision will be made next year on the next-generation Camry and export program and we need to take urgent action if we want to stay at the negotiating table for future investments.\" On Tuesday the government's mid-year budget update pushed ahead with a planned $500m cut to the government's Automotive Transformation Scheme between now and 2017\u201118. The Productivity Commission's draft recommendations on industry assistance are not due until January, although the commission is expected to release some information on the global automotive sector on Friday. One of the changes sought by Toyota is to reduce the 21-day Christmas break taken under the workplace agreement covering its Altona assembly plant in Melbourne's western suburbs. The company argues that is the longest Christmas break taken at any of Toyota's plants. It wants employees to take a minimum of 10 consecutive days which must include Christmas Eve and New Year's Day, with the ability to vary the shutdown to meet business needs from year to year. The shutdown time is partly skewed due to Australia combining a Christmas-new year shutdown with summer holidays, in contrast with northern hemisphere car plants. But Toyota Australia argues that the length of its production break causes supply backlogs to the Middle East, which then have to be made up by working overtime the rest of the year.",
