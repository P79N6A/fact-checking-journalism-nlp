      "bodyText": "The new governor of the Bank of England will be the highest paid central banker in the world, by a significant margin. Mark Carney is quitting his job as governor of the Bank of Canada to relocate to London, on an annual salary of \u00a3480,000 and pension contributions worth \u00a3144,000. On top of that, he will receive a \u00a3250,000 housing allowance, taking his total package to \u00a3874,000, far beyond the pay of the president of the US Federal Reserve, the governor of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Germany's central bank chief. He will also receive free health and dental insurance and the use of a chauffeur-driven car. Carney initially rebuffed George Osborne's advances, only to agree when the terms were sweetened and he was allowed to take the job for five years rather than the standard eight. One commentator said: \"I suspect he realised he had Osborne over a barrel.\" His nearest rival in pay is the governor of the ECB, Mario Draghi, who receives less than half of Carney's package, although he does enjoy the use of an official residence. Draghi is paid an annual salary of \u20ac371,148, plus an estimated \u20ac107,000 of allowances and contributions to medical and accident insurance schemes, bringing his pay to a total of \u00a3389,000. Jens Weidmann, the softly spoken but fearsome president of Germany's Bundesbank, is close behind on a total of \u00a3320,450. Meanwhile, Ben Bernanke \u2013 as head of the US Federal Reserve, arguably the most powerful central banker in the world \u2013 receives a relatively modest salary of $199,700 (\u00a3122,700). In terms of benefits, he is entitled to the same health and insurance benefits, pension and thrift savings plan as any other Fed employee. His salary is even lower than that of the central bank governor in crisis-hit Spain, Luis Maria Linde, who \u2013 according to 2010 figures \u2013 received the equivalent of \u00a3134,000. Remarkably, some countries do not publish pay details for their most senior banker. France, for one, finds itself in a catch-22 position. The annual salary of the governor of the Banque de France must, according to a decree, be equal to the salary of the vice-president of France's highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat. But the salary of the vice president of the Conseil d'Etat is kept private, meaning Christian Noyer's pay is also a secret. Admittedly, Carney is already on a healthy pay packet, although the Bank of Canada coyly publishes a salary range rather than an exact figure for his pay and benefits. As such, all we know is that Carney currently receives between C$425,300 and C$500,300 \u2013 a maximum of \u00a3311,000 in annual pay. The reaction to Carney's pay packet has been muted, as commentators hold fire on the man drafted in to save the UK economy. Former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Matthew Oakeshott said: \"If he really could stop our economy sliding deeper into stagflation, he'd be worth every penny.\"",

      "body": "<p>Hollywood has given us two major images of Wall Street. The first comes from the 1986 drama Wall Street, with its antihero Gordon Gekko and his dark, intellectual, strategizing about acquiring a company's stock to control its future. A corporate raider clad in the philosophical garb of Sun Tzu, armed with a simple tool \u2013 stocks \u2013 and confident of his power to wield those stocks to control the existence of everyone around him. </p> <p>The second is from the comedy Trading Places, where the action hinges on the broadest possible attempt to corner the market on the future price of frozen orange-juice concentrate. The hapless characters there don't have the option of manipulating stocks. They're working with options and futures contracts, esoteric tools that are far more unpredictable than stocks. </p> <p>Which one do you think has won the day?</p> <p>I'm sorry to tell you that the Gordon Gekko vision \u2013 the world of stocks as the tools of ultimate financial power, all played out in the open \u2013 died Thursday, when the New York Stock Exchange <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/20/nyse-sold-8bn-intercontinentalexchange\">agreed to sell itself to the Intercontinental Exchange</a>.</p> <p>It used to be that the NYSE's model \u2013 providing a market where people could buy stock and sell it \u2013 was the center of financial power plays. But the biggest exchange in the United States today is not a stock exchange. It is a commodities exchange: the CME, which is the former Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p> <p>Against all odds, it is the Trading Places version of Wall Street \u2013 the world of commodities, of wheat and coffee, and of derivatives \u2013&#xa0;that is in the ascendant. </p> <p>The NYSE is fully aware of its final abdication to the future. \"We felt consolidation was inevitable,\" said the NYSE's CEO, Duncan Niederauer, to CNBC. </p> <p>In Wall Street jargon, \"consolidation\" means \"mergers\". And what Niederauer was conceding was that the NYSE could not have survived on its own. </p> <p>\"It shows how tough the business has gotten,\" said Sal Arnuk, the co-founder of Themis Trading. \"It's symptomatic of how horrible [stock trading] has become, that it's either 'consolidate or die.'\" </p> <p>The NYSE long ago read the obituary of stock markets and recognized that it was losing ground. Currently, it makes less money from fees for trading stocks \u2013 which should be its core business \u2013 than it does from listing new companies on the exchange. The ICE deal, if it gets regulatory approvals, will cap six years of the NYSE's efforts to save itself. In 2006 it merged with Chicago's Archipelago Exchange to expand its world into the trading of options, which are contracts that allow investors to bet on the future price of a stock or commodity. </p> <p>The new NYSE started allowing computer trading alongside the \"open-outcry\" traders on the actual stock exchange floor. It rented out its trading floor \u2013 once a deafening hub of financial activity \u2013 as an expensive camera studio. It merged with the American Stock Exchange to snap up one of its last surviving US competitors and with Euronext to expand its business globally. Last year, the NYSE attempted to merge with Germany's Deutsche Boerse \u2013 again to expand internationally, and into the world of options and derivatives \u2013 but the deal failed. </p> <p>Mergers come with downside, however: the technology doesn't always keep up. Even as the NYSE started moving towards using more computer trading, it had a major disadvantage: trades that crosses the exchange were visible. Increasingly, big investors want their trades to be done invisibly, to move big blocks of stock quietly without waking up others who could beat them on the price. </p> <p>It doesn't help that the New York Stock Exchange and its primary rival, Nasdaq, have been plagued with big and small technological failures. The \"flash crash\" of 2010 was a notable low point, when dozens of stocks lost their value for no discernible reason. Companies listing their stock for sale to the public for the first time \u2013 in initial public offerings \u2013 have seen glitches galore. </p> <p>\"This shows how important young technology has become in mergers,\" Arnuk said. \"The New York Stock Exchange is being taken over by ICE, which is a technologically rich company. You thought the exchanges have been dragged kicking and screaming in to new technologies? Look how it's accelerating. It will be a bigger boys' game very soon.\" </p> <p>It's not just computers that the NYSE was losing ground on. Increasingly, its competition was not other stock exchanges; despite years of strategic smacktalk between the NYSE and Nasdaq, that rivalry is as outdated as the Brooklyn Dodgers versus the New York Yankees. </p> <p>The real threat \u2013 and the one the ICE and the NYSE combined will fight \u2013 is the CME, the quiet, brilliant and ruthless giant exchange in Chicago. </p> <p>The CME has also been steadily acquiring its rivals, from the Chicago Board of Trade to the New York Mercantile Exchange. It allows customers to trade everything from bets on the future price of wheat to currencies to derivatives contracts designed to predict how much snow will fall in any given month. It is fully global, with operations in Asia and ownership of a stock exchange in Brazil. It is even a force on social media, with an active profile on LinkedIn and \u2013 incredibly \u2013 750,000 followers on Twitter who tune in to read everything from economic reports to stories about oil futures and the rise of the Indian rupee. </p> <p>The CME has proven that there is no such thing \u2013 or at least, no such successful thing \u2013 as a \"stock\" exchange any more. There is little money to be made as the middleman for stocks, and the CME does not trade stocks. It trades contracts that few mom-and-pop investors ever see, much less understand: options, futures, commodities contracts, various derivatives. </p> <p>Where the NYSE's business is easy to grasp by anyone who's been on eBay \u2013 bid, buy, sell \u2013 the CME's business is limited to the sophisticated investor. </p> <p>And increasingly, that is why the NYSE's makeover is not just \u2013 as it is sure to be billed \u2013 the death of Wall Street. It is also the beginning of the death of financial involvement for Main Street.</p>",

And what Niederauer was conceding was that the NYSE could not have survived on its own. \"It shows how tough the business has gotten,\" said Sal Arnuk, the co-founder of Themis Trading. \"It's symptomatic of how horrible [stock trading] has become, that it's either 'consolidate or die.'\" The NYSE long ago read the obituary of stock markets and recognized that it was losing ground. Currently, it makes less money from fees for trading stocks \u2013 which should be its core business \u2013 than it does from listing new companies on the exchange. The ICE deal, if it gets regulatory approvals, will cap six years of the NYSE's efforts to save itself. In 2006 it merged with Chicago's Archipelago Exchange to expand its world into the trading of options, which are contracts that allow investors to bet on the future price of a stock or commodity. The new NYSE started allowing computer trading alongside the \"open-outcry\" traders on the actual stock exchange floor. It rented out its trading floor \u2013 once a deafening hub of financial activity \u2013 as an expensive camera studio. It merged with the American Stock Exchange to snap up one of its last surviving US competitors and with Euronext to expand its business globally. Last year, the NYSE attempted to merge with Germany's Deutsche Boerse \u2013 again to expand internationally, and into the world of options and derivatives \u2013 but the deal failed. Mergers come with downside, however: the technology doesn't always keep up. Even as the NYSE started moving towards using more computer trading, it had a major disadvantage: trades that crosses the exchange were visible. Increasingly, big investors want their trades to be done invisibly, to move big blocks of stock quietly without waking up others who could beat them on the price. It doesn't help that the New York Stock Exchange and its primary rival, Nasdaq, have been plagued with big and small technological failures. The \"flash crash\" of 2010 was a notable low point, when dozens of stocks lost their value for no discernible reason. Companies listing their stock for sale to the public for the first time \u2013 in initial public offerings \u2013 have seen glitches galore. \"This shows how important young technology has become in mergers,\" Arnuk said. \"The New York Stock Exchange is being taken over by ICE, which is a technologically rich company. You thought the exchanges have been dragged kicking and screaming in to new technologies? Look how it's accelerating. It will be a bigger boys' game very soon.\" It's not just computers that the NYSE was losing ground on. Increasingly, its competition was not other stock exchanges; despite years of strategic smacktalk between the NYSE and Nasdaq, that rivalry is as outdated as the Brooklyn Dodgers versus the New York Yankees. The real threat \u2013 and the one the ICE and the NYSE combined will fight \u2013 is the CME, the quiet, brilliant and ruthless giant exchange in Chicago. The CME has also been steadily acquiring its rivals, from the Chicago Board of Trade to the New York Mercantile Exchange. It allows customers to trade everything from bets on the future price of wheat to currencies to derivatives contracts designed to predict how much snow will fall in any given month. It is fully global, with operations in Asia and ownership of a stock exchange in Brazil. It is even a force on social media, with an active profile on LinkedIn and \u2013 incredibly \u2013 750,000 followers on Twitter who tune in to read everything from economic reports to stories about oil futures and the rise of the Indian rupee. The CME has proven that there is no such thing \u2013 or at least, no such successful thing \u2013 as a \"stock\" exchange any more. There is little money to be made as the middleman for stocks, and the CME does not trade stocks. It trades contracts that few mom-and-pop investors ever see, much less understand: options, futures, commodities contracts, various derivatives. Where the NYSE's business is easy to grasp by anyone who's been on eBay \u2013 bid, buy, sell \u2013 the CME's business is limited to the sophisticated investor. And increasingly, that is why the NYSE's makeover is not just \u2013 as it is sure to be billed \u2013 the death of Wall Street. It is also the beginning of the death of financial involvement for Main Street.",

      "bodyText": "Retailers are braced for a tough Christmas after a fall in spending in November. According to official figures on Thursday, British shoppers tightened their belts in the run-up to the biggest shopping period of the year, spending 0.1% less last month than in October. The fall hit high street shops especially hard after as shoppers increasingly turned to the internet, the Office for National Statistics said in its monthly retail sales report. A late surge is still expected by retail analysts, but it is increasingly unlikely there will be enough of a spending binge to make up for November's lost ground. Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at financial data providers Markit, said the lack of consumer spending would be another factor dragging the UK economy nearer to its third recession in four years. \"The underlying trend in retail sales has deteriorated to the worst since September 2011, and sales could even fall over the fourth quarter as a whole according to the indications available so far,\" he said. \"With production and trade data also turning down towards the end of the year, its looking very unlikely that the consumer is going to save the economy from sliding back into another contraction.\" The prospect of a triple-dip recession has undermined consumer confidence and is expected to keep spending subdued well into the new year. The ONS also pointed out that through the ups and downs of the last five years shops had suffered flat sales, making the recent lack of consumer confidence part of what has become a long term trend. With less than a week to go before Christmas, surveys have shown shoppers continuing to stay at home. A Visa Europe study showed spending in the first week of December was almost 3% down on the same period a year ago. Richard Lowe, head of retail at Barclays, was more upbeat. \"November proved to be an uninspiring month, however, the final festive push is underway, with many retailers extending opening hours to ensure they get every last penny through the door,\" he said. The ONS said: \"Compared with November 2011, the quantity of goods bought (all retailing seasonally adjusted sales volumes) in November 2012 was estimated to have increased by 0.9%. Between the same periods the amount spent (all retailing seasonally adjusted sales values) was estimated to have increased by 1.5%. \"Looking at the monthly picture (November 2012 compared with October 2012) there was no change in the quantity of goods bought and a fall of 0.1% in the amount spent, following decreases in both the quantity bought and the amount spent between September and October,\" it added.",

      "bodyText": "Set top box maker Pace has seen its shares drop nearly 6% after they returned from suspension. Trading was halted last Monday after the company confirmed it had submitted an offer to buy Motorola's set top box business from owner Google. But it lost out to a rival bid Arris Group, a cable equipment business which is paying $2.35bn for the business. Pace said it was unable to agree acceptable terms with Google and chief executive Mike Pulli said: We viewed the potential acquisition of Google's Motorola Home business as an opportunity to accelerate our stated strategy, but only if real shareholder value could be delivered. Although we had the support of our major shareholders and committed facilities, we could not reach an appropriate conclusion to the potential transaction.

      "bodyText": "And another green light. Spain's parliament has formally approved the budget for 2013, which aims to cut its deficit deficit to 4.5% of GDP from 6.3% this year. On that note it's time to wrap things up. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back as usual tomorrow. Cyprus finance minister Vassos Shiarly has dismissed reports the IMF wanted investors to take a haircut on their bonds before it would take part in a bailout. According to Reuters, he said: It is an unfounded allegation on which I do not wish to comment. He then did comment: There is no issue of a haircut. These reports are allegations of a position allegedly taken by the IMF. The IMF has never made such a reference and it is unnecessary to even comment on it. He said the level of aid to Cyprus would be clarified in mid-January after an assessment of its banking system, and he expected it to be discussed at a eurozone finance ministers' meeting on 21 January. Now this looks a little disturbing: European markets have closed, and they have closed pretty much unchanged as better than expected US GDP figures were outweighed by concerns about the continuing US budget talks. \u2022 The FTSE 100 slipped 3.25 points or 0.05%, edging away from the 6000 barrier \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.05% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.065 higher \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB was up 0.41% \u2022 Spain's Ibex was unmoved at 8264.2 \u2022 The Athens market closed up 0.26% \u2022 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down just 2.35 points The euro edged lower against the dollar after it hit a near nine month high on Wednesday. It is currently at $1.3236. Europe must get on and complete its planned banking union, as well as improving stress testing of its financial institutions, the IMF has said. In a report on the EU's financial sector, the IMF said significant progress had been made in recent months to strengthen the financial sector. But more needed to be done. It said: The [proposed] single bank supervisor is only an initial step toward an effective banking union - actions toward a single resolution authority with common backstops, a deposit guarantee scheme, and a single rule book, will also be essential. More on Cyprus from Helena Smith. As the year draws to a close, Cyprus has officially marked the end of its presidency of the rotating EU presidency. True to form, the island\u2019s controversial communist president used the occasion to give a rousing speech on the Union\u2019s potential pitfalls at a special lunch closing Cyprus' stint at the EU's helm. Addressing all 26 resident EU ambassadors, president Demetris Christofias waxed lyrical about the urgent need to re-embrace the bloc\u2019s founding principles, starting with the principle of solidarity. \u201cNot so that it can merely serve, as some fear, the unbridled lending from the richer European north to the poorer European south,\" he insisted, \"but to reassert that the word \u201cunion\u201d in the European Union is not devoid of substance.\u201d Christofias, who will not be standing for re-election in presidential elections this February, does not leave the post on the best of notes. Recently the leader broke down as he gave an impassioned speech to an audience of left-wing trade unionists about the tough conditions attached to the island nation\u2019s forthcoming bailout from the EU and IMF. \u201cMy concern and priority has always been for the good of the workers, of the common people,\u201d he said before being forced to reach for a handkerchief, wipe tears away and recompose himself. \u201cI assure you that I shall continue to fight for these values to my last breath.\u201d Christofias\u2019 own children, Christos and Christina, who are members of their father\u2019s AKEL party, have been spotted participating in mass demonstrations against the gruelling austerity measures demanded by international creditors in return for financial support. Both, however, have preferred to attend rowdy protests outside the Nicosia parliament and offices of the European Union than the presidential palace, Christofias' official seat. G\u00e9rard Depardieu, the French actor has said he may leave the country because of the tax increases by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande' government. He told Le Monde that Russia's president Putin had already sent him a passport, prompting Putin's press secretary to say the actor was probably joking. So what are we to make of this: Portugal's privatisation of its TAP airline has been cancelled after the only bidder failed to meet its requirements. The sale of TAP, which has around \u20ac1.2bn of debt, is part of a disposal of assets as part of its \u20ac78bn EU and IMF bailout. But the bidder, Synergy Aerospace owned by Colombian-Brazilan airline entrepreneur German Efromovic, failed to present the necessary bank guarantees, according to Reuters. As the Italian budget was passed by the senate and now passes to the lower house for a vote on Friday or Saturday, technocratic prime minister Mario Monti has been warning the country not to throw away the gains already made. With elections coming next year and fears that key measures could be reversed, Monti said in a speech in Melfi (courtesy of Reuters): It would be irresponsible to waste the many sacrifices Italians have made. In comments seeming directed at his predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi, who had promised to slash taxes, Monti said voters should not be tempted by promises which were \"far from reality.\" If the budget is passed by the lower house, some believe Monti will then call a press conference this weekend to announce his intentions in the election. So far these are shrouded in mystery although many believe he may yet stand. But Berlusconi has warned Monti against this, saying it would be \"morally questionable\" for him to run. Commenting on US GDP, Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Most of the upward revision is explained by a slight upward revision in personal consumption (up by 1.6% versus 1.4% previously estimated) and net trade that now seems to have added nearly 4 tenths to GDP growth versus the 0.14% previously estimated. Government consumption has also been revised a touch higher. Looking ahead, we rule out that US GDP will continue to accelerate in the coming quarters. At the current juncture, we expect Q4 GDP to run at around 2% and no major improvement is expected in the first part of next year. US GDP figures have just come out and they show a bigger than expected gain. The final third quarter rise was 3.1%, compared to expectations of 2.8% and the previous quarter's 2.7%. This is the biggest increase since the fourth quarter of 2011. Meanwhile jobless claims rose to 361,000 last week from a revised 344,000 the previous week. Cyprus is another country to approve its austerity measures, but there are now reports that may not be enough to trigger aid payments. According to a report in der Spiegel (itself quoting S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the International Monetary Fund is demanding a partial default by Cyprus involving private creditors, before it joins the bailout agreement. The IMF is said to be worried that even with the austerity measures, Cyprus would struggle to make the interest payments on its debt. A key quote, according to der Spiegel: \"The situation in Cyprus is much worse than it is in Greece,\" one high-ranking EU official [said]. This is causing some comment on what exactly is being said: BREAKING NEWS. Italy's senate has approved the 2013 budget, which will now pass to the lower house, according to Reuters. Prime minister Mario Monti has also been speaking. Earlier, France passed its own austerity budget. On the theme of looking ahead, what can we expect from the eurozone in 2013? In a report on the prospects, Open Europe's head of economic research, Raoul Ruparel, is not exactly bullish: If 2012 saw a full on crisis in the eurozone, 2013 is likely to be a year of economic stagnation and political uncertainty, with low growth and high unemployment continuing to plague many countries. There will be fewer threats to the eurozone\u2019s existence than in 2012, but the fundamental flaws in the structure of the eurozone remain, and progress towards solving them is likely to continue to be slow. Italy, Spain and France face funding costs of \u20ac332bn, \u20ac195bn and \u20ac243bn respectively, which will keep markets on edge. On this front, liquidity from the ECB and the potential activation of its bond buying programme, the OMT, will help soothe fears in the first half of the year at least. However, politics will be the name of the game. In order to get to the OMT, Spain and others will have to go through the ESM, meaning approval by parliaments in several creditor countries including Germany. This could trigger unexpected delays and tensions. As for the UK and its future within or without Europe, he said: A British exit from the EU became a topic of mainstream discussion in 2012 and will continue to be a front-page issue in 2013, with UKIP on the rise and European elections approaching. In his forthcoming Europe speech \u2013 scheduled for mid-January \u2013 Cameron could well frame the choice for Britain in Europe as one between \u201crenegotiation\u201d and \u201cBrixit\u201d, though may still shy away from promising a concrete referendum. The two issues to watch are how many EU crime and policing laws the UK will remain signed up to, which could be decided next year, and whether Cameron can present a deal on the long-term EU budget as a success. The full piece from the thinktank is here. A quick bit of housekeeping. We'll be running the liveblog as usual tomorrow (Dan Milmo will be in the chair, as I have an urgent rendezvous with a turkey). We're not planning to run a liveblog on Christmas Eve, as we'd hate to distract regular readers from those essential last-minute shopping decisions. There's nothing serious on the agenda - but rest assured that we will leap into action if there is big news. Then I'll be back on Thursday 27th December and Friday 28th December, and I'm also planning to be at my station on Monday 31st (although perhaps not till midnight, eh?) And with that, I must fly.... Have lovely Christmases, one and all. And over to Nick Fletcher.... From Greece, our correspondent Helena Smith says Stournaras\u2019s warning comes amid a welter of good and bad news for the debt-choked country. On the one hand, a new gas pipeline could generate desperately needed revenues. On the other, classrooms may have to close because Greek schools can't afford to heat them ... Here's the good news In what could be the single biggest foreign direct investment (FDI) ever in Greece, the Swiss-based Trans Adriatic Pipeline company announced that it has officially initiated the process to begin \u201chost agreement\u201d talks with the Greek government. The joint venture is competing to deliver gas from the Caspian region to Europe. If selected, Greece would become part of the fourth major gas import corridor for the EU, with the pipeline going through Greece, Albania and under the Adriatic to Italy, TAP officials say. The final selection of the gas transportation route is expected early in 2013. Azerbaijan\u2019s BP-operated Shah Deniz consortium will oversee the process in a deal that would be worth \u20ac1.5bn for the crisis-hit country. TAP is the only option that will go through Greece. \"The host government agreement [governing the group\u2019s investment] is a key step towards securing selection in 2013 of the Greek route,\" TAP's country manager for Greece, Rikard Scoufias, said. \"We are very pleased with our co-operation with the Greek government, and this is yet another significant step towards realising the TAP project, which is destined to bring thousands of direct and indirect job opportunities as well as strengthen Greece's strategic role in Europe.\" Now for the bad news: In another area of the energy sector, Greeks are in for a rough ride, with the nation reeling from the announcement that state-run schools in snow-hit central and northern Greece may have to cancel classes because of a lack of funds to heat them. Under pressure to meet internationally mandated budget targets, the Greek government has slashed funding for school heating oil supplies by around 60% as part of cost-cutting that has seen operational school expenses drop from \u20ac110m in 2011 to \u20ac80m this year. Just as the country is about to be gripped by a cold snap it has emerged that many schools have yet to receive any funding for heating at all. With temperatures due to drop to well below freezing, the primary school teachers\u2019 federation (DOE) said the union may soon \u201chave to suspend classes because of the cold weather\u201d. \u201cMany schools are facing serious problems with heating oil supplies,\u201d DOE said in a statement. Regular readers will know that sky-high oil prices in Greece are a classic case of big monopolies hogging the market. The coalition government has come under immense pressure from foreign lenders to liberalise the energy sector (currently dominated by Motor Oil Hellas and Hellenic Petroleum) as part of a reform programme aimed at opening up the country\u2019s highly regulated economy and boosting competitiveness. Both companies are owned by two of the wealthiest tycoons in Greece, which is also hobbled by the highest fuel taxes on the continent of Europe. An internal report produced by the International Monetary Fund, part of the troika of creditors propping up the insolvent Greek economy, this year attributed uncompetitive markets to the high costs. \u201cThe Greek market is highly concentrated and basically controlled by two domestic refiners,\u201d the report contended, adding that lower fuel prices could help bring down the country\u2019s consumer inflation rate by more than 1%. Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define thinktank is also musing on the issue of how democracy survives within the eurozone: Answers below (or here) Charles Robertson of Renaissance Capital believes Stournaras is absolutely right to caution that Greece's political system could struggle to handle public opposition to its austerity plans. The Greek finance minister's comments (see opening post) echo Robertson's own concerns about Europes austerity programmes \u2013 that people won't tolerate them. He argues that Greece will leave the eurozone next year, with Spain following in 2014: Is an economic policy that has produced 25% unemployment in Spain and Greece, and is forecast to make this worse, a morally acceptable policy choice? How does an electorate react to such a socially damaging manmade disaster? History is unequivocal. The electorate will reject the policy. Taking the Great Depression template for countries leaving the gold standard, we should expect Greece to leave the euro in 2013 and Spain to follow in 2014-15. The former might see markets decline by 10-20% over one quarter. The latter is a Lehmans II event, likely to trigger a 50% fall in markets before a strong rebound. Back to Greece, where the current account deficit has fallen. Good news, you'd think, except the drop is mainly due to tumbling imports rather than a surge of exports. The Greek current account balance came in at -\u20ac684m in October, better than the -\u20ac1.469bn recorded a year earlier. Tourism revenues were also lower, down 19% compared to a year earlier. Meanwhile, independent economist Shaun Richard is encouraged by the latest industrial orders data: 2013 may be crucial for Greece (see 8.18am), but it will be pretty tough for Finland, according to the Finnish finance ministry's new outlook. It has slashed its forecast for growth in 2013 to just 0.5% of GDP, from 1%. It also admitted that the economy probably shrank by 0.1% during 2012, having previously expected growth of 1%. Finland is still one of the few European countries with an AAA rating, but weak growth could put it at risk. The Will he? Won't he? speculation over Mario Monti continues this morning, with conflicting press reports on whether Italy's technocratic PM will run as a candidate. According to the FT, Monti indicated yesterday that he will run, at a meeting with Pier Ferdinando Casini, head of the small UDC party, and Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the head of Ferrari. 'Monti would be the political chief of the operation,' one source said. However, Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper takes the opposite line. It reckons Monti will not be an official candidate in Italy's elections but will back a centrist coalition. That means he could then be appointed to the government after the vote. Either way, Monti is still expected to reveal his plans over the weekend. Downbeat economic news from Italy \u2013 retail sales fell by 1.0% in October compared with September, the steepest monthly fall since April. That means sales were 3.8% lower than a year ago, showing the impact of the Italian recession. Italian inflation is running at 2.8%, so the belt-tightening is more severe in real terms. Yannis Stournaras's warning may have taken some of the shine off the recent rally in Greek bonds. They've lost ground in early trading, pushing up the yield on 10-year debt to over 11.7%, from 11.6% overnight. Still impressively low by recent form \u2013 at the end of May, Greek 10-year bonds were yielding 30%. Good morning, and welcome to another day of rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. Greece's finance minister has slightly deflated the sense of optimism as we ease into the Christmas break, by warning that the country faces another difficult year. Yannis Stournaras has cautioned against getting carried away by recent progress, pointing out that things could unravel next year \"if the political system finds the situation too difficult to handle\". He made the comments in an interview with the Financial Times, published just a day after Greece's credit rating was upgraded. Stournaras is not all doom and despair, arguing that 2013 will be crucial: We can make it next year if we can stick to the programme agreed with the EU and IMF. But only if Greek people accept the job cuts and austerity measures that were contained in the 2013 budget. Stournaras warns that this is far from guaranteed: What we have done so far is necessary but not sufficient to achieve a permanent solution for Greece ... The issue now is implementation. As such, there's a \"possible risk\" of Greece leaving the euro, he added, despite Athens having now received its latest aid tranche. With bond yields falling sharply, and yesterday's general strike passing off peacefully, Greece has reached a calmer state. But it's going to be a grim winter for many Greeks \u2013 and Stournaras is clearly concerned that he may struggle to hit his deficit targets and improve the competitiveness of the battered Greek economy. As he put it: We still face the possible risk of bankruptcy. But get through 2013, and the future will be brighter, he added. The full interview is here: Greece faces \u2018make or break\u2019 year. Worth a read. Anyway, as usual I'll be mopping up the latest developments across the eurozone and beyond ...",

Italy, Spain and France face funding costs of \u20ac332bn, \u20ac195bn and \u20ac243bn respectively, which will keep markets on edge. On this front, liquidity from the ECB and the potential activation of its bond buying programme, the OMT, will help soothe fears in the first half of the year at least.</p> <p>However, politics will be the name of the game. In order to get to the OMT, Spain and others will have to go through the ESM, meaning approval by parliaments in several creditor countries including Germany. This could trigger unexpected delays and tensions.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for the UK and its future within or without Europe, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A British exit from the EU became a topic of mainstream discussion in 2012 and will continue to be a front-page issue in 2013, with UKIP on the rise and European elections approaching.</p> <p>In his forthcoming Europe speech \u2013 scheduled for mid-January \u2013 Cameron could well frame the choice for Britain in Europe as one between \u201crenegotiation\u201d and \u201cBrixit\u201d, though may still shy away from promising a concrete referendum. The two issues to watch are how many EU crime and policing laws the UK will remain signed up to, which could be decided next year, and whether Cameron can present a deal on the long-term EU budget as a success.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full piece from the thinktank is <a href=\"http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Article?id=9723\">here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T12:28:09.560Z\">at 12.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50d2fb1395cb94a7be21b23f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T11:57:24.258Z\">11.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8fc4628a-eb2c-4bcb-ad4a-cd45186555cb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/20/1356004475105/693ac57a-bcb7-4b01-a0c5-0bbde73c0c1c-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Christmas present\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>A quick bit of housekeeping.</strong></p> <p>We'll be running the liveblog as usual tomorrow (<em>Dan Milmo will be in the chair, as I have an urgent rendezvous with a turkey</em>).</p> <p>We're not planning to run a liveblog on Christmas Eve, as we'd hate to distract regular readers from those essential last-minute shopping decisions.

The joint venture is competing to deliver gas from the Caspian region to Europe. If selected, Greece would become part of the fourth major gas import corridor for the EU, with the pipeline going through Greece, Albania and under the Adriatic to Italy, TAP officials say. The final selection of the gas transportation route is expected early in 2013.
