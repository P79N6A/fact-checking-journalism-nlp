      "bodyText": "Nick Beighton, the chief executive of online fashion retailer Asos, has said he has put in a shift at the Barnsley warehouse where concerns were raised about working practices last year and found conditions to be \u201cgreat\u201d. Six local MPs recently visited the warehouse after reports workers often went without regular toilet or water breaks. The company branded those claims \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cinaccurate\u201d and said that people can take toilet and water breaks whenever they want. When asked what action Asos was taking following the MPs\u2019 visit, Beighton said \u201cthere is nothing to resolve\u201d and \u201cno next steps\u201d were planned. Asos is yet to set a date for a visit from another group of MPs from the business energy and innovation strategy committee who are investigating conditions in Barnsley. However, last week Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB union which has been campaigning for change at the Asos warehouse, told the BEIS committee that workers there were on flexible contracts which meant they could receive just 24 hours notice of a change to their hours. He claimed half the workers were employed via agencies with no guarantee of employment. A representative from Transline, the employment agency used by XPO Logistics which operates the warehouse on behalf of Asos, was unable to tell MPs of any specific improvements to conditions there since the GMB criticisms came to light. Beighton said all of Asos\u2019s executive directors had taken on a shift in Barnsley in the last three months. \u201cBarnsley is something we are immensely proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t claim to be perfect, none of us are. But every time we don\u2019t like the sound of [something] we have a look and fix it.\u201d He said the company would be spending \u00a320m on developing the warehouse in the next 12 months, including putting in a wellness centre and gym for workers as well as new sorting equipment. He said Asos had addressed all the allegations made by the GMB and staff satisfaction had now increased. Unveiling a better than expected 38% surge in sales, Beighton said Asos\u2019s twentysomething shoppers cared about the way their clothes were produced and ethically sourcing its products was \u201cnot optional\u201d but a \u201cbusiness imperative\u201d. He said the company had published a list of all its suppliers and put more resources into monitoring the factories it uses around the world in terms of working conditions, health and safety and minimum wage \u201cthroughout the supply chain\u201d. Sales at Asos rose by 38% to \u00a3889.2m in the six months to 28 February as the business benefited from a 54% rise in sales overseas, with particularly strong growth in Australia and Russia. The devaluation of the pound after the EU referendum helped exports which now make up 60% of the group\u2019s sales. Sales in the UK, the London-based firm\u2019s most established territory, rose 18%, despite difficulties in the wider fashion market, as Asos improved its A-List loyalty scheme. But shares in Asos closed down about slightly at \u00a359.53 as the company said profit margins had fallen because of the increased costs from A-List as well as a rise in the price of goods from overseas because of the lower value of the pound. Pre-tax profits rose by 14% to \u00a327.3m. The company said it expected sales for the year to rise by between 30% and 35%, ahead of previous expectations of 25% to 30%, but annual profits would not be higher than predicted because of the increased costs.",

      "bodyText": "With the rise in crude prices helping to lift energy stocks, European shares have ended the day in positive territory. A recovery on Wall Street after an early decline has also helped sentiment, although concerns about President Trump\u2019s ability to push through his tax and spending programmes continue to unsettle investors. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.13 points or 0.54% at 7321.82 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.21% to 12,282.34 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.3% to 5101.13 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.07% to 20,257.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.35% higher at 10,361.2 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.13% to 666.44 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 40 points or 0.2%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Meanwhile here\u2019s JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon talking about the consequences of Brexit in his annual letter to shareholders: Oil prices are moving higher on the expectation of a drop in US oil stocks. Brent crude is up 1.6% at $53.99 ahead of the latest US inventory figures, helped by hopes that Opec and other producers would continue to curtail output, despite the effects of this move being offset by rising US shale production. But with demand picking up, analysts expect US crude stocks to show a decline last week after two weeks of increases. The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to hover in negative territory as investors remain cautious. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Neither a shrinking trade deficit nor a solid factory orders figure could convince the Dow Jones to open in the green this Tuesday.... The next few days are pretty busy for the US, with a pair of services PMIs on Wednesday, the meeting between Trump and China\u2019s President Xi on Thursday and a non-farm Friday; hopefully one of these events will give the Dow a much-needed kick in the backside. More US data, this time showing the third monthly rise in a row for factory goods orders. New orders rose by 1% in February, in line with expectations but down on the 1.5% increase in January. The January figure was revised up from the initial 1.2% rise. Orders were up 4.6% compared to the same time last year. As European markets edge higher, Wall Street is heading in the opposite direction, albeit marginally. The continuing concerns about whether President Trump will be able to meet his promises on tax and infrastructure spending are putting a dampener on investor enthusiasm. On top of that comes Trump\u2019s potentially tricky meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping later this week. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped around 8 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.25 lower. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has issued a paean of praise for the humble banknote, as he launched the new \u20ac50 note in Frankfurt. He said: Although banknotes may not receive as much attention as other aspects of our monetary policy, they are a fundamental part of what we do. And in some ways their role is even more important in the euro area than in other parts of the world. Though electronic payments are becoming more popular, cash is still our most important means of payment. A soon-to-be-published survey on cash use, carried out on behalf of the ECB, shows that over three-quarters of all payments at points-of-sale in the euro area are made in cash. In terms of transaction values, that\u2019s slightly more than half. So even in this digital age, cash remains essential in our economy. After hailing the new note\u2019s security features making it harder to counterfeit, he went on: But there is also another reason why banknotes are a fundamental part of what we do \u2013 one which is more significant for the euro area than for others. In a multi-country union such as ours, it is inevitably harder to create a shared identity than in a single nation state with its own culture and history. The euro is something we all have in common \u2013 it is a tangible symbol of European unity. Back in Europe, and later comes the second debate in the French presidential election, whose outcome is likely to impact the euro. As Kathleen Brooks at City Index points out, some candidates are not attending the final debate on 20 April on the basis that it is too close to the election so tonight\u2019s performances could be key. The polls are suggesting that centrist Emmanuel Macron and far right candidate Marine Le Pen are favourites to make it to the second round, but centre-right candidate Francois Fillon should not be ruled out yet. Brooks says: If this election is as wide open as the polls suggest, then Fillon, with his solid block of conservative voters, could still be in the game. We expect Fillon to give his all in tonight\u2019s debate, and he is likely to come out fighting as this is his last chance to use a public debate to boost his popularity. This might give him a slight advantage above the supposedly safer candidates Macron and Le Pen.... If tonight\u2019s debate sees Fillon perform well then the foreign exchange market could start to price out the chance of a Le Pen victory in the first round, which we believe is one of the reasons why the euro has been under pressure and the French-German yield spread has widened again in the last week or so. A strong Fillon performance could see the euro rally in anticipation of a Macron/ Fillon second round... Overall, there is a chance that the market has been wrong-footed by the polls, and Le Pen is not guaranteed a spot in the second round. If we are correct, then the political premium that has weighed on the euro in recent months could evaporate, allowing the single currency to stage a decent rally as we move into the second quarter. Now this might please Donald Trump - America\u2019s trade gap has hit a four-month low, as exports rise and imports fall. The US trade deficit shank by 9.6% to $43.6bn in February, the US Commerce Department reports, down from $48.2bn in January. That\u2019s lower than expected. Exports rose by 0.2% during the month to $192.2bn, the highest since December 2014. Exports to the European Union jumped by 8%, including a 17.3% surge to the UK and an 8.6% rise to Germany. But America bought less from the rest of the world, with imports dropping by 1.8% to $236.4bn. Imports from China shrank by 20%, or $8.6bn, to $32.8bn. That\u2019s due to the Chinese New Year, which usually distorts economic activity in January and February as firms try to ship orders before the Lunar holiday. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics explains: The trade deficit narrowed sharply in February to $43.6bn, from $48.2bn, as the surge in imports from China ahead of the Lunar New Year Holiday was reversed..... After surging from $27.8bn in December to $32.5bn in January, the bilateral deficit with China shrank back to only $23.0bn.... Unsurprisingly since it is a China made distortion, the surge and subsequent drop back in total imports was concentrated in consumer goods. Something to ponder ahead of the Trump-Xi summit later this week.... The slowdown in UK construction sector growth last month has dampened the mood in the City a little. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, reports: The latest PMI data points to a weaker outlook for construction activity in the UK, primarily driven by a loss of momentum in housing activity. This has sent shares in the sector down, led by a 1.5% fall at Travis Perkins, who just last month said it is bracing itself for tougher times this year. Back in the markets, gold has been pushed to a one-week high by geopolitical concerns. Spot gold has gained 0.6% to $1.260 per ounce; a sign that some investors have been seeking out safe-havens for their money. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga suggests the npredictability of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is a key factor, ahead of the meeting with Chinese premier Xi on Friday. The source behind this wave of risk aversion is the uncertainty gravitating around the pending Trump-Xi summit which investors will be paying heavy attention towards. With participants already noticeably jittery, any potential complications in the meeting could accelerate the flight to safety ultimately elevating Gold\u2019s price further. The visible fact that Gold remains resilient despite Dollar\u2019s resurgence continues to highlight how risk aversion has become a key theme this week. Some more photos from today\u2019s anti-austerity protests in Athens have arrived: Reuters explains why they\u2019re protesting: \u201cTsipras has betrayed us,\u201d said Stelios Vitzilaios as he marched with about another 4,000 pensioners through Athens with the aid of a walking stick. He started work at the age of 14, and now takes a 550-euro pension a month, 100 euros less than pre-crisis levels. Pensioners in the country are often the sole means of support in a household, where a quarter of the workforce is jobless. Several said their pensions were financially supporting unemployed adult members of their family and that they scrimped on food. \u201cWe have cut everything. We only eat beans,\u201d said Triainos Softsis, 82. His 800-euro pension was cut to 650 euro during the crisis, and now, he says, he financially supports two children and grandchildren. The Greek debt crisis is heating up, as public anger over its austerity programme bubbles up again. Thousands of people have taken part in a march in Athens today, protesting against pension cuts under various Greek bailout packages since the crisis began. The demonstration comes as Greece and its lenders continue to struggle to reach an agreement to finally unlock fresh bailout loans, which have been frozen for months. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the situation in Malta on Friday; but it seems unlikely that a deal will be reached in time. Our Athens correspondent, Helens Smith, reports that a team of senior economy ministry officials, lead by finance minister Euclid Tskalaotos, are flying to Brussels for emergency talks about the issue: Monitors representing the EU and IMF were meant to have returned to Athens to continue their progress report yesterday. But with the Greek government regarding the review as an all-inconclusive package that will define Greece\u2019s post-bailout future, talks have stumbled once again over horse trading on the fiscal measures Athens will have to enforce to ensure a primary surplus of 3.5 % once the programme ends in 2018. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras will meet with the European Council president Donald Tusk in Athens tomorrow and is expected to hold telephone talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel later today. He has already said he\u2019ll only accept a deal that also tackles the issue of Greece\u2019s staggering debt pile. Tsipras wants to secure a staff level agreement that would allow monitors to resume inspections in Athens by Friday. But there is also mounting speculation that with its own popularity now in free fall, the leftist led administration may go for broke in a repeat of the drama-filled summer of 2015 with Greece hurtling towards default as massive debt repayments fall due in July. Retail sales across the eurozone have risen, in another sign that the European economy is strengthening. Stats firm Eurostat reports that retail spending rose by 0.7% during February, and was a chunky 1.8% higher than a year ago. Spending on \u2018non-food products\u2019 was 2.8% higher, year-on-year, while spending on food, drink and tobacco rose by 0.8% and petrol spending was up 0.5%. Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank says it backs up earlier upbeat \u2018soft\u2019 data: We\u2019ve also learned today that Britons are paying more at the check-out, as supermarkets pass on higher import costs. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: A sharp rise in food prices has added \u00a321.31 to the average household shopping bill over the past three months, as the level of promotions fell to an 11-year low, according to new grocery market data. The price of everyday goods at supermarkets rose 2.3% in the three months to 26 March from a year ago, said Kantar Worldpanel, a sharp pick-up from the 0.2% food price inflation recorded in the 12 weeks to 1 January \u2013 the first time prices rose in just over two years. More here: Kathleen Brooks of City Index reckons that today\u2019s construction figures, and yesterday\u2019s slowdown in factory growth, suggest that the UK economy is slowing. She writes: Of course, this is early days, and the PMI surveys are impacted by multiple factors, but the decline in the manufacturing and construction PMIs, two sectors impacted by Brexit, suggests that the economic impact of the decision to leave the EU may start to show itself more than nine months after the vote to leave the EU. The key test will be the services sector PMI due out on Wednesday, if it\u2019s a hat trick of weaker than expected data, we would expect this to be reflected in weaker sterling and UK equities. GBP/USD had a bad start to the quarter, but it has found some support at the 50-day sma at 1.2430 this morning, this is helping to boost sterling for now, but we could see it falling below this level if the economic data starts to slow. March\u2019s construction PMI is the second weakest reading since last September, when the economy shook off the immediate shock of the Brexit vote. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says today\u2019s report is \u201clargely uninspiring\u201d, especially given the slowdown in new housebuilding. He writes: Expansion was at the equal lowest level (with January) since last September\u2019 largely due to slower housebuilding growth which will be particularly disappointing for the government given its desire to lift the UK\u2019s housing stock to tackle the acute shortage.... Following on from a third successive modestly softer manufacturing purchasing managers survey for March, the lacklustre construction PMI maintains suspicion the UK economy is beginning to falter. Signs of slowing UK growth is particularly evident in consumer spending. Paul Trigg, construction specialist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, is worried that UK construction firms will be dragged down by economic headwinds and rising inflation. \u201cDespite 526 privately owned construction companies failing so far this year, the level of sector insolvencies has remained elevated but stable over the last 12 months. Businesses are generally reporting robust trading conditions, particularly across civil engineering which has been buoyed by Government commitments to keep the UK building. \u201cAn increase in construction failures appears unavoidable as the economic headwinds of Brexit strengthen. The commercial market is particularly fragile and those companies at the end of the supply chain, such as fit-out businesses, will be hit hardest by an increase in overdue payments \u2013 the inevitable consequence of falling retail sales and rising inflation.\u201d Brexit fears may have receded for now, but many builders are worrying how they\u2019ll find enough brickies, plasterers and electricians once the UK leaves the EU. Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, explains: \u201cCivil engineering continues to be the star performer in the sector thanks to a number of mega-projects in the works across the UK, some of which were given the green light before the EU referendum. \u201cWith the triggering of Article 50 last week, the most significant issue on the industry\u2019s radar remains labour. Almost 10% of UK construction workers are from the EU and in London that rises to a quarter. Contractors are therefore keen to understand what can be done to maintain access to this labour, otherwise they potentially face both increased costs and project delays. Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade, says the UK construction figures are \u201cunderwhelming\u201d. \u201cWhile the purchasing managers\u2019 index still indicates growth, it\u2019s very modest. UK construction has been largely in retreat since December\u2019s figure of 54.2 and there are dark clouds forming over the sector. \u201cThe housing market appears somewhat weary and the UK economy overall is likely to slow as it navigates its way through Brexit. All eyes will now be on tomorrow\u2019s PMI services data.\u201d Today\u2019s report suggests that Britain\u2019s building sector barely grew in the last quarter: Here are the key findings from Markit\u2019s report into the UK construction sector: Business activity growth eases in March Housing slowdown offsets rebound in civil engineering and commercial work Input price inflation slows further from January\u2019s peak Breaking: Growth in Britain\u2019s building industry slowed a little last month, as housebuilding lost momentum. But builders are still upbeat about their prospects for this year, as worries over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU fade a little. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s construction PMI, which measures activity across the sector. It has fallen to 52.2 for March, down from 52.5 in February, and lower than expected. Building firms reported that new business was still subdued, with some clients holding back from commissioning projects due to squeezed budgets, and planning delays. But construction bosses also reported that \u201creduced Brexit-related anxiety and the resilient economic backdrop\u201d was helping, Markit says. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says that builders remain confident, despite signs that growth is weakening: \u201cUK construction firms experienced a growth slowdown in March, with the loss of momentum centred on housebuilding. A weaker trend for residential work has been reported throughout 2017 so far, which provides an indication that the cooling UK housing market has started to act as a drag on the construction sector. \u201cCivil engineering projects were the construction sector\u2019s main growth engine in March, driven by rising infrastructure spending and a strong pipeline of new work throughout the UK. \u201cMarch data showed a slight rebound in commercial construction activity. Survey respondents noted that the resilient economic backdrop and receding Brexit- related anxieties have helped to stabilise client demand after the disruption to development projects last summer. I\u2019ll pull together more reaction now South African government bonds have fallen sharply this morning, matching the drop in the rand. Shares in the country\u2019s banks are also being hit, on worries that other credit ratings could follow S&amp;P and downgrade South Africa to Junk. Economist Wandile Sihlobo has tweeted a chart showing how SA\u2019s credit rating rose steadily after apartheid was abolished, but has been falling since the financial crisis: That partly reflects the rise and fall of commodity prices over the period. In the City, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 40 points in early trading to 7321 - helped by a falling pound. Gold maker Randgold are the biggest rise, up 1.7%, followed by packaging firm Bunzl. Major exporters such as Rolls-Royce and AstraZeneca are also up, benefitting from sterling\u2019s weakness. The pound has shed half a cent this morning, dropping back to $1.2425 ahead of today\u2019s construction figures. However, the crisis in South Africa is pulling down companies with exposure to the country, such as insurer Old Mutual. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets warns: South Africa\u2019s Rand has taken another dive overnight after S&amp;P cut the nation\u2019s sovereign credit rating to \u2018junk\u2019 in light of recent political upheaval. Keep an eye on the likes of FTSE-listed Old Mutual, Investec and Mondi which are all exposed to the currency and have already been troubled of late as a consequence. Over in Tokyo, the Nikkei stock index has hit a 10-week low. Investors are fretting about Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese premier Xi later this week. Weak US car sales figures released on Monday are also dampening the mood Kit Juckes of Societe Generale senses a gloomy mood in the markets: There\u2019s an abundance of angst this morning, stemming from weak US car data, the explosion in the St Petersburg subway, the prospect of Donald Trump meeting Xi Jinping at the end of the week and the rapidly approaching French election. S&amp;P\u2019s downgrade will deter some risk-averse investors from holding South African debt, as Paul Donovan of UBS explains: The move was anticipated by markets (credit rating agency actions normally are), but it does have a bearing on the universe of investors who can invest in the country. The South African rand is suffering fresh losses this morning, as the political crisis gripping the country threatens its credit rating. The rand has tumbled by 1.5% to below 13.8 rand to the US dollar. That extends last week\u2019s losses, triggered by the sacking of well-respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan. The slump came after Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s slashed South Africa\u2019s credit rating into Junk status, from BBB- to BB+, with a negative outlook. S&amp;P warned that \u201cthe likelihood that economic growth and fiscal outcomes could suffer\u201d had increased, following prime minister Jacob Zuma\u2019s cabinet reshuffle. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed fears that the rand could suffer further losses. The elevated political risks after firing the finance minister will continue to be reflected in the country\u2019s currency. From a fundamental perspective, the rand looks undervalued, but how much lower it might drop in the short run depends on the political developments. A 5-10% fall from current levels is very likely. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u2019s slowdown in UK manufacturing growth, Britain\u2019s construction sector is in the spotlight. Markit\u2019s Construction Purchasing Managers Index, due a 9.30, will show how Britain\u2019s builders fared in March. Economists are expecting to see another month of steady but unspectacular growth, with the PMI unchanged at 52.5. But a weaker reading might worry the City, as traders look for signs of economic uncertainty. As Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group puts it: If UK construction growth disappoints like manufacturing, it will be another dose of cold water poured on the UK economic outlook post-Brexit. Also coming up today: The European Central Bank is launching the new \u20ac50 note in Frankfurt at 2.30pm GMT. ECB president Mario Draghi will say a few words. In the economic calendar, we get eurozone retail sales figures for February at 10am GMT, and US factory orders data at 3pm GMT. Research group Kantar Worldpanel are publishing the latest supermarket sales figures. And in the City, online fashion chain ASOS is reporting results.",

A soon-to-be-published survey on cash use, carried out on behalf of the ECB, shows that over three-quarters of all payments at points-of-sale in the euro area are made in cash.

Brooks says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If this election is as wide open as the polls suggest, then Fillon, with his solid block of conservative voters, could still be in the game.</p> <p> We expect Fillon to give his all in tonight\u2019s debate, and he is likely to come out fighting as this is his last chance to use a public debate to boost his popularity. This might give him a slight advantage above the supposedly safer candidates Macron and Le Pen....</p> <p>If tonight\u2019s debate sees Fillon perform well then the foreign exchange market could start to price out the chance of a Le Pen victory in the first round, which we believe is one of the reasons why the euro has been under pressure and the French-German yield spread has widened again in the last week or so. A strong Fillon performance could see the euro rally in anticipation of a Macron/ Fillon second round...</p> <p> Overall, there is a chance that the market has been wrong-footed by the polls, and Le Pen is not guaranteed a spot in the second round. If we are correct, then the political premium that has weighed on the euro in recent months could evaporate, allowing the single currency to stage a decent rally as we move into the second quarter.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfdfe9a0ec84a9d33c96eb7787a0f1127912be13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfdfe9a0ec84a9d33c96eb7787a0f1127912be13/176_0_4262_2992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Socialist candidate for the presidential election Benoit Hamon, centre, greets from left to right, Francois Fillon, Emmanuel Macron, far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, and Marine Le Pen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Socialist candidate for the presidential election Benoit Hamon, centre, greets from left to right, Francois Fillon, Emmanuel Macron, far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, and Marine Le Pen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e39418e4b007e8557f29b5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-04T12:58:38.956Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US trade gap narrows as exports surge</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42587c02cad0cdb5cbbf82e55d5b18066bf90114\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42587c02cad0cdb5cbbf82e55d5b18066bf90114/0_0_4368_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Port of Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"588\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Port of Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Now this might please Donald Trump - America\u2019s trade gap has hit a four-month low, as exports rise and imports fall.</strong></p> <p>The US trade deficit shank by 9.6% to $43.6bn in February, the US Commerce Department reports, down from $48.2bn in January.

      "bodyText": "\u2018We don\u2019t do ordinary,\u201d declares the billboard at the entrance to the Battersea power station building site in London, where cranes are busy conjuring up a new world of 3,500 homes, 150 shops and 15,000 jobs from the mud. After standing derelict for decades, Giles Gilbert Scott\u2019s majestic temple to electricity will soon be surrounded by a forest of luxury apartment blocks, some in the shape of thrashing metallic flowers by Frank Gehry, another like a writhing glass snake by Norman Foster, all clustered around a plunging piazza by Bjarke Ingels. It is a heady cocktail of competing forms and egos that will make the gargantuan brick cathedral seem almost humble in comparison. It is true that the developers of Europe\u2019s largest regeneration project don\u2019t appear to do ordinary. But they don\u2019t seem to do many black people either. In the computer-generated visions emblazoned across the site hoardings, the bustling cafe-lined streets are inhabited by an almost entirely monocultural society of white thirtysomethings. Women with long blond hair and shopping bags, occasionally accessorised with prams, fill the foreground of a scene drenched with that scorching Miami sunshine so familiar to this part of Britain\u2019s capital. \u201cNew exciting concept coming soon,\u201d coos another billboard over a vacant shopfront where this tableau is intended to unfold. The new real-estate concept of ethnic cleansing. It might seem like an odd decision, particularly given that the project is masterminded by a Malaysian consortium, and that the first phase of flats was sold mainly to buyers in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. But therein lies the answer: speak to any property-marketing agency and they will tell you their east-Asian clients are buying a piece of England, which \u2013 for them \u2013 means blond-haired, blue-eyed Burberry models. The whitewashing continues up the Dubai-style strip of Nine Elms, along the Thames to Vauxhall, where \u00a315bn of international investment is shaping the riverside into a gauntlet of luxury enclaves. Surrounding the new US embassy in a \u00a31bn fortified arc of paranoia, \u201cLondon\u2019s new diplomatic precinct\u201d of Embassy Gardens trumpets the arrival of \u201ca London address with international significance\u201d. But not that international: its hoardings are once again populated by white models staring into the middle distance, trying their best to look like dashing diplomats as they loll in the glass-bottomed swimming pool that will connect two of the towers, hoping that its glass is as bombproof as the 6in-thick windows of the embassy next door. It\u2019s the same story down the road at the Albert Embankment, where a clutch of silvery silos by Foster and Partners now stands, topped with \u00a322m penthouses. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a place like this, you literally have London at your feet,\u201d proclaims the billboard of the Corniche, showing this new-look London to be a place populated solely by Caucasians. For a bit of balance, a solitary Asian face stares forlornly out from one of the building\u2019s goldfish-bowl windows, trapped in her hermetically sealed investment unit. The marketers say it\u2019s an accident. \u201cI would be appalled if people thought this was conscious ethnic cleansing,\u201d says William Murray of Wordsearch, the communications agency behind the branding of Battersea power station and many of the world\u2019s most exclusive developments, from the Shard to One World Trade Center in New York. \u201cIt just comes down to whatever stock people the rendering company happens to have in its image library. Visualisations are a blunt tool, not something to be relied upon as representative of the place being created. We spend a lot of time discussing what kind of clothes people are wearing, not what colour their skin is.\u201d As developers compete for attention with ever-more elaborate pieces of \u201cplacemaking\u201d, construction hoardings have become a parody of themselves, a phenomenon recorded in all its surreal glory on the Development Aesthetics blog. Property companies no longer build homes, but \u201ccurate concepts\u201d. They don\u2019t sell flats, but offer \u201cboutique collections\u201d. On the Greenwich Peninsula, where Hong Kong developer Knight Dragon is busy building a new quarter of 16,000 homes, buyers are invited to \u201cjoin the land rush\u201d, with an image of white settlers loaded into a horse-drawn wagon. \u201cBe a peninsula original,\u201d along with the other 16,000 lumberjack-shirt-wearing pioneers. Across town, Chelsea Barracks claims to be \u201cthe most coveted 12.8 acres in the world,\u201d a place where you can acquire \u201cA Heritage. A Destiny. A Legacy\u201d of Britishness, courtesy of the development arm of the Qatari royal family. Others are more desperate. \u201cDrink beverages together,\u201d is the glamorous lifestyle opportunity offered by Stratford\u2019s Prospect East, while in the newly minted speculators\u2019 hotbed of Aldgate East, they have decided to do away with any pretence of building actual homes for people to live in. \u201cOff-plan investment opportunities,\u201d trumpets one hoarding. \u201cProven return. Project 54% growth to 2020.\u201d As prices have inflated beyond all reason in the capital, investors are flocking to the regions to find better rental yields on \u201caffordable luxury\u201d schemes outside the bubble, from Manchester and Liverpool to Birmingham and Leeds. In Salford Quays, the first of four 26-storey barcode-striped towers is fast rising out of the ground, but there is no marketing suite in sight. The 1,100-flat \u201cX1\u201d scheme is aimed specifically at buy-to-let investors who will likely never even visit, hence the build quality and the towers\u2019 tacky grey livery in keeping with the Carbuncle Cup-winning MediaCityUK complex nearby. A little further east, north Manchester has been rebranded as NOMA, an \u00a3800m 20-acre lifestyle concept that claims to be \u201cwhere the modern world began\u201d \u2013 although any evidence of that heritage will soon be trampled beneath \u201cManchester\u2019s most exclusive and iconic landmark\u201d in the form of a 36-storey slab of luxury flats. In Liverpool, that historic hub of international trade, the origins of overseas investment are making themselves known more explicitly than ever before with the arrival of New Chinatown, a \u00a3200m symbol of \u201cthe burgeoning energy and dynamism of modern China transplanted into the heart of an historic world heritage city\u201d. Emerging from behind bright-red billboards below the Anglican Cathedral, the development will feature 800 five-star serviced apartments looking on to a sunken Chinese bazaar, based on the \u201cidea and motif of the awakening dragon \u2013 a powerful symbol of China\u2019s resurgence and status as a new global power\u201d. As Hong Kong-based estate agent Neil Jensen told the Guardian: \u201cYou can\u2019t just put up a block of flats in Liverpool and expect people to buy it \u2026 If you want foreign buyers, there has to be a story.\u201d Such stories are increasingly being told on the other side of the world from where the concrete realities are taking shape. Most buyers of these kind of schemes will never see the roadside hoarding, but acquire their assets at an exhibition stand in a far-flung hotel lobby. In the deserted marketing suite at the Battersea power station site, which is clad with vaguely crumpled metal panels to hint at the coming Gehry, a sales assistant admits that most of the units have already been sold off-plan overseas \u2013 but that now I have the chance to buy one back at a premium. \u201cMany of the investors are reselling their units before the project has even been finished,\u201d he says, handing me a PlayStation controller so I can take a walk through my virtual future home. \u201cThey only paid 20%, then they\u2019ll sell them on again a year or so before completion and make a load of money, which is pretty cool.\u201d But is it possible that many are ditching their assets as fast as they can, realising there is a huge glut of oversupply at the top end of the market? Thankfully, I\u2019m still in time to snap up a \u00a31.7m Gehry two-bed, or a penthouse on the roof of the power station for \u00a345m. The globalised nature of the high-end property market is having an interesting effect on how developments are being presented on the street. Given that the UK\u2019s super-prime apartments are increasingly sold elsewhere, via agents trained to ensnare the world\u2019s ultra-high-net-worth individuals, the traditional site hoarding is mutating from a device to sell flats into an instrument to appease the local community. It has evolved from glitzy advert to defensive justification, trumpeting the community benefits that the project will bring. \u201cOver 50% of the development is public realm,\u201d insists a sign at the foot of the swollen 53-storey shaft of One Blackfriars, a building that attracted ridicule for its promotional video, which featured a young couple arriving in the capital in a private helicopter, visiting museums and \u201cexclusive boutiques\u201d before heading to their penthouse. \u201c50 Shades of Grotesque,\u201d tweeted writer Nereida Diesent. \u201cBritish condo pitch or trailer for the worst soft-core porn flick ever?\u201d But at least we now know that half of the luxury tower will be open to anyone to walk in whenever they please. Stung by the widespread animosity, the developer of One Blackfriars, St George, a branch of the Berkeley Group, now stresses the local benefits of its bulbous totem. \u201cNot only building homes, but building futures,\u201d says the hoarding. \u201cOver 200 new jobs created upon completion of the development.\u201d Never mind that the project gets away with providing no affordable housing on site, paying just 4% of its total value to the council instead. The Berkeley Group continues to propagandise its philanthropy across the capital wherever it can. A large sign outside the Corniche lists the total bounty that the developer has magnanimously given back to the community. It asserts that \u201cover the last five years, Berkeley has contributed \u00a31.5bn to pay for affordable housing, as well as \u00a3396m to help pay for schools, parks, shops, transport and other public amenities\u201d. The project in question contains \u201c84 affordable senior living homes,\u201d it adds, using the Newspeak definition of affordable: the one-bed retirement flats start at \u00a3565,000, and they will be overshadowed by the hotel next door. I conclude my luxury property safari at the dense thicket of concrete stumps that will soon be Southbank Place, \u201ca location where residents feel they have truly arrived\u201d. This \u00a31.3bn joint venture by the Canary Wharf Group and Qatari Diar will see 900 flats squeezed in behind the London Eye and packed so close together that, according to an independent survey, a third will fall below the minimum daylight standards. The estate agents\u2019 sales strategy identifies the target market as \u201cinternational tycoons\u201d and \u201cMiddle Eastern couples\u201d, but I give it a go anyway. I am greeted by a jovial butler, who politely hides his disbelief at my intention to buy a \u00a31m studio apartment, and ushers me into the oak-lined corridors of County Hall to await my tour of a glowing buffet of Perspex models, where a Chinese family and their agent are exploring touch-screen panoramas of their penthouse options. It turns out to be an appropriate setting for such a scene. This palatial suite, with windows looking out over the Thames, used to be the office of Ken Livingstone when he was head of the leftwing Greater London Council. As mayor of London, he first opened the doors of the capital to investors as a place to park their cash. \u201cI was very keen to get foreign investment into London,\u201d Livingstone said in an interview last year. \u201cBut that was in terms of constructing developments and creating new jobs, not flogging them off to people who just keep them there in case there is a coup and they have to flee.\u201d Southbank Place will have plenty of those, but it also professes to be a mixed community. The sales assistant assures me there are handful of affordable homes, though I won\u2019t have to meet the residents; they are tucked round the back in a separate block facing the main road. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 April 2017. An earlier version said the first phase of flats in the Battersea power station development was \u201csold exclusively to buyers in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong\u201d; that should have said \u201csold mainly to\u2026\u201d.",

Most buyers of these kind of schemes will never see the roadside hoarding, but acquire their assets at an exhibition stand in a far-flung hotel lobby.</p> <p>In the deserted marketing suite at the Battersea power station site, which is clad with vaguely crumpled metal panels to hint at the coming Gehry, a sales assistant admits that most of the units have already been sold off-plan overseas \u2013 but that now I have the chance to buy one back at a premium. \u201cMany of the investors are reselling their units before the project has even been finished,\u201d he says, handing me a PlayStation controller so I can take a walk through my virtual future home. \u201cThey only paid 20%, then they\u2019ll sell them on again a year or so before completion and make a load of money, which is pretty cool.\u201d But is it possible that many are ditching their assets as fast as they can, realising there is a huge glut of oversupply at the top end of the market? Thankfully, I\u2019m still in time to snap up a \u00a31.7m Gehry two-bed, or a penthouse on the roof of the power station for \u00a345m.</p> <p>The globalised nature of the high-end property market is having an interesting effect on how developments are being presented on the street. Given that the UK\u2019s super-prime apartments are increasingly sold elsewhere, via agents trained to ensnare the world\u2019s ultra-high-net-worth individuals, the traditional site hoarding is mutating from a device to sell flats into an instrument to appease the local community. It has evolved from glitzy advert to defensive justification, trumpeting the community benefits that the project will bring.</p> <p>\u201cOver 50% of the development is public realm,\u201d insists a sign at the foot of the swollen 53-storey shaft of One Blackfriars, a building that attracted ridicule for its promotional video, which featured a young couple arriving in the capital in a private helicopter, visiting museums and \u201cexclusive boutiques\u201d before heading to their penthouse. <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/luxury-london-flat-advert-branded-the-creepiest-thing-you-will-ever-see-9966793.html\">\u201c50 Shades of Grotesque,\u201d tweeted writer Nereida Diesent</a>. \u201cBritish condo pitch or trailer for the worst soft-core porn flick ever?\u201d But at least we now know that half of the luxury tower will be open to anyone to walk in whenever they please.</p> <p>Stung by the widespread animosity, the developer of One Blackfriars, St George, a branch of the Berkeley Group, now stresses the local benefits of its bulbous totem. \u201cNot only building homes, but building futures,\u201d says the hoarding. \u201cOver 200 new jobs created upon completion of the development.\u201d Never mind that the project gets away with providing no affordable housing on site, paying just <a href=\"http://35percent.org/one-blackfriars/\">4% of its total value to the council instead</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a4da968d528701785732016686e18ed1baede15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a4da968d528701785732016686e18ed1baede15/0_146_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billboards outside the Corniche.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Billboards outside the Corniche.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Berkeley Group continues to propagandise its philanthropy across the capital wherever it can. A large sign outside the Corniche lists the total bounty that the developer has magnanimously given back to the community. It asserts that \u201cover the last five years, Berkeley has contributed \u00a31.5bn to pay for affordable housing, as well as \u00a3396m to help pay for schools, parks, shops, transport and other public amenities\u201d. The project in question contains \u201c84 affordable senior living homes,\u201d it adds, using the Newspeak definition of affordable: <a href=\"http://www.retiremove.co.uk/shared-ownership-retirement-properties-launching-londons-south-bank/\">the one-bed retirement flats start at \u00a3565,000</a>, and they will be overshadowed by the hotel next door.</p> <p>I conclude my luxury property safari at the dense thicket of concrete stumps that will soon be <a href=\"http://www.southbank-place.com/\">Southbank Place</a>, \u201ca location where residents feel they have truly arrived\u201d. This \u00a31.3bn joint venture by the Canary Wharf Group and Qatari Diar will see 900 flats squeezed in behind the London Eye and packed so close together that, according to an independent survey, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">third will fall below the minimum daylight standards</a>. The estate agents\u2019 sales strategy identifies the target market as <a href=\"https://tbij.atavist.com/viability\">\u201cinternational tycoons\u201d and \u201cMiddle Eastern couples\u201d</a>, but I give it a go anyway. I am greeted by a jovial butler, who politely hides his disbelief at my intention to buy a \u00a31m studio apartment, and ushers me into the oak-lined corridors of County Hall to await my tour of a glowing buffet of Perspex models, where a Chinese family and their agent are exploring touch-screen panoramas of their penthouse options.</p> <p>It turns out to be an appropriate setting for such a scene. This palatial suite, with windows looking out over the Thames, used to be the office of Ken Livingstone when he was head of the leftwing Greater London Council. As mayor of London, he first opened the doors of the capital to investors as a place to park their cash.</p> <p>\u201cI was very keen to get foreign investment into London,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/sadiq-khan-condemns-foreign-investors-london-homes-gold-bricks-housing-policy\">Livingstone said in an interview last year</a>. \u201cBut that was in terms of constructing developments and creating new jobs, not flogging them off to people who just keep them there in case there is a coup and they have to flee.\u201d Southbank Place will have plenty of those, but it also professes to be a mixed community. The sales assistant assures me there are handful of affordable homes, though I won\u2019t have to meet the residents; they are tucked round the back in a separate block facing the main road.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 April 2017. An earlier version said the first phase of flats in the Battersea power station development was \u201csold exclusively to buyers in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong\u201d; that should have said \u201csold mainly to\u2026\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s North Sea oil and gas industry was a net drain on the UK\u2019s public finances for the first time last year, as the slump in the oil price hit company profits. The sector received \u00a3396m, net of tax payments, from the government in 2016 compared with a contribution to the exchequer of \u00a3381m the previous year, according to analysis by energy specialist Carbon Brief. As recently as 2011, the industry\u2019s contribution to the government\u2019s coffers amounted to more than \u00a310bn. \u201cThe sector is no longer the cash cow chancellors have come to expect over the past several decades,\u201d said Carbon Brief\u2019s policy editor, Simon Evans. The oil price, which was as high at $114 (\u00a391) a barrel in 2014, fell to below $30 last year as a supply glut coincided with with falling demand as the global economy stuttered. Attempts by oil producers at Opec to curtail output have only had limited success, not helped by an upturn in US shale production, and Brent crude has only recovered to around $53. Evans said: \u201cIf [companies] are operating at a loss in the current year, they can claim a rebate on tax paid in previous years. This latter factor is likely to have been quite significant, given oil prices crashed to $30 by early 2016, only rising towards $50 by later in the year. [At these levels] they were probably operating at a loss and reclaiming tax.\u201d Firms can also claim rebates on the cost of decommissioning rigs, pipelines and other infrastructure as some of the largest North Sea fields come to the end of their lives. Although these are probably not significant yet, with decommissioning of Brent only beginning this year, the Oil and Gas Authority has estimated that the clean-up could cost \u00a347bn between now and 2050. Another study said the cost could be as high as \u00a375bn. In total, the oil and gas sector has contributed about \u00a3190bn in tax revenues since the 1960s, not adjusted for inflation. But the future outlook is uncertain, given the costs of decommissioning and the fluctuations in the oil price. In March 2016 the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that the sector would receive a net payment of \u00a31bn a year for the next five years from UK taxpayers. However with the recovery in oil prices, last month, the OBR predicted the sector would in fact contribute \u00a34.5bn over the five-year period. In a separate analysis of government figures, Carbon Brief said BP, ExxonMobil and Shell were the largest recipients of taxpayer funds to help cover the cost of decommissioning old oil and gas fields. The top five recipients (BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, Talisman Sinopec and Hess) were paid a net total of more than \u00a31.1bn across 2014 and 2015, according to Carbon Brief.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, has warned the cycle of surging house prices, where people are investing in residential property in the hope of ongoing capital gains, further fuelling house prices, is a risk to Australia\u2019s economy. He has warned too many loans are still being made to borrowers with the \u201cskinniest of income buffers\u201d and says banks must stop issuing so many interest-only loans. He has pointed a finger at \u201ctaxation arrangements\u201d \u2013 negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount \u2013 that led to a surge in interest-only loans in the last 12 months. He has also flagged more regulatory measures from the Council of Financial Regulators if last week\u2019s attempts to curb investor lending do not encourage banks to stop issuing so many mortgages. It is his strongest intervention yet to the debate about runaway house prices. \u201cOver the past year, close to 40% of the housing loans made in Australia have not required the scheduled repayment of even one dollar of principal at least in the first years of the life of the loan; only interest payments are required,\u201d Lowe said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is unusual by international standards.\u201d Speaking at the Reserve Bank board dinner on Tuesday night in Melbourne, Lowe said current problems with specific housing markets in Australia were complicated, and were generally caused by a lack of supply. But the lack of supply has been exacerbated by easy availability of credit which has amplified demand, he said. He said banks must pay special attention to their serviceability assessments, because \u201ctoo many loans are still being made where the borrower has the skinniest of income buffers after interest payments.\u201d \u201cIn some cases, lenders are assuming that people can live more frugally than in practice they can, leaving little buffer if things go wrong.\u201d He said last week\u2019s attempt by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to dampen investor lending should help to pull the \u201cwhole system\u201d back to a more sustainable position. This included reducing the proportion of new loans that are interest-only. \u201cA reduced reliance on interest-only loans in Australia would be a positive development and would help improve our resilience,\u201d he said. \u201cWith interest rates so low, now is a good time for us to move in this direction. \u201cHopefully, the change might encourage a few more people to think about the merit of taking out very large interest-only loans when interest rates are near historical lows.\u201d \u201cThe RBA welcomes these latest changes.\u201d Lowe\u2019s warning comes a day after data showed Sydney property prices surged by almost 20% over the past year, putting the city at the front of a nationwide trend that has seen dwelling values increase by 12.9% on average. Data from CoreLogic, released on Monday, showed house values in Melbourne (up 17.15%), Canberra (13.64%), and Hobart (11.05%) have followed Sydney\u2019s rapid rise. On Friday the banking regulator, Apra, wrote to major lenders warning them to tighten their lending practices on investor and interest-only loans. Lowe said on Tuesday that the Council of Financial Regulators would consider further regulatory measures if Apra\u2019s latest intervention did not work. However, he also said we must be realistic about what these and other prudential measures could achieve. \u201cThe underlying driver in our housing market is the balance between supply and demand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe availability of credit is undoubtedly a factor that can amplify demand, but it is not the root cause. \u201cThis assessment is consistent with the observation that housing market dynamics currently differ significantly across the country, despite Australia having nationwide financial institutions and the level of interest rates being the same across the country. \u201cIt is hard to escape the conclusion that we need to address the supply side if we are to avoid ever-rising housing costs relative to our incomes and to avoid the attendant incentive to borrow that is created by rising housing prices,\u201d he said. The RBA left the official interest rate on hold on Tuesday, at 1.5%.",

      "bodyText": "A sharp rise in food prices has added \u00a321.31 to the average household shopping bill over the past three months as the number of promotions fell to an 11-year low, according to new grocery market data. The price of everyday goods at supermarkets rose 2.3% in the three months to 26 March from a year ago, said Kantar Worldpanel, a sharp pick-up from the 0.2% food price inflation recorded in the 12 weeks to 1 January \u2013 the first time prices rose in more than two years. Rising prices for everyday staples such as butter, fish, tea and skincare have been partially offset by falling prices for crisps, bacon, chocolate and fresh poultry, Kantar said. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cWe expect inflation to continue to accelerate, and as a result we\u2019re likely to see consumers looking for cheaper alternatives. A reduction in promotional activity means the proportion of spending on promotions now stands at just 32.9% \u2013 5.5 percentage points lower than last year.\u201d Supermarkets have been cutting multi-buy deals and other special offers, after mounting evidence that they confuse shoppers and increase food waste. Separate data from Nielsen showed the proportion of consumer spending on promotions at UK supermarkets has fallen to an 11-year low. Just over a quarter (26%) of money spent at supermarkets went on products with temporary price cuts or multibuy offers in the four weeks to 25 March, the lowest level since 2006. Supermarkets\u2019 own-label products are more affected than other categories: 18% of sales went on promotional spending, compared with 41% of branded goods sales. \u201cThe level of promotional spend has gone back to levels not seen since before the 2008-09 economic crisis,\u201d said Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight. \u201cThe last few years have seen about a third of the typical supermarket shopping bill going on promotional items. However, to be more price competitive, supermarkets have turned temporary price reductions into permanent cuts, so there\u2019s less promotional activity as many prices are cheaper all-year round.\u201d Last year, Sainsbury\u2019s became the first of the major supermarkets to phase out controversial \u201cbuy 1, get 1 free\u201d offers in favour of lower everyday prices. However, the sharp slide in the pound since the Brexit vote last June has increased the cost of imported goods, and grocers have been passing on the rises to customers. Kantar said supermarket sales of \u201cfree from\u201d products grew by 36% year on year in the past three months, with more than half the population (54%) purchasing a gluten or dairy-free product. That\u2019s 3.3m more people than last year, led by younger shoppers keen to eat healthily. Supermarket sales and market share German discounters Lidl and Aldi have reached new record market shares and together account for 11.7% of the grocery market, according to Kantar. Lidl was the fastest-growing retailer with sales growth of 15%, taking its market share to 4.9%. Aldi increased sales by 14.3%, taking its share to 6.8%. Iceland posted its strongest sales growth since March 2013, of 9.8%, after introducing more fresh and chilled lines. Bigger rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda have seen sales and market share slip. Morrisons was the only one of the big four to achieve higher sales, of 0.3% in the past 12 weeks.",

      "bodyText": "The British travel industry is urging the government to protect the many benefits currently enjoyed by UK holidaymakers under EU membership, including visa-free travel and free or reduced healthcare, in Brexit negotiations. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) wants ministers to maintain Britons\u2019 ability to travel freely within Europe and beyond and protect existing consumer rights including compensation for delayed and cancelled flights. It is lobbying the government to secure the UK\u2019s continued participation in the European Health Insurance Card scheme, which guarantees UK travellers reciprocal access to healthcare across Europe. In a new report, Making a Success of Brexit for Travel and Tourism, Abta sets out priorities for the negotiations that have implications for UK holidaymakers and the travel industry. Abta has about 1,200 members \u2013 including airlines, tour operators and travel agents \u2013 with a combined UK turnover of \u00a332bn. The EU is the UK\u2019s biggest market for overseas holidays \u2013 in 2015 British holidaymakers and business travellers splashed out \u00a319bn on business and holiday visits to its countries. Safeguarding transport links, including air routes, is vital, the report says. In contrast with other industries there are no World Trade Organization rules for aviation to fall back on if no EU deal is reached. With some holidays on sale up to 18 months in advance, Abta is also calling on the government to ensure that effective transitional agreements with the EU are in place if needed. \u201cAs the UK begins to extricate itself from the European Union, we want to work with the government to help them make Brexit a success,\u201d said the Abta chief executive, Mark Tanzer. \u201cWe believe that the benefits that UK holidaymakers currently enjoy, such as visa-free travel and the EHIC card should be prioritised and protected. The government must also make sure transition agreements are in place if needed. Travel and tourism is one of the UK\u2019s largest industries and it is vital that the government makes sure it can continue to thrive during and after the negotiations.\u201d However, it also believes Brexit opens up possibilities for new partnerships and the opportunity to revamp dated laws and regulations. It argues for the reduction of Air Passenger Duty, for example \u2013 which it considers a tax on \u201cglobal Britain\u201d \u2013 to ensure the UK has world-class connectivity. With mobile phone roaming fees in Europe due to be abolished from June, it also wants the UK government to replicate the EU-level agreement to ensure that British and EU customers will continue to benefit.",

It is lobbying the government to secure the UK\u2019s continued participation in the European Health Insurance Card scheme, which guarantees UK travellers reciprocal access to healthcare across Europe. </p> <p>In a new report, Making a Success of Brexit for Travel and Tourism, Abta sets out priorities for the negotiations that have implications for UK holidaymakers and the travel industry. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/30/london-will-remain-europes-financial-capital-despite-brexit\">London will remain Europe\u2019s financial capital despite Brexit | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abta has about 1,200 members \u2013 including airlines, tour operators and travel agents \u2013 with a combined UK turnover of \u00a332bn. The EU is the UK\u2019s biggest market for overseas holidays \u2013 in 2015 British holidaymakers and business travellers splashed out \u00a319bn on business and holiday visits to its countries.</p> <p>Safeguarding transport links, including air routes, is vital, the report says. In contrast with other industries there are no World Trade Organization rules for aviation to fall back on if no EU deal is reached.</p> <p>With some holidays on sale up to 18 months in advance, Abta is also calling on the government to ensure that effective transitional agreements with the EU are in place if needed.</p> <p>\u201cAs the UK begins to extricate itself from the European Union, we want to work with the government to help them make Brexit a success,\u201d said the Abta chief executive, Mark Tanzer. \u201cWe believe that the benefits that UK holidaymakers currently enjoy, such as visa-free travel and the EHIC card should be prioritised and protected. The government must also make sure transition agreements are in place if needed. Travel and tourism is one of the UK\u2019s largest industries and it is vital that the government makes sure it can continue to thrive during and after the negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>However, it also believes Brexit opens up possibilities for new partnerships and the opportunity to revamp dated laws and regulations. It argues for the reduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/30/air-passenger-duty-scrapped-for-children-under-12\">Air Passenger Duty</a>, for example \u2013 which it considers a tax on \u201cglobal Britain\u201d \u2013 to ensure the UK has world-class connectivity. </p> <p>With mobile phone roaming fees in Europe due to be abolished from June, it also wants the UK government to replicate the EU-level agreement to ensure that British and EU customers will continue to benefit.</p> <p> </p>",
