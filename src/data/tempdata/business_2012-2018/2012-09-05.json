      "bodyText": "The Bank of England's attempt to support the economy with massive injections of newly created money has failed to achieve its main objectives, according to an independent assessment of the Bank's policy of quantitative easing (QE). A report by the economic consultancy, CEBR, found that all households have lost out with pensioners the worst affected following Threadneedle Street's decision to pump funds into the City in an effort to support bank lending and persuade consumers to buy more goods. The Bank has used \u00a3325bn of funds since 2008 to buy UK government bonds, mainly from banks, and is part way through spending another \u00a350bn. Several economists have predicted QE could reach \u00a3500bn by the end of next year to boost the recovery. But with Britain back in recession and bank lending and consumer spending down over recent months, there should be a reassessment of QE's impact before more money is spent, said Saga, the over-50s campaigning group that commissioned the report. Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and the director general of Saga, said the Bank's policy had several unintended consequences that were undermining the recovery. MPs on the Treasury select committee questioned how much QE is supporting economic growth and demanded the bank conducted an internal review. The review, published last month, argued that most people were better off after a boost to stock market and property values that could be directly attributed to QE. It said preventing a steep fall in asset prices had increased the value of households' financial wealth, although it admitted that holdings were heavily skewed, with the top 5% of households holding 40% of these assets. Altmann said a breakdown by age group showed that in the first years after the credit crunch younger families with mortgages and other debts benefited from lower interest rates at the expense of older people who rely on savings income. But recently, banks have increased the cost of mortgage loans while inflation has eaten away at the living standards of all age groups. She said: \"CEBR estimates that real incomes for the over-50s would have been 1.5% higher without QE. This group comprises 21 million people and represents more than half of UK households and nearly half of total domestic consumption.\" Around 1.2 million people will be reaching state retirement age over the next two years and many will be forced to buy a private income using their pension retirement pot. Retirement incomes, known as annuities, have fallen sharply since 2008 when QE was introduced. Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of CEBR, said: \"Those pensioners hit hardest are those who have had to take out an annuity in the past four years, who will be retiring on much lower incomes than they might have expected, after working hard to pay for their retirement. Also pensioners who rely on interest income will have had their income reduced in the same way. \"The effects of these factors are not confined to those pensioners directly affected because the impact of their spending spreads out through the economy through those who supply them with goods and services.\" Altmann said Saga was calling for an alternative policy, not an end to monetary policy. She said the billions of pounds created by the Bank would be better spent on temporary tax breaks for capital spending to encourage house building. She said desirable new homes for older people would encourage them to move and free up family homes for younger people. Plans to switch pension fund cash into funding vital infrastructure projects should also be encouraged to increase investment and jobs. The Bank, which now owns around one third of the government's traded debt, could embark on another round of QE in November. The nine-strong monetary policy committee has discussed purchasing a broader range of assets, including mortgage loans, after similar moves by the Federal Reserve, but has so far limited its purchases to government bonds.",

Central banks have slashed interest rates to the bone and finance ministries have allowed budget deficits to widen. Yet policymakers believe more is needed to arrest the slump and so they delve into the history books to come up with something known as quantitative easing. The Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England decide that they will buy large quantities of bonds from the financial markets to supplement the boost to activity provided by cuts in short-term interest rates. QE is designed to be a double-whammy. Firstly, the price of a bond moves inversely to the yield (interest rate) that it generates. Taking bonds out of the market reduces supply and pushes up the price. The interest rate comes down, making long-term borrowing cheaper for companies and householders with fixed-rate mortgages. Secondly, the institutions that hand over their bonds to the central banks get money in return, and they can use this to buy other assets such as shares. Rising equity prices help to restore business and consumer confidence. In one important respect, QE did the trick, because without it there is no telling what would have happened to the global economy in the winter of 2008-09.

The Bank of England is on its fourth round of QE; the Fed is about to embark on its third. Despite an unprecedented stimulus, the global economy is losing momentum. Some argue that the harmful side-effects of QE are partly to blame for this, since the money created by bond buying has led to speculation in commodity markets, driving up the price of food and fuel, and hence hitting the spending power of consumers.

Full details of the blueprint are likely to be disclosed by Mario Draghi, the ECB president, on Thursday after a meeting of the central bank's governing council. According to the Bloomberg, the ECB plans to \"sterilise\" its bond-buying by removing money from elsewhere in the eurozone economy such as by selling bonds or restricting the money supply.

The ECB is likely to concentrate on buying short-term debt \u2013 bonds that mature within three years \u2013 in the hope that it will provide breathing space until longer-term measures are in place.

Martin Wheatley, managing director of the FSA and boss of the soon-to-be-created Financial Conduct Authority, says he will take personal charge of reforms that will put an end to bonus schemes that encourage mis-selling. The FSA ignored the warnings for many years.

The following year Barclays was found to be making 10% of its global profits from the sale of payment protection insurance (PPI) in the UK. The cost of the insurance was deliberately disguised and most claimants were told they failed to qualify for a payout. A plea to then FSA boss John Tiner for an investigation fell on deaf ears. Wheatley has warned firms they risk huge fines if they continue with the old sales tactics. But there are some extra incentives he missed out. The FSA should name and shame the companies in its latest investigation that were found to be mis-selling.

      "bodyText": "The Department of Justice (DoJ) has launched a withering attack on BP underlining the US government's determination to prove the British oil group responsible for gross negligence and \"corporate recklessness\" over the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010. Shares in BP fell nearly 3% to 423.85p on Wednesday and there was renewed calls by financial analysts for the business to be broken up into smaller parts in a bid to extract more value from it. Legal specialists have indicated that a successful gross negligence charge would leave BP facing penalties under the local Clean Water Act of over $20bn (\u00a312bn), on top of a $7.8bn proposed settlement with fishermen and others. The DoJ remarks, contained in a New Orleans federal court filing made last Friday but which have only just come to light, took investors aback because they indicate the department is determined to pin the harshest charges on the energy group. The government lawyers also condemned some arguments made by BP earlier in the case as \"plainly misleading\" in a DoJ filing made in reaction to a tentative settlement between the company and various private plaintiffs. \"The behaviour, words and actions of these BP executives would not be tolerated in a middling size company manufacturing dry goods for sale in a suburban mall. Yet they were condoned in a corporation engaged in an activity (deep water drilling) that no less a witness than Tony Hayward (former BP chief executive) himself described as comparable to exploring outer space,\" said the DoJ. There had been earlier speculation that BP was in out-of-court talks with the DoJ about a wider settlement of criminal and civil charges but the latest department filing suggest no such deal is likely before new court proceedings start early next year. BP publicly shrugged off the latest setback, arguing that the government's claims \"simply illustrate that disputes about the underlying facts remain. BP believes it was not grossly negligent and looks forward to presenting evidence on this issue at trial in January.\" Privately the company is believed to be shaken by some of the aggressive language used by the department which comes in the middle of a volatile presidential election campaign. In the past City analysts have suggested that BP can only raise the value of its sagging share price by being broken up into two companies, only one of which might face legal claims. This was repeated by Stuart Joyner, energy analyst at Investec Securities in London who said in a research note to clients: \"We re-iterate that the best outcome for long suffering BP shareholders, and indeed the only credible route to unlock our increased SoTP (sum-of-the-parts) value of 732p, is a demerger of remaining assets starting with the US,\" said Joyner. \"BP died when it failed to cap the Macondo spill in the first few days. The CEO did a good job of saving BP from forced liquidation, but we do not believe he can revert to its pre-Macondo strategy,\" he added. The increased anxiety over its position in the US, where it still has an enormous business, comes at a time when it is also struggling to find agreement with its Russian partners inside TNK-BP to dispose of its 50% shareholding there. That money might be needed to help pay any final bill for the Deepwater Horizon \"blowout\" in which 11 oil workers lost their lives and miles of beach front were damaged by the accompanying oil spill.",

First of all, the trend toward meat-based western diets is certainly worth resisting, for health and environmental reasons.

An <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE-price-volatility-and-food-security-report-July-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">FAO study</a> documented conclusively that cereals demand rose more slowly since 2000 than it had in previous decades. So demand in India and China may have grown, but it did not create a \"demand shock\" that precipitated more recent price surges.</p> <p>What is the demand shock that has occurred since 2000? The dramatic expansion of biofuels production, under a range of government incentives, particularly in the US with corn-based ethanol and in the EU with biodiesel. This has truly been a shock to tight commodity markets. US ethanol consumes 40% of the country's corn, fully 15% of global corn production. Estimates vary widely on the impacts, but <a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13105\" title=\"Renewable Fuel Standard\">the National Academy of Sciences concluded</a> that 20-40% of the price increases in 2008 were due to biofuels expansion.</p> <p>That impact couldn't be clearer than in today's looming food crisis, triggered by the widespread drought in the US. Corn output is down dramatically, but ethanol refiners keep gobbling up the corn, driving global prices to new records. Elliott for some reason discusses this as a supply-side issue, but it's pure demand, created by government programmes that seemed good at the time, as he points out, but are now a disaster. Or, more to the point, a set of recurring disasters as the world suffers its third price spike in five years.</p> <p>To be sure, there has been one other demonstrable boost in demand since 2000, and it does implicate the rising demand for meat-based diets. Chinese demand for soybeans has jumped dramatically, mostly to feed its own growing meat production. This puts pressure on agricultural land and certainly contributes to rising food prices. But not on the order of magnitude accounted for by biofuels expansion in general and US ethanol expansion in particular.</p> <p>As Elliott points out, it is not easy to reduce the rising demand for meat-based diets in developing countries. And he calls on the west to \"reassess the wisdom of biofuels\". That should be a priority in the current price crisis.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "EasyJet is ending the desperate rush for prime seats on low-cost flights by launching allocated seating across its network. Having been eschewed by budget carriers in the past for impeding fast turnaround times, the Luton-based airline said seat allocation did not appear to slow down journeys and is more lucrative than speedy boarding schemes. It expects 1a and 6a to be the prime picks on flights following trials on 6,000 flights this summer. Allocated seating will be rolled out across easyJet's network from November, with all passengers allocated a seat. Those wishing to change their seat will be charged \u00a312 for front row and over-wing seats, \u00a38 for berths in the four rows behind the front row, and \u00a33 to reserve a seat anywhere else on the plane. Passengers who don't pay for a particular spot will be randomly allocated a seat as well when they check in, free of charge, although the chances of getting a seat up front will be diminished. \"The majority of people will not have to pay for their seat,\" said an easyJet spokesman, adding that the airline would attempt to seat families together even if they don't pay for specific seats. EasyJet has mulled allocated seating trials in the past but Carolyn McCall, easyJet chief executive, has decided to push ahead after a trial scheme showed encouraging results. The trials found that on short-haul flights such as London to Glasgow, the \u00a33 window seat 6a was the most popular, while on longer routes such as London to Sharm el-Sheikh the \u00a312 1a berth is the most sought-after due to the more substantial legroom. Predictably, seats in the middle and near the back found the fewest takers, with 16b the least desired on short haul and passengers avoiding 19b on long haul. \"This is an example of easyJet trying to do all it can to make travel easy and affordable for our passengers,\" said McCall. \"Our customers asked us to trial allocated seating and we are really pleased with the positive passenger feedback during the trial. As importantly, we have shown that we can do so while delivering strong on-time performance \u2013 the most important driver of passenger satisfaction.\" EasyJet said that more than seven out of 10 passengers on trial routes preferred the system to speedy boarding, where passengers pay around \u00a310.50 to board a flight first \u2013 a service also offered by Ryanair. Low-cost airlines have been characterised by their strategy of charging for as many services as possible, from inflight food to checking bags into the hold. However, some notions such as allocated seating have been ruled out by the likes of Ryanair because of their potential to clutter up planes, which would prevent low-cost carriers from executing the 25-minute turnaround times \u2013 the gap between a plane arriving at its gate and pushing off again \u2013 that allow them to run the busiest possible timetable. Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, said the move would benefit easyJet because it gives the airline the opportunity to make money from all seats on a flight rather than the 30 berths set aside for speedy boarding. \"We would expect sales of pre-allocated seat selection and premium seat allocation in the front of cabin and exit rows to certainly exceed speedy boarding revenues. Speedy boarding was limited to 30 passengers per flight, but we imagine a higher share of passengers will opt to secure their seats in advance of travel.\" He added: \"Moreover, we think the switch to allocated seating will make travelling on easyJet notably less stressful. It will be far better for families travelling together. It will also remove the hassle of boarding which we think has been a material deterrent for business travellers. It should also be helpful for relations with airports: as customers spend less time standing in queues for hours before the flight, they should be free to spend more time and money in airport stores.\" However, Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Espirito Santo bank, said easyJet is replacing one of its most dependable sources of ancilliary revenue. \"These charges replace speedy boarding, so this is not wholly incremental. But the hope is to make at least slightly more money than they were making before.\"",
