      "bodyText": "The new Greek finance minister is to call on George Osborne and City bankers next week as part of a whistlestop tour of European capitals to drum up support for Athens\u2019 new leftwing government. Yanis Varoufakis will visit No11 before heading to Paris and Rome with the aim of building closer co-operation between Greece and the major EU economies. A spokesman for the minister said he will also meet representatives of the financial sector in the City of London. The announcement came as new Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras played host to president of the European parliament Martin Shulz and the foreign minister Nikos Kotzias raced to Brussels to join his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Coming only two days after the new cabinet was assembled, the flurry of meetings cemented the claim of the governing Syriza party that it intends to move quickly to renegotiate the huge mountain of public sector debt it has inherited. But Athens immediately threatened EU solidarity when Kotzias delayed agreement on further EU sanctions against Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. The move raised European and Nato fears that Moscow might seek to exploit the hard left and far right coalition under Alexis Tsipras as a Trojan Horse within the key western alliances. The emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers was convened in Brussels to respond to the upsurge in violence in eastern Ukraine, notably last week\u2019s shelling of the town of Mariupol by pro-Russian secessionists which left 30 civilians dead and 100 wounded. On Thursday evening the ministers agreed to prolong the blacklisting of pro-Russian separatist leaders from March until September and to add new names to the blacklist by next week, and asked the European commission to look into broadening the economic and financial sanctions against Russia imposed last July. At an earlier meeting of 28 EU ambassadors, the Greek ambassador refused to agree to the key passage on sanctions \u2013 prolonging the blacklisting of 132 individuals and 28 \u201centities\u201d, mainly in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. The Greek representative, diplomats said, told the meeting he could not take a position until his minister arrived in Brussels, forcing the group to issue a holding statement. Although several other countries are lukewarm about renewing or extending sanctions against Moscow or the Russian separatists, diplomats said there were no other dissenters on the statement which squarely held Russia to blame for facilitating the Mariupol attack. Nikos Kotzias, the new Greek foreign minister, said Greece wanted to \u201cprevent a rift\u201d between Russia and the EU although both sides have been in acute conflict for the past 10 months over Moscow\u2019s assault on Ukraine. Russian finance ministerm Anton Siluanovm said on Thursday that Russia would consider extending financial aid to Greece if Athens were to make a request. \u201cWell, we can imagine any situation, so if such petition is submitted to the Russian government, we will definitely consider it, but will take into account all the factors of our bilateral relationships between Russia and Greece,\u201d he told CNBC. The Athens government is under pressure to make a series of monthly debt interest payments or find itself in default. Tsipras is keen to impress on European leaders that the government can only run a balanced budget if its \u20ac240bn rescue loan is reduced. In response to the growing uncertainty, one of the three biggest credit ratings agencies threatened to downgrade Greek debt to junk if talks with its international creditors failed to make progress. Fitch said it would need to see the results of any negotiation by the time of its next review in May to avoid a downgrade, one of the firm\u2019s senior ratings directors said. Fitch is the last of the big three ratings agencies, after Standard and Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s, to send a warning to Greece\u2019s new anti-bailout coalition. \u201cIf by our next review on the 15 May there is no progress on these talks or they look to be failing, of course that would be a trigger for a downgrade,\u201d Douglas Renwick, the firm\u2019s head of western European sovereigns, said during a conference call. \u201cAlternatively, if a deal is reached with more financing and more support, then that may be a cue to affirm the rating.\u201d The agency is also closely watching Greece\u2019s banks, which are experiencing deposit withdrawals and have seen their borrowing costs soar amid the political uncertainty. Greece\u2019s top four listed banks, Alphabank, Piraeus Bank, National Bank of Greece and Eurobank Ergasias, are all rated B-minus by Fitch, one notch below the sovereign debt. Varoufakis, who speaks fluent English after studying at Essex University and teaching in the UK, Australia and the US, is also aiming to meet French finance minister Michel Sapin, and economy minister Emmanuel Macron, in Paris on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, he will conduct talks in Rome with his counterpart Pier Carlo Padoan \u201cfor an exchange of views on the macro-economic course of the eurozone,\u201d the finance ministry said. Ahead of his tour, Varoufakis will be hosting Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who also heads the eurogroup of finance ministers. \u201cThe start of negotiations with our partners which will lead us to a viable and comprehensive solution for the reconstruction of our social economy in the framework of a developing Europe,\u201d the Greek finance ministry added.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Was that confidence or complacency gushing out of Shell in the face of falling oil prices and a big miss in fourth-quarter profits? A $15bn (\u00a310bn) cut in spending on new projects over three years sounds enormous until you remember how big Shell is. The reduction is 14%, which seems modest. The case for the defence, of course, is that you can\u2019t run an oil and gas exploration and production titan on a stop-start basis. If you don\u2019t invest when the oil price is $50 a barrel you risk missing the financial prizes that come when $100 is back again. Fair point. All the same, one suspects chief executive Ben van Beurden\u2019s \u201cprudent\u201d approach to spending cuts may turn out to be a first guess. More projects will surely have to be delayed or canned if Brent crude is still plodding along at $50 or $60 a barrel at the end of this year. The \u201clong-term equilibrium\u201d is $90 a barrel, suggested van Beurden, omitting (wisely) to define long-term. \u201cShell has options to further reduce spending,\u201d he added, with a vague sweep. He was even less precise about the size of cost savings: everything at Shell is \u201cmultibillion.\u201d Amid the many uncertainties, there is a solid point of focus: the balance sheet. Shell\u2019s debt ratios are lower than many major rivals\u2019 and the credit rating is pristine. If necessary, it\u2019s plainly possible to let borrowings rise to protect the dividend for a while. For the whole of 2014, the payment to shareholders was improved 4%; for the first quarter of 2015, a same-again dividend is promised. If you trust the solidity, there\u2019s a yield of 5.6% up for grabs. Be wary: if Shell can miss an earnings forecast by 20% in a quarter when the oil price averaged $75, then $50 oil may bring more surprises. The corporate juggling act between dividends and investment looks harder by the day. Competing narratives Is Ronan Dunne feeling sensitive? The chief executive of Telef\u00f3nica UK seemed overly anxious to claim that his firm\u2019s deal with Sky shows that the UK mobile telephony market is a bear-pit of open and hostile rivalry. Sky will offer its customers mobile services over Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s O2 network from next year. This, says Dunne, \u201cdemonstrates the lively competitiveness of the UK market\u201d. Possible translation: will people please stop worrying about the implications for competition of Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s \u00a310bn deal to sell O2 to Hutchison Whampoa, owner of Three, thereby reducing the number of UK mobile operators from four to three. Sorry, no, we won\u2019t stop worrying. For a start, the Sky deal doesn\u2019t create a new competitive force. This is a piggy-back deal of modest scope. Sky will rent some wholesale capacity from O2. It will not be investing in new infrastructure. It\u2019s a suck-it-and-see arrangement for Sky. If customers want to buy another product, it will happily accept the incremental revenue. If there isn\u2019t demand, the cost of finding out is tiny. By contrast, combining O2 and Three would represent a big change to the structure of the market. In the current set-up, Three, the fourth largest network, can be fairly seen as the player that keeps the bigger beasts honest. It lives by being fast on its feet and different.

      "body": "<p>Was that confidence or complacency gushing out of Shell in the face of falling oil prices and a big miss in fourth-quarter profits? A $15bn (\u00a310bn) cut in spending on new projects over three years sounds enormous until you remember how big Shell is. The reduction is 14%, which seems modest.</p> <p>The case for the defence, of course, is that you can\u2019t run an oil and gas exploration and production titan on a stop-start basis. If you don\u2019t invest when the oil price is $50 a barrel you risk missing the financial prizes that come when $100 is back again. Fair point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/29/shell-cuts-spending-oil-price-slide\">Shell slashes spending and calls for North Sea tax cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All the same, one suspects chief executive Ben van Beurden\u2019s \u201cprudent\u201d approach to spending cuts may turn out to be a first guess. More projects will surely have to be delayed or canned if Brent crude is still plodding along at $50 or $60 a barrel at the end of this year. The \u201clong-term equilibrium\u201d is $90 a barrel, suggested van Beurden, omitting (wisely) to define long-term. \u201cShell has options to further reduce spending,\u201d he added, with a vague sweep. He was even less precise about the size of cost savings: everything at Shell is \u201cmultibillion.\u201d</p> <p>Amid the many uncertainties, there is a solid point of focus: the balance sheet. Shell\u2019s debt ratios are lower than many major rivals\u2019 and the credit rating is pristine. If necessary, it\u2019s plainly possible to let borrowings rise to protect the dividend for a while.</p> <p>For the whole of 2014, the payment to shareholders was improved 4%; for the first quarter of 2015, a same-again dividend is promised. If you trust the solidity, there\u2019s a yield of 5.6% up for grabs.</p> <p>Be wary: if Shell can miss an earnings forecast by 20% in a quarter when the oil price averaged $75, then $50 oil may bring more surprises. The corporate juggling act between dividends and investment looks harder by the day.</p> <h2>Competing narratives</h2> <p>Is Ronan Dunne feeling sensitive? The chief executive of Telef\u00f3nica UK seemed overly anxious to claim that his firm\u2019s deal with Sky shows that the UK mobile telephony market is a bear-pit of open and hostile rivalry. Sky will offer its customers mobile services over Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s O2 network from next year. This, says Dunne, \u201cdemonstrates the lively competitiveness of the UK market\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/29/sky-moves-uk-mobile-phone-market-deal-with-o2-telefonica-bt-ee\">Sky moves into UK mobile-phone market after deal with O2 owner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Possible translation: will people please stop worrying about the implications for competition of Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s \u00a310bn deal to sell O2 to Hutchison Whampoa, owner of Three, thereby reducing the number of UK mobile operators from four to three.</p> <p>Sorry, no, we won\u2019t stop worrying. For a start, the Sky deal doesn\u2019t create a new competitive force. This is a piggy-back deal of modest scope. Sky will rent some wholesale capacity from O2. It will not be investing in new infrastructure. It\u2019s a suck-it-and-see arrangement for Sky. If customers want to buy another product, it will happily accept the incremental revenue. If there isn\u2019t demand, the cost of finding out is tiny.</p> <p>By contrast, combining O2 and Three would represent a big change to the structure of the market. In the current set-up, Three, the fourth largest network, can be fairly seen as the player that keeps the bigger beasts honest. It lives by being fast on its feet and different. Those qualities will be hard to retain if Three is housed under the same roof as O2, or folded into it.</p> <p>Naturally, the mobile operators make counter-arguments. Look, they say, there is a reason why France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and Deutsche Telekom are selling EE to BT, and why Telef\u00f3nica wants out of the UK: returns here are among the lowest in Europe.

Christine Tacon, the first person to hold the role, had asked at the end of 2013 for the power to fine retailers up to 1% of their UK revenues but was left waiting for regulations granting her that power to be laid before parliament.

The total, $4.22bn, missed analysts\u2019 forecasts of $4.45bn. Net profits for the quarter jumped to $2.1bn, above the $1.9bn estimated by 23 analysts polled by Reuters, and the company announced strong growth in mobile sales, a key metric in the world\u2019s largest mobile market. But neither was enough to stem the sell-off. Alibaba went public in September in the biggest initial public offering in history, raising $25bn as investors snapped up shares in China\u2019s largest e-commerce company. The company dominates retail in China and now has 334 million annual active buyers. Despite some wobbles, Alibaba\u2019s shares have soared since the IPO, priced at $68. They closed at over $98 on Wednesday. The share slide came a day after the company was forced to defend itself against accusations by Chinese authorities that it has done too little to tackle the sale of fake goods, bribery and other illegal activities. Critics have long charged that Alibaba\u2019s Taobao online marketplace, one of the world\u2019s largest shopping sites with 7 million sellers offering 800 million items, is rife with fake goods. In a report released yesterday, China\u2019s state administration of industry and commerce said it had uncovered \u201cthe long-term existence of illegal problems regarding the management of transaction activity and other issues\u201d. \u201cIllegal business exists on Alibaba Group\u2019s trading platforms, and for a long time the company has failed to pay adequate attention and failed to take measures to stop it. This not only is the biggest crisis of integrity faced by the company since its founding, but also has hurt other internet companies that try to operate legally,\u201d the report stated. Alibaba hit back, accusing the regulator of bias and misconduct. In a conference call on Thursday, executive vice-chairman Joseph Tsai called the allegations \u201cso unfair\u201d. Tsai said Alibaba has spent more than 1bn yuan (about $160m) over the past two years to fight fakes and was prepared to file a complaint about the report. The report was taken down Thursday. The spat and the miss on revenue growth are not the only issues troubling investors. This week Yahoo\u2019s chief executive Marissa Mayer announced the company would be spinning off its 15% stake in Alibaba as a separate entity.",

Analysts at Charles Stanley said: Diageo has released a weak set of interim results, which were towards the lower end of market expectations. Reported results were heavily impacted by a \u00a3268m hit from the weakness of key emerging market currencies against sterling. The underlying performance at constant currencies was resilient, with a solid performance in developed markets and mixed conditions in emerging markets. Outlook comments were cautiously optimistic, with financial performance expected to improve in the second half of the year. We anticipate a small downgrade to our full year earnings per share estimate, but the recommendation is maintained at Accumulate. Canaccord Genuity\u2019s analyst Eddy Hargreaves said: We expect 2015 earnings per share consensus, which has already dropped 18% since this time last year, to fall further today reflecting the heavier foreign exchange impact. Pubs group Mitchells &amp; Butlers ended 1.5p higher at 423.5p after saying sales for the 17 weeks to 24 January were up 1.7%, a slowdown on the 2.4% growth in the first eight weeks of the period. Food sales jumped 2.8% helped by good festive sales, with more than 200,000 meals sold on Christmas Day. But margins were stretched as it cut prices to compete with rivals, and integrated the 2014 acquisition of Orchid pubs. Mark Brumby at Langton Capital said: This is perhaps a so-so trading update. Growth is better than it was last full year \u2013 against reasonably tough comps \u2013 but growth over the whole 17 weeks under review is slower than it had been in the first 8 weeks and, as Christmas was strong, this implies that the rest of December and January to date have not been good. M&amp;B suggests that comparisons will remain tough (there wasn\u2019t much of a winter last year) and says that margins will be down. This is in line with our understanding of what is going on regarding discounting (check vouchercodes.co.uk) but may be perhaps a little disappointing overall. There is unlikely to be much upward pressure on forecasts as a result of today\u2019s update. Whilst acknowledging the latent strength of M&amp;B\u2019s business and accepting that its shares are now cheap, we do not see M&amp;B as a share that you must have and we would still be tempted to look for value elsewhere. But Oriel said: While the shares have shown some recent recovery from depressed levels, the rating is undemanding. The group should generate strong earnings growth, partly as the Orchid transaction becomes increasingly earnings accretive. Accordingly the shares have good medium term upside. Online grocer Ocado added 2p to 416p as it unveiled plans for a fourth distribution centre, in Erith in south east London. Although planning consent had not been received yet, it expected the centre to begin operations in 2017. Funding of \u00a398.8m for the project will come from real estate investment trust Tritax Big Box. Ocado has two warehouses open, with a third due to come on stream at the end of this year. FInally, online fashion retailer Asos lost 112p to \u00a325.13 after chief executive Nick Robertson sold around \u00a320m worth of shares, reportedly for tax purposes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell is to make $15bn (\u00a310bn) of spending cuts and has warned George Osborne that North Sea operations will remain in the firing line unless the chancellor can offer tax cuts. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said he had already put in place a restructuring programme selling off some North Sea fields, but low oil prices meant more savings must be found. At the same time, western Europe\u2019s largest oil company said it was \u201cnever going to be easy\u201d to recreate the US fracking boom in Britain and admitted that a shale drive in China had been disappointing. On the North Sea, Van Beurden said: \u201cWe see falling production levels, rising costs, high tax and ageing assets, so it was a tough place and it just got tougher with the low oil prices \u2026 there is a plan for the future of the North Sea \u2026 [but] we need to take a significant hard look at the tax position. \u201cThe low-oil-price environment is giving us more [UK cost-cutting] opportunities, at first in the supply chain as activity levels run down \u2026 [and] we will continue to take a look at costs and efficiencies,\u201d he added. Asked whether Shell could promise that there would be no further redundancies in Aberdeen this summer, Van Beurden said: \u201cThere are no guarantees in life.\u201d Shell revealed 250 job cuts in Britain\u2019s oil capital at the start of August, while BP has since axed 300 jobs. Chevron of the US and Statoil of Norway have also cut their staff in the UK. The $15bn in spending cuts will be implemented over the next three years and the company said 40 projects worldwide could be hit as it tried to protect itself from the fall in oil prices, down almost 60% since last summer. Two oil majors in the US have also announced multi-billion-dollar cost cuts. Conoco, which said in December it would cut 2015 spending by 20% to $13.5bn, now expects spending to be scaled back by a further 15% to $11.5bn. Occidental said it would slash its capital budget by 33% to $5.8bn this year. Shell sold off $15bn worth of fields and other assets last year, and Van Beurden said it could be months or even years before Brent oil prices returned to the $90-$100 level he felt was needed to support the level of investment that could meet longer-term oil and gas demand. The energy group reported that final-quarter profits almost doubled to $4.1bn, but that was largely because the equivalent 2013 figure was hit by a number of special charges and costs. Full-year earnings were up 14% to $19bn. Shell shares were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, with shares down by almost 5% by Thursday\u2019s close. The Anglo-Dutch group said it was cancelling investment plans to build up its financial buffers amid cost cutting and layoffs across the industry. Shell, the first of the big oil groups to publish results for 2014, increased its payouts to shareholders despite the plunge in the oil price, but said dividend growth would be frozen. \u201cWe slowed our [share] buyback programme at the end of 2014 to conserve cash, and near-term oil prices will dictate the buyback pace,\u201d the company said. Van Beurden said oil buyers and traders had overreacted in pushing down the price so far at a time when the margin between supply and demand remained at 1% or 2%. The Shell boss was confident that eventually a more normal oil price level would be established, saying fossil fuels would play a significant role in the future despite the need for action to reduce carbon in the atmosphere in the hope of stemming global warming. Meanwhile, the company, which is not currently looking for shale gas in Britain, said it was switching its Chinese exploration focus from onshore shale to offshore prospects in locations such as the Pearl river basin. Shell believes China may yet find the kind of commercial shale opportunities that have transformed the energy scene in the US, but say it is going to be hard there and in Britain. \u201cI fully expect the Chinese will make it work, or make some of it work, because they will get the cost down and find the regulatory framework, but there is a message to anyone outside China, including the UK, that this is not an easy thing to do,\u201d said Simon Henry, Shell\u2019s finance director. \u201cIn North America, we have a million wells or more. They drill 10,000 a year so that flow of new [geological] information on top of the existing base is what creates the knowledge of where to drill the next one and how to do it \u2026 the UK has two wells in it and neither of them produce. We don\u2019t know the geology, and that is the key. \u201cIt\u2019s about real estate. You get the right real estate, you get a good project. Around that you need a good fiscal framework, you need capability, lots of rigs, people who can do the work and infrastructure, which the UK does not really have.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Martin Schulz ended what will go down as the first visit of an EU official to Greece since the radical leftists stormed to power, saying: \u201cI hope that your wonderful country will remain on a European course as it always has.\u201d But the European parliament president made clear that while the two men had agreed \u201con many issues\u201d there were \u201cother issues and discussions that have to continue.\u201d (Russia, perhaps?....) He said further discussions with the new government in Athens would be based on the proposals the radical lefists will make (the government will outline its policy programme in parliament next week). Schulz said he was enthused that the Tsipras government had made the crackdown on tax evasion a priority. The previous government had been very lax in clamping down on big fish tax evaders \u2026 partly because of so many of them were friends of those in the governing coalition. Elsewhere....Evangelos Venizelos, deputy prime minister for the nearly three years the coalition held party, admitted this afternoon that the performance of his centre-left Pasok party in the poll was a \u201cheavy defeat for Pasok and for me personally.\u201d (Helena reports) And that\u2019s probably all from us tonight. Thanks again for reading and commenting. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow... GW There must be sighs of relief on the Athens stock market tonight, after shares recovered some - but by no means all - of Wednesday\u2019s huge losses. The main index jumped by over 3%, having shed 9% in the previous session. Reassuring noises from Athens about working with Greece\u2019s European partners appeared to help restore some confidence. Bank shares led the risers, on the back of their worst day ever. Newsflash from Athens: The Greek finance ministry also announced that \u00c1ngel Gurria, general secretary of the OECD, had accepted Alexis Tsipras\u2019 invitation to visit Athens on February 11, says Helena. Gurria is visiting Athens: \u201cWith the purpose of discussing the government\u2019s proposals for radical reforms with the economic leadership and to offer his good services in this and finally to exchange views on his own experience in the practicalities of renegotiating public debt as finance minister of Mexico when the public debt of his country was substantially reduced.\u201d \u201cThe new government is working hard in collaboration with our European partners and international fora, like the OSCE, for stability, reforms and the prospect of immediately getting over the self-perpetuating crisis.\u201d The Greek finance ministry has just confirmed that Yanis Varoufakis is going to visit London next Monday. In a statement, the ministry said that finance minister Varoufakis will meet with chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne: ...with the aim of close cooperation between the two countries on issues of common European interest. The minister will also meet with the financial sector in the city of London.\u201d Varoufakis is also aiming to meet French finance minister Michel Sapin, and economy minister Emmanuel Macron, in Paris on Monday afternoon. Then on Tuesday, he will conduct talks in Rome with his counterpart Pier Carlo Padoan \u201cfor an exchange of views on the macro-economic course of the the eurozone.\u201d Busy busy! But first, the ministry will be hosting eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem on Friday. That will mark: the start of negotiations with our partners which will lead us to a viable and comprehensive solution for the reconstruction of our social economy in the framework of a developing Europe. (via Helena Smith) Varoufakis is no stranger to the UK. He conducted his post doctorate studies at Essex University and went on to teach at Cambridge before moving to Australia, then Athens and then the US. The talks between Alexis Tsipras and Martin Schulz are over. And the European Parliament president says he\u2019s encouraged by Tsipras\u2019s stance: Ratings agency Fitch has warned that it could downgrade Greece\u2019s credit rating if there\u2019s no progress with its creditors by May 15 (the next scheduled review). It also predicted that there could be \u201cnegative rating implications\u201d for Greece\u2019s banks too, but reckons the \u201csystemic risk\u201d posed by a Greek exit is lower. That\u2019s from a conference call with investors taking place now.... Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is reportedly visiting London on Monday, to see chancellor George Osborne and investors in the City. Have put a call into the Treasury to confirm..... Meanwhile in Brussels...Greece\u2019s new foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, is meeting with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier. They\u2019re both attending a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the Ukraine crisis. Kotzias is criticising EU allies for releasing that \u2018unanimous\u2019 statement about Russian sanctions on Tuesday without consulting Greece: GREEK FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS SOME EU PARTNERS TRIED TO PRESENT GREECE WITH UNACCEPTABLE FAIT ACCOMPLI WITH UKRAINE STATEMENT GREEK FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS MISTAKE TO BELIEVE GREECE WILL RENOUNCE SOVEREIGNTY IN EUROPE BECAUSE OF DEBT Did Tsipras get a dressing down for being too dressed down? The PM is apparently resisting wearing a tie until he\u2019s managed to negotiate a debt restructuring deal. Just in... Germany\u2019s inflation rate has turned negative. Prices across Europe\u2019s largest economy fell by 0.3% year-on-year in January, for the first time in over five years. That suggests the wider eurozone inflation rate has been dragged further into negative territory, raising fears of a protracted period of falling prices, ie...the dreaded deflation. Another photo from Athens. Apparently Tsipras is telling Schulz that: \u201cYou are a close friend of Greece and a close friend of mine\u201d. It was all smiles (but only one tie), as Schulz and Tsipras met a little while ago..... French finance minister Michel Sapin has indicated that Paris would support renegotiating the terms of Greece\u2019s debts....but nothing more dramatic. Sapin told French daily Liberation that Greece\u2019s fiscal position mustn\u2019t be allowed to worsen: \u201cCancelling the debt is an aberration, a renegotiation is on the table.\u201d \u201cSince 2013, spending has been balanced by revenues ... It is out of the question to allow the Greek budget to go out of balance again and spin off into a spiral of deficit,\u201d Sapin failed to mention, though, that while Greece was achieving a primary surplus its economy was in freefall, shrinking by 25% (!) since the crisis began. Martin Schulz may see signs of public anger over Greece\u2019s bailout programme during his visit today, judging by these photos taken this morning: The new government giveth, and also taketh away? Greek bank deposits dropped in December for the third month running, as nervous savers pulled out cash ahead of last Sunday\u2019s election. The Greek central bank reported that business and household deposits fell by 2.4% in December to \u20ac160.3bn, from \u20ac164.3bn the previous months. European parliament officials are trying to dampen speculation that Martin Schulz is visiting Athens to act as an intermediary between the government and its lenders. Correspondent Helena Smith reports Local media reports have suggested that Schulz, who has spoken openly of his distrust of austerity, is intending to act as a go-to-man between Greece and its creditors. The German won hearts in Greece in the run-up to Sunday\u2019s election when he criticized Berlin, and mandarins in Brussels, for spreading \u201cunhelpful Grexit scenarios\u201d and making statements that were overly interventionist. Leonidas Antanokopoulos, who heads the European Parliament office in Athens, said there \u201cis no question\u201d of Schulz acting as an interlocutor. He told me: \u201cThe purpose is to speak openly with the government. Both men in recent years have built up a relationship. Schulz has described Tsipras as a realist\u201d. It wasn\u2019t always so: in the run-up to Euro elections last May, Tsipras who ran as the European Left party\u2019s candidate for EC president, lambasted the German for acting as if \u201che is the chosen one of Merkel in Europe.\u201d Schulz has been a loud proponent of the need for consensus. He told Greece\u2019s leading weekly Protothema: \u201cI do not think that this is the moment for politicians to be speculating on what each side should consider as their red lines and what they should be ready to concede on,\u201d Adding: \u201cMore important neither is it time for any side to be making any headline grabbing statements. Rather all political forces, both in Europe and in Greece, would do well to take good note of the result in Greece and work to create the most serene environment within which talks can take place.\u201d \u201cA solution for Greece will be found through a compromise,\u201d he said, insisting he was \u201cacting on nobody\u2019s behalf.\u201d One blog reader, James Wilkins of Thessaloniki, isn\u2019t impressed that Martin Schulz will meet with four opposition leaders as well as prime minister Tsipras today: The decision of Schulz to meet leaders of political parties who have just been resoundingly defeated in a democratic election will only inflame the situation. It will make many Greeks angry. I fear that the EU, and the Eurozone in particular, is incapable of responding to events that do not fit in with its narrative. Greek banks stocks are on something of a tear this morning, as the Athens market recovers. Shares in Eurobank have surged by 18%, recovering most (but not all) of yesterday\u2019s huge losses. So why the rally? A couple of possibilities. 1) Daniele Nouy, who chairs the ECB\u2019s Supervisory Board, declared that Greek banks are strong enough to survive the crisis, and hailed their progress in improving their balance sheets. 2) Deputy PM Giannis Dragasakis told reporters last night that Athens will seek dialogue, not confrontation, with its lenders. He also said that \u201cour concern is the proper functioning of banks\u201d, suggesting the government wouldn\u2019t let them collapse. Anyone who had the nerve to buy bank shares yesterday afternoon may be feeling pretty smug.... Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s decision to lower Greece\u2019s credit rating outlook to negative last night is driving Greek bond yields steadily higher: Martin Schulz tweets that he\u2019ll be meeting several Greek political leaders today, not just the winner of Sunday\u2019s election. Stavros Theodorakis leads the centrist To Potami party, came fourth in Sunday\u2019s election with 17 seats. Former PM George Papandreou founded a new party, the Movement of Democratic Socialists, which didn\u2019t win any seats. The chief of the Eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) confirms that he will meet with the senior members of the Greek government tomorrow afternoon. Happy news; he and finance minister Varoufakis will give a statement to the press corps. Greek government bonds continue to weaken in the financial markets. That has pushed the yield, or interest rate, on its five-year debt up to 15% -- compared to around 5% when it was sold last April. The 10-year bond is now trading at a yield of 11%; that\u2019s far too high a rate for Athens to actually sell new debt. From Athens, Helena Smith reports that Syriza is making much of Barack Obama\u2019s backing last night. The US, generally, has taken a much more pragmatic approach to Greece than Europe (perhaps because it doesn\u2019t hold billions of euros of Greek debt?). Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis co-authored a book with Jamie Galbraith, a close friend with whom he spent much time when he was seconded to the University of Texas at Austin, entitled: A modest proposal for resolving the euro zone crisis. The Greek radicals have been emboldened by the praise with which their anti-austerity views/stimulus policies have been embraced by leading economists in the US, Helena explains: Over the summer I met the economist/political science professor Barry Eichengreen at Berkeley University, who follows Greece closely, and said despite being nine time zones away from Athens was an avid reader of this blog. \u201cThe Greek crisis has not gone away. It\u2019s no longer acute. Its chronic,\u201d he had said. How his words resonate today! A handy reminder of holds Greece\u2019s debt: Greece\u2019s decision to freeze the privatisation of the Piraeus Port has not gone down well in Beijing. AFP reports: Chinese media warned Tsipras over halting the privatisation of the Piraeus port, for which China\u2019s COSCO group has bid, saying he was in a similar position to the Greek mythological figure of Phaeton, who was given the reins of the sun only to lose control and nearly destroy the earth. Makes a change from another Cassandra reference.... The Athens stock market is calm this morning, after yesterday\u2019s sensational selloff which wiped a third off the value of its banking sector. The main ATG index has risen by 1.4%, led by financial stocks. Francesco Papadia, who used to run the ECB\u2019s Open Market operations, reckons a deal is possible..... Some Greek newspapers appear to have the inside line on the government\u2019s negotiating strategy (see financial portal Euro2day and newspaper Efsyn, which is sympathetic to Syriza) They say that PM Tsipras and finance minister Varoufakis will argue that Greece\u2019s bond payments should be \u201cfrozen\u201d until the country is growing steadily. They will also promise to run balanced budgets, so Greece would not be adding to its debt pile - but not under pressure to meet the high surpluses demanded before. Germany\u2019s jobless rate has hit a new record low, underlining the sharp economic differences across Europe. The number of people unemployed across Germany fell by 9,000 in January. And with December\u2019s figures revised lower, the German unemployment rate is now a record low of 6.5%. That\u2019s roughly a quarter of Greece\u2019s unemployment rate. European Parliament President Martin Schulz is expected to arrive in Athens at noon, or 10am GMT. Apparently Barack Obama also urged Alexis Tsipras to get some rest. During their telephone call last night, the US president told the new Greek prime minister that: \u201cI started young as well, and now my hair has turned grey\u201d. Germany\u2019s economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, has warned Greece not to \u2018burden\u2019 the rest of Europe with its problems. He was speaking in the Bundestag (parliament) this morning - here\u2019s the headlines: GERMAN ECONOMY MINISTER GABRIEL SAYS PEOPLE IN GREECE HAVE UNDERGONE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SUFFERING, COUNTRY HAS MADE PROGRESS IN REFORMS GERMAN ECONOMY MINISTER GABRIEL SAYS WRONG TO SEE TROIKA AS RESPONSIBLE FOR GREECE\u2019S PROBLEMS, GREECE STILL HAS UNFAIR DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH GERMAN ECONOMY MINISTER GABRIEL SAYS WE WANT TO KEEP GREECE IN EURO ZONE BUT NEW GOVERNMENT MUST MEET ITS COMMITMENTS GERMANY\u2019S GABRIEL SAYS CHANGES IN GREEK POLITICS MUST NOT BURDEN CITIZENS OF REST OF EUROPE The selloff in Greek government debt is continuing this morning, as investors continues to ditch its bond. This is pushing up the yields (or interest rates) on the bonds further into dangerous levels. The three-year Greek bond is how yielding 17%(!), showing that traders see it as particularly risky. A senior European Central bank policymaker has ruled out giving Greece any relief on the debt held by the ECB. Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, ECB executive board member, told Italy\u2019s Corriere della Sera newspaper that it was impossible to give Greece more time to repay its loans. C\u0153ur\u00e9 said: Greece\u2019s debt is made up of various components. As regards the government bonds purchased by the ECB as part of the Securities Markets Programme launched in 2010, we cannot grant even an extension of maturities: it would be like granting a loan to the country and that is prohibited by the treaties. As regards loans given to Athens by European countries, that\u2019s not for us to decide. He also urged Greece to keep reforming its economy, but conceded that Alexis Tsipras will probably introduce \u201cdifferent reforms from the ones expected\u201d. There\u2019s a(nother) row brewing over whether Greece officially opposes sanctions on Russia. Yesterday, energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis veered off his brief, to declare that: \u201cWe are against the embargo that has been imposed against Russia. Greece has no interest in imposing sanctions on Russia. We have no differences with Russia and the Russian people.\u201d And this morning, new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has also broached out into international affairs. In his blog, he denied that Greece wanted to veto Russian sanctions -- it just wanted to be consulted. Our Foreign Minister, Nikos Kotzias, briefed us that on his first day at the job he heard in the news bulletins that the EU had approved new sanctions on Russia unanimously. The problem was that he, and the new Greek government, were never asked! So, clearly, the issue was not whether our new government agrees or not with fresh sanctions on Russia. The issue is whether our view can be taken for granted without even being told of what it is! Now personally, I\u2019m all for titbits from around the cabinet table...but perhaps Greece\u2019s new ministers shouldn\u2019t be quite so open?.... The new Greek government\u2019s relationship with Russia are also causing a stir in Europe this week. The Financial Times reports this morning that EU leaders are fuming behind closes doors: European and Nato intelligence officials are now poring over links between the Kremlin and senior figures from Syriza and its coalition partner, the Independent Greeks party. The fact that the first foreign official Mr Tsipras invited to the Maximos Mansion in Athens on Monday was Andrey Maslov, Russia\u2019s ambassador, speaks to their concerns. Mr Tsipras\u2019 previous comments on the Ukrainian crisis are also clear enough: in a trip to Moscow in May, the Syriza chief accused Kiev of harbouring \u201cneo-Nazi\u201d elements and denounced sanctions against Russia. Full story: Alarm bells ring over Syriza\u2019s Russian links Overnight, US president Barack Obama phoned Alexis Tsipras to congratulate him on his victory. According to the White House.... \u201cThe president noted that the United States, as a longstanding friend and ally, looks forward to working closely with the new Greek government to help Greece return to a path of long-term prosperity,\u201d. \u201cThe two leaders also reviewed close cooperation between Greece and the United States on issues of European security and counterterrorism.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek election, and other key developments across the financial markets, the world economy, the rest of the eurozone, and business. The head of the European Parliament is heading to Athens today for talks with the new Greek government. Martin Schulz is the first senior member of the European establishment to meet with Alexis Tsipras since he won power in Sunday\u2019s election. The visit follows several dramatic days, in which Tsipras\u2019s government has begun rolling back Greece\u2019s austerity programme, at pace, to the alarm of many eurozone members. Schulz may urge the left-wing leader to rein his government back, having already frozen several privatisation deals agreed with the Troika. If so, Tsipras might care to point Schulz towards the speech given by the Bank of England governor last night. In a hard-hitting address, Mark Carney called for more fiscal flexibility (government tax&amp;spending) in Europe to drag it out of its debt trap. A clear signal to Germany. Bank of England governor attacks eurozone austerity Another senior European figure, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, has called on Tsipras not to consider defaulting on Greece\u2019s debts. Juncker told Le Figaro that \u201cGreece must comply with Europe......there is no question of cancelling the debt\u201d. \u201cWe respect the popular vote in Greece, but Greece must also respect others, public opinion and parliamentarians from the rest of Europe.\u201d \u201cArrangements are possible, but they will not fundamentally alter what is in place.\u201d But with Greece\u2019s new government promising fundamental change, it\u2019s going to be another lively day....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Energy companies are using the falling price of gas to increase their profits to \u00a3114 a household despite a recent wave of price cuts, the industry watchdog has warned. The average pretax profit for a big supplier from a household bill will rise by \u00a39 to \u00a3114 over the next 12 months, Ofgem said. Average expected profits have increased by \u00a337 in the past year while the cost of gas in wholesale markets has fallen by \u00a362, Ofgem\u2019s supply market indicator (SMI) report showed. Dermot Nolan, Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, said this week that rising profit margins were \u201cclearly a cause for concern\u201d and that the competition regulator should take the figures into account in its continuing inquiry into the market. EDF was the last of the big six providers to announce a price cut on Tuesday. Its 1.35% reduction was the smallest while npower\u2019s was the biggest at 5.1%. After price cuts by the large suppliers, the average forecast dual fuel bill over the next year has fallen by \u00a321, or 1.6%, to \u00a31,305 since November, Ofgem said. However, the figures show that the big six \u2013 which also comprise SSE, Scottish Power, British Gas and E.On \u2013 are still managing to increase profits. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cThe inadequacy of recent energy price cuts is now clear. Low wholesale costs are allowing energy companies to increase profits whilst barely cutting energy prices. The ball is now back in the energy firms\u2019 court to actually compete with each other on further and deeper price cuts. Households that are struggling to pay their bills will rightly be angered that falling wholesale costs are being passed on more quickly to shareholders than customers.\u201d Wholesale gas prices have fallen more than 20% since early December following the halving of the oil price since the summer. Energy suppliers typically link gas prices to oil prices in their long-term supply contracts. The big six have long faced criticism for imposing large price increases on consumers when market prices rise and failing to pass on all the benefits when wholesale prices fall. Ofgem said last year it had found clear evidence that this was industry practice and referred the industry to the Competition and Markets Authority. Ofgem said: \u201cOur latest supply market indicator suggests that the pretax margins of a typical supplier are likely to widen over the next 12 months as wholesale costs continue to fall sharply even when accounting for recent price cut announcements. If the market were more competitive you would expect suppliers to be competing more vigorously for market share in response to falling wholesale costs.\u201d Energy UK, which represents the energy companies, rejected Ofgem\u2019s figures, describing them as outdated, statistically biased and inaccurate. The lobby group said research by the economic consultancy Nera showed Ofgem\u2019s estimates consistently overstated profits, made mistaken assumptions about revenues and costs and assumed too high a level of energy consumption. Energy UK\u2019s chief executive, Lawrence Slade, said: \u201cOfgem\u2019s SMI reports time and again have proven to be unreliable. Nera\u2019s report shows that the SMI takes no account of what energy companies have to pay out in financing costs, interest or tax but gives the misleading impression that there are massive profits to be made. It\u2019s high time the SMI was abandoned.\u201d But Ofgem said it had no intention of ditching the SMI. Nolan told MPs he was confident the indicator was a reliable guide to the direction of company profit margins. The watchdog urged consumers to switch provider and said the best fixed rate deals on the market could save the average household up to \u00a3250.",

Its 1.35% reduction was the smallest while npower\u2019s was the biggest at 5.1%. After price cuts by the large suppliers, the average forecast dual fuel bill over the next year has fallen by \u00a321, or 1.6%, to \u00a31,305 since November, Ofgem said. However, the figures show that the big six \u2013 which also comprise SSE, Scottish Power, British Gas and E.On \u2013 are still managing to increase profits.</p> <p>Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cThe inadequacy of recent energy price cuts is now clear. Low wholesale costs are allowing energy companies to increase profits whilst barely cutting energy prices. The ball is now back in the energy firms\u2019 court to actually compete with each other on further and deeper price cuts. Households that are struggling to pay their bills will rightly be angered that falling wholesale costs are being passed on more quickly to shareholders than customers.\u201d</p> <p>Wholesale gas prices have fallen more than 20% since early December following the halving of the oil price since the summer. Energy suppliers typically link gas prices to oil prices in their long-term supply contracts.</p> <p>The big six have long faced criticism for imposing large price increases on consumers when market prices rise and failing to pass on all the benefits when wholesale prices fall. Ofgem said last year it had found clear evidence that this was industry practice and referred the industry to the Competition and Markets Authority.</p> <p>Ofgem said: \u201cOur latest supply market indicator suggests that the pretax margins of a typical supplier are likely to widen over the next 12 months as wholesale costs continue to fall sharply even when accounting for recent price cut announcements. If the market were more competitive you would expect suppliers to be competing more vigorously for market share in response to falling wholesale costs.\u201d</p> <p>Energy UK, which represents the energy companies, rejected Ofgem\u2019s figures, describing them as outdated, statistically biased and inaccurate. The lobby group said research by the economic consultancy Nera showed Ofgem\u2019s estimates consistently overstated profits, made mistaken assumptions about revenues and costs and assumed too high a level of energy consumption.</p> <p>Energy UK\u2019s chief executive, Lawrence Slade, said: \u201cOfgem\u2019s SMI reports time and again have proven to be unreliable. Nera\u2019s report shows that the SMI takes no account of what energy companies have to pay out in financing costs, interest or tax but gives the misleading impression that there are massive profits to be made. It\u2019s high time the SMI was abandoned.\u201d</p> <p>But Ofgem said it had no intention of ditching the SMI. Nolan told MPs he was confident the indicator was a reliable guide to the direction of company profit margins. The watchdog urged consumers to switch provider and said the best fixed rate deals on the market could save the average household up to \u00a3250.</p>",

Last summer, a supplier to the chain\u2019s restaurants in China was accused of supplying rotting meat and falsifying meat expiry dates. Local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at the supplier in question, Shanghai Husi Food, claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald\u2019s and KFC kitchens. There was a near three week shortage of meat products in some of its Chinese restaurants after it suspended orders from the supplier. </p> <p>The company is still dealing with the fall-out from the situation. Sales in Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa fell by 4.8% in the final quarter of last year on a like-for-like basis, stripping out the impact of restaurants open for less than a year. McDonald\u2019s said the drop was \u201cprimarily due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue on sales and profitability in China, Japan and certain other markets\u201d. While it is having a clear and quantifiable impact on financial results, the cost to its reputation could be greater.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s has also been hit by food safety concerns in Russia - apparently politically motivated as the US company is caught up in Russia\u2019s dispute with the West over Ukraine. About half of McDonald\u2019s 450 restaurants in Russia were put under government investigation.</p> <h2>Get ready to take on investors</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ec5dec4fab84bfbaadf6709e0a33a376fc74756\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/29/1422525828322/cee5ce3b-75f1-45bc-b312-7c4eba77eb7f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNITED ARTISTS/Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Easterbrook will be under pressure from investors to turn things around quickly.

The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonald\u2019s once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year-olds visiting is flat. As McDonald\u2019s sales figures go into reverse, sales at Chipotle Mexican Grill are soaring. Shake Shack meanwhile has transformed from a single hot dog stand in Manhattan\u2019s Madison Square Park a decade ago into a 63-strong chain operating in nine countries. It is preparing for a stock market floatation that will value the company at $568m (\u00a3374m). Taking on Burger King for low-income customers At the other end of the spectrum, McDonald\u2019s needs to make sure that it can still attract low-income customers, rather than losing out to its traditional rival Burger King. Burger King has served up better results recently, which the chain has partly put down to its focus on price and success of its value menu range. Tackle the negative pr by paying staff more McDonald\u2019s has a reputation for paying its staff poorly. The company has been hit by protests from workers, many of whom earn the minimum wage despite being with the company for years. Shareholder activists last year called for the salary of outgoing chief executive Don Thompson to be cut, citing the chain\u2019s poor performance and the massive gap between his wages and those of the average McDonald\u2019s worker. At a time when it is losing customers, the company could really do without the additional bad pr. Sort out China, where it has been rocked by food safety scandals Steve Easterbrook will need to make a concerted effort to clean up McDonald\u2019s reputation on food safety, which has taken a battering following scandals in China. Last summer, a supplier to the chain\u2019s restaurants in China was accused of supplying rotting meat and falsifying meat expiry dates. Local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at the supplier in question, Shanghai Husi Food, claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald\u2019s and KFC kitchens. There was a near three week shortage of meat products in some of its Chinese restaurants after it suspended orders from the supplier. The company is still dealing with the fall-out from the situation. Sales in Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa fell by 4.8% in the final quarter of last year on a like-for-like basis, stripping out the impact of restaurants open for less than a year. McDonald\u2019s said the drop was \u201cprimarily due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue on sales and profitability in China, Japan and certain other markets\u201d. While it is having a clear and quantifiable impact on financial results, the cost to its reputation could be greater. McDonald\u2019s has also been hit by food safety concerns in Russia - apparently politically motivated as the US company is caught up in Russia\u2019s dispute with the West over Ukraine. About half of McDonald\u2019s 450 restaurants in Russia were put under government investigation. Get ready to take on investors Easterbrook will be under pressure from investors to turn things around quickly. Activist investors alarmed by the company\u2019s poor performance are likely to give the new chief executive a hard time from word go. Activist fund Jana Partners took a stake in McDonald\u2019s in November, while shares jumped a month later on speculation that one of the most determined activists, Bill Ackman intended to buy a stake and shake things up. Slim down the menu In a bid to be all things to all men and offer healthier alternatives to burgers and fries, some argue the menu has got too complicated. Bigger menus have made kitchen operations more complex, giving some customers a longer wait for their fast food fix. Read the history books Dust down those history books, for McDonald\u2019s has been here before. In the early 2000s the chain experienced similar problems. Back in 2003 it reported its first quarterly loss since going public in 1965. Jim Cantalupo, the then chairman and chief executive, said at the time: \u201cThe world has changed. Our customers have changed. We have to change, too.\u201d Management did turn the company around, so will history repeat itself?",

This is not a surprise in our view given that our estimated value of Afren\u2019s assets of around $1.5bn in an $80 a barrel long-term oil price environment is just about enough to cover our 2014 year-end estimated net debt of around $1.5bn. Therefore, in our view, additional equity investment in the company would only make sense if an equity investor believes in (1) an around $100 a barrel environment and/or (2) the company will unlock additional value via exploration. We doubt many equity investors will be willing to invest in Afren on those assumptions given the risk of default and the fact that under the same assumptions they can find attractive investments in plenty of other names. </p> <p>At the mercy of the bondholders. With a $235m cash balance (albeit restricted) and 30,000 barrels a day of production, we believe the lender of the loan facility will likely be able to recover its loan fully. However, that may not be the case with the bondholders. We estimate that in a fire-sale (i.e. selling the assets in the current $50 a barrel environment) the assets may be valued in the $500-600m range, or roughly 1/3 of our estimated net- debt position. This is in line with the market value of the bonds that are currently trading roughly at 1/3 of their face value. If the bondholders are able to find an entity/management team that believes in an $80 plus barrel oil price environment we see a potential for a bond-to-equity swap, rather than a fire-sale. However, should Afren default on the coupon payments, the bondholders will have the opportunity to completely squeeze out the current equity holders from such a transaction. </p> <p>An equity offer [from potential predator Seplat is] unlikely on Friday, in our view. The announced liquidity crunch has probably made Seplat\u2019s decision easier. We don\u2019t see why would Seplat go through with what now seems like a complicated \u2018equity acquisition\u2019 when it can try to negotiate with the bondholders for a potentially better deal instead. Therefore, we see low likelihood of an offer on Friday. If anything, we could see another extension, in light of the new situation, or no offer at all. </p> </blockquote>",

This is not a surprise in our view given that our estimated value of Afren\u2019s assets of around $1.5bn in an $80 a barrel long-term oil price environment is just about enough to cover our 2014 year-end estimated net debt of around $1.5bn. Therefore, in our view, additional equity investment in the company would only make sense if an equity investor believes in (1) an around $100 a barrel environment and/or (2) the company will unlock additional value via exploration. We doubt many equity investors will be willing to invest in Afren on those assumptions given the risk of default and the fact that under the same assumptions they can find attractive investments in plenty of other names. At the mercy of the bondholders. With a $235m cash balance (albeit restricted) and 30,000 barrels a day of production, we believe the lender of the loan facility will likely be able to recover its loan fully. However, that may not be the case with the bondholders. We estimate that in a fire-sale (i.e. selling the assets in the current $50 a barrel environment) the assets may be valued in the $500-600m range, or roughly 1/3 of our estimated net- debt position. This is in line with the market value of the bonds that are currently trading roughly at 1/3 of their face value. If the bondholders are able to find an entity/management team that believes in an $80 plus barrel oil price environment we see a potential for a bond-to-equity swap, rather than a fire-sale. However, should Afren default on the coupon payments, the bondholders will have the opportunity to completely squeeze out the current equity holders from such a transaction. An equity offer [from potential predator Seplat is] unlikely on Friday, in our view. The announced liquidity crunch has probably made Seplat\u2019s decision easier. We don\u2019t see why would Seplat go through with what now seems like a complicated \u2018equity acquisition\u2019 when it can try to negotiate with the bondholders for a potentially better deal instead. Therefore, we see low likelihood of an offer on Friday. If anything, we could see another extension, in light of the new situation, or no offer at all.",

      "bodyText": "Over the course of a generation Tesco steamrollered its way across the country, seemingly building supermarkets in every postcode to cement a dominant position resulting in its tills ringing up nearly \u00a31 in every \u00a37 spent on the British high street. But at the start of this month new Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis, faced with falling profits and last year\u2019s accounting scandal, not only abandoned plans for 49 new stores but said it would shut 43 existing branches. Although the locations of the store closures were made public on Wednesday, Tesco has not revealed the abandoned developments. But exclusive research by the Guardian has pieced together a full list exposing how the cuts will affect communities across the country. Lewis\u2019s decision to abandon the planned stores marked a turning point in Tesco history and the brand\u2019s love-hate relationship with the British public. For every campaign group claiming victory for local shopkeepers there was a council chief head in hands after a round robin email, timed to coincide with the grocer\u2019s Christmas trading update, confirmed it was shelving hundreds of millions of pounds worth of investments. The abandoned projects range from a small to a grandiose scale, taking in a Lincolnshire malt house that English Heritage lists as one of the largest at-risk buildings in the country, a Wolverhampton hospital built by Victorian philanthropists and a Fife football pitch. Many of the projects were part of larger schemes that together promised more than 1,000 new flats and houses. Those homes and thousands of jobs Tesco promised to bring to struggling communities may never materialise. The retrenchment is on top of more than 100 sites dropped by Lewis\u2019s predecessor Philip Clarke. Some of the housing projects are still going ahead as Tesco is not the land owner \u2013 and Cowdenbeath got a new football pitch because it had to be laid down first \u2013 but others are in limbo. Chris Shepley, chair of the National Retail Planning Forum, said Tesco\u2019s about-face would hit some communities harder than others. \u201cThis is a shock because for so long Tesco were highly expansionist and planners were used to having to deal with a steamroller \u2013 sometimes one which brought benefits, but not always.\u201d Investors are also weighing up the costs and benefits of Tesco\u2019s decision. While the retailer will be saving millions of pounds in store building and fit-out costs, investors are bracing themselves for another major writedown on the value of Tesco\u2019s property assets. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mike Dennis thinks the latest round of retrenchment could result in a hit of at least \u00a3550m which would be in addition to a writedown of more than \u00a31bn reflecting the UK chain\u2019s reduced profitability. In 2013 the retailer took an \u00a3800m charge after shelving more than 100 store projects. The true scale of this writedown is difficult for analysts to calculate as it involves the cost of breaking the financial promises Tesco has made around the country. In Somerset, for example, two local councils were due to share \u00a311m from selling land to Tesco. About half that money is needed to pay off a loan used to fund a new swimming pool, but it is not clear how much the retailer will have to pay. In another example of how the costs could add up, a Scottish council says Tesco remains on the hook for a land deal reported to be worth \u00a310m. Aberdeenshire council is reliant on cash from the sale of Canal Park, home to local football teams Deveronside and Banff Rovers, to pay for new leisure facilities. With councils being offered reassurances right up until the end of last year, many were stunned by Tesco\u2019s sudden change of heart. Small communities such as Chatteris, in Cambridgeshire, and Immingham in Lincolnshire have been left in limbo with shiny new stores lying empty and Tesco signed up to long leases that it may struggle to pass on. In 2013 Tesco agreed a 25-year lease on the \u00a322m Chatteris store. Immingham mayor Malcolm Cullum said Tesco was guilty of \u201cplaying with peoples\u2019 lives\u201d. The town had waited more than a decade for its dated shopping precinct to be revamped and it now has an empty shop at its heart. \u201cWe thought we might be safe,\u201d said Cullum. \u201cI know shopping habits are changing and supermarkets are not building big out-of-town stores but everybody would have been able to walk to this supermarket.\u201d Tesco\u2019s determination to conquer the UK led to lengthy planning battles and some of the jettisoned projects can be traced back to the Sir Terry Leahy era. Its ownership of the former Wolverhampton Royal Hospital \u2013 until recently the focus of a \u00a365m plan \u2013 dates back almost to 2000 while Tesco spent tens of millions of pounds and more than a decade buying land for a now scrapped development in Dartford, Kent. One high profile casualty is a \u00a3200m Tesco-led project to redevelop the town centre of Kirkby in Merseyside. The plan was a second attempt after a \u00a3400m plan for a new Everton stadium (Leahy is a diehard Blues fan) and shopping centre was knocked back by the government in 2009. The retailer\u2019s withdrawal blindsided Knowsley council, which said meetings had continued as normal until the end of last year with preparatory works, including the demolition of 72 homes, at an advanced stage. It is now casting around for another private sector partner. In Sleaford, home to one of three stores the retailer has dropped in Lincolnshire, Tesco\u2019s \u00a320m investment was to kickstart the regeneration of the historic Bass Maltings into shops, offices and more than 200 apartments. Its owner, Avant Homes, concedes the project is now delayed as it relied on infrastructure linked to the Tesco plan. Mike Kiely, chair of the Planning Officers Society, said retrenchment by the major supermarkets was likely to hit small towns more than cities. \u201cWhere a town is relatively small but looking for a large scale development, supermarkets may well have a significant role to play. They are not going to attract John Lewis or a big shopping centre and they may struggle to find an alternative.\u201d German discounters Aldi and Lidl are looking for new sites, but their requirements are much smaller and so they won\u2019t be able to directly replace a Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s or Asda. Tom Edson, at property consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle said a better alternative could be a complete change of use. \u201cTesco could put up social housing in less affluent areas and get positive PR and some cash in.\u201d That solution is not going to help Armagh, where Tesco is half way through building a 44,000sq ft store. Local councillor Gerard Paul White said Tesco\u2019s abandonment of the store was \u201ca blow\u201d to the Northern Irish town, particularly as it had promised to bring up to 300 new jobs to the city hit by the closure of hospital services and a large call centre. While Tesco has promised to complete the building and put it on the market, Edson said finding a new tenant is likely to be tough. \u201cWe are trying to breathe life into the city,\u201d said White. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a shopping centre on the outskirts which is thriving and we\u2019re trying to attract businesses into the town centre. We thought Tesco would be the missing link.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Queensland election this Saturday is one of the most fascinating state elections for a long while. The Newman government is in danger of losing, despite winning the last election with a 67-seat majority in a parliament with only 89 seats. </p> <p>Three years ago, after being elected, the premier, Campbell Newman, set about following an austerity agenda that saw public service numbers drastically cut and public spending slashed. It was some very harsh medicine, and given the Queensland economy remains weak, Newman might have a tough time convincing voters he has the cure.<br></p> <p>Queensland\u2019s economy \u2013 like the state itself \u2013 is rather different to the rest of Australia. First there is the size of the place \u2013 something often forgotten by southerners. </p> <p>No other state has cities as large as Townville and Cairns as far away from the capital city. To give it some context, Cairns is not that much smaller than Geelong, and yet rather being than just an hour\u2019s drive from Melbourne, Cairns is about as far from Brisbane as Brisbane is from Melbourne. </p> <p>Therefore services outside the capital city are much more important and challenging to deliver than in other states where outlying regions are far less populated (and thus contain far few voters).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/embeds/qldmap-embed.html\" data-alt=\"Queensland election map - interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/embeds/qldmap-embed.html\">Queensland election map - interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The size of state brings with it a rather different economy to other states. Yes it is a mining state, but not really in the way that Western Australia is. </p> <p>The mining industry accounts for about 30% of the WA economy, whereas in Queensland it accounts for only 9%. Queensland\u2019s biggest industry in terms of output is actually the construction industry \u2013 it\u2019s the only state where that is the case. </p> <p>It was an economy that Campbell Newman decided needed to be run by a much smaller government. </p> <p>He embarked on a series of austerity measures and is now campaigning to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/27/queensland-election-campbell-newman-pins-hopes-on-37bn-privatisation-plan\">privatise a number of assets</a>. </p> <p>Newman\u2019s Liberal National party (LNP) plan to lease its ports, power generators, and electricity transmission and distribution businesses for 50 years, with an option to extend, in the hope of using the proceeds to pay off some debt and to build infrastructure such as roads, rail hospitals and schools and for a \u201c<a href=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2014/10/12/queenslanders-to-get-electricity-price-relief\">cost of living fund</a>\u201d which will be used to remove the cost of the solar bonus scheme from electricity prices. </p> <p>Privatisation in Queensland \u2013 mostly due to fear in regional areas of a large drop in quality of services and a large rise in price \u2013 has had a history of being about as popular as poison. And certainly the Bligh government achieved that level of popularity when it privatised the Port of Brisbane Authority, Queensland Motorways, forestry plantations, the Abbot Point coal terminal and some of Queensland Rail\u2019s rail lines.</p> <p>The arguments for privatisation are quite contested \u2013 especially those related to the electricity generation and network. The belief that it will lead to lower prices seems a lot stronger in theory than it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/jan/10/privatisation-benefits-are-not-assured-and-public-are-sceptical-history-shows\">does in practice</a> </p> <p>But the Newman government also has to overcome the view that its cuts to the public service and overall handling of the economy have left Queensland in worse shape than it was three years ago. </p> <p>The Commsec annual <a href=\"https://www.commsec.com.au/stateofstates\">State of the States</a> report for 2015 doesn\u2019t provide much joy for the LNP. </p> <p>It suggests that overall \u201cQueensland remains close to Victoria in the performance rankings, retaining fifth position\u201d.</p> <p>The only points where the state seems to be doing well are in \u201cequipment investment and overall construction work done\u201d \u2013 a must for Queensland given the importance of construction to its economy. </p> <p>But it comes in sixth \u201con the leading indicators of population growth and dwelling starts\u201d and also, most damningly, \u201csixth on unemployment\u201d.</p> <p>Employment was set to be a huge election issue \u2013 and a key aspect of the ALP\u2019s campaign.

      "bodyText": "The Queensland election this Saturday is one of the most fascinating state elections for a long while. The Newman government is in danger of losing, despite winning the last election with a 67-seat majority in a parliament with only 89 seats. Three years ago, after being elected, the premier, Campbell Newman, set about following an austerity agenda that saw public service numbers drastically cut and public spending slashed. It was some very harsh medicine, and given the Queensland economy remains weak, Newman might have a tough time convincing voters he has the cure. Queensland\u2019s economy \u2013 like the state itself \u2013 is rather different to the rest of Australia. First there is the size of the place \u2013 something often forgotten by southerners. No other state has cities as large as Townville and Cairns as far away from the capital city. To give it some context, Cairns is not that much smaller than Geelong, and yet rather being than just an hour\u2019s drive from Melbourne, Cairns is about as far from Brisbane as Brisbane is from Melbourne. Therefore services outside the capital city are much more important and challenging to deliver than in other states where outlying regions are far less populated (and thus contain far few voters). The size of state brings with it a rather different economy to other states. Yes it is a mining state, but not really in the way that Western Australia is. The mining industry accounts for about 30% of the WA economy, whereas in Queensland it accounts for only 9%. Queensland\u2019s biggest industry in terms of output is actually the construction industry \u2013 it\u2019s the only state where that is the case. It was an economy that Campbell Newman decided needed to be run by a much smaller government. He embarked on a series of austerity measures and is now campaigning to privatise a number of assets. Newman\u2019s Liberal National party (LNP) plan to lease its ports, power generators, and electricity transmission and distribution businesses for 50 years, with an option to extend, in the hope of using the proceeds to pay off some debt and to build infrastructure such as roads, rail hospitals and schools and for a \u201ccost of living fund\u201d which will be used to remove the cost of the solar bonus scheme from electricity prices. Privatisation in Queensland \u2013 mostly due to fear in regional areas of a large drop in quality of services and a large rise in price \u2013 has had a history of being about as popular as poison. And certainly the Bligh government achieved that level of popularity when it privatised the Port of Brisbane Authority, Queensland Motorways, forestry plantations, the Abbot Point coal terminal and some of Queensland Rail\u2019s rail lines. The arguments for privatisation are quite contested \u2013 especially those related to the electricity generation and network. The belief that it will lead to lower prices seems a lot stronger in theory than it does in practice But the Newman government also has to overcome the view that its cuts to the public service and overall handling of the economy have left Queensland in worse shape than it was three years ago. The Commsec annual State of the States report for 2015 doesn\u2019t provide much joy for the LNP. It suggests that overall \u201cQueensland remains close to Victoria in the performance rankings, retaining fifth position\u201d. The only points where the state seems to be doing well are in \u201cequipment investment and overall construction work done\u201d \u2013 a must for Queensland given the importance of construction to its economy. But it comes in sixth \u201con the leading indicators of population growth and dwelling starts\u201d and also, most damningly, \u201csixth on unemployment\u201d. Employment was set to be a huge election issue \u2013 and a key aspect of the ALP\u2019s campaign. But then the December unemployment figures released two weeks ago showed a big drop in the state\u2019s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate from 6.8% to 6.1%: The seasonally adjusted measures of state unemployment are notorious for their wild fluctuations and they are ignored by anyone with any sense. Even the Queensland treasurer, Tim Nicholls, has in the past called the trend rate \u201cmore reliable\u201d. The trend rate stayed flat at 6.6%. But with the media all reporting the seasonally adjusted drop, the ALP big unemployment campaign was stymied. But Queensland\u2019s employment situation is not good. The 6.6% rate is the second worst on the mainland \u2013 only Victoria with 6.7% is worse. And over the course of the Newman government, Queensland\u2019s unemployment has been worse than the national rate. While the state had benefitted from investment and growth of jobs in the mining sector, in 2012 \u2013 the same time Newman moved to begin his austerity plan that saw government consumption and expenditure in infrastructure decline \u2013 the mining boom came off the boil: It saw employment growth plummet during 2012 and stay low until mid-late 2013: But the curious thing about Queensland\u2019s resurgence of employment growth was that it was almost entirely a part-time employment growth: Usually total and full-time employment grow around the same pace, and certainly in the same direction. But from the start of 2013, while full-time employment in Queensland stagnated or fell, total employment grew strongly \u2013 because of a growth in part-time employment. The bad news for Newman is even this growth has now dimmed. Queensland\u2019s employment growth in the past 12 months is second worst only to South Australia, and similarly second worst over the past three years: It\u2019s not a picture that suggests the austerity measures have produced wonderful economic gains. The limited employment growth that Queenslanders experienced was short-lived and mostly for part-time work only \u2013 hardly the thing that is promised when politicians tell voters that the pain will be worth it. The LNP is still the favourite to get over the line on Saturday, but if it does, it won\u2019t be because of any great economic performance that has been achieved in the past three years.
