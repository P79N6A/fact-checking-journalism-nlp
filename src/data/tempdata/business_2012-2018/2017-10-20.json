      "bodyText": "The Adani Group has promoted a bizarre video advertisement on Facebook, in which the Indian company responds to revelations its Australian coal operations face growing financial risks. The video, targeting people in Melbourne, flashes up text on the screen, backed by fast and upbeat percussive music. It displays \u201callegations\u201d, which are labelled as \u201clies\u201d, followed by attempts to set the record straight. It also misspells \u201cAbott point\u201d, its coal terminal. The video was uploaded along with a long post that contains strange defences of its operation, including the false claim that the entire allegations about the company are based on \u201cjust one screenshot of random text\u201d. The Facebook post had more than 580,000 views on the video statistics at the time of writing. Tim Buckley, a financial analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, made many of the allegations Adani was attempting to refute. Aired in an episode of ABC\u2019s Four Corners program, the institute claimed Adani\u2019s operations in Australia were unprofitable and required the Carmichael mine to bail them out. Buckley described the video as a \u201cdesperate attempt to try and counter some of the facts with loud music and flashing lights\u201d and a sign that the campaign against Adani in Australia is having an impact. \u201cIn one respect it shows that Adani is taking it seriously,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cThe whole campaign in Australia is doing enormous damage to the social licence to operate of Adani.\u201d The ad has been uncovered by a Guardian Australia and ProPublica collaboration to track political advertising on Facebook. Facebook ads are \u201csponsored\u201d posts that an advertiser has paid to push into the news feed of a specifically targeted pool of people. Unless the ad appears in your feed, there is no easy way to determine that a post has been sponsored. This makes it difficult to keep track of political advertising on the social network. Facebook advertising is considered effective because it allows messaging to be fed to a very specific audience based on demographics and interests. In this case, the Adani ad was aimed at targeting \u201cpeople ages 18 and older who live or were recently near Melbourne, Victoria\u201d. The video was posted on 17 October, about two weeks after Four Corners aired a report about the escalating financial risks of Adani\u2019s operations in Australia, including the Abbot Point coal terminal, and the proposed Carmichael coalmine. Much of the Four Corners story was based on a detailed report by the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis (Ieefa), which said the push to develop the Carmichael mine appeared to be a desperate attempt by Adani to save its unprofitable and debt-ridden Abbot Point coal terminal. It also revisited the allegations of financial and environmental crimes committed by the Adani Group and its senior executives, including those allegations revealed by the Guardian. Adani says the post was a response to a GetUp video, which itself was a summary of the Ieefa and Four Corners reports. The company\u2019s post said: \u201cThe entire baseless accusation on Adani is based on just one screenshot of random text with no mention of its origins or reference.\u201d However, the Ieefa report is publicly available, and contains a long list of references, also available to anyone. The allegations of tax avoidance are based on many documents, including a leaked investigation from the Indian directorate of revenue intelligence, which the Guardian has published. One key part of the Ieefa and Four Corners report was the fact that the existing Abbot Point coal terminal had been operating at only 50% capacity, adding to evidence the port\u2019s viability was tied to the successful development of the Carmichael coal mine, which will fill the rest of its throughput. The Facebook post says: \u201cThe Abbot Point Coal Terminal has consistently delivered 100% of supply-driven throughout and is not a low utilisation of Asset.\u201d However, government data from the North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation \u2013 collated in the Ieefa report \u2013 shows the port has averaged just over 50% utilisation since the beginning of 2015. The advertisement attacks the idea that Abbot Point is unprofitable by making an unusual claim: \u201cThe capital structure of Abbot point is rated by rating agencies and has investment grade rating from S&amp;P (BBB-),\u201d it says. However, BBB- is the lowest investment grade rating, below which assets become known as \u201cjunk bonds\u201d. Buckley and one of the authors of the Ieefa report said that particular company (Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd) with the poor rating was the only publicly listed company in the Adani group, and the only one in the group that had a credit rating at all. \u201cThat listed company is totally removed from the operations in Australia,\u201d Buckley said, adding that if any other group company had a credit rating, it would be even lower. At the end of Adani\u2019s post, it makes a passing reference to GetUp, suggesting the post was also motivated by one of their videos. \u201cThe analysis of the nos. from the balance sheet by Getup is not correct. In fact, the whole video is a bundle of lies,\u201d the post says. GetUp posted several videos after the Four Corners story, including one that summarised the findings of the Ieefa report. A spokesman for Adani told the Guardian the video was a response to a GetUp video, which included \u201ca non-sourced frame of allegations\u201d. The Adani spokesman insisted that the Abbot Point terminal operated at full capacity. \u201cAAPT maintains its position that 100 per cent of supply side throughput has been delivered since the asset was acquired by Adani,\u201d he said. \u201cContracted capacity, both for counter parties and quantities, is commercial information that we are restricted from sharing due to confidentiality conditions associated with our customers.\u201d If you would like to participate in our project to increase the transparency of political advertising on Facebook, go here.",

      "bodyText": "Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank\u2019s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. \u201cRBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,\u201d the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having \u201creceived reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports\u201d. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report \u2013 paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA\u2019s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee\u2019s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay \u00a3400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: \u201cFor years, thousands of people\u2019s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, along with two recent earthquakes in Mexico, will cost the insurance industry $95bn (\u00a372bn), according to estimates released on Friday. Swiss Re, one of the world\u2019s biggest reinsurance companies, made the estimate as it admitted its own bill for the natural disasters would be around $3.6bn. Reinsurance companies such as Swiss Re stand behind insurance companies and help to cushion the blow of claims from their customers. Swiss Re warned that the \u201cestimates are subject to a higher than usual degree of uncertainty\u201d and could need to be adjusted as claims come in. Christian Mumenthaler, Swiss Re\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe most recent natural catastrophes have been extremely powerful and we extend our sympathies to all those affected by these events.\u201d Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas in August, causing flood damage and leading to more than 80 people being reported killed in the state. Hurricane Irma caused devastation across the Caribbean in September before hitting Florida and Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico. Earthquakes hit Mexico last month, one of which was the most powerful the country had suffered in 32 years and killed at least 90 people. Swiss Re did not provide information about the bill it faced for payouts caused by damage from the hurricanes but put the cost of Mexican quakes at $175m, indicating the bulk of its costs were caused by the hurricanes. Other estimates have been made for the cost of the hurricanes. Hiscox, an insurer on the Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market, has put the cost of the insured damage of Harvey and Irma at $50bn. At the time Bronek Masojada, chief executive of Hiscox, said the claims would make 2017 one of the worst years for natural disasters. But he indicated that the cost to the insurance industry would be reduced by the fact that only one in six Houston homeowners were covered. The economic cost \u2013 which includes damage which is not covered by insurance policies \u2013 has been estimated at $300bn.",

      "bodyText": "The recent downturn on the high street is largely down to the weather but the uncertainty of Brexit continues to dampen demand for big household purchases, according to the boss of John Lewis. \u201cOctober is going to look pretty grim for the market,\u201d said Paula Nickolds, managing director of the department store, ahead of the opening of the company\u2019s first new store in a year, in Oxford. But Nickolds said the poor month was down in comparison to a very strong trading period last year, when shoppers finally took to the high street to buy their winter woolies after a very warm September. This year October has been warmer while September was better for many retailers. Nickolds explained that looking at the last three months together, trading was similar to last year. \u201cIt is not a contraction of the market it is more about the vagaries of the weather. It would be dangerous to read too much into the October numbers,\u201d she said. The retailer still expects this year\u2019s Black Friday discounting event on 24 November to be its busiest trading day of the year. Nickolds said John Lewis was trading ahead of the market as a whole and sales had picked up in comparison to the company\u2019s first half which ended in July. She said the pattern of trade remained similar with fashion, beauty and \u201clittle pleasures\u201d selling well. However, home furnishings and more expensive purchases were \u201creally challenged\u201d as housing sales remain low. \u201cIn my years in retail I have never seen such a pace of change or level of transformation and disruption we are experiencing at the moment. What is happening in retail predates Brexit, it\u2019s about the changing nature of customer behaviour and changes to fixed costs. It\u2019s true to say that its been exacerbated by the uncertainty of Brexit and what that has done to consumer confidence,\u201d she said. She said John Lewis had to up its game by tempting shoppers back to the high street with the kind of experiences they could not find online. While some shoppers would be focusing on cheap prices, Nickolds said there was also likely to be a \u201cflight to quality\u201d as others sought out fewer but longer lasting buys. Nickolds said John Lewis needed to hold to its \u201cnorth star\u201d of good customer care and quality while introducing more services. The \u00a318m Oxford store is home to the retailer\u2019s first \u201cbrand experience manager\u201d to help navigate 21 services on offer, including the chain\u2019s first personal shopper for men, technology workshops and a pop in nail and eyebrow bar. A fifth of the 120,000 sq ft Oxford store\u2019s floorspace is dedicated to such services as well as events spaces, where John Lewis expects to host yoga classes, storytelling for kids and fashion events, as well as two restaurants and a coffee bar. The retailer, which now sells 40% of its goods online, has slowed new store openings to a trickle. It has confirmed plans for just two more outlets \u2013 Westfield in west London and in Cheltenham, both due next year. John Lewis\u2019s parent company\u2019s half year profits slumped by more than 50% amid rising costs, particularly at its Waitrose chain, and weaker consumer demand prompted by Brexit.",

    "webTitle": "UK budget deficit narrows to lowest level September since 2007", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s budget deficit has fallen to its lowest level in any September for the last 10 years, as higher than-expected tax recepits handed Philip Hammond a boost ahead of next month\u2019s autumn budget. The 11% drop from September last year shows the government\u2019s finances putting in a better than expected performance despite recent Brexit turmoil and a sharp slowdown in GDP growth. Analysts said that if tax and spending plans remain on course for the rest of the financial year, the exchequer will undershoot official predictions for the annual 2017-18 deficit \u2013 the gap between government income and expenditure \u2013 by around \u00a310bn, pushing it nearer to \u00a348bn than the official forecast of \u00a358bn. However, analysts have warned that much of the extra room for spending in the budget \u2013 as indicated by the narrower-than-expected deficit \u2013 could evaporate should Brexit talks generate more uncertainty, in turn hitting investment and tax receipts. Another blow is expected once the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s economic forecaster, makes good on hints it will dramatically revise down its forecasts for productivity growth and tax receipt income for rest of the parliament. The ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded the UK\u2019s credit status last month after it warned that the debt pile was likely to continue rising while the government coped with the fallout from Brexit. Mounting pressure on the chancellor to put more money into the NHS and school budgets while relaxing severe cuts on in-work benefits, could also deny Hammond vital funds for investment and improvements to UK infrastructure. The Office for National Statistics said the public spending deficit stood at \u00a35.9bn in September, lower than a forecast of \u00a36.5bn in a Reuters poll of economists. September\u2019s figures marked the third straight month in which the public finances performed much better than analysts had expected, even as the economy has suffered from uncertainty created by Brexit negotiations. John Hawksworth, senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC, said the improvement was largely a spin-off from rising inflation, which raised the price of goods in the shops with the knock-on effect of boosting VAT receipts. ONS figures show a rise in VAT income was also largely behind improvements in August and July. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said September\u2019s modest borrowing left the cumulative deficit for the first six months of the financial year at \u00a332.5bn, which is only \u00a32.5bn lower than in the same period last year. Tombs said the deficit is on course to be \u00a310bn lower by next March than the latest forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. \u201cBorrowing now appears to be on track to come in at about \u00a348bn this fiscal year, \u00a310bn or so below the OBR\u2019s March forecast. The OBR, however, likely will downgrade in forecasts for productivity, countering the beneficial impact of this year\u2019s borrowing undershoot in future years,\u201d Tombs said. The OBR said September\u2019s figures were helped by a rebate from the European Union on contributions to Brussels following a period of underspending by member states. Another factor was lower than expected outgoings on tax credits and universal credit where spending during the first half of the financial year was down 5% on a year earlier It said: \u201cInterpreting this is complicated, since some of the drop relates to some of the caseload moving to universal credit. Our March forecast assumed that tax credits spending would fall 2.6%, with the decline more than explained by the shift to universal credit. In fact, spending seems to be falling in underlying terms too, with new claims lower than expected.\u201d Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cGiven record low unemployment and surprisingly robust retail sales, it\u2019s not hard to see why the Treasury is making inroads on bringing its borrowing back in line. \u201cDespite the improving fiscal outlook, we can\u2019t expect too many giveaways in the forthcoming budget. While the deficit is falling, the government still owes an eye-watering amount of money.\u201d A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cWhile we\u2019ve made great progress getting the deficit down by over two-thirds, government borrowing is still far too high at over \u00a3150m a day. We will continue to take a balanced approach that deals with our debts and allows us to invest in our public services.\u201d",

September\u2019s figures marked the third straight month in which the public finances performed much better than analysts had expected, even as the economy has suffered from uncertainty created by Brexit negotiations.</p> \n<p>John Hawksworth, senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC, said the improvement was largely a spin-off from rising inflation, which raised the price of goods in the shops with the knock-on effect of boosting VAT receipts.</p> \n<p>ONS figures show a rise in VAT income was also largely behind improvements in August and July.</p> \n<p>Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said September\u2019s modest borrowing left the cumulative deficit for the first six months of the financial year at \u00a332.5bn, which is only \u00a32.5bn lower than in the same period last year. Tombs said the deficit is on course to be \u00a310bn lower by next March than the latest forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p> \n<p>\u201cBorrowing now appears to be on track to come in at about \u00a348bn this fiscal year, \u00a310bn or so below the OBR\u2019s March forecast. The OBR, however, likely will downgrade in forecasts for productivity, countering the beneficial impact of this year\u2019s borrowing undershoot in future years,\u201d Tombs said.</p> \n<p>The OBR said September\u2019s figures were helped by a rebate from the European Union on contributions to Brussels following a period of underspending by member states. Another factor was lower than expected outgoings on tax credits and universal credit where spending during the first half of the financial year was down 5% on a year earlier</p> \n<p>It said: \u201cInterpreting this is complicated, since some of the drop relates to some of the caseload moving to universal credit. Our March forecast assumed that tax credits spending would fall 2.6%, with the decline more than explained by the shift to universal credit. In fact, spending seems to be falling in underlying terms too, with new claims lower than expected.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/borrowing-zip/giv-3902rmh53flak1JE/\" data-alt=\"net borrowing graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/borrowing-zip/giv-3902rmh53flak1JE/\">net borrowing graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cGiven record low unemployment and surprisingly robust retail sales, it\u2019s not hard to see why the Treasury is making inroads on bringing its borrowing back in line.</p> \n<p>\u201cDespite the improving fiscal outlook, we can\u2019t expect too many giveaways in the forthcoming budget.

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Bank and five of its former directors \u201cemphatically reject\u201d allegations they were bullied into taking over HBOS, their QC has told the high court. Helen Davies was responding to claims made by 6,000 Lloyds shareholders, who have brought a \u00a3600m compensation claim that they were not given a true picture of the financial health of HBOS when they voted through the takeover in November 2008. When the case opened on Wednesday, the shareholders\u2019 QC, Richard Hill, said Lloyds had been bullied into taking over HBOS by being told it would need a \u00a37bn government bailout in October 2008 if it continued as a standalone bank. Lloyds announced the takeover of HBOS on 18 September 2008. The government eventually took a 43% stake in the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group, but it no longer owns any shares after selling its final tranche in May. Davies said the directors, who include former chairman Sir Victor Blank and former chief executive Eric Daniels, emphatically rejected the idea that the demand by regulators that it find \u00a37bn of capital was a \u201cnaked threat\u201d. Blanks and Daniels are scheduled to give evidence in the coming weeks along with three other former directors named in the case: former finance director Tim Tookey, ex-head of retail Helen Weir and former head of wholesale banking Truett Tate. Hill told Mr Justice Norris at the start of the case on Wednesday that the the deal took place amid intervention from the then prime minister, Gordon Brown, to avoid the nationalisation of HBOS in September 2008. The shareholders, Hill said, were \u201cmugged\u201d during the transaction and were not told about loans HBOS was receiving from the Bank of England and Lloyds itself. Davies said Lloyds had found that the requirement for an extra \u00a37bn of capital was not negotiable with the Financial Services Authority, the then City regulator. This was set out during the weekend in October 2008 when the UK was orchestrating a so-called recapitalisation exercise of its banking sector. The City regulator, she said, had wanted to \u201cbulletproof\u201d the banking sector and had rejected Lloyds\u2019 calculations that \u00a33bn of capital would be required. She said it was the responsibility of investment banking advisers at Merrill Lynch, UBS and Citibank to ensure that information sent to Lloyds shareholders was correct. During this transaction, she said, UBS had the primary responsibility for dealing with the UK Listing Authority, which oversees stock market-listed companies and analysed the information. \u201cThis is not just a box-ticking exercise,\u201d Davies said.",

      "bodyText": "BrewDog\u2019s 60,000 \u201cEquity Punk\u201d investors enjoy lifetime discounts and free brews on their birthday as part of the craft beer company\u2019s crowdfunded money-raising scheme. But while BrewDog\u2019s beer may flow freely, the market for its shares is less fluid. Its latest fundraising effort, launched this week, aims to raise \u00a310-50m to fund expansion in four continents. But Equity Punks who do sign up may only sell during annual windows decided by the company and founder-boss, James Watt, the largest shareholder with a 25% stake. That means that while those who invested in the first of BrewDog\u2019s five crowdfunding rounds may be sitting on a paper return of 2,765% \u2013 and some have happily cashed out \u2013 such a rise has yet to be tested under normal market conditions. Watt, ensconced in a booth at BrewDog Shoreditch in east London, part of his 50-strong bar network, admits that the next share-trading window, due in 2018, will provide a stern test of the company\u2019s true value. \u201cIf there are more sellers than there are buyers then that will obviously impact the share price,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a microcosm for conditions when we might become a public company.\u201d In the last trading window, hosted on the trading platform Asset Match, the firm protected its share price by dipping into the market, buying shares to plough into a staff equity reward scheme, known as Hop Stock. Watt is adamant such a price tag is not overblown, despite BrewDog reporting just \u00a37m in underlying profit last year. \u201cSome people would look at Fever-Tree [the tonic water brand valued on the stock market at \u00a32.5bn] and say our valuation should be compared to a fast-growing drinks company,\u201d he says. Buyers, emboldened perhaps by the TSG investment, are still pestering Watt with sizeable takeover offers. The last, he says, came in just two weeks ago, but was rejected out of hand. Like Fever-Tree, one route to crystallising BrewDog\u2019s value is a stock market listing. Watt insists the company could only go public if it can protect its sacred cows, such as its 20% profit giveaway, with half shared among staff and half going to charity. \u201cWe can IPO but not IPO the voting shares or float a smaller percentage where no investor or pension fund can force us to do anything we don\u2019t want to,\u201d says Watt \u201cOr we could write something into our articles of association, or even build our own trading platform instead and host it on our website.\u201d Another option under consideration is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), in which firms raise funds via cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. Would Watt, rarely if ever seen in a suit, still need to hobnob in the City of London and schmooze industry analysts? Possibly not. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just not bother messing about in the City and just post a video on your website every month with full financials and the analysts can do with that what they want?\u201d he says. Whatever format BrewDog plumps for, Watt talks the kind of game that investors like to hear \u2013 growth \u2013 and he has the numbers to back up his confidence. From a standing start in 2007, a two-man band of Watt and co-founder Martin Dickie have built the UK\u2019s biggest craft brewery. Last year, 645 employees helped it produce 214,000 hectolitres of beer (nearly 38m pints), racking up sales of \u00a371m in the UK and 50 export markets. The Ellon, Aberdeenshire, company has already established a beachhead in the US by opening a brewery in Columbus, Ohio, where it is also building a hotel. But the broadest horizons may lie to the east. Watt gets visibly excited when talking about the market potential of China. . \u201cThe US is a key part of our strategy and initial signs are good. But in China we\u2019re going to build a brewery and we have an opportunity to grow exponentially where the craft beer market is forecast to be more than 10m hectolitres [1.7bn pints] in five years time.\u201d Watt\u2019s sometimes confrontational manner came to the fore earlier this year, when BrewDog\u2019s \u201cpunk\u201d ethos was called into question due to its pursuit of two bars for trademark infringement. This was a \u201cgrowing pain\u201d, says Watt, caused by the tension between the company\u2019s stated principles and its burgeoning size. \u201cWe deserved to take some flak, maybe not quite that much. But I was disappointed with how we handled it and lessons have been learned. \u201cIt\u2019s important that as we grow, we\u2019re not like other big companies in terms of how we do things.\u201d Watt remains as abrasive as ever when it comes to \u201cBig Beer\u201d, particularly in the light of recent deals in which multinational firms have bought out rival craft ale brewers. \u201cBig beer stands for everything craft beer isn\u2019t. They\u2019ve been responsible for the commoditisation and bastardisation of beer over the last 50 years. It\u2019s really disappointing to see craft beer sell out.\u201d But Watt does not believe that BrewDog\u2019s own identity will be similarly compromised by the investment from private equity group TSG Consumer Partners, headquartered in San Francisco, which bought its BrewDog stake through TSV AIV, a vehicle registered in the Cayman Islands. He vows that Brewdog\u2019s idiosyncratic way of doing things will prove to others that success can go hand in hand with principle. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a responsibility to show that this can be a blueprint for a new type of business for the 21st century.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2017 to clarify that TSG Consumer Partners is headquartered in San Francisco.",

But while BrewDog\u2019s beer may flow freely, the market for its shares is less fluid.</p> <p>Its latest fundraising effort, <a href=\"https://www.brewdog.com/equityforpunks\">launched this week</a>, aims to raise \u00a310-50m to fund expansion in four continents.</p> <p>But Equity Punks who do sign up may only sell during annual windows decided by the company and founder-boss, James Watt, the largest shareholder with a 25% stake.</p> <p>That means that while those who invested in the first of BrewDog\u2019s five crowdfunding rounds may be sitting on a paper return of 2,765% \u2013 and some have happily cashed out \u2013 such a rise has yet to be tested under normal market conditions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/24/the-aggressive-outrageous-infuriating-and-ingenious-rise-of-brewdog\">The aggressive, outrageous, infuriating (and ingenious) rise of BrewDog | Jon Henley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watt, ensconced in a booth at BrewDog Shoreditch in east London, part of his 50-strong bar network, admits that the next share-trading window, due in 2018, will provide a stern test of the company\u2019s true value.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are more sellers than there are buyers then that will obviously impact the share price,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a microcosm for conditions when we might become a public company.\u201d</p> <p>In the last trading window, hosted on the <a href=\"http://www.assetmatch.com/\">trading platform Asset Match</a>, the firm protected its share price by dipping into the market, buying shares to plough into a staff equity reward scheme, known as Hop Stock.</p> <p></p> <p>Watt is adamant such a price tag is not overblown, despite BrewDog reporting just \u00a37m in underlying profit last year. \u201cSome people would look at Fever-Tree [the tonic water brand valued on the stock market at \u00a32.5bn] and say our valuation should be compared to a fast-growing drinks company,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Buyers, emboldened perhaps by the TSG investment, are still pestering Watt with sizeable takeover offers. The last, he says, came in just two weeks ago, but was rejected out of hand.</p> <p>Like Fever-Tree, one route to crystallising BrewDog\u2019s value is a stock market listing. Watt insists the company could only go public if it can protect its sacred cows, such as its 20% profit giveaway, with half shared among staff and half going to charity.</p> <p>\u201cWe can IPO but not IPO the voting shares or float a smaller percentage where no investor or pension fund can force us to do anything we don\u2019t want to,\u201d says Watt</p> <p>\u201cOr we could write something into our articles of association, or even build our own trading platform instead and host it on our website.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7ab340d55b616a9b032d55f9157f8e8739c5a1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7ab340d55b616a9b032d55f9157f8e8739c5a1f/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Watt of Brewdog.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Watt of Brewdog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another option under consideration is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), in which firms raise funds via cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin.</p> <p>Would Watt, rarely if ever seen in a suit, still need to hobnob in the City of London and schmooze industry analysts? Possibly not. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just not bother messing about in the City and just post a video on your website every month with full financials and the analysts can do with that what they want?\u201d he says.</p> <p>Whatever format BrewDog plumps for, Watt talks the kind of game that investors like to hear \u2013 growth \u2013 and he has the numbers to back up his confidence.</p> <p>From a standing start in 2007, a two-man band of Watt and co-founder Martin Dickie have built the UK\u2019s biggest craft brewery. Last year, 645 employees helped it produce 214,000 hectolitres of beer (nearly 38m pints), racking up sales of \u00a371m in the UK and 50 export markets.</p> <p>The Ellon, Aberdeenshire, company has already established a beachhead in the US by opening a brewery in Columbus, Ohio, where it is also building a hotel.</p> <p>But the broadest horizons may lie to the east. Watt gets visibly excited when talking about the market potential of China. .</p> <p>\u201cThe US is a key part of our strategy and initial signs are good. But in China we\u2019re going to build a brewery and we have an opportunity to grow exponentially where the craft beer market is forecast to be more than 10m hectolitres [1.7bn pints] in five years time.\u201d</p> <p>Watt\u2019s sometimes confrontational manner came to the fore earlier this year, when BrewDog\u2019s \u201cpunk\u201d ethos was called into question <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/28/brewdog-lawsuit-bar-punk-brewer-pub\">due to its pursuit of two bars for trademark infringement</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd6c26acfe77d72d16597ab27c89f6d22888067\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd6c26acfe77d72d16597ab27c89f6d22888067/0_471_6544_3928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Watt (left) and Martin Dickie, co-founders of BrewDog.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Watt (left) and Martin Dickie, co-founders of BrewDog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Richardson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a \u201cgrowing pain\u201d, says Watt, caused by the tension between the company\u2019s stated principles and its burgeoning size. \u201cWe deserved to take some flak, maybe not quite that much. But I was disappointed with how we handled it and lessons have been learned.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that as we grow, we\u2019re not like other big companies in terms of how we do things.\u201d</p> <p>Watt remains as abrasive as ever when it comes to \u201cBig Beer\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/jan/07/has-camden-town-brewery-ruined-craft-beer-ab-inbev\">particularly in the light of recent deals in which multinational firms have bought out rival craft ale brewers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBig beer stands for everything craft beer isn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "Investors across Europe remain in an upbeat mood this mood, with the FTSE 100 still in with a chance of a new closing high (7,556.24 is the number to beat). FSTE 100: +0.3% at 7,546 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 13,028 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,382 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 22,303 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 10,213 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 390 Wall Street is expected to higher, after the US Senate voted through Trump\u2019s 2018 budget plans, potentially paving the way for the tax cuts pledged by the President. On that note we\u2019re closing up for the day. Thank you for all your comments, and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. AM Britain\u2019s manufacturers are encouraged by what they consider to be progress on Brexit talks after Theresa May\u2019s trip to Brussels for the EU leaders summit. But more needs to be done, cautioned Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the manufacturers\u2019 trade body, EEF: The warmer words emerging from the European Council following the approach adopted by the Prime Minister suggest there is a glimmer of light at the end of this tunnel. Business needs to see more than a hint of progress, however, because serious planning for transitional arrangements should be taking place now if companies are to firm up their business plans and pin down investment. Firms in the UK and across Europe are united in seeking clarity on a transition deal that maintains a level playing field in order to avoid confusion and potential economic damage. Time is moving and without greater political certainty businesses will form their own conclusions and plan accordingly. That is why work on agreeing a transition needs to start now and businesses will redouble their efforts to encourage leaders in the UK and the EU to do that. The pound has reversed earlier losses against the dollar after a hint of progress on Brexit talks from a meeting of European leaders in Brussels. Sterling is up 0.1% at $1.3170. The pound is also up 0.5% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1157. Investors are feeling slightly more positive about Brexit negotiations, as Theresa May and EU leaders appeared to edge forward at the summit. EU leaders, excluding the UK, agreed this morning that they will begin to prepare for talks about how a transition period and Britain\u2019s long-term future outside the EU might work - something May has been pressing for. Follow our politics live blog for all the latest developments in Brussels: Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, shares the view that Hammond is unlikely to be handing out early Christmas gifts in next month\u2019s budget. The deficit is heading in the right direction, helped by increasing revenues from income tax, national insurance and VAT, which underlines how reliant government finances are on UK consumers both earning money, and spending it. Despite the improving fiscal outlook, we can\u2019t expect too many giveaways in the forthcoming budget. While the deficit is falling, the government still owes an eye-watering amount of money. What\u2019s more, the imaginary pie of future tax revenues that the chancellor has to play with is expected to be trimmed back significantly, thanks to an adjustment to economic projections made by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Finally there\u2019s also Brexit in the mix, and the unknown effect this will have on the UK economy, and government finances. All of this means the Chancellor\u2019s spreadsheets will tell him he doesn\u2019t have a great deal of room for manoeuvre on Budget day. Lower than expected government borrowing in September and the year to date suggests Philip Hammond is on track to meet his target of \u00a358.3bn for the year ending March 2018. However, Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics says the chancellor is unlikely to have room for big giveaways when he delivers the budget on 22 November. It is too soon for the chancellor to begin loosening the purse strings in response. After all, the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] expected the deterioration in the public finances to be back-loaded this year, reflecting the unwinding of a number of temporary factors. Moreover, it looks set to revise down its assumptions about productivity and the economy\u2019s potential to grow in its November forecasts, which is likely to significantly reduce the room the chancellor left himself against his fiscal targets. As a result, this is likely to constrain the chancellor\u2019s ability to provide big giveaways in the very near term. The Treasury is keen to show it is not complacent about the deficit, despite the lowest September borrowing figure in a decade. A spokesman said: Whilst we\u2019ve made great progress getting the deficit down by over two thirds, government borrowing is still far too high at over \u00a3150 million a day. We will continue to take a balanced approach that deals with our debts and allows us to invest in our public services. Some welcome news for the chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of his budget on 22 November. The government borrowed less than expected in September, at \u00a35.9bn - the lowest for the month of September since 2007, before the financial crisis dealt a huge blow to the UK economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast \u00a36.5bn. The Office for National Statistics also revised down borrowing for August to \u00a34.7bn from a previous estimate of \u00a35.7bn. It means that over the first six months of the fiscal year (April to September), the government borrowed \u00a332.5bn, \u00a32.5bn less than at the same point last year. That is also the lowest year-to-date borrowing since 2007. Will the Bank of England\u2019s rate setters put their money where there mouth is and vote for a hike in borrowing costs? Last month, investors were convinced a rate hike to 0.5% from the current all-time low of 0.25% was a certainty, after the Monetary Policy Committee dropped heavy hints: Since then however, some weaker economic data and more cautious comments from some members of the MPC have dampened expectations. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex: Last night Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe cast further doubt on a November rate hike by arguing that the UK is \u201cnot seeing sustained signs of domestic inflation pressure\u201d. He joins Dave Ramsden on the dovish end of the spectrum, with the newest deputy governor claiming he was not one of the MPC members who believes rates need to rise \u201cin the coming months\u201d. A rate rise would require the backing of at least five members of the nine-strong committee. Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders voted for a rise in September, so they would need the support of three others. With Cunliffe and Ramsden seemingly out, as well as new member Silvana Tenreyro, that would leave: Mark Carney, governor Ben Broadbent, deputy governor Andy Haldane, chief economist Gertjan Vlieghe, external MPC member All four have hinted they might be willing to vote for a rate rise in November. The FTSE 100 could be in for a new record closing high. It is currently about 14 points off last Thursday\u2019s close of 7,556.24. Over in Spain, investors are so far shrugging off the political instability created by Madrid\u2019s decision to impose direct rule in Catalonia. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, has this take on the markets this morning: Markets are in a decidedly risk-on mood on Friday. Ignoring the risks from escalating tensions in Catalonia, European indices have opened higher across the board. Even Spain\u2019s IBEX is just in the green. The Trump trade has been reignited, so it seems. Tax reform is definitely back on - if it was ever off, thanks to the Senate approving of the Republican-backed budget Thursday night. This is a major step towards tax cuts as it allows the GOP to pass legislation without the need for any Democrat help. Investors are in an upbeat mood across Europe this morning, boosted by the news that the US senate voted through budget plans for the 2018 fiscal year. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,543 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 13,048 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,384 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 22,191 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,206 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 390 Japan\u2019s Nikkei has risen for a 14th consecutive session, posting its longest winning streak in more than 50 years. A weaker yen helped to push up shares, with the dollar up 0.6% to 113.16 yen after the US Senate voted on Thursday to approve a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year. The Nikkei closed up just 0.04 percent, or 9 points, at 21,457.64, but it was enough to clinch its longest daily winning streak since 1961. Japan\u2019s share index has risen by more than 5% over the past fortnight on hopes that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s ruling coalition will win a general election on Sunday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under pressure this morning as investors become increasingly uncertain that Bank of England policymakers will follow through on hints that UK interest rates will rise. It was down more than half a cent at $1.3085, after some of the latest UK data started to point to slowing growth as Brexit uncertainty starts to be reflected in the behaviour of households and businesses. Consumers are feeling much more cautious about spending, with retail sales falling 0.8% in September. Meanwhile real pay has been falling for six months as prices rise faster than wages. On Thursday the Bank\u2019s deputy governor Jon Cunliffe said it was not clear that interest rates needed to rise soon, planting further doubt in the minds of investors about an imminent rate rise. Also coming up today: Investors are expected to remain cautious as political crisis escalates in Spain 09.30 BST: Public finances data is expected to show the UK government borrowed \u00a36.5bn in September, up from \u00a35.7bn in August",

Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, has written to Hammond asking for confirmation that everything is being done to encourage gender and ethnic diversity among applicants for roles on the Bank\u2019s policy committees. \u201cThe Treasury must make all efforts to encourage as diverse range of candidates for the Bank\u2019s policy committees as possible,\u201d Morgan said. She raised the concerns as the committee confirmed the appointments of the two newest recruits to the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, Silvana Tenreyro and Sir David Ramsden. Tenreyro is the only female member of the nine-strong committee. \u201cWe have approved both appointments,\u201d Morgansaid in the letter. \u201cHowever, in considering these appointments, the committee discussed its wider concerns about the composition of the policy committees, and in particular about diversity at the most senior levels of the Bank of England. \u201cThe committee would be interested in taking evidence from you (or the most appropriate minister or senior official) on this shortly.\u201d There are no women among the 11 members on the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, which is responsible for monitoring financial stability; only one woman is on the the Bank\u2019s 12-strong prudential regulation committee.

He said the Bank was in the middle of a strategy to address that. The Treasury select committee has launched a separate inquiry into the barriers to women entering and progressing in the financial services industry. \u201cMore women than men are employed in the financial services sector, but female representation at senior levels has been historically low,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cGender diversity across job grades and functions delivers benefits to firms, society and the wider economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Three of Britain\u2019s biggest mobile phone networks keep charging customers extra for their handsets after they have been paid off, leaving them up to \u00a338 a month worse off, a consumer group has said. Citizens Advice found that Vodafone, EE and Three were overcharging customers who failed to change their contract an average of \u00a322 a month, rising to \u00a338 a month for buyers of premium phones including the Samsung Galaxy S8, Apple iPhone and Sony Xperia XZ Premium. Raising concerns that older customers were being stung by \u201csharp practices\u201d, it called for intervention from the regulator Ofcom if mobile networks failed to be clear about how contracts are structured and cut bills once phones are paid off. \u201cMobile phones are now an essential part of modern life, but the way that the cost of handsets are hidden within some contracts gives phone providers a way to exploit their customers,\u201d said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. Many contracts are paid monthly over two years and cover the cost of the customer\u2019s phones, which can be hundreds of pounds to buy outright. At the end of the contract, the customer owns the handset and is free to stay on the contract or switch. However, Citizens Advice research found that Vodafone, EE and Three continued charging customers the same amount as when they were paying for the handset. In the worst case, customers with a 256GB iPhone could end up being overcharged by \u00a346 a month on average, it said. Over-65s were the most likely to be caught out, with 23% on a handset-inclusive deal remaining on it for more than 12 months past the end of the fixed contract, compared with 13% of under-65s. Overall, 36% of people with a handset-inclusive mobile phone contract stayed on it beyond the fixed period, with 19% staying in the same contract for more than six months afterwards. Citizens Advice called on all providers to reduce their customers\u2019 bills when they stay in the same contract past the end of a fixed deal to reflect the expired cost of the handset. Guy added: \u201cIt is clearly unfair that some phone providers are charging loyal customers for handsets that they have already paid for. It\u2019s especially concerning that older customers are more likely to be stung by this sharp practice.\u201d A Three spokeswoman said contract end-dates were made clear to new customers, who were encouraged to get in touch if they wanted to change their plan. A Vodafone spokeswoman said workers contacted customers near the ends of their contracts \u201cwherever possible\u201d. EE said separating phone and tariff sometimes left customers worse off, adding that most choose upgrades or a SIM-only plan when their contracts expire. Nina Bibby, chief marketing officer of O2, accused rivals of undermining trust and reputation in the mobile phone industry, and said the provider separated device and service charges in monthly bills: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see the other operators review their position and follow our lead.\u201d",
