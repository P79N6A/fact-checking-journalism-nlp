The first retail price index (RPI) was published on the eve of the outbreak of the first world war in 1914 and was then dominated by food and shelter. Today, the ONS attempts to measure the cost of living by noting the prices of 700 separate goods and services in 150 different areas of the UK, but one of the big changes in recent years has been the spread of digital technology, with sales of equipment and services booming.</p> <p>The ONS said: \"As in most years, developments in technology influence the basket update and in 2012 tablet computers are being included for the first time.</p> <p>\"This mirrors the evolution of computers through desktop personal computers, laptops and now tablets, and they are being introduced to capture price changes in this rapidly expanding market.\"</p> <p>The inclusion of tablet computers comes less than a week after Apple unveiled its latest iPad model, while a number of rival devices, such as the BlackBerry Playbook, Asus Transformer Prime and Motorola Xoom 2 will step up competition in the market.</p> <p>Smartphones and the \"apps\" that run on them were added to the basket last year, replacing mobile phone downloads such as ringtones and wallpaper.</p> <p>Since 1996, there have been two key measures of inflation calculated by the ONS: the RPI and the consumer price index (CPI), the yardstick used by the Bank of England to set interest rates. The CPI measure showed the annual inflation rate in January at 3.6%, almost double the official target of 2%, but well down on last autumn's peak of 5.2%. The RPI record of 25% was reached in 1975.</p> <p>The ONS, which logs 180,000 prices across the country each month, said: \"A convenient way of thinking about both the CPI and RPI is to imagine a shopping basket containing those goods and services on which people typically spend their money. As the prices of the various items in the basket change over time, so does the total cost of the basket. Movements in the CPI and RPI represent the changing cost of this representative shopping basket.\"</p> <p>Over the past 25 years, the proportion of the average household budget spent on food has dropped from 16.7% to 11.4%, while that for clothes has fallen from 7.4% to 4.5%. A smaller slice of consumer income goes on alcohol and tobacco than it did a quarter of a century ago, but almost a quarter of spending, 23.7%, is now on housing costs, up from 15.7% in 1987. The proportion of income spent on household and leisure services has also increased sharply.</p>",

Today, the ONS attempts to measure the cost of living by noting the prices of 700 separate goods and services in 150 different areas of the UK, but one of the big changes in recent years has been the spread of digital technology, with sales of equipment and services booming. The ONS said: \"As in most years, developments in technology influence the basket update and in 2012 tablet computers are being included for the first time. \"This mirrors the evolution of computers through desktop personal computers, laptops and now tablets, and they are being introduced to capture price changes in this rapidly expanding market.\" The inclusion of tablet computers comes less than a week after Apple unveiled its latest iPad model, while a number of rival devices, such as the BlackBerry Playbook, Asus Transformer Prime and Motorola Xoom 2 will step up competition in the market. Smartphones and the \"apps\" that run on them were added to the basket last year, replacing mobile phone downloads such as ringtones and wallpaper. Since 1996, there have been two key measures of inflation calculated by the ONS: the RPI and the consumer price index (CPI), the yardstick used by the Bank of England to set interest rates. The CPI measure showed the annual inflation rate in January at 3.6%, almost double the official target of 2%, but well down on last autumn's peak of 5.2%. The RPI record of 25% was reached in 1975. The ONS, which logs 180,000 prices across the country each month, said: \"A convenient way of thinking about both the CPI and RPI is to imagine a shopping basket containing those goods and services on which people typically spend their money. As the prices of the various items in the basket change over time, so does the total cost of the basket. Movements in the CPI and RPI represent the changing cost of this representative shopping basket.\" Over the past 25 years, the proportion of the average household budget spent on food has dropped from 16.7% to 11.4%, while that for clothes has fallen from 7.4% to 4.5%. A smaller slice of consumer income goes on alcohol and tobacco than it did a quarter of a century ago, but almost a quarter of spending, 23.7%, is now on housing costs, up from 15.7% in 1987. The proportion of income spent on household and leisure services has also increased sharply.",

As Greece finally had the terms of its second bailout agreed by its European partners and the country was upgraded by ratings agency Fitch, the Dow Jones industrial average soared through the 13,000 point barrier to hit its highest point since June 2008. In London the FTSE 100 index closed at 5956. Stocks in New York were buoyed by strong corporate results and the monthly statement from the Federal Reserve which kept interest rates at historic lows and noted that the US economy was expanding. In Athens, Greek officials reacted with barely concealed delight to the news that for the first time since the eruption of the crisis the country's credit rating had been upgraded by Fitch. As the 27 European Union countries gave their approval to the Greek bailout in Brussels, it was clear that the size of the upgrade \u2013 from junk status to B \u2013 with a stable outlook and Fitch's view that Greece's debt service profile had \"significantly improved\" \u2013 caught officials off guard. Aides close to the country's technocrat prime minister, Lucas Papademos, said they were happily \"very surprised\". \"We didn't expect it and it's clearly very good news,\" government spokesman Pandelis Kapsis said. \"It reflects the new confidence that Greece will be able to address its problems, make its debt sustainable and it increases our determination to move forward with reforms and fiscal consolidation.\" However, concern grew that Hungary could be the next country to require a rescue. EU finance ministers imposed back-dated sanctions on Budapest over the size of its budget deficit as pressure mounted on the former communist-bloc country to agree terms with the International Monetary Fund over a financial bailout. Amid concern across the continent that the government in Budapest has lost control of the public finances, EU finance ministers said they would review in June a decision to deprive Hungary of \u20ac495m (\u00a3410m) in cohesion funds, a move that would only come into force in 2013. This followed the publication of the annual health check on the Hungarian economy from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which urged Budapest to re-start stalled talks with the IMF. The OECD said \"swift action\" was needed to stabilise the Hungarian economy and put the country on course for a sustainable recovery. \"[The agreement] is a necessary first step to stabilise the exchange rate, restore investor confidence, ensure against rollover risks and support fiscal consolidation,\" said Andrew Dean, director of the OECD's economics department.

The regulator is \"monitoring closely\" the repayment of interest-only mortgages which are due be repaid over the next five to 15 years and will looking at the fair treatment of those customers whose mortgages mature but who cannot repay the capital. It is also scrutinising innovation in a mortgage market where just six lenders now account for more than 80% of the lending because of the withdrawal of lenders since the banking crisis, as well as any inappropriate use of buy-to-let mortgages. It is also preparing new rules for unregulated collective investment schemes (UCIS), which were designed for professional investors but are being sold to retail investors. But the FSA was criticised by Bruno Geiringer, insurance partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, for the \"remarkable\" decision not to highlight tax changes to financial products.",

      "bodyText": "More than 170,000 Tesco staff will have to work up to two years longer to qualify for their full pension, it has emerged. Britain's biggest private sector employer also plans to save money by increasing staff pensions in line with the consumer price index (CPI) instead of the retail price index (RPI) \u2013 a move which only affects future service but which could nevertheless leave some workers thousands of pounds worse off during their retirement, assuming the same differences between CPI and RPI going forward. Tesco said it was making some \"essential\" changes to its defined benefit pension scheme \"to ensure it is sustainable for the future\". The retailer operates a \"career average\" scheme, based on an average salary calculated over a staff member's whole working life, and said it believed it was one of only four FTSE 100 companies that still has a defined benefit arrangement in place. But it said the scheme was facing increasing costs, as people are living longer and the weak global economy means lower investment returns. Tesco is proposing to increase by two years \u2013 from 65 to up to 67 \u2013 the age at which a full pension is paid. This affects pension built up after 1 June 2012. A Tesco spokeswoman said this does not mean staff will have to retire up to two years later \u2013 the normal retirement age remains 65, and staff can still apply to retire any time after 55. But if they wish to qualify for their full pension entitlement, they will have to work longer. It is understood an employee in their early 60s might need to work a few months longer to get the full benefit of the scheme. For someone younger, it would be up to two years. The second change affects how Tesco takes inflation into account when increasing staff pensions each year. Tesco is switching from RPI to CPI for service after 1 June \u2013 a move which follows similar changes to public-sector pensions made by the government. CPI inflation has tended to be lower than RPI inflation and studies have suggested that this type of change could leave some older people thousands of pounds worse off over the next 10 years. Tesco, which has 172,000 active scheme members, said: \"Importantly, the changes don't affect the pensions that staff have already built up, they don't require colleagues to work for longer and their contributions will stay the same.\" The spokeswoman added that while many schemes cap inflation at 2.5%, it is keeping the current cap at 5%. \"This is especially important in times of higher than normal inflation, like now.\"",

      "body": "<p>A hush has descended on a handsome 17th century villa in The Hague where the leaders of the Netherlands' rightwing minority government are huddled over spending ledgers, debt projections, budget balances, housing market analyses and deteriorating pension fund figures.</p> <p>Mark Rutte, prime minister and leader of the liberal-conservative VVD party, has imposed a vow of omerta on his colleagues locked away in his official residence until they chart a path out of a worsening public finances debacle.</p> <p>Europe's two-year debt and deficit crisis has pitted preachy northern creditors against \"feckless\" Mediterranean spendthrifts \u2013 countries the Dutch are wont to dub the \"garlic belt\".</p> <p>But suddenly the air in Brussels and elsewhere is thick with tales of pots and kettles, glass houses and stonethrowing as the triple-A rated Netherlands comes unstuck.</p> <p>Rutte launched the three-week retreat for the top members of his government at his residence last week after shock budget projections from the CPB Bureau for Economic Analysis, the old and authoritative thinktank which crunches the finance ministry's numbers.</p> <p>The CPB, accustomed to delivering inarguable verdicts on fiscal and budgetary policy, said the Netherlands was in flagrant breach of the new eurozone rulebook and fiscal pact it has been highly instrumental in drafting.</p> <p>\"The government has the intention of living up to the rules, but it's embarrassed that it can't meet the targets now,\" says Coen Teulings, director of the CPB.</p> <p>On current policy, a mild recession would leave the country nursing a budget deficit of 4.5% of gross domestic product next year, 2 points higher than previously projected and 50% above the eurozone ceiling of 3%, \u2013 risking the wrath of Brussels and the imposition of automatic penalties the Dutch had been keen to devise for others.</p> <p>What's more, without a new round of austerity, the Dutch would still be above the eurozone deficit limit by 2015. National debt levels are also running in the wrong direction, from 65.4% of GDP last year to 75.8% in 2015, well above the 60% eurozone threshold.</p> <p>Most analysts agree the Dutch economy is fundamentally sound and a dogmatic application of the new eurozone rules next year will do much more damage than good.</p> <p>\"The financial markets think the Dutch economy is in good shape, though it needs strong reforms to rebalance,\" said Teulings.</p> <p>But as one of the most vocal cheerleaders for the rigid new rules the Rutte government has put its own credibility on the line. The Dutch are the authors of a radical proposal for establishing a new eurozone budget tsar to enforce fiscal rectitude across the 17 countries.</p> <p>\"The government's in a fix,\" says Paul Nieuwenburg, a political scientist at Leiden University. \"It's a problem of image. Having such a big mouth on Greece and seizing the moral high ground, they are now morally obliged to stick by the rules. Things have become very complicated. That's why Rutte has withdrawn into splendid isolation and they won't talk to the media.\"</p> <h2>What's gone wrong? And how to fix it? </h2> <p>The minority coalition of Rutte's liberals and christian democrats, supported in parliament by the xenophobic populist Geert Wilders in return for concessions on immigration policy, came into office in late 2010 promising \u20ac18bn in savings over their four-year term.</p> <p>In order to meet its pledge of complying with the 3% deficit next year, it now needs to save a further \u20ac9bn in a year. That's a very tall order.

      "bodyText": "A hush has descended on a handsome 17th century villa in The Hague where the leaders of the Netherlands' rightwing minority government are huddled over spending ledgers, debt projections, budget balances, housing market analyses and deteriorating pension fund figures. Mark Rutte, prime minister and leader of the liberal-conservative VVD party, has imposed a vow of omerta on his colleagues locked away in his official residence until they chart a path out of a worsening public finances debacle. Europe's two-year debt and deficit crisis has pitted preachy northern creditors against \"feckless\" Mediterranean spendthrifts \u2013 countries the Dutch are wont to dub the \"garlic belt\". But suddenly the air in Brussels and elsewhere is thick with tales of pots and kettles, glass houses and stonethrowing as the triple-A rated Netherlands comes unstuck. Rutte launched the three-week retreat for the top members of his government at his residence last week after shock budget projections from the CPB Bureau for Economic Analysis, the old and authoritative thinktank which crunches the finance ministry's numbers. The CPB, accustomed to delivering inarguable verdicts on fiscal and budgetary policy, said the Netherlands was in flagrant breach of the new eurozone rulebook and fiscal pact it has been highly instrumental in drafting. \"The government has the intention of living up to the rules, but it's embarrassed that it can't meet the targets now,\" says Coen Teulings, director of the CPB. On current policy, a mild recession would leave the country nursing a budget deficit of 4.5% of gross domestic product next year, 2 points higher than previously projected and 50% above the eurozone ceiling of 3%, \u2013 risking the wrath of Brussels and the imposition of automatic penalties the Dutch had been keen to devise for others. What's more, without a new round of austerity, the Dutch would still be above the eurozone deficit limit by 2015. National debt levels are also running in the wrong direction, from 65.4% of GDP last year to 75.8% in 2015, well above the 60% eurozone threshold. Most analysts agree the Dutch economy is fundamentally sound and a dogmatic application of the new eurozone rules next year will do much more damage than good. \"The financial markets think the Dutch economy is in good shape, though it needs strong reforms to rebalance,\" said Teulings. But as one of the most vocal cheerleaders for the rigid new rules the Rutte government has put its own credibility on the line. The Dutch are the authors of a radical proposal for establishing a new eurozone budget tsar to enforce fiscal rectitude across the 17 countries. \"The government's in a fix,\" says Paul Nieuwenburg, a political scientist at Leiden University. \"It's a problem of image. Having such a big mouth on Greece and seizing the moral high ground, they are now morally obliged to stick by the rules. Things have become very complicated. That's why Rutte has withdrawn into splendid isolation and they won't talk to the media.\" What's gone wrong? And how to fix it? The minority coalition of Rutte's liberals and christian democrats, supported in parliament by the xenophobic populist Geert Wilders in return for concessions on immigration policy, came into office in late 2010 promising \u20ac18bn in savings over their four-year term. In order to meet its pledge of complying with the 3% deficit next year, it now needs to save a further \u20ac9bn in a year. That's a very tall order. Teulings calculates that for every \u20ac3 in deficit reduction, you need to generate \u20ac5, meaning \u20ac15bn euros worth of spending cuts and tax increases are needed by next year. \"That's so outrageous and it's not really required by the economics,\" he said. \"Structurally we have to get spending down and revenue up to sustainable levels. Doing that too hastily means tax increases which are bad for the economy. Raising taxes in the middle of a recession is a bad thing. Structural reforms like raising the retirement age are preferable.\" A depressed housing market, with prices falling 8% since 2008 and likely to fall further, reduced consumption, shrinking pension funds and spending cuts which have seen disposable income curbed by 2% this year all underpin Holland's budgetary dilemmas. Away from the economics, there's the politics. Wilders, who combines far-right anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim tubthumping with leftwing welfarism (for white indigenous Dutch only) and europhobia, opposes more austerity except for slashing the foreign aid budget. He will demand policy concessions if he is to support, say, VAT or other tax rises or spending cuts. He is taking part in the villa negotiations. If the Netherlands has traditionally been a europhile country, that has changed sharply since it voted down the European constitution in 2005. Wilders' strength on the right is currently mirrored on the hard left by the Socialist party which is riding high in the polls and is fiercely hostile to the EU. Between the two of them \u2013 Wilders' Freedom party and the socialists \u2013 the anti-European stream musters 55% in the opinion polls. Wilders sought to exploit the crisis by demanding a referendum on a return to the guilder, but this was dismissed by the political mainstream.

And while 61% were against bringing back the guilder, two thirds believed there should have been a referendum in the 1990s on joining the euro \u2013 54% would have voted against. Asked whether the Greek drama and the euro crisis were to blame for the current economic predicament, 56% thought they were. \"Europe will be the main political divide in Holland in the years to come,\" predicted Nieuwenburg. The euro crisis has sharpened that political conflict and boosted the sceptics. A clash with Brussels over the deficit some time in the next year could boost them further. Rutte, some analysts are urging, can go a long way to solving his budget dilemma by abolishing the generous mortgage tax relief regime that costs the public purse \u20ac16bn a year. But he campaigned against that to get elected, it would be highly unpopular and would worsen an already dismal housing market. Rutte's room for manoeuvre is limited, his coalition is fragile. The euro crisis could yet bring down another eurozone government \u2013 even in a country as prosperous and successful as the Netherlands.",

In particular we think that Pru and Aviva offer greater upside potential with similar/greater dividend yields. The company will pay a final dividend of 9.2p on 31 May, making the total dividend 13.8p, up 6.2% from last year. The FTSE 100 gained 0.8% on hopes the US Federal Reserve will acknowledge a slightly brighter economic outlook later today. It is expected to keep rates on hold at between 0% and 0.25%. Volumes in London were very thin on the first day of Cheltenham. One London-based trader told Reuters: Never mind the Fed. It's the start of the week-long Cheltenham Festival [of horseracing], so many traders will either be heading down there or just focusing on their TV screens come this afternoon.",

Today, there are an estimated 12.5bn internet connected devices, an average of two per person, and many of these are phones or computers. In 2025, according to IT firm Cisco, there will be 1 trillion such devices. While earlier Arm micro-processors cost half a dollar each, the new microcontroller design will be closer to 20 cents (13 pence). The product will see Arm pitching for a share of the entire $15bn micro-controller market, Atkinson said, rather than the third it addresses today. The group's royalty revenues from such units totalled $16m in 2010, out of total royalties of $335m, but Morgan Stanley forecasts this will more than double to $37m by the end of 2012. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2012 to delete a line saying that Arm has been producing 8 and 16-bit micro-processors since 2007. Arm has not produced 8 and 16-bit technology.",

      "bodyText": "The UK job scene is improving after a bleak midwinter, according to one of the country's largest recruitment agencies. Manpower found that employers were in the mood to take on more staff across most sectors as the prospects of a double dip recession ease. The report follows a spate of positive surveys showing greater appetite among employers for expanding their workforce. However, Manpower managing director Mark Cahill urged caution ahead of unemployment figures on Wednesday that are expected to show another rise in the claimant count and headline unemployment rate, especially among women and the young. A survey by the Federation of Small Businesses also showed a turnaround in hiring intentions, but not enough to alter the overall trend for rising unemployment. The FSB said a winter of shedding staff was coming to an end after its 'Voice of Small Business' Index showed more than a quarter of small firms want to increase their investment plans and create new jobs. A net balance of 1.2% of small firms are looking to take on new workers in the next three months, the highest level since the second quarter of 2010. A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said earlier this year that unemployment would rise to almost 3 million before it began to fall as private sector firms struggled to offset huge job losses in the public sector. Cahill said that while the current jobs boost was across most sectors, it was healthier in London and the south-east. He said the Olympics was a key factor overriding a lacklustre retail sector. The London games is also encouraging services firms to hire staff for a general influx of business along with a rise in tourism. \"London has seen the highest rises since 2008. The only concern is construction, which is still contracting. The Olympics must be a key factor, which means the effect should last all year,\" he said. \"But these are not necessarily green shoots because we have seen rises before that have disappeared. I'd like to see another quarter of solid rises before declaring we have turned a corner.\" Manufacturing has maintained a steady rise in employment throughout the last year and will get a boost from a deal announced yesterday to make components for a new generation of jet fighters in the UK. According to Lockheed Martin, which is the lead contractor, around 25,000 jobs are to be created in Lancashire and across the UK following a deal to make a 3,000-strong fleet ofF-35 fighter jets. The project could increase UK GDP by \u00a328.7bn over the period between 2009 and 2036. Work will primarily be carried out at the BAE Systems site at Samlesbury, Lancashire, where the fuselage and other structural components will be made. Other places to benefit include companies with sites at Denham in Buckinghamshire, Birkenhead in Wirral, Lostock in Lancashire, Wimborne in Dorset, Bristol and Southampton. Manpower said outside of London, the employment picture remains mixed with the East Midlands remaining bouyant while London's neighbouring regions of the south-east and east of England have both dipped into negative territory. \"Meanwhile, employers in the north-east report the least optimistic regional forecast, with an outlook of -6%,\" the report said. \"The most optimistic region is the East Midlands, with an outlook of +10%, whereas the region showing the strongest improvement is the north-west, where the outlook has improved from a negative Outlook of -5% in Q1 to +6% this quarter.\"",
