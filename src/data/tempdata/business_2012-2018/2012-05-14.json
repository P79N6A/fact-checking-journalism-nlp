      "bodyText": "The UK's status as a safe haven for investors has cut the cost of borrowing by the Treasury to a 300-year low. Ten-year bond yields, which reflect the cost of borrowing by the government, fell to 1.87% on Monday as investors fearful of the enveloping euro crisis reduced their lending to Spain and Italy in favour of the UK, Germany, the US and Japan. The fall in the yield on UK Treasury bonds \u2013 known as gilts \u2013 beat the previous low of 1.92% in January, and is the lowest level since Bank of England records started in 1703. Supporters of the government's seven-year austerity programme cheered the news, saying it showed the benefit of retaining a safe haven status. The chancellor, George Osborne, has proposed devising 40- or 50-year bonds to lock-in lower borrowing costs, but has yet to test the water with a sale to international investors. Yields on German 10-year bonds slid to a record low of 1.43% while Japan's 10-year bond yield fell to 0.858%. Spanish 10-year bond yields rose above 6.3% for the first time in more than five months after concerns grew that Greece was closer to leaving the euro. There were also fears that the strength of German chancellor Angela Merkel's right wing CDU party had been undermined after it lost a state election. Finnish and Dutch yields also reached record lows as investors favoured the highest-rated countries. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the benefits of low interest rates offset higher than expected government borrowing. He said the weak state of the economy and the likelihood of inflation falling quickly later this year would spur the Bank of England to dust down its quantitative easing programme and increase the current \u00a3325bn of gilt purchases, driving down the yield further. Tim Morgan, chief economist at money broker Tullett Prebon, warned that gilt yields could rocket if market traders questioned the UK government's failure to rein in spending. He said the Treasury had succeeded in spinning a myth about austerity cuts that amounted to a mendacious strategy to con private investment markets. Morgan, a right-wing critic of the government's failure to reduce the size of the state, said his research showed the bulk of austerity gains have come from tax rises, and cuts to benefits and Whitehall spending have yet to make any meaningful impact. He said: \"Sooner or later \u2013 with the probabilities strongly favouring sooner \u2013 the big lie at the heart of the British fiscal stance is likely to be exposed. Some commentators may already be beginning to smell, if not exactly a rat, then at least a very large and feral mouse.\" Industrial production figures for the 17-nation eurozone piled more pressure on politicians as they decreased 0.3% from February \u2013 when it rose a revised 0.8%. According to the median estimate of 38 economists in a Bloomberg survey the impact of a manufacturing slowdown, a collapse in construction in Germany and elsewhere along with weak consumer demand meant the eurozone economy contracted 0.2% in the first quarter, after shrinking 0.3% in the previous three months. Official figures on Tuesday will show if the forecasts are near the mark and the eurozone is in recession.",

One of those times is now, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/14/greece-euro-exit-fears-rattle-stock-markets\">Greece is inexorably pushed out of the euro</a>. It took no particular talent to have seen this coming, just the recognition that it has always been a fantasy to believe that the Greeks would democratically choose to destroy their economy for the better part of a decade in order to pay foreign creditors. </p> <p>The fact is that Greece never was a suitable member of the eurozone. That the Greek economy was extremely inefficient, that corruption was rife, that the government budgets were perpetually out of control, and that the official statistics were not to be believed were widely known.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes, just sometimes, economics and politics are like physics \u2013 one can recognize immutable forces. One of those times is now, as Greece is inexorably pushed out of the euro. It took no particular talent to have seen this coming, just the recognition that it has always been a fantasy to believe that the Greeks would democratically choose to destroy their economy for the better part of a decade in order to pay foreign creditors. The fact is that Greece never was a suitable member of the eurozone. That the Greek economy was extremely inefficient, that corruption was rife, that the government budgets were perpetually out of control, and that the official statistics were not to be believed were widely known. But, as in many marriages, Greece's entry into the euro was a triumph of sentimentality and wilful blindness over realism.

      "bodyText": "The boss of the Plus Markets stock exchange group has blamed over-regulation for the company's collapse. The business, self-described as the \"next generation\" stock market, is set to wind down over the next six months after failing to find a buyer. It lists 156 companies as diverse as Arsenal FC, the brewer Shepherd Neame, and Quercus, publisher of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy. Chief executive Cyril Theret warned that post-2007 regulations are discouraging small and medium businesses from floating on stock exchanges like Plus, which is, in turn, affecting economic growth. \"The danger is we have an excessive regulatory environment, combined with the adversity to risk. This has essentially created an impact that is affecting growth,\" he said. \"I think the increase in regulation, whether in the financial world or elsewhere, is becoming unbearable, and I'm not sure it is necessarily making any good sense. \"We are struggling in this country because there is no more appetite for early-stage investment. \"If we are not innovating and allowing small and medium businesses to get investment through listings, how are we going to grow?\" Plus said it was looking for \"suitable alternative arrangements\" for its listed firms, with the most likely outcome seeing the companies listed on rival AIM. It is understood Plus had a handful of suitors for several months, leading to a formal announcement in February of plans to sell. Sources close to the firm say discussions over a possible sale of successful parts of the business are still ongoing, with Nasdaq and the broker Ipac being mooted as interested parties. Plus, which is itself listed on AIM, has struggled in recent years owing to the low number of IPOs and increased costs associated with stricter FSA regulation. Theret revealed it would have needed 850 IPOs \u2013 at around \u00a310,000 a go \u2013 to break even. The company made a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.4m in the six months to the end of June 2011, down from the \u00a32.5m loss during the same period a year earlier. In 2010 it made a loss of \u00a35.8m on revenues of \u00a33m, its sixth consecutive loss-making year. Theret, who was made chief executive in 2010, said: \"When I took over at Plus I inherited a company that was on the verge of bankruptcy. \"It's a huge disappointment that we have to shut down after all the fighting we've done to keep going.\" Plus Markets grew out of Ofex, an exchange for British small cap stocks that required less regulation than the London Stock Exchange or AIM. The company said in a statement: \"Due to the ongoing operating costs of its business in the context of its regulatory status, the company's cash balance has reached a level at which the board has informed the FSA that it intends to commence a process of orderly closure.\"",

With Greece still struggling to form a government in the wake of the recent inconclusive elections, and fears the country could run out of cash, there was growing talk it could exit the euro altogether.

We see little in either share for growth potential.

For Premier, we see a business well capable of not only delivering its 100,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day target, but also growth from there and potential for meaningful shareholder returns. With the shares trading at a 27% discount to core net asset value, it is the cheapest stock in the sector.

      "bodyText": "Europe is braced for a crucial 48 hours of high-stakes summitry likely to decide whether Germany and France can strike a grand bargain aimed at dispelling growing pessimism over the chances of the single currency surviving in its current form. While eurozone finance ministers are to meet on Monday in Brussels, apparently at a loss over how to respond to political paralysis in Greece and a worsening crisis in Spain, all eyes are on Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the new French leader, who is to go to Berlin for his first face-to-face meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, as soon as he is sworn in as president on Tuesday. Hollande, Europe's new champion of growth policies, lines up against Merkel, the dominant cheerleader of austerity as the solution to the crisis. The German leader, increasingly isolated if inherently strong in the European contest, suffered a big setback on Sunday night, with her Christian Democrats slumping to a crushing defeat in an election in the big German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to German TV exit polls. Against a background of intense volatility, Europe was pulled in opposing directions by voters, protests, and political paralysis at the weekend, deepening uncertainty over its future shape and gnawing away at the prospects for the euro's survival as a 17-country union. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, and the former EU commissioner Lord Mandelson claim that the coalition government must commit with other European governments to a new growth strategy if the eurozone is to survive. In a joint article for the Guardian, Balls and Mandelson call for a \"new political settlement\" across the continent to achieve growth. The business secretary, Vince Cable, gave a bleak warning that if the eurozone fails to contain the problems facing Greece then Britain could face a huge economic impact. He said the UK could only hope that the eurozone's economic firewalls were strong enough to stop the financial turmoil from spreading. He said Britain did not have the problem of managing the issue, as it remained outside the eurozone, but could still be hit. \"The problem would affect us if it spread, if you had these contagion effects in Italy and Spain,\" he said. \"[Michel] Barnier [EU commissioner for the internal market] has expressed optimism that those firewalls have now been created, and we must hope he's right \u2013 because if they're not, then of course it has a massive impact on our trade \u2013 half of our exports go to the eurozone countries, our banks are quite substantially exposed to those countries.\" The large protests and minor clashes in Spain, political gridlock in Greece, the crucial regional election in Germany, and rising hostility to the EU in the Netherlands have all contributed to an air of crisis supplanting more than two years of financial panic and bitter argument over how to rescue the euro. Hollande goes to Berlin on Tuesday with the psychological advantage, buttressed by a strong new mandate that has shifted the terms of European politics. After a string of setbacks among her political allies at home and in the EU, Merkel was weakened by the spectacular defeat in D\u00fcsseldorf. The state election, involving almost one in four of German voters, was seen as a bellwether. Elections in North Rhine-Westphalia are often a gauge of the future of German national politics. The opposition Social Democrats and Greens were on the brink of securing an absolute majority, according to TV projections, with Merkel's CDU said to have dropped between eight and nine points on two years ago and four points below what the opinion polls had predicted. After the French Socialists' presidential election triumph, the victory for Germany's Social Democrats \u2013 projected to be up four points from 34.5 \u2013 will be seen as a further fillip for the European centre-left. Eurozone finance ministers are to meet in Brussels on Monday to ponder their options, but are unlikely to decide very much, given the political imponderables and the unresolved splits between German-led belt-tighteners and French-led proponents of growth policies as the answer to Europe's travails. Tens of thousands of Spanish people took to the streets to protest at soaring unemployment in a country where anyone under 25 is now more likely to be out of than in work. The fourth attempt in less than a week to form a government in Greece looked destined for failure, signalling weeks of instability before fresh elections likely to strengthen the hard left, which rejects the terms of Greece's \u20ac240bn bailout and the restructuring of much of its national debt. Opinion polls in the Netherlands, meanwhile, for the first time showed the hard left, anti-European Socialist party as the strongest single party before early elections in September in which Europe looks like being the central issue. While the pressure from Spain, Greece, and France pointed towards a relaxation of cost-cutting austerity, the signals from Germany went in the opposite direction. The CDU's worst postwar performance in North Rhine-Westphalia, while weakening Merkel, is unlikely to cause her to abandon her tough line on a new fiscal pact for the eurozone and her arguments that Europe's debt crisis cannot be fixed by piling up more debt. The cover of Monday's influential news weekly Der Spiegel declares \"Adieu Greece\", arguing that it is time to kick the country out of the euro. Almost four in five Germans believed Greece should forfeit its bailout cash if it does not comply with the stringent eurozone terms, according to a poll in the bestselling tabloid Bildzeitung. Against this background, Merkel is unlikely to expose herself to charges that she is going soft on the euro. More quietly, however, the government in Berlin and the German central bank have signalled over the past week that they favour tolerating greater inflation and higher wage increases in Germany in order to spur domestic demand and effect a partial rebalancing of the chronically imbalanced EU economy. Data being released on Tuesday will confirm that the EU is in recession, registering contraction of gross domestic product for the last two quarters. The figures are expected to show very slight growth in Germany, while the French economy stagnated.",
