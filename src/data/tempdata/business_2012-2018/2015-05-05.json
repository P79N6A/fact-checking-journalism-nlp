      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy will grow at a slower pace this year and faces serious risks from weak productivity and a troubled eurozone, a leading thinktank has warned. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has cut its forecast for growth this year to 2.5%, down from 2.9% pencilled in three months ago and below the 2.8% rate last year. The move follows much weaker than expected official GDP figures for the first quarter, which saw Britain\u2019s growth rate halve to 0.3%. Those figures and the downgrade from NIESR come as a blow to the Conservatives before the election. But the thinktank said the rocky start to 2015 appeared to be a blip and the overall picture was of a \u201creasonably stable\u201d recovery. \u201cThere are undoubtedly concerns that this quarter is the harbinger of a pervasive slowdown. However, this is probably just a temporary deceleration, partly related to a fall in construction output, a sector that is particularly volatile,\u201d said NIESR\u2019s principal research fellow Simon Kirby. \u201cWe expect economic growth, consistent with a modest recovery, to resume from the second quarter.\u201d The troubles of the construction industry were underlined in a closely watched business survey suggesting that the second quarter kicked off with a sharp slowdown in activity and new work. Output and new orders for construction companies rose at their slowest rates for almost two years, with many builders reporting that clients were delaying spending decisions before the election, according to the latest Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers index survey. Construction and manufacturing remain below their pre-crisis strength and NIESR, like other forecasters, expects most of the momentum for growth this year to come from consumer spending. The biggest single uncertainty facing the UK economy was how quickly productivity can be improved. Echoing warnings from other economic commentators over the UK\u2019s apparent, and little understood, failure to raise output per hour worked, NIESR said productivity growth was crucial to raising living standards. The puzzle remained unsolved, said Kirby. \u201cIn the long run, productivity growth is the key driver of rising living standards. If a shock has somehow permanently lowered the rate of productivity growth, our expectations of future increases in living standards could well smack of hubris, with hindsight,\u201d he said. NIESR also sounded a note of caution about the UK\u2019s export prospects. Despite a government ambition to rebalance the economy towards more exports and less reliance on domestic consumer demand, the thinktank said net trade would continue to be a drag on growth for now. That could change from the middle of next year but only if the eurozone, the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner, recovers as forecast, NIESR added. The eurozone\u2019s prospects were seen as having improved in NIESR\u2019s forecasts for the global economy, but big question marks hung over the future of Greece in the currency bloc. The outcome of Greek debt crisis talks was crucial. \u201cIf an agreement is not reached in the next few weeks, there is a significant risk of a Greek default and a disorderly exit from the monetary union. Greece accounts for only about 2% of euro area GDP, but there would be risks of contagion to the rest of the area and to the euro itself,\u201d NIESR said in its global outlook. Similar to the UK, global growth had come in slightly weaker than expected so far in 2015 but it would be supported by low oil prices as well as accommodative monetary policy conditions in advanced economies. Inflation remains low in almost all developed nations, NIESR said, but deflation did not appear to be \u201cembedded\u201d. In the UK, inflation is expected to remain close to zero for most of the year. NIESR is not forecasting any rise in interest rates from their current record low of 0.5% until February next year. Separate figures released on Tuesday showed UK shop prices continued to fall in April. They were down 1.9% on a year ago, a slightly softer pace of deflation than March\u2019s 2.1% as measured by the British Retail Consortium-Nielsen shop price index. Prices of both food and other goods were lower than a year ago. Non-food prices have been falling for 25 months in a row while food prices have fallen for five of the last six months. That pattern was putting pressure on retailers\u2019 margins, said Mike Watkins of Nielsen. \u201cThe challenge for retailers is that despite consumer confidence being back to pre-recession levels, many households are still cautious about spending, and for those with more disposable income, some appear to be spending a little more outside of retail, for example on leisure and entertainment. So we anticipate promotions continuing over the summer months to help the momentum in retail sales,\u201d said Watkins.",

      "bodyText": "Hello again: Just to flag up a few newsflashes from Frankfurt tonight, following the talks between Greek deputy PM Dragasakis and ECB president Mario Draghi. Nothing too spectacular, but at least both sides are talking.... As the Greek talks drag on with little sign of agreement, and next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting suddenly not expected to produce much progress, stock markets turned sharply into negative territory. Disappointing US trade figures also added to the uncertain mood as did the forthcoming UK election. The final scores showed: The FTSE finished down 58.37 points or 0.84% at 6927.58 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.51% to 11,327.68 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.12% lower at 4974.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.76% to 22,576.35 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.74% lower at 11,115.6 The Athens market dropped 3.85% to 794.23 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 53 points or 0.3% lower. European bond yields moved higher as investors fretted about the situation in Greece. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s the start of the document: The serious disagreements and contradictions between the IMF and the EU are creating obstacles in the negotiations, as well as high risks. While until recently the main argument of the institutions was that the Greek side did not submit complete proposals, now it is clear that proposals have indeed been submitted and that there have been substantial concessions towards the direction of an \u201chonorable compromise.\u201d The difference of strategy, however, between the institutions is creating obstacles. The IMF puts its red lines on the reforms, especially on pension and labour reforms, while it has loose lines on the topic of the primary surplus. On the back of the mind of the IMF lies the thought of debt write off, so that this can be rendered sustainable. On the contrary, the European Commission has red lines on the topic of the primary surplus, and consequently, on the issue of not cutting the debt, and loose lines on tough reforms, such as those regarding pensions and labour relations. Greece is considering plans to slow any capital flight, the Times is reporting. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take on Greece blaming its creditors for the current impasse: Greece blamed international creditors for the failure to find an agreement in bailout talks, saying a deal won\u2019t be possible until they agree on a common set of demands. A Greek official said that the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund are confronting the country with too many red lines and aren\u2019t coordinated enough with each other. The IMF won\u2019t compromise on labor deregulation and pension reforms, while the European Commission is insisting on fiscal targets being met and is refusing to consider a debt write down, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. And here is the European Commission: So many conflicting comments coming out about where Greece and its creditors stand. French finance minister Michel Sapin said after meeting his Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis that \u201cwe have the scope to reach a good compromise..There is no other solution than an accord.\u201d But then we have unnamed Greek officials taking a different tone: More on the growing feeling that no deal between Greece and its creditors will be reached next week, this time from the chairman of the eurogroup working group Thomas Wieser, talking to CNBC. Reuters reports: Greece and its European creditors will not reach a comprehensive agreement by next week, as it was expected, the chairman of the eurogroup working group, Thomas Wieser, told US TV channel CNBC on Tuesday, but expressed confidence that a deal will be reached before a real crisis or bankruptcy occurs. \u201cWe will get a deal,\u201d Wieser was quoted as saying on CNBC\u2019s webpage. \u201cI think all of the polls show in Greece, the Greek population is firmly convinced its future is in euro. It has given a mandate, which is quite clear it seems to me and it seems to the Greek politicians, [to] do whatever it takes to come to a conclusion with the creditors.\u201d On Monday, members of the Eurogroup had hoped they would be able to signal that an agreement was in sight, but representatives for European finance ministers in Brussels are still battling over fiscal and value-added-tax issues and labor market reforms, Wieser said. Asked about a possible Greek exit from the Eurozone, Wiesersaid that while this would have been \u201ca real catastrophe\u201d three years ago, today Europe is well insulated, but the outcome would still be negative. And in contrast to Markit, the Institute for Supply Management is reporting the pace of growth in the services sector rose to a five month high in April. An increase in business activity offset a fall in exports, pushing the ISM services index to 57.8 from 56.5 in March and above forecasts of a figure of 56.2. The contradictory evidence and disappointing US trade deficit earlier have combined to send Wall Street lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 65 points. Back with the US, and signs of a slowdown in growth in the service sector. The Markit purchasing managers index for services came in at 57.4 in April, down from an initial reading of 57.8 and the 59.2 figure for March. There was a dip in new business growth but the employment component frost to a 10 month high of 55 from 54 in March. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: Robust service sector growth adds to evidence that the economy is far from stalling, as indicated by the GDP numbers seen as the start of the year, supporting the [Federal Reserve\u2019s] view of the economy growing at a moderate rate. The ISM services report is due shortly. It appears the \u201ccrunch\u201d eurogroup meeting on May 11 will be nothing of the sort. No solutions expected, just more talks about progress (or lack of it?) Time for a recap. The European Commission has intensified the pressure on Greece to reach a deal with its creditors by slashing its growth forecasts. The EC now expects Greek GDP to rise by only 0.5% this year, not the 2.5% it had predicted previously. That would push the country\u2019s debt mountain into even more unsustainable levels, of around 180% of economic output. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici blamed the \u201chigh political uncertainty\u201d in Greece for the downgrade. As the report puts it: The rise in uncertainty since the autumn of 2014 and the slowdown in the recovery have had a significant impact on Greece\u2019s public finances, resulting in a significant shortfall in state revenues at the end of 2014 and in the first two months of 2015. The poor revenue collection around the turn of the year resulted in a significantly weaker-than- expected fiscal outcome for 2014. The EC predicts faster growth across the wider eurozone this year; GDP is tipped to rise by 1.5%, up from 1.3% before. Moscovici says: \u201cThe European economy is enjoying its brightest spring in several years, with the upturn supported by both external factors and policy measures that are beginning to bear fruit. But more needs to be done to ensure this recovery is more than a seasonal phenomenon.\u201d Highlights of the press conference start here. Greece\u2019s debt crisis ratcheted up another notch this morning, after the Financial Times reported that the International Monetary Fund was seriously worried about its bailout programme. According to the FT, the Fund had warned it could walk away from the Greek bailout unless unless European lenders write off significant amounts of its sovereign debt. That report helped to drive up yields on Greek bonds, and sent the Athens stock market spiralling down 4.5% in late trading. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has confirmed that the Fund raised concerns last month, but denied that it was pushing for an immediate write-off. Athens has speeded up its push for a breakthrough; Yanis Varoufakis is meeting with Moscovici in Brussels this afternoon..... ...., and deputy PM Greek PM Yiannis Dragasakis is sitting down with ECB chief Mario Draghi tonight. Dragasakis is expected to push for some breathing room from the ECB, which decides tomorrow whether to extend even more emergency liquidity to Greek banks. Greece is becoming an increasingly painful problem for the ECB, insiders say. As one senior official put it to Reuters: \u201cPeople are fed up...But withdrawing ELA altogether would be a nuclear bomb.\u201d Greece\u2019s stock market has fallen deeper into the red; the main Athens index is down 4.5% today. Bank shares are leading the fallers, as traders react to reports that the IMF was pushing for a new debt writedown. The surge in America\u2019s monthly trade deficit means that the US economy \u201cundoubtedly contracted slightly in the first quarter of 2015\u201d, says Paul Ashworth, Chief US Economist at Capital Economics. But he expects growth to bounce back in the second three months of this year, meaning America would avoid falling into a technical recession. Just in.... America\u2019s trade deficit has widened unexpectedly to its largest since the financial crisis began, suggesting that its economy could actually be contracting. The US commerce department says that the US trade deficit surged to a jaw-dropping $51.4bn in March, up from $35.9bn in February. That\u2019s the largest one-month gap between imports and exports since October 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. There is a one-off factor to consider; some West Coast US ports has been disrupted by strike action in February, so imports were playing catch-up last month. But even allowing for that, the figures suggest the US economy may actually have contracted in the first three months of 2015, rather than scraping annualised growth of 0.2%. Remember the oil price crash of autumn 2014? Well, it\u2019s a different story today - US crude oil just hit the $60/barrel mark for the first time this year. That\u2019s quite a recovery since mid-March, when US crude briefly nudged $42 per barrel. Still, $100 per barrel is still a long way off: We\u2019ve not heard much from Greece\u2019s finance minister today.... but Yanis Varoufakis has just arrived in Brussels, for talks with Pierre Moscovici. Cue the usual scrum to catch a glimpse of Varoufakis; despite the recent reshuffle of Greece\u2019s negotiating team, he retains his magnetic attraction to the media. Germany\u2019s finance chief, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has denied that the International Monetary Fund pushed the eurozone to cut Greece\u2019s debt burden last month. Sch\u00e4uble told the Foreign Press Association in Berlin that IMF European chief Poul Thomsen had indeed warned that Greece\u2019s debt reduction path had become \u2018more challenging\u2019. However, Thomsen didn\u2019t insist on debt relief at last month\u2019s Eurogroup meeting in Riga, he added. Reuters has the details: \u201cThe IMF of course did not make such a comment,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said, noting however that Thomsen had been clear that Greek finances were deteriorating because of a pause in reforms linked to the election there. Thomsen did say things \u201chad become more difficult,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said. If you\u2019re just tuning in, this is in response to the FT\u2019s front page story this morning that the IMF is taking a tough line on Greece, due to its deteriorating finances. And that story stated clearly that Thomsen did push the debt relief issue. Par example: With the large surplus now turning into a sizeable deficit, Greece\u2019s debt levels would begin to spike again. This would force either Athens to take drastic austerity measures or eurozone bailout lenders to agree to debt write-offs to get Athens\u2019 debt back on a sustainable path, the IMF believes. Officials said Mr Thomsen specifically mentioned the need for debt relief during the three-hour meeting. \u201cThe IMF thinks the gap between the two realities is very large right now,\u201d said one senior official involved in the talks. He noted that both Athens, which was resisting new economic reforms, and eurozone creditors would probably fight the IMF on the issue. Don\u2019t take the risk of a Greek exit lightly. That\u2019s the warning from Italy\u2019s foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni this morning. He told reporters in Milan that: \u201cItaly\u2019s government considers short-sighted and dangerous to underestimate the Greek crisis.\u201d Another interesting development. A senior Greek privatisation official has told Reuters that Athens is eager to crack on with two deals, seemingly in a bid to placate its lenders. That includes reopening bidding for a majority stake in Piraeus Port, and agreeing a \u20ac1.2bn deal with German operator Fraport to run regional airports in Greece. Chinese shipping giant Cosco had been in line to buy Piraeus Port, which it already partly controls, before the Syriza government suspended the privatisation after taking office. Over in Athens, the stock market has fallen by 3% today. Bank shares are leading the fallers, with Piraeus Bank sliding by 9.5%. Investors are understandably concerned by reports that the IMF might walk away from the Greek bailout. The EC\u2019s new growth forecasts are adding to the gloom. Most other European markets are up, though. The FTSE 100 and the German DAX have both gained 0.5%. The Greek government has revealed that prime minister Alexis Tsipras and German chancellor Angela Merkel held a telephone call last night: No detail on what was said. The two leaders had agreed to stay in touch during the bailout talks. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Brussels reporters have scrambled for country-specific briefings, so I suspect we\u2019ll hear more shortly.... Could Greece be given some new liquidity assistance at the next eurogroup meeting, on May 11? Moscovici replies that he hopes to see significant progress by the time eurozone finance ministers meet on May 11, but doesn\u2019t go any further. Last night, EC president Jean-Claude Juncker warned that \u201cAnglo-Saxons will try to break up the eurozone\u201d if Greece were to exit the single currency. Bruno Waterfield of The Times asks Pierre Moscovici what Juncker meant, exactly..... Moscovici says he didn\u2019t catch his boss\u2019s speech (why not?!) but completely agrees with Juncker on this issue (good recovery). The single currency is irreversible, and if one member quit then people would begin to speculate about who was next. That\u2019s why Grexit isn\u2019t even being considered, he explains. You can read the Commissions\u2019s concerns about Greece on page 80 of the new Spring Forecasts. This charts show how growth is expected to flag this year, and deflation likely to continue until 2016: And this table shows all the new forecasts: (apologies if it\u2019s too small to read; this link may be better) Today\u2019s forecast also contain bad news for Finland; the EC has slashed its growth forecast this year from 0.8% to just 0.3%. Finland is also expected to run a deficit above 3% of GDP this year, breaching EU rules. Brussels is planning to give the new Finnish government some advice next week: Finally, the EC allow a question on Greece. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel gets the mike, and whether today\u2019s growth downgrade mean that more needs to be done in the current negotiations to get Greece\u2019s bailout programme back on track. And does it also mean that any future programme (a third bailout) would have to be larger than expected in February? Commissioner Moscovici give a long answer (in French, merci Pierre....). The gist is that uncertainty in Greece has hit growth prospects this year. Growth could recover in 2016, if suitable reforms are agreed. Europe and Athens both want Greece to remain in the eurozone, and neither side wants to see any \u201caccidents\u201d, he adds. The outlook for Europe\u2019s economy looks brighter than at any time since the financial crisis began in 2008, according to today\u2019s report. It says: The recovery from the crisis and the double-dip recession has been a long and tedious one, marked by numerous setbacks, but now there are clear indications that a cyclical upswing is underway, supported by economic tailwinds. And those tailwinds include the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme, the weaker euro (thanks to QE!), and the cheaper oil price. The EC\u2019s new Spring forecasts are online here (pdf). Despite Greece\u2019s woes, the EC believes Europe\u2019s economy is healing -- with faster-than-expected growth forecast this year. It has also raised its inflation forecast, and no longer fears a long stretch of falling prices: European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is outlining today\u2019s growth forecasts now. He tells reporters in Brussels that the EC was forced to cut its forecast for 2.5% growth in Greece this year, to just 0.5%, given recent events. In the light of the persistent uncertainty [in Greece], a downward revision has been unavoidable. The EC has also revised down its forecast for 2016, from 3.6% growth to 2.9%. That assumes, though that there is a deal over its bailout this summer. I\u2019ll collect all the growth forecast together shortly, but in the meantime this map shows the hot spots and the laggards: The EC is also warning that Greece is failing to get to grips with tax collection. The EC is warned that Greece\u2019s recovery has stalled since the previous government called snap general elections at the end of last year. Political uncertainty has been fuelled by the \u201clack of clarity\u201d over the present administration\u2019s polities, it says, adding that the Greek factory sector is still locked in a depression. The EC has also slashed its forecast for Greece\u2019s growth rate this year, in another signal that its bailout programme is off track. Brussels now expects Greece\u2019s GDP will expand by just 0.5% in 2015, down from a previous forecast of 2.5%. And that pushes up the country\u2019s debt/GDP ratio even higher, to 180% of national output. This will surely surely fuel concerns over Greece\u2019s financial position, with the IMF already warning that Athens is missing its target for a primary surplus (see earlier post) As Antonio Garcia Pascual, Barclays\u2019 chief European economist, explained on Bloomberg TV a few minutes ago: Both from the European and IMF perspective, the programme must be fully funded... The bigger the hole, the more funds must come in. Breaking: The European Commission has raised its growth forecast for the eurozone this year, from 1.3% to 1.5%. Reminder, it\u2019s nearly time for the European Commission to publish its new spring forecasts (live feed here from 10am BST/11am Brussels time) We\u2019re expecting the EC to cut its growth forecasts for Greece..... Growth in Britain\u2019s construction sector slowed last month, as Thursday\u2019s general election casts a shadow over building work. Although the sector expanded, growth was the weakest in almost two years, with firms reporting a sharp drop in new work. But it\u2019s not all bad -- firms are still hiring new workers. Markit\u2019s construction PMI, based on interviews with hundreds of UK building firms, dropped to 54.2, from 57.8 in March. That\u2019s the lowest since June 2013 (and closer to the 50-point mark splitting expansion from contraction). It\u2019s the latest sign that the recovery is losing some momentum. But.... business confidence is still quite high; it appears clients are holding back from taking spending decisions until Britain has gone to the polls, given forecast of a hung parliament. Tim Moore of Markit explains: \u201cApril\u2019s survey highlights another growth slowdown across the UK construction sector, with new work expanding at the weakest pace for almost two years. \u201cThe uncertain general election outcome appears to have put some grit in the wheels of decision making. Construction firms widely noted delays with clients\u2019 budget setting and a reduced propensity to commit to new projects. \u201cDespite experiencing pre-election risk aversion among clients in April, construction companies indicated a strong degree of confidence regarding the year-ahead outlook. Greek bonds are weakening this morning, after it emerged that the International Monetary Fund believes Greece\u2019s finances are badly off track (see earlier post for details). The yield (effectively the interest rate on Greece\u2019s two-year bonds has jumped by more than one percentage point this morning to 20.7%, up from 19.5% on Monday night. Greece\u2019s 10-year debt is also under some pressure, pushing its yield up over 11%, from 10.4%. Yields rise when prices fall. The IMF is due to provide around half the \u20ac7.2bn of outstanding bailout funds to Greece; so the consequences could be severe if the Fund does withhold its share. Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, has warned that there\u2019s no guarantee of a deal with Greece in time for next week\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers (on May 11) Schelling added that Greece has made some compromises, but is still holding firm on other issues. Reuters has the details: 08:40:00 - AUSTRIAN FINANCE MINISTER SCHELLING SAYS SEES PROGRESS IN GREEK DEBT TALKS, NO BREAKTHROUGH YET 08:40:00 - AUSTRIA\u2019S SCHELLING - CAN\u2019T SAY IF THERE WILL BE A DEAL ON GREEK DEBT ON MAY 11, NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE 08:40:00 - AUSTRIA\u2019S SCHELLING SAYS GREECE HAS CHANGED POSITIONS IN SOME AREAS, NO MOVEMENT IN OTHERS AREAS What can Greece hope to achieve by meeting Mario Draghi today? Well, according to the Kathimerini newspaper, Greek deputy PM Dragasakis has an \u201coptimistic plan\u201d to push the ECB to lift its restrictions preventing Greece issuing more short-term debt. More here. I\u2019d be surprised if Draghi was swayed -- given the amount of support the ECB has already given to Greece, and concerns that its banks are suffering deposit outflows. The meeting also comes a day before the ECB decides whether to continue providing liquidity assistance to Greece\u2019s banks. Spain\u2019s unemployment total has fallen by a record amount last month, as the country\u2019s recovery continues to gain pace. The number of people unemployed across Spain tumbled by over 118,000 in April, twice as much as economists had expected. That\u2019s a record drop for any April, according to Madrid. But it still leaves more than one in five adults out of work. Athens could come under even more pressure if the European Commission downgrades its economic forecasts for Greece this morning, points out analyst Yannis Koutsomitis. The BBC ran an interesting piece last night, explaining how Greece\u2019s government has already missed a swath of payments to Greek workers and companies. That doesn\u2019t count as an official default, of course, but it underlines how perilous Greece\u2019s financial position has become this year. Here\u2019s a flavour: A junior doctor told the BBC that although wages were paid regularly to medical staff, the government was more than four months behind on payments for on-call time. \u201cLast week we got paid on-call time for the month of December,\u201d she said. Hospital suppliers that provide healthcare units with everything from bandages to dialysis machines warned last week that they may be forced to stop supplying hospitals. \u201cIn the past four months we are experiencing an undeclared suspension of payments,\u201d their associations said in a recent statement. Eurozone crisis experts are alarmed by the news that the IMF could pull funding for Greece unless it receives debt relief. Here\u2019s some early reaction: A new Greek opinion poll shows that a majority of the population want to stick with the euro, with roughly a third favouring Grexit. And few people think things would be better if New Democracy were still in power: Overnight, Australia\u2019s central bank cut interest rates to a fresh record low of 2%. The move (covered in this liveblog), is intended to ward off an economic slowdown in Australia. But if the RBA hoped to weaken the Aussie dollar, it\u2019s been disappointed -- the currency did drop (as you\u2019d expect) before bouncing back smartly: Today\u2019s meetings are overshadowed by the news that the International Monetary Fund fears that Greece\u2019s debt mountain has become unsustainable again. According to the Financial Times, the IMF believes Greece may run a primary budget deficit of 1.5% this year, far from the 3% surplus it was aiming for. That would push Greece\u2019s debt/GDP levels even higher, meaning it could face even tougher austerity unless eurozone creditors agreed to write off some debts. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel explains: Greece is so far off course on its $172bn bailout programme that it faces losing vital International Monetary Fund support unless European lenders write off significant amounts of its sovereign debt, the fund has warned Athens\u2019 eurozone creditors. The warning, delivered to eurozone finance ministers by Poul Thomsen, head of the IMF\u2019s European department, raises the prospect that it may hold back its portion of a \u20ac7.2bn tranche of bailout aid that Greece is desperately attempting to secure to avoid bankruptcy. Full story: IMF takes hard line on aid for Greece Greece\u2019s national debt is already 177% of GDP; which many economists believe is simply unsustainable without some relief. And if the IMF are right, it would also mean that a third Greek bailout might have to be even larger than the \u20ac50bn that had been predicted. Good morning. We\u2019re back after Monday\u2019s Bank Holiday break to track the latest developments around Greece\u2019s bailout talks, plus the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up....Greece\u2019s government is scrambling to reach a breakthrough over its bailout before running out of cash. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is in Paris this morning to meet his French counterpart, Michel Sapin, before heading on Brussels to see European Economic and Monetary Affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici. But the key meeting could be in Frankfurt this afternoon, when deputy Greek PM Yiannis Dragasakis meets ECB chief Mario Draghi. Euclid Tsakalotos, who is now leading Greece\u2019s negotiations with its creditors, is also attending. With no deal in sight, despite days of negotiations in Brussels, Greece is still pushing for a breakthrough with its creditors ahead of the next Eurogroup meeting on May 11th. But the two sides are still divided over key issues such as pensions and labour market reforms. Yesterday, Greece insisted it would continue to meet its debt repayments, as the crisis grinds on: In other news... The European Commission is set to sound the alarm over Greece\u2019s economy, when it publishes its latest growth and inflation forecasts at 10am BST. It may cut its Greek forecasts, but also predict faster expansion across the wider eurozone. Banking giant HSBC is releasing its first-quarter results this morning, at 9.15am BST. It\u2019s expected to put more money aside to cover the cost of its role in the foreign-exchange rate-rigging scandal. Markit releases its latest assessment of the UK\u2019s construction industry, at 9.30am BST. And we get the latest Spanish unemployment data sometime after 8am BST.

      "bodyText": "Hewlett-Packard has unveiled full details of its $5bn (\u00a33.3bn) fraud case against the founder of the UK software company Autonomy, claiming that Mike Lynch inflated the revenues of his business by about $700m over a two-and-a-half-year period. HP, which bought Autonomy in 2011 for $11bn, has filed a claim against Lynch and his finance director, Sushovan Hussain, in the high court in London, alleging they engaged in improper transactions with software resellers and in questionable accounting practices. The filing contains new allegations, denied by Lynch, that Autonomy dismissed its US chief financial officer Brent Hogenson after he raised concerns about the company\u2019s transactions to its UK based auditor, Deloitte, and UK regulator the Financial Services Authority (FSA). HP has previously said it is considering taking legal action against Deloitte. HP claims that Lynch and Hussain breached their fiduciary duties as directors, that Lynch breached his contractual duties as an employee of Autonomy, and that Hussain repeatedly misled the Autonomy audit committee. The dispute has seen the HP chief executive, Meg Whitman, who joined the company after its disastrous Autonomy deal, lock horns with Britain\u2019s most successful software boss. Lynch hit back against the claims, saying HP had failed to produce a \u201csmoking gun\u201d to support its accusation of fraud. In a statement on his blog he said: \u201cHP\u2019s claim is finally laid bare for what it is \u2013 a desperate search for a scapegoat for its own errors and incompetence. The contents of the claim are a simple rehash of previous leaks and insinuations that add up to one long disagreement over accounting treatments, and have nothing to do with fraud.\u201d Lynch and Hussain, who also dispute the charges, acknowledged receiving the particulars of the claim on Tuesday, allowing the full details of HP\u2019s forensic trawl through Autonomy\u2019s accounts to become public for the first time. Between the first quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2011, the Cambridge-based company reported revenues totalling more than $2bn. HP claims that a third of that was wrongly reported, misleading Autonomy\u2019s shareholders on the London Stock Exchange and later HP. \u201cThis conduct by Lynch and Hussain was systematic and was sustained for more than two years prior to the acquisition of Autonomy by HP,\u201d the Californian software group said. \u201cIts purpose was to ensure that the Autonomy group\u2019s financial performance \u2026 appeared to be that of a rapidly growing pure software company \u2026 The reality was that the group was experiencing little or no growth, it was losing market share, and its true financial performance consistently fell far short of market expectations.\u201d HP\u2019s lawyers have outlined five main sources of allegedly wrongly claimed income: $194m of supposedly hidden hardware sales. HP said it found Autonomy resold hardware such as servers made by other companies, often at a loss, and claims its directors allowed investors to believe this was software revenue. $196m in apparently wrongly reported sales of Autonomy\u2019s core software product, IDOL, to other software companies. $205m in supposedly questionable transactions with software resellers. $80m of claimed incorrectly reported hosting deals, in which Autonomy renegotiated contracts to host other companies\u2019 data on its own servers. $33m in other alleged improper transactions. After the release of Autonomy\u2019s results for the first half of 2010, US executive Hogenson allegedly blew the whistle. He raised concerns - about reseller deals - with the FSA in an email sent on 26 July of that year. On 28 July 2010, HP claims, he was summarily dismissed by US chief operating officer Joel Scott, \u201cacting at the direction of Lynch\u201d. Lawyers for Lynch said in a letter to HP\u2019s legal team that Hogenson was actually dismissed by Autonomy\u2019s chairman. His concerns had been investigated by Deloitte and UK accounting body the Financial Reporting Review Panel, they said, but neither organisation had taken issue. Of particular interest are 37 deals with small IT contractors that bought Autonomy\u2019s software. Deals with these outfits, known in the industry as \u201cvalue added resellers\u201d, were key to Autonomy\u2019s ability to present itself as a fast-growing software business. The resellers were presented as acquiring the rights to sell on Autonomy software to end users including UBS bank, General Motors, the Vatican library, accounting firm KPMG and even Hewlett-Packard itself. But HP claims many of these deals were fictional in that no agreement with an end user was ever concluded, and that the resellers were simply warehousing Autonomy\u2019s software. Other deals were recorded as revenue too early, before the end user had agreed to buy the Autonomy products. The resellers involved were located in countries including the US, Italy and the UK. In a point-by-point rebuttal, Lynch and Hussain have dismissed HP\u2019s claims, saying: \u201cOut of 23,000 deals and $2.2bn in revenue that took place at Autonomy during the period, Whitman makes assertions concerning only six specific reseller transactions, which add up to under $40m in revenue, and for which almost all the cash was, in fact, received. Whitman provides scant supporting evidence even for these few assertions. \u201cShe raises questions over fully paid hosted deals, the form of which HP\u2019s own accountants approved, and in a structure HP itself also used. She now admits that hardware sales were correctly recorded as revenue and that HP was fully aware of this when they valued the company at $11bn. Meg Whitman has been playing a delaying game, promising a smoking gun that has never materialised.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The top 25 US hedge fund managers earned more than $11bn last year \u2013 one of their worst-ever years. It might sound like a lot, but the collective $11.6bn taken home by the 25 leading (all male) hedge fund managers in 2014 was roughly half what they collected in 2013 and the lowest since the 2008 financial crisis. Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine, which conducts the annual hedge fund pay survey, described the earnings as \u201cpaltry\u201d despite their collective personal earnings being more than the gross domestic product of Nicaragua, Laos or Madagascar. \u201cHow bad was [2014]?,\u201d Alpha magazine said. \u201cThe 25 hedge fund managers on our 14th annual Rich List made a paltry $11.62bn combined, barely half of the $21.15bn the top 25 gained the previous year and roughly equal to what they took home during nightmarish 2008. \u201cHarsh memories of the global financial crisis pervaded Wall Street in 2014 \u2013 at least, for the highest-earning hedge fund managers,\u201d Alpha said. Alpha said the average 2014 earnings were \u201cjust $467m\u201d down from $846m in 2013 \u2013 which is still 18,800 times the average US salary of $44,888. The top three managers \u2013 Citadel\u2019s Kenneth Griffin, Renaissance Technologies\u2019s James Simons and Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Ray Dalio \u2013 all made more than $1bn last year, with Griffin claiming the top spot with $1.3bn. In 2013, the top performing hedge fund manager David Tepper of Appaloosa Management took home $3.5bn after big bets on airline stocks paid off. No woman has yet made the list, which has been running for 14 years. Hedge fund managers typically get paid based on a structure known as \u201ctwo and 20\u201d, in which they collect a 2% fee on the assets they manage and earn 20% of the profits they make for investors.",

The spike in imports also partly reflected a rebound in activity following the end of strike action at key West Coast ports that had disrupted activity earlier in the year. The first official estimate of growth for the first three months of the year showed the world\u2019s largest economy only just scraped growth at an annual rate of 0.2%.

Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said growth could be revised down to reflect a fall of about 0.3% at the time of the second estimate later this month. \u201cThe surge in the monthly trade deficit to a massive $51.4bn in March means that the US economy undoubtedly contracted slightly in the first quarter,\u201d he said.

Imports of petroleum products on the other hand were at a record low, reflecting lower oil prices and as the increase in energy production in the US has reduced the country\u2019s dependence on foreign oil. The US trade deficit with China increased by $10.5bn to $37.8bn in March. The weak trade performance will reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve is in no rush to raise interest rates and will instead wait for stronger growth before announcing the first hike in borrowing costs for nearly a decade. Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets, said the weak US trade data \u201cgenerated further doubt over the sustainability of the US economic recovery\u201d. The dollar fell against a range of currencies after the weaker-than-expected data was published by the commerce department.",

      "bodyText": "BG Group investors have rebelled against the pay deal for the company\u2019s boss, Helge Lund, after an annual meeting where the package, worth up to \u00a325m, was branded \u201coutrageous\u201d by one shareholder. Just under one in five failed to back the pay report and more than 15% opposed the re-election of Sir John Hood as chairman of the remuneration committee. The vote came as Andrew Gould, the chairman, told the meeting the board had misjudged the public reaction to Lund\u2019s pay package, but declined the shareholder\u2019s invitation to apologise and said the deal was necessary to get Lund to join. Lund had been hired from Norway\u2019s Statoil to overhaul the underperforming company, but the outrage over his pay deal intensified when BG agreed to be bought by Shell for \u00a347bn last month, only weeks after he joined. Some investors argued he would now earn a fortune for merely keeping the company ticking over before Shell\u2019s purchase completes next year, at which point Lund is to leave. Lund told the meeting: \u201cFrom a leadership perspective, I do have slightly mixed emotions and I was looking forward to taking BG forward. A takeover was certainly not in my mind when I joined.\u201d The size of the shareholder rebellion was large given that many City fund managers were unwilling to rock the boat with the Shell takeover going through. Shell is paying a 52% premium on BG\u2019s market value before the offer was announced. Hood said it would not be clear until the end of the year how much Lund stood to collect when he leaves, but at BG\u2019s annual meeting, Mark Bentley, from the small shareholder group ShareSoc, said he could receive \u00a311.7m. To applause from the floor, he said: \u201cThis really represents an outrageous sum in the current climate. It\u2019s a contribution to the ratcheting up of executive pay across FTSE 100 companies \u2026 I really think the remuneration committee has let shareholders and UK plc down in agreeing this massive package for the CEO and may I request an apology from the remuneration committee?\u201d Gould replied: \u201cAll decisions around Mr Lund\u2019s \u2026 package were made by the board as a whole. Therefore, if an apology is due it has to come from the board as a whole.\u201d Gould said the board underestimated the \u201camount of public interest and shareholder angst\u201d that Lund\u2019s proposed pay deal caused. \u201cIf we misjudged something, we misjudged the public reaction to it.\u201d Lund has kept a low profile since joining BG. Asked about the reaction to his pay, Lund said: \u201cI recognise this is an area where there is a lot of focus but that has never been the focus for me in joining BG.\u201d Lund joined for the management challenge of improving the company, he said.",

      "bodyText": "HSBC\u2019s boss has hit out against the chancellor\u2019s bank levy, warning it would end his efforts to increase dividend payments to shareholders, as he said a review of whether to move Britain\u2019s biggest bank out of the UK would be completed by the end of the year. Stuart Gulliver also conceded the bank\u2019s reputation has been damaged and the morale of senior staff knocked by the revelations about the tax evasion strategies adopted by its Swiss arm. The bank took a $139m charge for potential legal actions related to the operation as it published its first-quarter results on Tuesday. Gulliver cited the bank levy \u2013 which cost HSBC \u00a3700m last year, more than any other bank \u2013 as well as the requirement to ringfence its high street arm from the investment banking operation, as among his concerns over remaining headquartered in London. He said Hong Kong would be capable of regulating HSBC, which employs 266,000 people in 70 countries. Speaking from Hong Kong, Gulliver also told analysts the bank could move a large part of its investment banking arm, known as global banking and markets or GBM. Last month, the bank unleashed a political storm when it announced it was reviewing its London head office, where it has been based since 1992 after buying Midland bank. Gulliver\u2019s latest remarks, less than 48 hours before polling day, may help reignite the row after he focused on the bank levy, which was introduced by George Osborne in 2010, and the ringfencing rule, also introduced by the chancellor. As markets position themselves for the outcome of Thursday\u2019s election, the bank said it had insured 90% of its sterling assets to guard against major swings in the value of the pound. The methodology on comparing HQ locationswould be set out on a strategy day on 9 June, he said, and the executive team aimed to make its presentation to the board by the end of the year. The review is \u201cgoing to take us a few months, not years\u201d said Gulliver, whose personal use of a Swiss-based bank account was exposed in the leak of bank customer details published by the Guardian and other publications in February. \u201cThis is not a threat , it\u2019s a very objective review,\u201d he said. Born in Britain, he is a UK tax resident but domiciled in Hong Kong and has said he intends to die abroad. Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, said: \u201cAlthough the detailed discussion of the potential re-domicile will have to wait until the 9 June investor day, a few key comments showed a positive bias towards a Hong Kong move, in our view.\u201d Gulliver said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority was capable of regulating HSBC, even though the bank is nine times the size of the Chinese territory\u2019s GDP. \u201cThey are regulating about 80% of the profit of the group already, they are quite capable of regulating the group,\u201d he said. Any head office move would affect the roles of 250 people. He linked the bank levy to the bank\u2019s commitment to a progressive dividend policy. A 5% rise on last year\u2019s $9.6bn (\u00a36.3bn) dividend payouts would cost around $400m, he told analysts, around the same as the increase in the bank levy. Gulliver said the group was \u201cunder significant pressure from our shareholders\u201d to look into relocation. He said that the rise in the share price after the review was announced last month was an indication that shareholders saw the growth of the bank being restricted by \u201cwhat they perceive to be in their view [the bank being based in] the wrong location\u201d HSBC shares fell on Tuesday after the bank reported profits of $7bn, up 4% compared with the same three months of last year. Gulliver also used stark language to discuss the impact of the ringfencing rules. \u201cThe UK has rejected the concept of universal banking,\u201d he said. But he said it was \u201cway too early\u201d to say if the UK high street bank \u2013 the former Midland bank \u2013 would be floated off separately, although he set out a series of concerns about the ringfenced bank, which would be located in Birmingham. \u201cWhat we have been studying is evolution of the rules and the extent to which we as the 100% shareholder will have management control over that ringfenced bank \u2026 If we ended up simply as an equity holder \u2026 that would become a difficult issue,\u201d said Gulliver. Asked about the impact of revelations about the tax evasion strategies in its Swiss arm following the leak of details about 100,000 bank accounts, he said they had \u201cundoubtedly done reputational damage to the firm and had significant negative impact on morale among senior colleagues at HSBC\u201d. \u201cIt has clearly had an impact on people\u2019s sense of pride,\u201d he said, but it had not led to customers moving their accounts. The bank included new disclosures about its legal risks, one of which included the interest of Financial Conduct Authority in the Swiss bank. \u201cIn the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority issued a request for information to HSBC Bank plc and HSBC Holdings plc in relation to HSBC Swiss Private Bank,\u201d HSBC said. Unlike other banks, it did not take a fresh provision for potential new fines for foreign exchange rigging. As well as the $139m charge related to the Swiss bank, there was a $137m provision for more compensation for payment protection insurance mis-selling. It also made reference to a UK court case regarding PPI, which could lead to further provisions. This article was amended on 6 May 2015. The original article said Stuart Gulliver was \u2018tax-domiciled in Hong Kong\u2019. He is a UK tax resident and Hong Kong-domiciled. This has been corrected.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last month\u2019s construction industry figures add to the welter of evidence showing that boom-boom Britain is no more. Building firms, according to the Markit/CIPS survey, are expanding output at the slowest rate for almost two years. Commercial activity, which includes properties such as shops, factories, offices and industrial units, was down to the weakest since August 2013. Analysts need to go back to June 2013 for such a weak housebuilding figure. The official figures are even worse. As IHS Global Insight analyst Howard Archer points out, the Office for National Statistics has estimated that construction output contracted in the first quarter of 2015 by an unexpectedly steep 1.6%. This startling drop came after an even larger fall of 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Coupled with the downbeat Markit survey of manufacturers for April, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the bedrock of British commercial life is lacking the verve and energy seen in 2013 and the first half of 2014. Some economists have blamed the slowdown on the election. Markit\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson said as much when he warned: \u201cClearly the election outcome will be a major factor in determining growth and confidence in coming months.\u201d He may be right. Building firms are notoriously sensitive to winds of change. Far from being the bold capitalists they appear, builders will mothball projects with little notice if the sums for the coming month fail to add up. But why would builders fear an election when every major party has pledged to construct more homes? If it is the Labour party that developers fear, this would seem equally nonsensical. Yes, the major developers are massive Tory donors and have packed David Cameron\u2019s dinner table in No10 since 2010. But Labour is responsible for the regeneration of the northern cities, with much of the money spent on sprucing up and rebuilding city centres. Britain was transformed into a first rank nation from 1997, largely by a construction industry that in turn profited immensely from its efforts.",

As IHS Global Insight analyst Howard Archer points out, the Office for National Statistics has estimated that construction output contracted in the first quarter of 2015 by an unexpectedly steep 1.6%. This startling drop came after an even larger fall of 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. </p> <p>Coupled with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/01/uk-manufacturing-slowdown-deals-blow-to-conservatives\">downbeat Markit survey of manufacturers</a> for April, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the bedrock of British commercial life is lacking the verve and energy seen in 2013 and the first half of 2014.<br></p> <p>Some economists have blamed the slowdown on the election. Markit\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson said as much when he warned: \u201cClearly the election outcome will be a major factor in determining growth and confidence in coming months.\u201d</p> <p>He may be right. Building firms are notoriously sensitive to winds of change. Far from being the bold capitalists they appear, builders will mothball projects with little notice if the sums for the coming month fail to add up.</p> <p>But why would builders fear an election when every major party has pledged to construct more homes?</p> <p>If it is the Labour party that developers fear, this would seem equally nonsensical. Yes, the major developers are massive Tory donors and have packed David Cameron\u2019s dinner table in No10 since 2010. But Labour is responsible for the regeneration of the northern cities, with much of the money spent on sprucing up and rebuilding city centres.</p> <p>Britain was transformed into a first rank nation from 1997, largely by a construction industry that in turn profited immensely from its efforts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Uncertainty over the general election affected British building sites last month, with construction output rising at the slowest rate in almost two years. In the latest sign that the UK\u2019s economic recovery is faltering, the closely watched Markit/CIPS construction PMI survey showed all parts of the building sector weakened in April, including housebuilding. The sharp slowdown surprised economists and sent the pound to a 10-day low against the dollar at $1.5088. It gave up some of its gains against the euro \u2013 weak across the board \u2013 with \u20ac1 worth 73.33p compared with 73.20p before the data was published. With just two days until the UK goes to the polls, the data dealt a further blow to David Cameron and George Osborne, who have marked out the economy as the key election battleground for the Conservatives. Official figures published last week showed growth halved in the first quarter of 2014, to just 0.3%. It was the slowest since the end of 2012, when there were fears that the UK was heading for another recession. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said uncertainty over the outcome of the election had put \u201csome grit in the wheels of decision-making\u201d in the building sector. \u201cConstruction firms widely noted delays with clients\u2019 budget setting and a reduced propensity to commit to new projects,\u201d he added. The disappointing construction numbers, combined with a similarly poor equivalent survey for the manufacturing sector last week, suggest the UK economy got off to a weak start in the second quarter. The UK recovery has so far been heavily dependent on the services sector, despite the government\u2019s ambition to rebalance the economy away from consumer spending and towards more manufacturing and exports. \u201cTogether with a steep slowdown in manufacturing and disappointing GDP data, the construction survey adds to evidence that the UK economy has hit a soft patch,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. The headline index on the construction PMI fell to 54.2 in April from 57.8, where anything above 50 signals expansion. Growth in housebuilding and commercial construction slowed and civil engineering work volumes shrank. New orders in the sector overall grew at the slowest rate since June 2013. Despite slowing growth in the construction sector \u2013 where output is still below its pre-crisis peak \u2013 a shortage of subcontractors encouraged them to increase their prices at the fastest pace since the survey began 18 years ago.",

      "bodyText": "Telstra breached Australian privacy law when it failed to hand over a journalist\u2019s metadata to him, a watchdog has ruled. A Fairfax journalist, Ben Grubb, has been in a two-year battle to access details of his phone and web metadata from Telstra. Under Australian privacy law, certain corporate and government entities must hand over \u201cpersonal information\u201d they hold on individuals. Although Telstra provided some data to Grubb, it refused to hand over information about internet protocol address information, edited versions of incoming call records and website URL information. But the Australian privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, said in a landmark ruling on Monday that the URL and IP information must be provided to Grubb within 30 days, and free. \u201cI therefore find that in the present set of circumstances, the metadata held by Telstra to which it refuses to give the complainant access (the so named \u2018network data\u2019) constitutes the complainant\u2019s personal information under the Privacy Act,\u201d he said. Telstra said it would appeal against the decision. Pilgrim ruled the incoming call record data was subject to an exemption under the Privacy Act that allowed Telstra to refuse access to the information. In his decision he rejected a number of claims made by Telstra about the difficulty in retrieving and linking data to a person\u2019s identity. Telstra relied in part on this submission to argue that certain types of Grubb\u2019s data was not \u201cpersonal information\u201d because it could not be linked to his identity. He drew attention to Telstra\u2019s provision of data to law enforcement agencies to show that it has the ability to process and connect different types of metadata to individuals. \u201cTelstra\u2019s handling of tens of thousands of requests made by law enforcement bodies, together with its recent public statement affirming that customers may access their metadata on request, suggests instead that Telstra has the capacity through the use of its network and records management systems to ascertain the identity of an individual, and this process of ascertaining an individual\u2019s identity does not exceed the bounds of what is reasonable,\u201d Pilgrim said. \u201cI am consequently of the view that the metadata Telstra holds in connection with an individual which permits that individual\u2019s identity to reasonably be ascertained from that metadata constitutes the personal information of that individual under the Privacy Act.\u201d The decision was made before the new Australian privacy principles came into force in 2014. But the definition of personal information has not changed significantly, and the decision is likely to carry significant weight in cases under the new privacy regime.",
