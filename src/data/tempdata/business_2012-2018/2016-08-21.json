According to figures from the first full month after Brexit, the value of infrastructure construction contracts for July dropped by 20% to \u00a31.5bn. The consultancy group that supplies figures to the Office for National Statistics, Barbour ABI, revealed that new construction orders were down to \u00a35.8bn in July. According to Michael Dall, the group\u2019s chief economist, economic uncertainty in the wake of the Brexit vote could be stopping private sector investors from putting money into construction and infrastructure projects. With the private sector reluctant to invest in large-scale projects, Dall says pressure is mounting on the government to finance public infrastructure projects themselves. He said: \u201cIn the first full month since the vote to leave the European Union, the value of construction projects reaching contract award stage declined in July. This is unsurprising given the uncertainty in the economy. \u201cHowever, it is the infrastructure sector which has performed particularly poorly this month, and with the change in narrative from the current government, it puts more emphasis on any fiscal stimulus that they may be planning to make.\u201d Although prime minister Theresa May has pledged to put infrastructure investment at the heart of post-Brexit economic policy, analysts fear that the stalled Hinkley Point plans and uncertainty over airport expansion point to hesitancy over investment in public building projects. However, her decision to break with the previous administration\u2019s austerity project has given industry insiders hope that the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, will be given the freedom to invest in big projects. Last week Leo Quinn, chief executive of Balfour Beatty, said that industry was \u201clooking for a lead from government\u201d. He added: \u201cMoney is effectively free, so it\u2019s a good time for the government to be making long-term decisions on infrastructure.\u201d There was some good economic news, as the value of contracts for commercial office construction in July increased by 22% compared with June.",

      "bodyText": "House prices will fall next year as the economy weakens following the vote to leave the EU, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent has predicted. Prices will fall by 1% in 2017 after weakening in the second half of this year with all regions affected except Scotland, where prices will remain unchanged, according to Countrywide. The company, which has more than 1,500 branches, said prices would fall because of economic weakness caused by uncertainty following the referendum decision on 23 June. Prices will rise 2% this year, a slowdown from last year\u2019s rate of 6.5% and 8.5% in 2014. The housing market will be affected by declining consumer confidence, reduced household spending power and rising unemployment. Prices will start rising again towards the end of next year and into 2018, but at a modest rate of 2%. The most expensive parts of London will bear the brunt of the slowdown with most of the impact happening this year. Prices in prime central London, which includes Westminster and Kensington, will drop 6% in 2016 and stagnate next year, Countrywide said. Greater London prices will fall 1.25% next year before rising 2% in 2017, the company said. Fionnuala Earley, Countrywide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cForecasts in the current environment are trickier than ever as the vote to leave the EU has thrown up many risks. Our central view is that the economy will avoid a hard landing. However, the weaker prospects for confidence, household incomes and the labour market mean that we do expect some modest falls in house prices.\u201d She said Brexit was not the only reason prices would fall. Higher stamp duty has affected demand for expensive homes and after several years of rocketing prices people no longer expect values to keep rising at the same pace, reducing demand. Earley said her forecasts were more likely to be too optimistic than overly gloomy. But a continuing lack of property for sale and very low borrowing costs should prevent a big fall in prices and house prices have a habit of doing better than expected, she said. Signals from the housing market have been mixed since the vote to leave the UK. Countrywide and other estate agents have issued profit warnings as transactions have declined and the number of house hunters fall, the National Association of Estate Agents said last week. However, housebuilders have reported demand among potential buyers reviving after a sharp fall immediately after the referendum. Persimmon, Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder, reports half-year results on Monday. The Bank of England cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% this month with many economists predicting a further reduction to 0.1%. The Bank\u2019s action prompted lenders to cut mortgage rates yet further from fixed rate deals already close to record lows. Countrywide\u2019s prediction of a relatively modest fall in prices \u2013 back to the level in early 2016 \u2013 contrasts with gloomier analysts who argue the vote for Brexit will burst a bubble that has been building for years. Economists at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said last month London property prices could plunge by more than 30% and be slashed in half in the capital\u2019s priciest boroughs.",

This is the finding of a new paper from the Inclusive Prosperity Commission within Labor\u2019s thinktank, the Chifley Research Centre. It suggested that if no action is taken to reduce inequality, it would eventually cost Australia 3% of GDP over the next 25 years. The commission is led by Chifley Research Centre\u2019s executive director and former speechwriter to Julia Gillard, Michael Cooney, and the former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan. Amanda Robbins of Equity Economics was the principal author. The analysis found that between 2012 and 2014 Australia\u2019s income Gini index \u2013 the most common measure of income inequality \u2013 grew by 1 percentage point from 32% to 33%. The paper found: \u201cOver the next five years, this is projected to reduce the level of GDP by $13.1bn or 0.7% lower than it would otherwise have been in 2019-20. This approximately translates to a reduction of around $500 per person.\u201d The paper warned inequality will have an impact on Australia\u2019s capacity to transition from a mining economy to a more innovative, modern economy. \u201cOur \u2018order of magnitude\u2019 estimate shows that rising inequality, left unchecked, poses a serious economic risk for Australia,\u201d the paper concluded. \u201cRising inequality will reduce the pace at which the economy can grow, damaging long-term growth prospects and even worse, negating hard-won gains of successful economic policy in the past.\u201d The paper found over the long term, a one Gini point increase in inequality is estimated to reduce the level of GDP by 3%. \u201cAs a comparison, this is equivalent to wiping out the gains of the national competition policy reforms, which were estimated to have boosted GDP by 2.5%,\u201d the paper said. \u201cAnother comparison is with the stated impact of the three North-Asia FTAs (Japan, Korea, China), which are expected to raise GDP by only 0.1% over the long-term.\u201d The paper\u2019s policy prescriptions include access to quality education from early childhood, ensuring womens\u2019 return to work was financially viable through childcare and paid parental leave as well as affordable healthcare. Unsurprisingly, the paper also suggests changing the tax mix in line with Labor policies to crack down on generous tax concessions in the areas of negative gearing, capital gains and superannuation. Cooney said the new evidence showed that middle Australia was already paying a price for increased inequality. \u201cGovernments need to do more: through policies which lift wages for middle class and working class Australians and ensure people reliant on government payments have adequate incomes, and with wider health, education, housing and retirement income policy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When the shutters come down on the Barclays branch in Bexley in a fortnight\u2019s time, the south-east London suburb will be left without a high street bank. Nine customers used the branch \u201cregularly\u201d over the last 12 months without interacting with the bank in any other way, Barclays told locals as it prepared for the closure, which was delayed by six months because repairs to a local bridge hindered access to the alternative branch. It is a situation repeated across the UK, as banks scramble to save costs to bolster profits just as historic low interest rates are punishing their profitability and customers migrate to smartphones and the internet to access their accounts. In Dinas Powys, just outside Cardiff, the NatWest branch is also the last remaining on the high street \u2013 it would have closed in August if it were not for problems at the designated alternative branch. NatWest, which is owned by the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, pointed to a 56% fall in transactions at the branch since 2011. Local Plaid Cymru councillor Chris Franks said there were concerns for local business people \u2013 not just individuals \u2013 about how they can pay in cash. \u201cThe irony is not lost on people that the public purse has paid a fortune for these banks and they are now abandoning taxpayers,\u201d said Franks. RBS argues it reviews each branch on a case-by-case basis. About 1,500 communities have already been left without a bank on their high street, according to the Campaign for Community Banking Service (CCBS), which predicts an inexorable decline in the number of branches. One of the findings of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation into high street banking competition published earlier this month, was that a branch network was no longer a barrier to entry for challengers to the \u201cbig four\u201d \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. \u201cPrevious reviews have found the authorisation process for banks, the cost of IT and access to branches as barriers to entry or expansion in retail banking. We no longer find this to be the case,\u201d the CMA said. Along with Santander, the big four have closed an estimated 1,700 branches in the last five years.When bailed-out Lloyds, the owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland (HBOS), announced 200 unit closures last month it said use of branches had fallen by 15% year on year. Some new branches have appeared. Metro Bank was, in 2010, the first startup to open on high streets for more than a century and now has 41 branches. Both Lloyds and RBS were forced to carve out branch networks as a penalty from the EU for their taxpayer bailouts. The network created \u2013 TSB \u2013 is owned by Sabadell and now has 598 branches compared with 631 when it started. RBS has abandoned attempts to spin out its 300 branches of Williams &amp; Glyn and is looking for a trade buyer. However, Age UK, the charity which works with older people, is concerned. Journeys to branches are getting longer and for some older people not ready to embrace digital, there are other consequences. \u201cSmall business will also take fright of having to go long distances to a bank,\u201d a spokesman for Age UK said. That could prompt an exodus of other businesses from high streets. \u201cWe\u2019re asking [older] people to lead more independent lives in the community and then cutting it away,\u201d the Age UK spokesman said. Last year, the industry was forced to agree to a \u201cprotocol\u201d that requires them to publish impact statements with information about counter usage, regular customers and location of the nearest alternative bank, cash machine and Post Office. This is currently under review, with the outcome expected in the autumn. Nick Kennett, financial services director at the Post Office, said that when each branch closes, discussions are held about the services the Post Office can offer over its 11,500 counters. Customers of different banks at present have access to different services. He is working on a standardised service, by January, that means when each bank closes, cash withdrawals, deposit enquiries and deposit services are available for customers and small businesses to get small change. Campaigners against branch closures have long argued that branch sharing would be a solution. Derek French, who has run the CCBS since 1998, is now closing the website down. While he agrees with analysis by the consultancy CACI, cited by the CMA, that it is possible that just 600 branches will \u201cdeliver effective nationwide customer coverage in five years\u2019 time\u201d, he thinks there will still be a need for banking services through other outlets. The banks themselves argue that branches will remain. Barclays said: \u201cThe number of physical Barclays branches will reduce overall but our branch network and the colleagues who work in them remain a vital part of our offering\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The family home of Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, was on the brink of being repossessed before cash from the department store chain was used to pay off the mortgage. The Guardian has learned that financial company Amicus initiated legal proceedings against the Chappell family to repossess the property unless their debts were repaid. The debt was settled when the parent company of BHS paid out \u00a31.5m. The money came from BHS and was paid out as an interest-free loan. It has not been repaid. The saga raises further questions about Chappell\u2019s management of BHS and highlights the chaos behind the scenes as the chain headed for collapse. The last of BHS\u2019s 164 stores are scheduled to close before the end of month. The demise of BHS has led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit, which Sir Philip Green, the previous owner, has pledged to \u201csort\u201d. MPs described the corporate governance of Retail Acquisitions, the company that owned BHS, as a \u201cjoke\u201d after Chappell admitted to the parliamentary committee investigating the demise of BHS that a \u00a31.5m loan had been paid out. One of the directors of Retail Acquisitions, Eddie Parladorio, voted against the loan, with the only two votes in favour cast by Chappell and his friend Lennart Henningson. However, the MPs were unaware of the financial predicament facing the Chappells and the house at the time of the loan. Chappell told the committee that the \u00a31.5m was paid because the property, which is in Dorset, \u201cneeded to be remortgaged\u201d. Retail Acquisitions, which is 90% owned by Chappell, bought BHS from Green for \u00a31 in March 2015. The company collapsed just 13 months later, but Retail Acquisitions banked at least \u00a317m from it. The failure of BHS is being investigated by the Insolvency Service, the Financial Reporting Council and the Pensions Regulator. The Serious Fraud Office is also considering whether to launch a formal inquiry. The mortgage on the family home, where Chappell\u2019s mother and father still live, was provided by London-based lender Amicus. It is thought the loan was initially for less than \u00a31m but was gradually increased. Amicus declined to comment, citing client confidentiality. Chappell claimed he had \u201cabsolutely no idea what was going on\u201d with the property despite describing it to MPs as \u201cmy family home\u201d and the fact that the \u00a31.5m payment that settled the debt was paid from his company. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it is nothing to do with me, it is my father\u2019s property,\u201d Chappell said when asked about the loan. \u201cI have absolutely no idea what is going on there, nor do I want to know. That is as far as I am prepared to make a statement. I don\u2019t discuss finances with my father on these matters, so that is where we are.\u201d The payment of the \u00a31.5m loan from Retail Acquisitions was complex. It was paid to a company called JDM Island Properties, which had only one director and shareholder, Colin Sutton, an associate of the Chappells. JDM Island Properties then bought the Chappell family house. Filings on Companies House reveal that this month the shares in JDM passed from Sutton to Olivia Investments, a Gibraltar-based vehicle that acts as the Chappell family\u2019s investment fund.",

      "bodyText": "Swedish fashion chain H&amp;M worked with clothing factories in Myanmar where children as young as 14 toiled for more than 12 hours a day, according to a book being published in Sweden next week. \u201cThey employed anyone who wanted to work,\u201d Zu Zu, one of the girls who started work aged 14, told the authors of Modeslavar, or Fashion Slaves in English. Writers Moa K\u00e4rnstrand and Tobias Andersson Akerblom met with 15-year-old girls who were working until 10pm in breach of Myanmar\u2019s laws and the international labour convention. The girls were working for two factories, Myanmar Century Liaoyuan Knitted Wear and Myanmar Garment Wedge, both near the capital, Yangon. H&amp;M said it had taken action with both factories over ID-cards and overtime after being made aware that a group of 14- to 17-year-olds had been working long hours since 2013. However, it said in a statement: \u201cWhen 14\u2013 to 18-year-olds are working it is therefore not a case of child labour, according to international labour laws. ILO instead stresses the importance of not excluding this age group from work in Myanmar. H&amp;M does of course not tolerate child labour in any form.\u201d The revelations raise new fears about conditions in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, where British retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, Primark and New Look who have joined H&amp;M, C&amp;A, Aldi and Gap in recent years. Erinch Sahan, from Oxfam, which carried out research into working conditions in Myanmar factories last year, said the charity had not looked into child labour but had found a high prevalence of forced overtime and low pay. \u201cI am not hugely surprised these problems are happening given the scale of disempowerment of workers in Myanmar,\u201d Sahan said. Last year, the Myanmar government set a minimum wage of 3,600 kyat (\u00a32.30) for an eight-hour day, one of the lowest in the world. All of the British retailers contacted by the Guardian said they had policies in place which banned their suppliers from using child labour \u2013 classed as 14 in developing countries under International Labour Organisation (ILO) recommendations, although it says children aged 13 to 15 may do light work, as long as it does not threaten their health and safety, or hinder their education. Marks &amp; Spencer, which works with three factories in Myanmar, said its suppliers were only allowed to employ over-18s. New Look and Primark said workers in its factories had to be over 16, and all this was checked through regular visits and other measures. They all said they did not use the factories highlighted by Modeslaver. Tesco said only that it did not allow child labour. H&amp;M said: \u201cIt is of utmost importance to us that our products are made under good working conditions and with consideration to safety, health and the environment. We have therefore taken action regarding two suppliers in Myanmar which have had problems with ID-cards and overtime.\u201d The retailer added that the revelation that teenagers had been working long hours at its suppliers\u2019 factories violating international recommendations and local rules was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cAny overtime must be in accordance with legislation as well as our own demands, this is particularly important when it comes to the age group 14-18. If a supplier doesn\u2019t live up to our standards or national legislation we \u2013 in accordance with our routines \u2013 demand that the supplier immediately establishes an action plan, which has been done also in this case. One of the measures concerning the two suppliers in question is improved recruitment routines, which has resulted in improved handling of ID-cards,\u201d the H&amp;M said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "You don\u2019t have to look as far afield as Rio to find all-time records being smashed to bits in the last two weeks. The US stock market has been celebrating Team USA\u2019s string of gold medals by posting a string of new highs, having staged a decisive recovery from its \u201cBrexit\u201d swoon, after Britain voted to leave the EU in late June. The three major indices \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite \u2013 even scored new records simultaneously for the first time since 1999, the height of the dotcom boom. So why, amid all this market ebullience, do most ordinary investors feel downright glum? The problem is that though stock markets bounced back to life rapidly following the 2008 financial crisis, the typical investor waited until 2013 to return, missing out on the earliest \u2013 and biggest \u2013 parts of the post-crisis rally. Most people remain deeply wary of stocks \u2013 not surprising, after they saw the equity portion of their retirement shrink by 40% or more within a single year. A professional investor isn\u2019t worrying about needing to retire in four or five years with a much, much smaller 401k plan. He can afford a long-term view. The average woman in the street, however, is in a much different position. Not only are her savings smaller, but the collapse in interest rates \u2013 part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s repeated attempts to jump-start the economy \u2013 has left her fixed income investments yielding almost nothing. Her house, which represents a larger share of her net worth than that of a more affluent investor, may have lost value. Or at least she probably can\u2019t count on its value at the same rates as before 2008, when the housing market cratered and left only San Francisco and New York City as real estate exceptions. Her job may be less secure, as companies cut costs. Her salary, which also is more important to her financial wellbeing than her investment income, is almost certainly flat, and she pays a higher proportion of the cost of the benefits she receives. To profit from the market\u2019s record highs, she would have to be willing to take on more risk in her investment portfolio \u2013 if she has one at all \u2013 and load up on stocks. And for many Americans, that feels like it\u2019s asking too much. They probably aren\u2019t wrong. The last bull market in stocks ended brutally when the dotcom bubble burst in the spring of 2000, but it wasn\u2019t followed by a chasm opening in wealth inequality, as in the crisis of 2008. If that late-1990s boom gave birth to \u201cequity culture\u201d \u2013 the idea that stock investing can go mainstream \u2013 then the 2008 crisis may have handicapped the idea. Too few Americans have profited too little from the stock market rally, while a handful of the country\u2019s wealthiest have taken the lion\u2019s share of the profits, simply because they have the spare capital to invest. Rises in the stock market have persistently accompanied increases in income inequality from 1979 to 2011, according to a report by the St Louis Federal Reserve. Even middle-income families are less likely to expose their savings to the higher risks of the equity markets, the report concluded. And the reason those stocks have climbed? Well, it\u2019s as much due to interest rates as corporate profits. As long as bond yields are at their current basement levels, even anemic profits look attractive to investors,relative to bonds. It\u2019s growth! And bonds aren\u2019t going to be delivering that any time soon. So what else is an investor to do? As the old saying goes, in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. And that one-eyed man, right now, would be US stocks. The truth is that the stock market\u2019s records may be fragile. Corporate earnings have declined for the fifth straight quarter, and those companies that have managed to post higher profits have done so by cutting costs rather than generating higher sales. That should be bad news for stock prices, which typically trade as a multiple of a company\u2019s earnings. The only thing that\u2019s keeping the party going for now is super-cheap money, AKA low interest rates. As long as that\u2019s happening, well, the only place to park your spare cash \u2013 if you\u2019re an investor \u2013 is in stocks. But it\u2019s interesting to look at just where those investors are choosing to put their money. By far the strongest performers of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 10 sectors are the telecommunications and the utilities sectors, both crammed full of stocks that pay out big dividends to their investors every quarter. In other words, investors are flocking to the safest companies out there, and the ones that will behave the most like bonds, paying them dividends instead of interest . There just aren\u2019t very many cheap stocks left \u2013 another reason to feel gloomy as the market has hit highs. Perhaps it wouldn\u2019t matter as much if more of us had managed to capture more of the gains. But we haven\u2019t. But when this geriatric bull market eventually gives up the ghost, all of us who have any kind of investment portfolio, however small, will share the pain. The smaller our portfolios, the more significant those losses will be. Ultimately, the only thing average Americans seem able to count on is financial insecurity. Their increased productivity has gone to higher profits for corporations, and companies have paid those profits to shareholders in the form of higher stock prices, rather than to employees in the form of higher compensation. Only if that is reversed will we all be able to truly celebrate a bull market that profits everyone.",

      "bodyText": "Athletes know all about productivity. Their lives are spent eking out improvements in performance through new training methods, better diets and learning from their rivals. A personal best is productivity writ large: doing better this year than you did last. Sometimes progress is dramatic. The Olympic record in the long jump set by Jesse Owens in Berlin in 1936 lasted for 24 years. Eight years later there was another big advance. Nobody has managed to beat the Olympic-best of 8.90 metres managed by Bob Beamon in Mexico City. This year\u2019s victor in Rio, Jeff Henderson, won with a jump more than a half a metre off Beamon\u2019s record. More often, gains are slow and incremental. Athletes run a few hundredths of a second faster, throw the hammer, the shot or the javelin a few centimetres further. New technology often plays a part: it has only been possible to break the six-metre barrier in the pole vault because carbon-fibre poles are more flexible and less likely to break. Then there\u2019s the murkier side of sport. Productivity improvements are not always just the result of pumping more iron and pounding round the track: they can be achieved by the use of performance-enhancing drugs. It is notable that progress in many events has stalled since testing regimes have been tightened up. The limitations of the human body may mean that it will prove impossible to run 100 metres in less than nine seconds or long jump more than 10 metres. Productivity gains will become slower and slower until they stop altogether. Ultimately, though, it doesn\u2019t really matter that Henderson was unable to beat Beamon\u2019s (altitude-assisted) record. All he needed to do was beat the rest of the field in Rio. Seeing the medals decided in the sixth and final round was still gripping viewing. It matters a lot more that the US, Henderson\u2019s country, saw productivity not just slow but actually fall over the past year. What this means is that output per worker in 2016 is lower than it was in 2015: the world\u2019s biggest economy became less effective at producing goods and services. Falling productivity means Americans are seeing their living standards decline. The UK\u2019s recent productivity performance has been almost as dismal: output per worker grew by 0.2% in the latest 12-month period, well down on its pre-financial crisis trend of 2.3%. Historically, just as with Owens and Beamon in the long jump, there are sometimes big leaps forward. Technological advances such as the printing press, the steam engine and the internal combustion engine change societies radically and can act as the catalyst for faster productivity growth. Yet, in the decades between these paradigm shifts, progress is more incremental. Michael Pearce, global economist at Capital Economics says the rate of productivity growth has been slowing in advanced countries almost continuously since the 1960s. \u201cThere are plenty of possible reasons for this, including the fading boost to productivity from previous waves of innovation, the diminishing gains from further economic integration, and the shift of global activity away from manufacturing and towards services.\u201d The postwar period experienced a rapid spurt in productivity. In part, that was because it took time to fully exploit the technological advances of the late 19th and early 20th century. That was particularly true of Europe and Japan, where slow growth during the 1930s and the devastating impact of the second world war meant there was scope for a prolonged period of catch-up with the world leader, the US. But they couldn\u2019t keep up the blistering rate of progress. Rather like someone who is totally unfit joining a running club, they initially make rapid improvements as the pounds are shed and the legs get stronger, closing the gap with the faster athletes. But progress eventually slows. Similarly, it is still possible to squeeze productivity gains out of mature technologies but they are harder to achieve. It is more than a century since the first cars appeared on the streets, yet the auto industry is still looking for ways to make better cars more efficiently. Economies can grow even when productivity is exceptionally weak, as it has been in the years since the global recession. That\u2019s possible if the labour force expands or if people work longer hours. The problem seems to be the weakness of investment. Companies are tending to employ more labour to work with ageing capital equipment, leading to weaker productivity. Central banks have become like the dodgy coaches administering drugs to their athletes. They have found ways of making performance look better than it would otherwise be. Instead of artificial stimulants they have used ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. In theory, individual countries are not supposed to use these unconventional measures to the detriment of their rivals. Loose monetary policy is deemed to be fine if it is for domestic purposes \u2013 raising the growth rate or steering clear of deflation \u2013 but not if it is to secure a competitive advantage by driving down the currency. But everybody suspects everybody else of cheating. The Americans are convinced that the Chinese are deliberately holding down the level of the yuan in order to boost exports. The reluctance of the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is deemed, in part, to be the result of concerns about an over-strong dollar. The Japanese have openly admitted that they would like to see the yen lower. Concerns about the strength of the euro help explain why the European Central Bank is mulling the possibility of fresh stimulus measures this autumn. The Bank of England is in a different position. A cheaper pound would have been necessary at some point if the UK was ever to start closing its colossal balance of payments deficit. Brexit has delivered that depreciation without it looking like an act of beggar-thy-neighbour policy. Threadneedle Street is taking full advantage of the situation: dropping strong hints of further interest rate cuts to come is designed to ensure that the unlooked for competitive boost provided by the referendum is not dissipated. If this were the Olympics, the closest comparison would be the Devil Take the Hindmost race in the cycling omnium. There, the rider at the back of the field drops out every couple of laps, and each contestant pedals furiously to ensure it is not them. Eventually, central banks hope to create the conditions for an acceleration in productivity growth. The idea is that boosting demand will lead to better supply-side performance. That, though, is taking some time. The past few years have been a slow-bicycle race led by China, with the US the best of the developed countries. Eventually, innovation and more skilled workforces will result in higher productivity. For now, though, central banks are expending a lot of effort for less growth than in previous decades. None is close to a PB.",

      "body": "<p>Athletes know all about productivity. Their lives are spent eking out improvements in performance through new training methods, better diets and learning from their rivals. A personal best is productivity writ large: doing better this year than you did last.</p> <p>Sometimes progress is dramatic. The Olympic record in the long jump set by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDTNFhiQ8ig\">Jesse Owens </a>in Berlin in 1936 lasted for 24 years. Eight years later there was another big advance. Nobody has managed to beat the Olympic-best of 8.90 metres managed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEt_Xgg8dzc\">Bob Beamon </a>in Mexico City. This year\u2019s victor in Rio, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWX2LdlxsQ\">Jeff Henderson</a>, won with a jump more than a half a metre off Beamon\u2019s record.</p> <p>More often, gains are slow and incremental. Athletes run a few hundredths of a second faster, throw the hammer, the shot or the javelin a few centimetres further. New technology often plays a part: it has only been possible to break the six-metre barrier in the pole vault because carbon-fibre poles are more flexible and less likely to break.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the murkier side of sport. Productivity improvements are not always just the result of pumping more iron and pounding round the track: they can be achieved by the use of performance-enhancing drugs. It is notable that progress in many events has stalled since testing regimes have been tightened up.</p> <p>The limitations of the human body may mean that it will prove impossible to run 100 metres in less than nine seconds or long jump more than 10 metres. Productivity gains will become slower and slower until they stop altogether. Ultimately, though, it doesn\u2019t really matter that Henderson was unable to beat Beamon\u2019s (altitude-assisted) record. All he needed to do was beat the rest of the field in Rio. Seeing the medals decided in the sixth and final round was still gripping viewing.</p> <p>It matters a lot more that the US, Henderson\u2019s country, saw productivity not just slow but actually fall over the past year. What this means is that output per worker in 2016 is lower than it was in 2015: the world\u2019s biggest economy became less effective at producing goods and services. Falling productivity means Americans are seeing their living standards decline. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/uk-productivity-gap-widens-to-worst-level-since-records-began\">The UK\u2019s recent productivity performance has been almost as dismal</a>: output per worker grew by 0.2% in the latest 12-month period, well down on its pre-financial crisis trend of 2.3%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/aug/16/why-are-uk-workers-so-unproductive\">Why are UK workers so unproductive?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Historically, just as with Owens and Beamon in the long jump, there are sometimes big leaps forward. Technological advances such as the printing press, the steam engine and the internal combustion engine change societies radically and can act as the catalyst for faster productivity growth. Yet, in the decades between these paradigm shifts, progress is more incremental.</p> <p>Michael Pearce, global economist at Capital Economics says the rate of productivity growth has been slowing in advanced countries almost continuously since the 1960s. \u201cThere are plenty of possible reasons for this, including the fading boost to productivity from previous waves of innovation, the diminishing gains from further economic integration, and the shift of global activity away from manufacturing and towards services.\u201d</p> <p>The postwar period experienced a rapid spurt in productivity. In part, that was because it took time to fully exploit the technological advances of the late 19th and early 20th century. That was particularly true of Europe and Japan, where slow growth during the 1930s and the devastating impact of the second world war meant there was scope for a prolonged period of catch-up with the world leader, the US.<br></p> <p>But they couldn\u2019t keep up the blistering rate of progress. Rather like someone who is totally unfit joining a running club, they initially make rapid improvements as the pounds are shed and the legs get stronger, closing the gap with the faster athletes. But progress eventually slows.</p> <p>Similarly, it is still possible to squeeze productivity gains out of mature technologies but they are harder to achieve.

      "bodyText": "Almost two months after the Brexit vote, Britain\u2019s economy remains in rude health. Unemployment is at its lowest for 10 years, inflation remains low and consumer spending in July was strong. The doom-mongers who predicted a panic in the aftermath of the referendum were wrong. Even house prices have continued to rise, unaffected by the prospect of the UK being outside the EU in a couple of years\u2019 time. This is one way of looking at the recent economic data. Another is to point out that had Mark Carney and the Bank of England not recognised the danger signs, Britain would have been in dire trouble. Bank officials read the economic tea leaves and agreed that a shot of adrenaline was needed. Without extra monetary stimulus, redundancies were inevitable, the pound would tumble to parity with the dollar, sending inflation spiralling upwards, and investment was likely to plunge. House prices might have dropped by 20%, as the Treasury famously predicted, with wages slumping instead of rising sightly. Carney, a safe pair of hands as goalkeeper in his student ice hockey days, has become the ultimate economic backstop. Brexiters brush aside the counter-factual arguments, saying that the Bank\u2019s stimulus plan, which included a cut in interest rates and pumping and extra \u00a370bn into the economy, played second fiddle to the wisdom of the UK household, which has turned out to be more self-confident and far-sighted than City economists had assumed. Consumer confidence surveys were another plank of support for this view, recording a rise this month after plummeting earlier this year. But what is more likely is that consumers were in a genuine panic until they heard that their central bank was priming its big guns. Soon after, though, they noticed the letter from their mortgage company highlighting the effect of the Carney interest rate cut on their monthly bills and felt much better about the world. Almost all economic activity these days seems to be predicated on zero interest rates, easy access to cheap credit and the Bank\u2019s promise that it will do anything to maintain growth. But next year could bring further trouble. Once Article 50 is triggered and the debate about our relationship with the EU begins in earnest, concerns about trading outside the free market will resurface. City economists have predicted a 350,000 increase in unemployment over the next four years and a growth rate consistently below 2% over the same period. We know this because the Treasury published its review of economic forecasts by the City\u2019s major banks. Investment, the lifeblood for improvements to productivity and higher wages, is expected to leach away, and not just to the EU. Why, finance companies will ask themselves, should they stay in a post-Brexit London when they could be in Singapore or Hong Kong? Likewise, Ford and other manufacturers will accelerate the process \u2013 under way for years now \u2013 of taking their factories to the more compliant, low-cost destinations such as Turkey. Unable to attract investment on the basis of being connected umbilically to the EU in key areas such as carmaking, pharmaceuticals and creative digital industries, the government will turn to tax cuts and other incentives that will undermine its ability to fund welfare, healthcare and education. Donald Trump is considered by many to be the biggest threat to the global economy. This threat remains theoretical and, if the latest polls are to be believed, unlikely. Brexit is just around the corner and involves the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy leaving the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. Such a seismic event cannot avoid creating a shock and some painful after-effects. Let\u2019s hope Theresa May is as good as her word and provides a clear plan of industrial support to mitigate the worst effects of leaving the EU. Without that, Carney may be called upon to give an ailing economy another stimulus shot. At last, a real tax evasion crackdown \u2018\u2018We need to talk about tax,\u201d said Theresa May when making her pitch for Conservative leader. She promised a crackdown on both avoidance and evasion. Empty words? It seems not. Last week the Treasury published an eye-catching proposal to fine the enablers of tax avoidance. Accountants, solicitors, banks and financial advisers whose tax schemes are successfully challenged by HMRC could find themselves paying the equivalent of 100% of the tax owed. Pressure groups have been arguing for such a measure for years, as a deterrent to those who dream up schemes and collect the fees, while their clients pick up the tab from the tax office. The big four accountancy firms will have little incentive to remain in the game of advising on avoidance. Smaller outfits may move offshore. Which brings us to another key piece of legislation, proposed but not yet passed. Last March, following revelations of HSBC helping clients hide money in Switzerland, George Osborne suggested a corporate offence of failure to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion \u2013 designed to tackle the difficulty in holding companies liable for the acts of their employees. This isn\u2019t really aimed at banks, though. After crackdowns by US and German regulators, attention has shifted to a lesser-known but growing sector \u2013 trust companies. They help set up the structures,and provide nominees who act as directors, shareholders or trustees, so the real owners can remain out of sight. As we learned from the Panama Papers, these services are popular \u2013 and lucrative. In 2012, private equity group Blackstone bought one such operator, Intertrust, for \u20ac675m. It floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange for \u20ac1.3bn last year. The mere threat of corporate liability is already having the desired effect. Reports suggest trust companies, many of which have UK offices, are combing their books for likely evaders. The government should pass both pieces of enabler legislation without delay. On the up and up: rail fares Last week saw the annual rail fares revolt, as news that season ticket prices will rise by 1.9% was met with outrage from commuters, green campaigners and trade unions. Passengers, in particular, have a point. They provide the bulk of the industry\u2019s income now \u2013 \u00a38.8bn, compared with \u00a33.5bn from the state \u2013 but the railways cannot afford a fairer deal. Last year, the industry\u2019s costs rose 7% to \u00a3900m, outstripping the latest fare increase. The government, which sets the caps on fares, is thus unlikely to come to passengers\u2019 aid. The answer is not nationalisation of rail franchises, because the most expensive bit, tracks and stations, is already state-owned through Network Rail. The answer is lower costs. And that means building better relations with trade unions and reducing profligacy at Network Rail. In the meantime, there is no light at the end of the tunnel for commuters. Sugar tax policy leaves a bad taste The government\u2019s sugar tax and childhood obesity strategy has received a mixed reaction. Health experts believe it does not go far enough, while soft-drink makers believe the tax will simply hurt consumers and businesses rather than lower obesity levels. Targeting soft drinks when fruit juice, smoothies and coffees are all loaded with sugar is a mistake, they say. The most important reaction, however, was from supermarkets. They criticised the government\u2019s watered-down obesity strategy, saying that mandatory cuts to sugar levels in food were needed to ensure a level playing field and ensure genuine change. The supermarkets are often criticised for two-for-one promotions and selling snacks at the till, but they are correct here. The only way to make change happen quickly and effectively is for the government to step in. When it has done so previously, such as by pushing brands, shops and restaurants to publish nutritional information on their packaging, companies have stepped up to the mark. Unfortunately, the government has left its childhood obesity strategy vulnerable to the vagaries of capitalism and the free market. Even if responsible companies do take action, others may not, and so responsible companies will pay the price.",

The government should pass both pieces of enabler legislation without delay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d45c290e733a43c8d184facf1a191110398fc40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d45c290e733a43c8d184facf1a191110398fc40/0_10_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rail ticket prices in Britain are just going to keep rising.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rail ticket prices in Britain are just going to keep rising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>On the up and up: rail fares<br></h2> <p>Last week saw the annual rail fares revolt, as news that season ticket prices will rise by 1.9% was met with outrage from commuters, green campaigners and trade unions. Passengers, in particular, have a point. They provide the bulk of the industry\u2019s income now \u2013 \u00a38.8bn, compared with \u00a33.5bn from the state \u2013 but the railways cannot afford a fairer deal.</p> <p>Last year, the industry\u2019s costs rose 7% to \u00a3900m, outstripping the latest fare increase. The government, which sets the caps on fares, is thus unlikely to come to passengers\u2019 aid. The answer is not nationalisation of rail franchises, because the most expensive bit, tracks and stations, is already state-owned through Network Rail. The answer is lower costs. And that means building better relations with trade unions and reducing profligacy at Network Rail. In the meantime, there is no light at the end of the tunnel for commuters.</p> <h2>Sugar tax policy leaves a bad taste</h2> <p>The government\u2019s sugar tax and childhood obesity strategy has received a mixed reaction. Health experts believe it does not go far enough, while soft-drink makers believe the tax will simply hurt consumers and businesses rather than lower obesity levels.</p> <p>Targeting soft drinks when fruit juice, smoothies and coffees are all loaded with sugar is a mistake, they say.</p> <p>The most important reaction, however, was from supermarkets. They criticised the government\u2019s watered-down obesity strategy, saying that mandatory cuts to sugar levels in food were needed to ensure a level playing field and ensure genuine change.</p> <p>The supermarkets are often criticised for two-for-one promotions and selling snacks at the till, but they are correct here.</p> <p>The only way to make change happen quickly and effectively is for the government to step in. When it has done so previously, such as by pushing brands, shops and restaurants to publish nutritional information on their packaging, companies have stepped up to the mark.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the government has left its childhood obesity strategy vulnerable to the vagaries of capitalism and the free market. Even if responsible companies do take action, others may not, and so responsible companies will pay the price.</p>",

Over to you, Henry. A Brexit briefing from Britain\u2019s ad man in chief With everyone wondering what the effect of Brexit will be on business and the economy, Wednesday is a perfect time for WPP to post its half-year results. The performance of the world\u2019s biggest advertising company is a reasonable indication of whether its clients are prepared to spend. But its results will also let loose the chief executive with Britain\u2019s best contacts book, Sir Martin Sorrell. The man who transformed WPP from wire-basket maker into \u00a323bn company has turned himself from smart ad man into commentator on world affairs. Sorrell supported remaining in the EU, and at WPP\u2019s annual meeting in early June he said a vote to leave would have a serious impact on WPP\u2019s business in Europe. He also said Britain risked \u201csleepwalking into a black hole\u201d if it opted for Brexit. Britain\u2019s best-paid chief executive (\u00a370m last year) has been fairly quiet since immediately after the vote, when he delivered a scathing assessment of the Remain campaign and its failure to address the concerns of people outside a London bubble. Two months down the line, Sorrell will no doubt have some choice words about the effect on WPP and the company\u2019s clients. Is McCue a good bet for the Restaurant Group? There may not be much to say when the Restaurant Group (TRG) reports its first-half results on Friday. The owner of Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s and other chains abruptly ousted chief executive Danny Breithaupt earlier this month. Breithaupt\u2019s replacement is to be Andy McCue, the former boss of Paddy Power, but he doesn\u2019t start until 19 September. So it will be left to chairman Debbie Hewitt and finance director Barry Nightingale to present the results. Hewitt has been with the company since May 2015 but only took over as non-executive chairman in May, while Nightingale joined TRG just two months ago, in mid-June. To give Hewitt credit, the former RAC executive didn\u2019t waste much time saying goodbye to Breithaupt after sales dipped severely this year. But she will surely face questions about McCue\u2019s qualifications for the job. A former management consultant, he spent 10 years at Paddy Power, the upstart Irish bookmaker, before leaving in April after its merger with Betfair. No doubt chief executives have transferable skills, but with Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, TRG\u2019s biggest business, facing stiff competition and falling footfall at shopping centres \u2013 where many of its restaurants are based \u2013 does he have the nous to revitalise the chain?",
