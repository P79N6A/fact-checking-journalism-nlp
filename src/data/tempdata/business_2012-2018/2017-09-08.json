      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has handed \u00a343m in share bonuses to a group of nearly 2,000 permanent staff who took part in an incentive scheme launched in 2011. Mike Ashley, the majority shareholder and chief executive of the retail group, praised the \u201cmagnificent achievements and fantastic loyalty\u201d of workers who were helping the company move towards becoming the \u201cSelfridges of sport\u201d. Ashley said: \u201cThe people at Sports Direct deserve every penny of these bonuses.\u201d The company revealed the payout in a stock exchange announcement, which came days after chairman Keith Hellawell narrowly escaped being voted out by independent shareholders partly in response to poor treatment of workers under his stewardship. Only just over 53% of independent investors backed his re-election on Wednesday as Hellawell defended Sports Direct\u2019s use of zero-hours contracts and said there was no need for an independent review of its working practices. The retailer\u2019s board pledged to tackle both issues a year ago. A spokesman for Sports Direct said: \u201cIt our policy to treat all people at Sports Direct with dignity and respect and we will continue to make a positive difference.\u201d However, the generous share bonus scheme, which paid out this week, has also proved controversial as only a tiny proportion of the 29,000 people who work for Sports Direct are able to participate. Applications for the scheme are limited to those directly employed on full contracts. Those on zero-hours contracts, including the vast majority of store staff, and those employed via agencies, as are most of those who work in Sports Direct\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse at Shirebrook, cannot take part in the scheme. Sports Direct does not have a current share bonus plan for staff after a planned scheme missed its targets. The retailer said last year it would not be paying a bonus under a scheme set to mature in 2019 after underlying profits missed the company\u2019s target of \u00a3420m. The bonus plan would have paid out \u00a3200m in shares to 3,000 permanent staff if earnings doubled by 2019. The company said it is developing a replacement scheme. Sports Direct said it expects to pay other awards and incentives this year of about \u00a319m, from which both permanent and casual staff can benefit.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Billionaire Richard Desmond is poised to sell his Express and Star newspapers and celebrity magazine OK! in a \u00a3130m deal, ending a 43-year publishing career that had its roots in music and pornographic magazines. Trinity Mirror, the publisher of the Labour-supporting Daily and Sunday Mirror titles has made an offer to take control of the Brexit-backing Express titles. The National Union of Journalists immediately expressed concern about the looming deal between political opposites. \u201cThe merger of national media titles would have implications for media plurality and diversity,\u201d said S\u00e9amus Dooley, acting general secretary of the NUJ. \u201cWe would want a clear understanding of how the editorial independence of the titles will be managed.\u201d Desmond donated \u00a31m to Ukip ahead of the general election and appointed Ukip peer Lord Stevens as his deputy chairman. For Desmond, who has a fortune estimated at \u00a32.5bn just a few notches below his good friend Sir Philip Green, the sale marks the end of a publishing empire and the departure of one of the media industry\u2019s most ruthless operators. His ownership of Express newspaper titles has focused on severe cost-cutting. The number of staff has been slashed and workers\u2019 pay was frozen for nine years. He also rapidly established himself as one of Fleet Street\u2019s most controversial and outspoken proprietors of the modern era. In one colourful episode he launched a tirade against Telegraph bosses, at the time his joint venture partners in printing, involving a string of abuse and goose stepping around a boardroom. He branded the then Telegraph chief executive, Jeremy Deedes, a \u201cmiserable little piece of shit\u201d and said Germans were \u201call Nazis\u201d. The Telegraph executives were so outraged by Mr Desmond\u2019s four-letter outburst that they walked out of the meeting . Desmond then told other Express executives to sing \u201cDeutschland \u00fcber Alles\u201d and made \u201csieg heil\u201d salutes. Boardrooms have proved to be fertile ground for Desmond tirades. Another outburst included the \u201cbust up of the billionaires\u201d with Lord Alan Sugar at a meeting of TV service YouView\u2019s shareholders, which involved an expletive-laded outburst end with the exclamation \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d, stealing Sugar\u2019s catchphrase from BBC show The Apprentice. More recently he set Twitter alight after ordering a \u00a3580 bottle of wine at a lunch interview with the Financial Times \u2013 at the newspaper\u2019s expense. Desmond \u2013 a jazz drummer who co-founded the self-proclaimed \u201csuper group\u201d The RD Crusaders with The Who\u2019s Roger Daltrey \u2013 started publishing in 1974 at the age of 23 with two music titles. In 1983, he won the UK licence to publish Penthouse and then a raft of other pornographic titles, including Asian Babes and Horny Housewives. The launch of OK! in 1993 shook up the celebrity magazine world thanks to a willingness to fork out \u00a31m-plus for deals such as the exclusive on the Beckham\u2019s wedding and an interview with Michael Jackson, his then bride, Debbie Rowe, and their baby, Prince Michael Junior. The sale of Express Newspapers, which he acquired for \u00a3125m 17-years ago, will be subject to a probe by competition authorities. But it is the last publishing asset owned by Northern &amp; Shell, the parent company he controls and chairs. The deal is predicated on huge cost savings and Trinity Mirror is likely to want all editorial staff under one roof at some point. However, neither Trinity Mirror\u2019s headquarters in Canary Wharf nor Desmond\u2019s in Lower Thames Street have the necessary space. Trinity Mirror is expected to consider sharing editorial content across papers as it has done with the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, and as Desmond has done at Express Newspapers. There are also big savings to be made in areas including, commercial, finance, HR and especially printing with Desmond owning a huge operation in Luton. The loss-making magazine operation, which includes the profitable OK!, could be trimmed, with the ailing Star the most likely candidate. The two companies held talks about a potential deal over two years ago. The negotiations fizzled out, however, over disagreements about price and the pension deficit at Desmond\u2019s paper. Given the deterioration in the market since the last talks more than two years ago \u2013 and Desmond\u2019s new focus on property development \u2013 observers believe there is a good chance the deal will be done this time. \u201cThe fundamentals of the deal have been agreed,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the talks. \u201cYou don\u2019t walk away from a deal that was on the table and tell the market about a new one without having things pretty much agreed.\u201d In recent years Desmond has been shedding his media assets to focus on property development, including a \u00a31bn development of his old Westferry print works site in London\u2019s Docklands area. Last year, Desmond sold his adult TV business, including Television X and Red Hot Channels, in a management buyout that severed his last link with the adult entertainment industry that helped make his fortune. Desmond sold his adult magazine titles for some \u00a320m in 2004. In 2014, he sold Channel 5 to Viacom, the owner of channels including MTV and Nickelodeon, for \u00a3463m \u2013 having bought it four years before for \u00a3103.5m.",

      "bodyText": "Toy specialist The Entertainer said playground crazes such as fidget spinners and Fingerlings were helping it buck a downturn in the toy trade. The amount spent on toys and the number of toys sold is down sharply on last year, but The Entertainer said its like-for-like sales were running level with 2016 over the most recent six months. The squeeze on the toy industry came to the fore this week after Danish toymaker Lego announced it was cutting 1,400 jobs after suffering its first drop in sales in more than a decade. In the US it was reported that Toys R Us has hired a team of lawyers to come up with a plan to deal with its $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) debt pile. Fling for bankruptcy is said to be among the options. \u201cPeople think [toy retailers] are up the creek without a paddle but we are not,\u201d said Gary Grant, managing director of The Entertainer. \u201cIf you have got the right products there is business to be done.\u201d In the run up to the summer holidays schools started banning fidget spinners as the playground mania spilled over into the classroom. The palm-sized spinners consist of a ball bearing that sits in a three-pronged plastic device that can be flicked and spun. But their contraband status only intensified the spinners\u2019 appeal. The Entertainer has sold 500,000 of them this year. Grant said Fingerlings \u2013 pocket-sized interactive baby monkeys that cling to your finger \u2013 are now giving spinners a run for their pocket money. The retailer said it had sold 60,000 of the \u00a315 toys since the fad began. At the start of 2017 a number of high-profile toy manufacturers, including Lego, hiked prices after last year\u2019s Brexit-related devaluation of sterling pushed up the cost of imported goods. UK toy retailers rang up \u00a33.5bn of sales in 2016 but the 2% drop over the first eight months of 2017 masks a much steeper fall in physical sales, with the number of units sold dropping 11%. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted with this year\u2019s performance so far particularly having had to face into increased promotional pressure and exchange-rate fluctuations,\u201d said Grant. The 5% drop in sales reported by Lego was worse than the wider market. Grant said: \u201cLego money is being spent on other things. There has been a whole number of high-profile crazes which have been selling amazingly well. Children are buying different products.\u201d",

Fling for bankruptcy is said to be among the options.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think [toy retailers] are up the creek without a paddle but we are not,\u201d said Gary Grant, managing director of The Entertainer. \u201cIf you have got the right products there is business to be done.\u201d </p> <p>In the run up to the summer holidays schools started banning fidget spinners as the playground mania spilled over into the classroom. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/03/fidget-spinner-inventor-patent-catherine-hettinger\">palm-sized spinners </a>consist of a ball bearing that sits in a three-pronged plastic device that can be flicked and spun. But their contraband status only intensified the spinners\u2019 appeal. The Entertainer has sold 500,000 of them this year.<br></p> <p>Grant said Fingerlings \u2013 pocket-sized interactive baby monkeys that cling to your finger \u2013 are now giving spinners a run for their pocket money. The retailer said it had sold 60,000 of the \u00a315 toys since the fad began.</p> <p>At the start of 2017 a number of high-profile toy manufacturers, including Lego, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/lego-to-raise-its-prices-in-uk-from-january-sterling\">hiked prices</a> after last year\u2019s Brexit-related devaluation of sterling pushed up the cost of imported goods. UK toy retailers rang up \u00a33.5bn of sales in 2016 but the 2% drop over the first eight months of 2017 masks a much steeper fall in physical sales, with the number of units sold dropping 11%.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re delighted with this year\u2019s performance so far particularly having had to face into increased promotional pressure and exchange-rate fluctuations,\u201d said Grant. </p> <p>The 5% drop in sales reported by Lego was worse than the wider market. Grant said: \u201cLego money is being spent on other things. There has been a whole number of high-profile crazes which have been selling amazingly well. Children are buying different products.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s efforts to expand trade in goods beyond the European Union\u2019s border took a knock in July after official figures showed the UK\u2019s deficit with the rest of the world widened following a drop in exports. The deficit in the trade in goods with non-EU countries widened by \u00a32.4bn while exports to the EU grew to cut the trade gap by \u00a31.3bn. The figures were released as a new report from thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said economic growth shows signs of accelerating in the UK, albeit still at a slower pace than in recent years. Analysts had expected the fall in the pound to give a significant boost to exports with the EU and beyond, but the trend since last year\u2019s Brexit vote has shown only a gentle increase in exports and a continuing appetite for imports, despite the higher cost, leaving only a marginal improvement in the net trade position. Overall, UK exports of goods and services edged down 0.2% month on month in July and were up just 0.6% from one quarter to the next. At the same time the eurozone is showing signs of outpacing the UK as the fall in sterling fails to lift exports as much as expected. The Office for National Statistics added to the gloomy economic news with data showing that the manufacturing sector remained \u201csubdued\u201d in July and the construction industry suffered a large drop in new orders in the three months to the end of June, especially in the housebuilding sector. Manufacturers improved their output, though this only meant reducing the loss of production of 0.6% in June to 0.1% in July. The ONS said a flurry of new car models helped the motor industry recover ground lost earlier in the year. The news came as the second of the UK\u2019s new generation of aircraft carriers, HMS Prince of Wales, was officially named in a ceremony at Rosyth Naval Dockyard on Friday. Liam Fox, the trade secretary, said 90% of the suppliers for the construction of the \u00a33bn boat and its sister ship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, were based in the UK. Set against the positive picture for manufacturing, there was worse news for the construction sector. Output dipped by 1.2% in July, the fourth consecutive month of contraction, while new orders fell to the lowest level since 2014 following an 8% slump. In a damaging development for the government, housing orders were down almost 10% on a year ago with public housing the worst affected. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, described the trade, construction and manufacturing data as a \u201cmixed bag\u201d that showed the upbeat signals from some manufacturing industry surveys was starting to register in official data, though the trade and construction data \u201cpoint to a UK economy still struggling to break out of sluggish growth\u201d. ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said: \u201cManufacturing remains relatively subdued since the start of the year, though July showed the first significant monthly growth of 2017, with car production increasing partly thanks to new models rolling off the production lines. The usual period of summer maintenance of North Sea oil platforms also failed to materialise for a second month running. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 trade body, said there was some good news from the export figures, which revealed \u201crobust numbers on manufactured exports\u201d. She said: \u201cDouble-digit year-on-year growth is carrying through to the start of the second half of the year. But the need to import materials and components at the same rate means the overall deficit isn\u2019t budging.\u201d Industrial production appears to be helping to bolster GDP growth after the worst start to the year since 2012. The economy is expected to have grown by 0.4% in the three months to the end of August, according to NIESR. While that\u2019s still below the long run trend of about 0.6%, it\u2019s an improvement on the three months to the end of July, when the economy grew by just 0.2%. The mixed signals on the economy add to the conundrum facing interest rate setters at the Bank of England as they prepare to meet on Thursday. Rising inflation, hitting 2.6% in July and expected to head higher over the coming months, would usually be enough for Threadneedle Street to put up its base interest rate. But weak growth and the stuttering Brexit talks will probably convince them to stay put, according to economists. Philip Shaw, of City bank Investec, said the monetary policy committee will probably keep rates steady until 2019, while a rate hike this year is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Madonna, Rihanna and Matthew McConaughey drink it by the gallon and like it so much they bought a stake in it. Now coconut water has become the UK\u2019s fastest-growing soft drink. Annual sales have broken the \u00a3100m mark for the first time \u2013 and are forecast to quadruple over the next five years. In sheer volume terms fizzy drinks such as Coke still reign supreme, but coconut water (which really is 95% water) has been boosted by its purported benefits \u2013 from hangover cure to weight loss aid \u2013 and British consumers are lapping it up. \u201cWe thought it would be a fad. But it\u2019s taken off like crazy,\u201d says Hope Lee, drinks analyst at Euromonitor, the research firm behind the new data. Around 10bn coconuts are now harvested for drinking every year, and the UK is now the third biggest market \u2013 after the US and Brazil. Per head, London has even overtaken New York and Los Angeles as the biggest consumer in the world. The brand leading the way is Vita Coco, which is responsible for cracking open 1.5m coconuts every day. It now has nearly half the UK market and nearly a quarter of the fast-growing global market. The idea for the brand came about 13 years ago, when founders Michael Kirban and Ira Liran started talking to two Brazilian women in a New York bar. Liran asked what they missed most about Brazil. \u201cAgua de Coco,\u201d they replied. \u201cIt sounds like a joke. You know, two Jewish boys go into a bar, meet two Brazilian women and the idea for a multimillion-dollar beverage company is born. But that\u2019s pretty much how it happened,\u201d says Arthur Gallego, one of Vita Coco\u2019s directors. Having Madonna as a fan, and then as an investor \u2013 along with Demi Moore, McConaughey and Rihanna \u2013 has certainly helped fuel the drink\u2019s meteoric rise. Now PepsiCo is rumoured to be interested in acquiring the brand, which could be valued at up to $1bn (\u00a3757m). Vita Coco declined to comment. Coca-Cola is in on the act too, having acquired the UK\u2019s Innocent drinks brand which developed its own coconut water, now currently No2 in the UK. Numerous smaller players abound. C7 Brands has developed a carbonated version sold in slim \u201cRed Bull\u201d-style cans, while Cocofina says demand in Britain was so high this summer that it ran out of stock. \u201cIt was a bit of a nightmare for us, I mean we totally underestimated demand \u2013 it was such a hot summer,\u201d says Jacob Thundil, Cocofina\u2019s director. The market is developing so fast that Steve Barton, CEO of C7 Brands, believes consumers will soon start handpicking the coconut water they want from a specific geographical region, much in the same way they choose their wine. \u201cCoconuts from different countries have different taste profiles. The closer you are to the equator, the sweeter tasting the coconut waters,\u201d he says, adding that their\u2019s hails from the appropriately named Coconut Island, just north of the Mekong delta in Vietnam. The pricier coconut water brands \u2013 including market leaders Vita Coco and Innocent \u2013 get their juice straight from the coconut \u2013 with some element of pasteurisation followed by a dash of sugar for taste. Cheaper brands are made from concentrate. Gallego says Vita Coco\u2019s mission has now gone beyond coconut water. They launched a coconut milk this year, as an alternative to traditional milk, and sales of its coconut oil are growing fast. \u201cWe want to be all things coconut,\u201d he says. Mintel\u2019s global drinks analyst, Alex Beckett, says Vita Coco has become \u201cmasters of the spin\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve given coconut water this really precious, powerful health halo \u2013 it\u2019s been brilliantly pitched and marketed. The thing is, people are willing to spend a couple of quid on something if they think they\u2019re going get that quick fix,\u201d he says. Beckett says the hunt is now on for the next coconut water: \u201cYou\u2019ve got all sorts of start-ups in America buying up prickly pear farms, coffee fruit pastures, I mean everyone\u2019s desperate to find what this next coconut water will be. Cactus water, maple water, Birch water \u2013 there\u2019s even a new Spanish juice drink that actually contains 8% seawater.\u201d Sussex-based natural food wholesaler, Infinity Foods, stocks some of these new drinks but so far none of them are gaining the traction of coconut water, says sales and marketing manager Charlie Booth. \u201cEverybody is looking for the next big thing \u2013 but we sell virtually nothing when you compare it with the coconut waters \u2013 now there\u2019s a product that\u2019s completely arrived,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, let\u2019s take a look at how European markets are performing. It\u2019s a fairly mixed bag: FTSE 100: -0.4% at 7,369 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 12,306 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,107 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 21,780 Spain\u2019s IBEX: flat at 10,125 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: flat at 375 The pound has held on to gains against the dollar - boosted by stronger than expected manufacturing - and is still above $1.32. Sterling is also doing well against the euro, up 0.7% at \u20ac1.0968. The euro meanwhile is just about holding on above the $1.20 mark, but the earlier gains have eased. A flurry of data from the ONS painted a mixed picture of the UK economy in July. Manufacturing growth was stronger than expected, but construction output suffered a bigger fall than forecast. At this point, economists think UK growth will pick-up slightly in the third quarter overall, to about 0.4% from 0.3% in the second quarter. That\u2019s it for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. Have a lovely weekend, and please do join us again on Monday. AM US stock indexes are slightly lower this afternoon, as Florida braces itself for Hurricane Irma. Dow futures are down 0.3% or 58 points S&amp;P 500 futures are down 0.2% or 6 points Nasdaq futures are down 0.2% or 9 points UK growth picked up to 0.4% in the three months to August, from 0.2% in the three months to July, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The think-tank publishes its rolling three-month estimate of UK growth every month to coincide with the industrial production figures. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, said the economy was likely to grow by 0.4% in the third quarter (July to September): Service sector output as well as industrial production appears to have contributed to the uptick in GDP growth. Looking ahead into the second half of this year and beyond, we see the economy rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and a weaker pound and away from domestic demand. Household spending is likely to be weighed down by weak wage growth and investment spending held back by Brexit-related uncertainty. NIESR says that if the UK economy grows at a pace of 0.4-0.5% per quarter, the Bank of England should raise interest rates to 0.5% from 0.25% in the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile in Greece, the visiting French President, Emmanuel Macron, has been chairing a meeting of Greek and French entrepreneurs. On the second day of his two-day official trip to Athens, the focus has turned firmly to investment. Macron, who is accompanied by 40 prominent business leaders representing companies big and small, told the select gathering of bankers and industry titans that with Greece finally emerging from economic crisis, France would lead fresh efforts to invest in the country. \u201cFrance will assume the responsibility in that effort [to attract foreign investment]\u201d, he said, adding it was vital that European investors did business with EU member states such as Greece rather than \u201cthe Chinese, Americans and Koreans.\u201d French investors, long in the country, should \u201cgive new energy, new dynamism to investments in Greece. We are calling on the Europeans to invest in Greece.\u201d A former economy minister, Macron has used the visit to applaud Greek reforms under prime minister Alexis Tsipras. He has stressed that, like the leftist leader, he believes Greece is on the road to recovery and growth after seven years of recession. \u201cThe Greek economy is turning the page after seven years of crisis,\u201d said Tsipras who also attended the meeting. The pound is up 0.8% against the dollar at $1.3205, helped by July\u2019s stronger-than-expected manufacturing output growth. It is the first time the pound has made it above the $1.32 mark in five weeks. Sterling is also up 0.5% against the euro, at \u20ac1.0954 Labour MP Chuka Umunna says the latest trade figures show that Britain\u2019s membership of the single market is crucial to Britain. Commenting as a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, Umunna said: Brexiteers repeatedly argued that the upside of crashing the pound would be that we would see a major boost in British exports. But there is scant evidence of this, and Britain\u2019s trade deficit remains stubbornly high. It is also increasingly clear that any gains in manufacturing exports will not be not enough to offset the damage being done to other sectors as a result of the government\u2019s hard Brexit plans. A chink of light in today\u2019s figures is that Britain\u2019s deficit in goods trade with other EU countries has narrowed. But this just serves to underline how crucial full membership of the single market is to British jobs and the economy.\u201d Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, says this morning\u2019s UK data suggests the economy got off to a decent start at the beginning of the third quarter. (UK growth was 0.3% in the second quarter.) Based on today\u2019s numbers we are comfortably in the 0.5% ballpark for GDP growth in the third quarter, with wiggle room in both directions. The monthly services data at the end of the month are likely to be the ultimate swing factor. Trade Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit with the rest of the world was roughly unchanged in July at \u00a311.6bn The wider trade in goods and services deficit (which includes things like legal advice) was also unchanged over the month at \u00a32.9bn Exports of UK-made goods to the EU rose by \u00a31.8bn, or 4.4% in the three months to July Over the same period, exports to non-EU countries fell by \u00a31.7bn or 3.9% Industrial output Industrial production rose by 0.2% in July, following a 0.5% increase in 0.5% The manufacturing sector was the main driver of growth, with output rising 0.5% over the month thanks to more cars rolling of UK production lines. It was the first month of manufacturing growth in 2017 Mining output fell 1.2%, mainly because of a 1.4% drop in oil and gas extraction Construction output Construction output fell 0.9% in July, more sharply than the 0.2% drop predicted by economists and the fourth consecutive monthly fall The fall was mainly driven by a \u00a395m decline in private house building over the month Building of infrastructure was also a drag, dropping for a third consecutive month, by \u00a338m A third release from the ONS this morning shows that UK construction output fell by 0.9% in July, following a 0.1% fall in June. It was the fourth consecutive monthly fall, and worse than the 0.2% dip predicted by economists. A fall in house building was a main drag on the sector, doing little to ease concerns over Britain\u2019s housing shortage. UK manufacturing output grew by 0.5% in July, following zero growth in June and beating expectations of a 0.3% increase. Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said the increase was largely down to car manufacturing: Manufacturing remains relatively subdued since the start of the year, though July showed the first significant monthly growth of 2017, with car production increasing partly thanks to new models rolling off the production lines. The usual period of summer maintenance of North Sea oil platforms also failed to materialise for a second month running. A stronger-than-expected July pushed the annual rate of growth in manufacturing to 1.9% in July, from 0.6% in June. The broader measure of industrial production, which includes mining and utilities as well as manufacturing, rose by 0.2% in July. It was a slowdown compared with 0.5% growth, but bang in line with economists\u2019 expectations. Britain\u2019s reliance on trade with the EU is highlighted in the latest set of figures from the Office for National Statistics. Exports of British-made goods to the EU increased by \u00a31.8bn, or 4.4%, in the three months to July (compared with the previous three months). Exports of crude oil, machinery, and transport equipment were the main drivers. Exports to the rest of the world however fell by \u00a31.7bn, or 3.9%. Germany\u2019s trade surplus narrowed more than expected in July, as growth in imports easily outpaced export growth. The surplus dipped to \u20ac19.5bn from \u20ac21.2bn in June, after exports just scraped growth of 0.2%, but imports rose by 2.2%. It was the smallest surplus in six months. Economists were exporting exports to grow by 1.3%, and as such were forecasting a bigger trade surplus of \u20ac20.3bn. The figures suggested that Europe\u2019s largest economy could be feeling the effects of the stronger euro, which makes German-made goods more expensive abroad. Jack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics, said the data provided an early sign that GDP growth in the wider eurozone might slow in the third quarter (from 0.6% growth in the second). July\u2019s data on German trade, as well as French and Spanish industrial production, provide some early hints that eurozone GDP growth might slow at ouch in Q3.But the continued strength of activity surveys suggest that any slowdown will be small. Here is Draghi\u2019s euro headache in graph form. The euro has been rising against the dollar since the beginning of the year and is climbing further still today. A stronger euro makes exports from the eurozone more expensive in other countries, and is likely to dampen domestic inflation (because imports are cheaper). With the exception of Spain\u2019s IBEX, it\u2019s red across the board in Europe this morning, although the losses are limited so far. FTSE 100: -0.3% at 7,376 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 12,285 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 5,102 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 21,702 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,138 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 374 Before, we take a look at the equity markets, some UK corporate news. Trinity Mirror - the publisher of the Daily Mirror - is in exclusive talks to buy the Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star, which are owned by Richard Desmond\u2019s Northern &amp; Shell. The deal is thought to be worth about \u00a3130m and also includes Northern &amp; Shell\u2019s magazines, including OK!, New! and Star. Here is our full story with all the background on the deal: Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The cautious tone adopted by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, at Thursday\u2019s policy press conference failed to put off investors who piled into the euro. Instead, those buying the euro heard two things: Eurozone growth has been stronger than expected so far this year, so much so that the ECB now expects growth this year to be 2.2% - the strongest in a decade. The second thing they heard was that the ECB\u2019s governing council will \u201cprobably\u201d be ready to make a decision in October on whether to taper its \u20ac60bn a month bond-buying programme. Investors assumed this meant the programme will be scaled back to purchases of about \u20ac40bn a month from January 2018. A stronger euro is not helpful to Draghi and his colleagues at the ECB, not least because it dampens inflation which is currently at 1.3%. But a stronger euro is what they\u2019ve got, with Draghi\u2019s comments sending the euro through the \u20ac1.20 on Thursday. Those gains have continued this morning, with the euro currently up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2060, having hit an earlier high of $1.2092. That\u2019s the strongest in more than two and half years. A reminder how events unfolded on Thursday: Also coming up today is a flurry of UK data, all at 09.30: Industrial production (July) Manufacturing output (July) Trade in goods and services (July) Construction output (July)",

Investors assumed this meant the programme will be scaled back to purchases of about \u20ac40bn a month from January 2018.</p> <p>A stronger <strong>euro</strong> is not helpful to Draghi and his colleagues at the ECB, not least because it dampens inflation which is currently at 1.3%.

      "bodyText": "Tobacco campaigners are concerned that new draft proposals from the European commission for a system to prevent cigarette smuggling may let the industry in by the back door. The illicit trade in cigarettes has become a major problem worldwide. A study in 2009 by the US-based Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids estimated that 11.6% of all internationally traded cigarettes were illicit. They said that was equivalent to 657bn cigarettes a year, losing governments more than $40bn in tax revenue. The tobacco industry claims the problem is counterfeit cigarettes, but even its own data shows that the majority of illicit trade is in packs the big companies have manufactured themselves. Documents show that tobacco companies have historically been involved in smuggling their own cigarettes as a way of evading the high taxes imposed in some countries and increasing sales. Even as recently as 2014, British American Tobacco (BAT) was fined \u00a3650,000 by HM Revenue and Customs for flooding the market in Belgium, which resulted in its brands being illicitly diverted back to the UK. BAT denied complicity, saying it could not tell who would buy cigarettes at lower prices in another European country and bring them back to the UK. Under the World Health Organisation\u2019s tobacco treaty, a protocol on illicit trade was agreed in 2012, requiring among other things for all cigarette packs to have overt and covert markings to ensure they can be traced. The industry has produced its own system, called Codentify. Developed by Philip Morris International and shared with other major companies, it was then passed to a third party organisation called Inexto, which the industry says is independent even though it is run by former tobacco industry executives. The European commission\u2019s proposals say an organisation or company can be considered independent if it gets no more than 20% of its income from the tobacco industry. Campaigners say they fear this may still let the tobacco industry have control over any track and trace system. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that the EU is consulting on the regulations needed to put in place a European-wide tracking and tracing system for tobacco products, which is vital to prevent Big Tobacco from facilitating smuggling of its products. The UK, which continues to have a big problem with smuggling, must be part of such a system whatever happens with Brexit.\u201d But she said it was not clear that an organisation running the system would be completely independent of the industry under the commission\u2019s proposals. \u201cWe need to go through the draft regulations with a fine-tooth comb, but from an initial look we already have some concerns. It\u2019s possible that Codentify, Big Tobacco\u2019s tracking and tracing system, might fit the bill because it has been transferred to a third party. So it might look financially independent, despite the fact it\u2019s an industry product which is run by former tobacco company executives. For a tracking and tracing system to be fully effective it has to be truly independent of Big Tobacco \u2013 that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d The Smoke Free Partnership, an anti-tobacco NGO which has been a major campaigner on the issue in Europe, said it was very pleased the commission managed to submit its proposals on time, but it is concerned. \u201cWhat we are going to look at very specifically is the notion of independence and whether the different commercial organisations and entities will fit the bill,\u201d said Florence Berteletti, its director. \u201cThe notion of independence would be so much simpler if they had said zero links to the tobacco industry.\u201d In a statement, the partnership said: \u201cWe trust that the commission and member states will be vigilant and resist attempts by the industry to push for its own system through third parties or position itself as a partner of national authorities in the tracking and tracing of its products.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority is facing questions from MPs about whether political influence was behind proposed City rule changes that could lure the $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) float of Saudi Aramco to London. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is being asked by the chairs of two powerful Commons committees whether there were any discussions between the City watchdog and ministers ahead of the consultation on the planned changes. The FCA did not mention Aramco when it began consulting on its proposal to create a new category for firms controlled by a shareholder that is a sovereign country. But the plan was immediately seen as an attempt to lower any barriers to the $2tn Saudi oil company picking London for its stock market listing, which could boost the UK in the wake of Brexit. Major City investors warned the plans could damage London\u2019s reputation and the matter is now being raised by Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, and Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industry committee. In a joint letter, the two chairs tell Bailey: \u201cWe are interested to explore the rationale for this consultation, particularly given the concerns expressed by shareholders that these proposals would weaken protection for private investors against interference from foreign sovereign company owners.\u201d They pose seven questions for Bailey, including \u201cto what extent was the FCA aware of any interest shown by Saudi Aramco in obtaining a UK listing, and if known, how far that interest influenced the consultation?\u201d They also ask: \u201cWhat discussions did the FCA (whether at board or working level) have with ministers or officials from government departments in advance of and during the consultation, and in particular on the balance between attracting foreign investment and maintaining the integrity of the UK markets?\u201d The committees are being reformed after the July general election and are likely to be formally constituted next week. Both Morgan and Reeves said they would discuss Bailey\u2019s response with their members, signalling further scrutiny from the MPs. Saudi Arabia is planning to sell off a wide range of assets in the face of a weak oil price. The sale of a 5% stake in Aramco - probably next year \u2013 is key to the plan and could value the entire company at $2tn. The Financial Times reported on Thursday that some changes were made to parts of the economic transformation plan but that these would not affect Aramco\u2019s sell-off. London and New Year are regarded as vying for the listing and in April Theresa May and Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, visited Riyadh to meet Aramco\u2019s chief executive, Khalid al-Falih, who is also the kingdom\u2019s energy minister. The FCA proposals would enable state-owned companies to qualify for a premium listing \u2013 which has more onerous corporate governance rules and is valued by investors \u2013 but escape two key hurdles. One relates to how the company and the controlling shareholder conduct deals with each other; the second allows investors a vote on independent directors. Morgan said: \u201cThe UK has a world-class reputation for upholding strong corporate governance. The FCA must protect this reputation, especially as the City looks to remain competitive and thrive post-Brexit. Any changes mustn\u2019t dilute the protection afforded by the \u2018premium listing\u2019 brand.\u201d She said the FCA\u2019s consultation would be examined by the Treasury select committee, which she was elected to chair after the general election in July. Reeves said that while it is important for the UK to thrive after Brexit it should not be at the expense of a weaker corporate governance regime. \u201cGetting this balance right will be vital to the UK\u2019s long-term future as a key financial centre and an attractive market-place place for investors. The FCA\u2019s consultation relating to its premium listing regime raises questions about the UK\u2019s reputation for sound corporate governance.\u201d The FCA confirmed it had received the letter and that it would reply in due course. At the time of the consultation, Bailey said sovereign owners had different motivations from private sector individuals or companies. The consultation ends on 13 October.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, is usually good at reading the breezes. He is the safe-hands operator whom the former chancellor George Osborne switched from the Bank of England to inject some much-needed credibility into FCA after its various calamities. For most part, the FCA under Bailey has performed as intended. Muscular common sense and a sound grasp of markets, which are all that\u2019s really required of a financial regulator, have returned. But if Bailey wants to keep this better image for the FCA he will have to find a way to abandon the proposal to rewrite the listing rules to make it easier for Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil company, Aramco, to float in London. The investment community hates the idea and the heat on the FCA will intensify now that the chairs of the Treasury and business select committees are asking pointed questions about ministerial interference. Naturally, the FCA doesn\u2019t describe its idea as a sop to the Saudis. In its view, its work is all about updating the rules and keeping London competitive. Aramco isn\u2019t even mentioned in the paper. It\u2019s just that almost nobody else sees this as a bland technical exercise. Furious fund managers sense a bad case of a regulator planning to lower standards to suit ministers\u2019 short-term desire to persuade Aramco to float in London rather than New York. The investors\u2019 objection is straightforward: why on earth would we want to create a \u201cpremium\u201d listing category for state-owned companies while not enforcing normal investor protections? Under the FCA\u2019s proposal, the likes of Aramco would be allowed to ignore some basic principles. They would not have to get approval from outside shareholders for transactions with the state. They would not have to give independent shareholders a vote on who should serve as independent directors. There clearly could be a place for such companies in London, but you would hardly award \u201cpremium\u201d status, a label that is meant to indicate the highest governance protections. The regulatory regime would look like a pushover, which may succeed in drumming up some short-term business but could seriously damage London\u2019s status as a good place to invest. Bailey and the FCA should read the mood. Resistance to the proposal is deep and wide, and rightly so. There is room to backtrack since only a consultation paper has been issued so far. The sooner the U-turn happens, the better. What goes up must come down \u2026 surely? When the government in February lowered the Ogden rate \u2013 a discount formula used to calculate compensation payments for victims of serious injuries \u2013 from 2.5% to minus 0.75%, the chief executive of one large insurance company called the decision the worst piece of policymaking he had seen in his career. He was not a disinterested observer since the rejig threatened to cost insurers (and also the NHS, which is exposed to claims for medical errors) a lot of money in the form of substantially higher payouts to victims who need lifetime support. But he had a point. A negative Ogden rate implied recipients could expect to receive negative returns on their lump sums. Even in a low-interest world, that defied common sense. The culprit, explained Liz Truss, the justice secretary at the time, was low long-term gilt yields. Her hands were tied by a long-established formula for setting Ogden. Her successor, David Lidington, thinks his hands are freer. He proposes \u201ca new framework based on how claimants actually invest\u201d. That seems reasonable, especially if, as the government suggests, the new calculation produces a suitably conservative figure between 0% and 1%. The insurance companies, when they\u2019ve stopped celebrating, should tell us by how much car insurance premiums will fall. They screamed blue murder in February and used Ogden to justify rises in premiums, especially for young drivers. Cuts in premiums must now be seen to arrive. Two choices \u2013 one bad luck, one duff It is sweet and commendable of the fund manager Neil Woodford to apologise to his followers for his miserable investment performance of late. Most of his breed would sit in a bunker. Hiding would be tricky in Woodford\u2019s case, of course. Not only is he the most famous (rightly so) retail fund manager in the land, but he has also been at the scene of too many stock market accidents recently, notably FTSE 100 firms AstraZeneca and Provident Financial. That does require an explanation. It\u2019s just that Woodford\u2019s is odd. While conceding that heavy falls at both companies \u2013 two of his largest exposures \u2013 \u201chave not helped,\u201d he delivered a sermon about how the stock market is currently obsessed by stocks with exposure to China. That\u2019s an interesting theme (as is the statistic that just eight big stocks account for half the gains in the FTSE all share index this year) but his UK focus hardly explains the rotten run. Everybody knew AstraZeneca\u2019s shares were bound to move 10% or more, up or down, depending on the result of the Mystic lung cancer trial. As for Provident Financial, surely nobody expects a quiet life from a doorstep lender making high-interest loans. Call it one piece of bad luck and one duff, or over-aggressive, stock pick. It happens.",

      "body": "<p>Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, is usually good at reading the breezes. He is the safe-hands operator whom the former chancellor George Osborne switched from the Bank of England to inject some much-needed credibility into FCA after its various calamities. For most part, the FCA under Bailey has performed as intended. Muscular common sense and a sound grasp of markets, which are all that\u2019s really required of a financial regulator, have returned.</p> <p>But if Bailey wants to keep this better image for the FCA he will have to find a way to abandon the proposal to rewrite the listing rules to make it easier for Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil company, Aramco, to float in London. The investment community hates the idea and the heat on the FCA will intensify now that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/08/mps-to-question-city-watchdog-over-saudi-aramco-float\">the chairs of the Treasury and business select committees are asking pointed questions about ministerial interference</a>.</p> <p>Naturally, the FCA doesn\u2019t describe its idea as a sop to the Saudis. In its view, its work is all about updating the rules and keeping London competitive. Aramco isn\u2019t even mentioned in the paper. It\u2019s just that almost nobody else sees this as a bland technical exercise. Furious fund managers sense a bad case of a regulator planning to lower standards to suit ministers\u2019 short-term desire to persuade Aramco to float in London rather than New York.</p> <p>The investors\u2019 objection is straightforward: why on earth would we want to create a \u201cpremium\u201d listing category for state-owned companies while not enforcing normal investor protections?</p> <p>Under the FCA\u2019s proposal, the likes of Aramco would be allowed to ignore some basic principles. They would not have to get approval from outside shareholders for transactions with the state. They would not have to give independent shareholders a vote on who should serve as independent directors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca\">Aramco may be big, but fawning to Saudis diminishes London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There clearly could be a place for such companies in London, but you would hardly award \u201cpremium\u201d status, a label that is meant to indicate the highest governance protections. The regulatory regime would look like a pushover, which may succeed in drumming up some short-term business but could seriously damage London\u2019s status as a good place to invest.</p> <p>Bailey and the FCA should read the mood. Resistance to the proposal is deep and wide, and rightly so. There is room to backtrack since only a consultation paper has been issued so far. The sooner the U-turn happens, the better.</p> <h2>What goes up must come down \u2026 surely?</h2> <p>When the government in February <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/27/nhs-faces-new-1bn-annual-bill-after-reckless-change-to-injury-payouts\">lowered the Ogden rate</a> \u2013 a discount formula used to calculate compensation payments for victims of serious injuries \u2013 from 2.5% to minus 0.75%, the chief executive of one large insurance company called the decision the worst piece of policymaking he had seen in his career.</p> <p>He was not a disinterested observer since the rejig threatened to cost insurers (and also the NHS, which is exposed to claims for medical errors) a lot of money in the form of substantially higher payouts to victims who need lifetime support. But he had a point. A negative Ogden rate implied recipients could expect to receive negative returns on their lump sums. Even in a low-interest world, that defied common sense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/07/uk-insurance-payouts-to-shrink-uturn-ogden-rate\">UK insurance payouts to shrink after U-turn on lump sum formula</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The culprit, explained Liz Truss, the justice secretary at the time, was low long-term gilt yields. Her hands were tied by a long-established formula for setting Ogden.</p> <p>Her successor, David Lidington, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/07/uk-insurance-payouts-to-shrink-uturn-ogden-rate\">thinks his hands are freer</a>. He proposes \u201ca new framework based on how claimants actually invest\u201d. That seems reasonable, especially if, as the government suggests, the new calculation produces a suitably conservative figure between 0% and 1%.</p> <p>The insurance companies, when they\u2019ve stopped celebrating, should tell us by how much car insurance premiums will fall. They screamed blue murder in February and used Ogden to justify rises in premiums, especially for young drivers. Cuts in premiums must now be seen to arrive.</p> <h2>Two choices \u2013 one bad luck, one duff</h2> <p>It is sweet and commendable of the fund manager Neil Woodford <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR3-cyWed9E\">to apologise to his followers</a> for his miserable investment performance of late. Most of his breed would sit in a bunker. Hiding would be tricky in Woodford\u2019s case, of course. Not only is he the most famous (rightly so) retail fund manager in the land, but he has also been at the scene of too many stock market accidents recently, notably FTSE 100 firms AstraZeneca and Provident Financial. That does require an explanation.</p> <p>It\u2019s just that Woodford\u2019s is odd. While conceding that heavy falls at both companies \u2013 two of his largest exposures \u2013 \u201chave not helped,\u201d he delivered a sermon about how the stock market is currently obsessed by stocks with exposure to China. That\u2019s an interesting theme (as is the statistic that just eight big stocks account for half the gains in the FTSE all share index this year) but his UK focus hardly explains the rotten run.</p> <p>Everybody knew AstraZeneca\u2019s shares were bound to move 10% or more, up or down, depending on the result of the Mystic lung cancer trial. As for Provident Financial, surely nobody expects a quiet life from a doorstep lender making high-interest loans. Call it one piece of bad luck and one duff, or over-aggressive, stock pick. It happens.</p>",

Southern commuters have suffered delays, cancellations and repeated strikes in a long-running labour dispute over the past two years, as unions have battled planned changes to the role of conductors. Southern is run by Go-Ahead\u2019s venture with France\u2019s Keolis, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). Go-Ahead\u2019s chief executive, David Brown, said: \u201cWe apologise to our Southern passengers who have been inconvenienced for many months by disruption caused by industrial relations issues. \u201cService levels are beginning to improve, but there is still a lot of work to be done to provide the level of service we and our customers expect.\u201d Despite calls for the company to be stripped of the Southern franchise, it escaped with a \u00a313.4m fine from the Department for Transport in July, which the two parties agreed would be spent on improvements to the service, including 50 more onboard staff.

Go-Ahead lost its bid to retain the West Midlands franchise last month, which it had held for a decade through Govia.

The West Midlands franchise was won by a group comprising Dutch transport company Abellio, East Japan Railway Company and Mitsui &amp; Co, which pledged hundreds of carriages and free wifi. Go-Ahead said profits in the current financial year would be hit by slowing passenger revenues, the loss of the West Midlands franchise and recent London bus contract losses.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is locked into a \u201clow growth trajectory\u201d that will see GDP growth dip next year while the eurozone shrugs off Brexit uncertainty to stretch ahead, according to a leading business group. The British Chambers of Commerce said a squeeze on household budgets and the failure of exporters to capitalise on the low pound meant the UK was \u201ctreading water\u201d. In the latest downbeat view of Britain\u2019s prospects as the Brexit date nears, the BCC cut its growth rate forecast for 2018 to 1.2% from 1.3%. The prediction for 2019 was also lowered, to 1.4% from 1.5%. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank confirmed eurozone growth forecasts of 1.8% for 2018 and 1.7% for 2019 as the economic recovery of the single currency bloc continues. Adam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s director general, said: \u201cWhile some businesses report strong trading conditions, the UK economy as a whole is treading water, and there is no sign on the horizon of a return to healthier levels of growth.\u201d Marshall said the outlook for 2017 was slightly healthier than previously thought, with a rise in the growth forecast from 1.5% to 1.6%, driven by a moderately stronger outlook for consumer spending growth in 2017. But he said the prospect of inflation returning to 3% by the end of the year and the likelihood that it would stay above wages growth throughout 2018 meant the current strength of consumer spending would falter. \u201cOur forecast suggests that the hoped-for rebalancing of the UK economy towards investment and export is unlikely to materialise in the medium term. The rising upfront cost of doing business in the UK, the uncertainty around Brexit, and the constraints created by skills gaps and shoddy infrastructure collectively outweigh any benefit arising from the recent depreciation of sterling,\u201d he said. The situation could turn around, said Marshall, if No10 can hammer out plans for a transition deal with Brussels and the Treasury \u201cpulls out the stops\u201d to support business growth in the autumn budget with a series of commitments to infrastructure spending and extra public investment. In the meantime, export growth is being offset by the strength of demand for imports, despite the higher price of goods from abroad. Modest export growth of 3.1% this year is expected to slow to 2.9% in 2018 and 2.8% in 2019 while its import growth forecasts have been upgraded to 2.9% in 2017 from 2.5%, to 1.5% in 2018 from 1.3%, and to 2% in 2019 from 1.8%. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, said: \u201cThe changes to our growth forecast suggest that the UK economy is likely to remain on a low-growth trajectory. \u201cIt is increasingly clear that the post-EU referendum slide in the value of sterling has done more harm than good. Inflation is being driven by the sizable increases in the cost of imported raw materials over the past year, and is expected to remain a drag on consumer spending over the near term, with pay growth not expected to outpace price growth until 2019. \u201cWhile the outlook for UK exporters is for modest growth, imports are expected to grow at a faster rate than we previously forecast, with little evidence that consumers or firms are switching away from imports towards domestic alternatives despite their rising cost. \u201cAlthough there remains considerable uncertainty over the UK\u2019s growth prospects, the risks to our current outlook are to the downside. On Brexit, our forecast implicitly assumes a relatively smooth exit from the EU. A more sudden departure would be likely to trigger a far more marked weakening in economic conditions.\u201d The European Central Bank revised up its forecast for eurozone growth in 2017, to 2.2% from a previous forecast of 1.9%, which would be the strongest rate of annual growth in the single currency bloc in a decade. Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, said the 2017 growth forecast had been revised up because the economy had been stronger-than-expected in the first half of the year and was continuing to perform well. \u201cEconomic expansion, which accelerated more than expected in the first half of 2017, continues to be solid and broad-based across countries and sectors,\u201d he said at a press conference in Frankfurt, after the Bank announced its decision to leave interest rates and quantitative easing unchanged.",
