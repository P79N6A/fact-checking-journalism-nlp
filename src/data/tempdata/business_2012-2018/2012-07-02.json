      "bodyText": "We don't know each other, but I want to offer you a deal: You each give me \u00a320,000. And that's it. What do you get in return? Well, it's a fair question but I can't even promise to pay it all back. But let me assure you of this: your hard-earned cash will keep me in the style to which I'm accustomed. And that's got to be good for all of us. So I'm sure you'll agree that 20 grand is an absolute bargain. Indeed, I would call it a once-in-a-lifetime offer; only I can't promise not to come back again. You've probably guessed that the transfer I'm talking about has already happened. Each man, woman and child in Britain has already handed over \u00a319,271. And our money has gone to the banks. According to the IMF, the British stuck \u00a31.2 trillion behind the finance sector. Read that again: well over a trillion pounds in bailouts, and loans and state guarantees on bankers' trading. In just a few months, and with barely any public debate, every household subbed \u00a346,774 to the City. A sliver of that money eventually went unused; as for the remaining hundreds of billions, we have no idea just how much we'll get back \u2013 or when. There ought to be a verb for this kind of involuntary donation. For true accuracy, it should only come in the passive voice. We could call it: to be bankered. \"What happened to the British in the early 21st century?\", a future historian will ask. \"Poor sods,\" her colleague might reply. \"I'm afraid they got totally bankered\". Twenty grand each is the sum I've looked out for in the coverage of the latest banking scandal; in vain, of course. But what gives this latest market-rigging story such force is that it was carried out by a financial system that taxpayers were bankered into near-penury to prop up. And we did so in the belief that saving banks was vital to the public interest. But you haven't heard much about the public interest in what will inevitably be dubbed the Lie-bor scam. Instead, the political and media industries have typically treated the rogue bankers as a tale of personal greed or market failure. So it is that the Daily Mail calls for market-rigging bankers to be banged up. That David Cameron and George Osborne talk up the need for an investigation of how benchmark lending rates are set. As for Ed Miliband, he'll doubtless carry on seeking an inquiry into \"the culture of banking\" with the same manner he always affects when discussing capitalist crisis: looking like a faintly peeved vicar who has just leafed through the Financial Times and discovered that Bad Things are happening in the cosmos. All of these demands are partly justified \u2013 and all ultimately miss the point. Where they are obviously right is in recognising that what's come out in the last few days really is a scandal. Through tampering with lending rates, financiers at Barclays and elsewhere distorted everything from how much home-owners paid on their tracker mortgages to the deals struck by pension funds purely to pump up bank profit margins and their own bonuses. The lawsuits for Barclays alone are likely to cost billions. Against that, the punishment meted out to Bob Diamond's company barely figures. The \u00a3290m fine slapped on it by regulators is tax-deductible, making it equivalent to just 13 days' profit. In any case, the bill will be paid by shareholders, rather than traders or senior management. Even today's chucking overboard of chairman Marcus Agius smacks of a firm doing the least it can, and hoping it doesn't have to do any more. Not a hint yet of any punishment for Trader C and Manager E and the rest of the millionaire looters pinging around those internal emails. They cling on to their bonuses and their anonymity, which means they can carry on taking telephone-number salaries in the City. But it's here that the various stories can't be contained in their respective boxes. The Mail's scapegoating of Cap'n Bob and the Bollinger crew doesn't fit with officials' warnings that this particular mess will not stop at Barclays or RBS \u2013 but will grow bigger by the week. Likewise, you can see why Cameron and Osborne would want to contain any fallout from this crisis, which is why they formally announced today an independent inquiry into the way in which Libor is fixed, alongside a more nebulous inquiry into industry standards. About time, too. Yet market manipulation is only the most jaw-dropping example of the corporate rampaging that caused the financial crisis. Early in the crisis, politicians, regulators and commentators discussed this recklessness as being largely about the selling of dodgy assets to other consenting financiers. But as time has gone by what's become clearer is that British banks have behaved in just as predatory a fashion whether dealing with the vulnerable or powerful. Into the first category fall family butchers, high-street electrical shops and up to 28,000 other small businesses who, it was officially ruled last week, had been force-fed over-complex and expensive financial products. So too do the individual account-holders who were mis-sold billions in insurance they didn't need and which hardly ever paid out. As for the second category, well, even ministers aren't above the occasional poke in the eye; earlier this year Barclays was forced to close two tax-avoidance schemes worth at least \u00a3500m. That time, Diamond didn't offer to forfeit his bonus \u2013 but shot off a missive to MPs about the \"unnecessary damage ... placed on Barclays' reputation\". So in a sequence of events reminiscent of the Wall Street crash of 1929, the same industry that brought you a financial crisis, a double-dip recession and the greatest economic misery in decades is now vomiting up scandal after scandal. Shot through these iniquities is a high-handed sense of being above the law. It's obvious in the blatancy with which Barclays went about rigging interest rates even at the height of the crisis while taxpayers were bailing it out with subsidies and guarantees. And it's here that Miliband's explanation runs out of road, too. Because this isn't just an everyday story of ordinary banking folk constantly hatching schemes to pervert markets, morality and the course of justice. In his call for a public inquiry, the Labour leader is desperate to restrict the role of politicians in the financial boom and bust to a mere walk-on part. But in the Libor scandal and elsewhere, the real picture is of an industry allowed to run riot by their regulators and governments. As far back as 2008, the Wall Street Journal was running front-page pieces, beginning: \"Major banks are contributing to the erratic behaviour of a crucial global lending benchmark\". Yet neither the British Bankers' Association (which is in charge of setting Libor), nor any state regulator stepped in. More than that, the Financial Service Authority (FSA) report last week referred to \"a telephone conversation between a senior individual at Barclays and the Bank of England during which the external perceptions of Barclays' Libor submissions were discussed.\" As the conversation was relayed through Barclays, the FSA observes, staff \"believed mistakenly\" that they had the thumbs up from Threadneedle Street to carry on lying. Expect that statement to be prodded and poked in coming days. But what's clear is that politicians of both major parties sanctioned, even encouraged, the recklessness of the banks. Just a few months before Northern Rock fell over, Gordon Brown told financiers, \"This is an era that history will record as a new golden age for the City of London.\" In 2006, Ed Balls, then-City minister declared, \"Nothing should be done to put at risk a light-touch, risk-based regulatory regime.\" Such hostages to fortune surely explain why the two Eds would rather focus the spotlight on the City than widen it out to take in Downing Street. Yet Labour ministers are not the only culpable parties. Last December Cameron stormed out of a Brussels summit that threatened to put extra restrictions on the City. He did it, he said, to protect the \"national interest\". The most generous spin you can put on this is of prime ministerial foolishness. This, you might say, just shows how far finance has convinced the British establishment that its special pleading somehow fits hand in Herm\u00e8s glove with the national interest. Yet more than enough evidence shows that what bankers want is either no use to the rest of us, or positively harmful. Finance doesn't create jobs: in fact, the number of people directly employed by banks and others has remained almost flat at 1m. As Manchester University's Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change (Cresc) points out in its must-read analysis, After the Great Complacence, the taxes paid by finance between 2002 and 2008, during the boomiest boom in human history, came to only \u00a3193bn \u2013 and were immediately wiped out by the upfront costs of the banking bail-out. Most of all, banks fail to lend to the real economy. And I'm not just trotting out the old line about how crisis-stricken financiers aren't giving loans to recession-hit businesses. I mean that they haven't been lending to the productive part of the economy for years. In March 2008, just over three-quarters \u2013 76.2% \u2013 of all bank and building-society loans went either to other financial firms or on property for mortgages. Less than a quarter \u2013 23.8% \u2013 went to what you might call the productive part of the economy \u2013 non-financial businesses. You will be delighted to hear that things have improved in the crisis. This March, the proportions of loans taken by finance and property slumped all the way to a trifling 74.7%, while non-financial firms took a whopping 25.3%. And manufacturing got just 2.5% of all loans \u2013 even though it still makes up around 10% of the economy. Some of you might look at those figures and ask exactly how far our bankers have reformed themselves during the crisis. The rest, no doubt, are grateful for the huge and beneficial changes being made by the coalition and its \"march of the makers\". Given how far banking fails to serve our own national interest, let alone live up to its own propaganda, we need a better explanation of why politicians are so willing to give it another chance, then another chance \u2013 all with 20 grand from each British resident with no strings attached. There's the revolving door between government and the City, which enables Tony Blair to leave No 10 and be chauffeured straight into a \u00a32.5m a year part-time job with JP Morgan. Or the research I've previously cited in these pages showing how today's Tory party gets half its funding from the finance industry. Most of all there is evidence of how the City retains its stranglehold on economic policy. The same coalition government that likes to promise a \"rebalancing\" of Britain's economy is even now generating schemes to keep the banks flush with billions \u2013 but couldn't guarantee an \u00a380m loan to Sheffield Forgemasters. Or there's the fact that, nearly five years on from the collapse and subsequent nationalisation of Northern Rock, British taxpayers have still not been provided with a comprehensive review of the causes of the financial crisis. One of Barack Obama's first acts as US president was to commission the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, a 600-page document that was reviewed in the New York Review of Books as \"the most comprehensive indictment of the American financial failure that has yet been made\". What's the nearest British equivalent? The Bischoff report commissioned by Alistair Darling in the wake of the crisis, which looked into the long-term outlook for finance. Totting up the career histories of the authors of this government-sponsored review, the Cresc team calculated that three-quarters of their combined working lives had been spent either at a bank or in a closely-related field. The comparison is laughable. Without review of how the UK ended up in this mess, or reform beyond the narrowly technical proposals made by the Vickers Commission (40% of whose authors were ex-bankers), we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes again and again. Indeed, the evidence is that London is already gaining the reputation of being the SpivZone of international financial markets. At a hearing in the US last month into how JP Morgan lost up to $9bn in the UK in derivatives trading, congresswoman Carolyn Maloney commented: \"It seems to be that every big trading disaster happens in London.\" This is surely where the pressure from the Libor scandal needs to be directed. Miliband is right to demand a public inquiry. But rather than a nice, compact affair that can be swept under the ministerial carpet, any investigation needs to understand how to reform the finance sector so that crises like these don't recur; and so that banks actually work in the public interest rather than hire propagandists to pretend they do. Because in the end, financial reform is not about technicalities, but about politics: deciding what role banks should play in an economy, and what kind of economy we want. And just as the Leveson investigation has unpicked the toxic intimacy between the Murdoch empire and the political classes, so any inquiry into finance needs to expose the strength of its grip on our politics. In the wake of the Lehman's collapse of 2008, there was much talk about how the relationship between state and finance would be changed in the public interest. Those efforts were effectively killed off by the finance lobbyists and, if we're honest, the unpreparedness of progressives in Britain to seize the opportunity. The Libor scandal offers a second go at the same argument. We either have it out this time, or we run the risk of repeating 2008. Only next time, the British might need to cough more than 20 grand each. A lot more.",

      "body": "<p>We don't know each other, but I want to offer you a deal: You each give me \u00a320,000. And that's it. What do you get in return? Well, it's a fair question but I can't even promise to pay it all back. But let me assure you of this: your hard-earned cash will keep me in the style to which I'm accustomed. And that's got to be good for all of us. So I'm sure you'll agree that 20 grand is an absolute bargain. Indeed, I would call it a once-in-a-lifetime offer; only I can't promise not to come back again.</p> <p>You've probably guessed that the transfer I'm talking about has already happened. Each man, woman and child in Britain has already handed over \u00a319,271. And our money has gone to the banks.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2009/spn0921.pdf\" title=\"\">IMF</a>, the British stuck \u00a31.2 trillion behind the finance sector. Read that again: well over a trillion pounds in bailouts, and loans and state guarantees on bankers' trading.</p> <p>In just a few months, and with barely any public debate, every household subbed <a href=\"http://www.cresc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Alternative%20report%20on%20banking%20V2.pdf\" title=\"\">\u00a346,774 to the City</a>. A sliver of that money eventually went unused; as for the remaining hundreds of billions, we have no idea just how much we'll get back \u2013 or when.</p> <p>There ought to be a verb for this kind of involuntary donation. For true accuracy, it should only come in the passive voice. We could call it: to be bankered. \"What happened to the British in the early 21st century?\", a future historian will ask. \"Poor sods,\" her colleague might reply. \"I'm afraid they got totally bankered\".</p> <p>Twenty grand each is the sum I've looked out for in the coverage of the latest banking scandal; in vain, of course. But what gives this latest market-rigging story such force is that it was carried out by a financial system that taxpayers were bankered into near-penury to prop up. And we did so in the belief that saving banks was vital to the public interest.</p> <p>But you haven't heard much about the public interest in what will inevitably be dubbed the Lie-bor scam. Instead, the political and media industries have typically treated the rogue bankers as a tale of personal greed or market failure.</p> <p>So it is that the Daily Mail calls for market-rigging bankers to be banged up. That David Cameron and George Osborne talk up the need for an investigation of how benchmark <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/28/barclays-boss-bob-diamond-pressure-mounts\" title=\"\">lending rates are set</a>. As for Ed Miliband, he'll doubtless carry on seeking an inquiry into \"the culture of banking\" with the same manner he always affects when discussing capitalist crisis: looking like a faintly peeved vicar who has just leafed through the Financial Times and discovered that Bad Things are happening in the cosmos.</p> <p>All of these demands are partly justified \u2013 and all ultimately miss the point.</p> <p>Where they are obviously right is in recognising that what's come out in the last few days really is a scandal. Through tampering with lending rates, financiers at Barclays and elsewhere distorted everything from how much home-owners paid on their tracker mortgages to the deals struck by pension funds purely to pump up bank profit margins and their own bonuses. The lawsuits for Barclays alone are likely to cost billions.</p> <p>Against that, the punishment meted out to Bob Diamond's company barely figures. The \u00a3290m fine slapped on it by regulators is tax-deductible, making it equivalent to just 13 days' profit. In any case, the bill will be paid by shareholders, rather than traders or senior management. Even today's chucking overboard of chairman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/02/barclays-chairman-marcus-agius-resigns?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Marcus Agius</a> smacks of a firm doing the least it can, and hoping it doesn't have to do any more. Not a hint yet of any punishment for Trader C and Manager E and the rest of the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-barclays-libor-emails-idUSBRE85Q1JY20120627\" title=\"\">millionaire looters pinging around those internal emails</a>. They cling on to their bonuses and their anonymity, which means they can carry on taking telephone-number salaries in the City.</p> <p>But it's here that the various stories can't be contained in their respective boxes. The Mail's scapegoating of Cap'n Bob and the Bollinger crew doesn't fit with officials' warnings that this particular mess will not stop at Barclays or RBS \u2013 but will grow bigger by the week.</p> <p>Likewise, you can see why Cameron and Osborne would want to contain any fallout from this crisis, which is why they formally announced today an independent inquiry into the way in which Libor is fixed, alongside a more nebulous inquiry into industry standards.</p> <p>About time, too. Yet market manipulation is only the most jaw-dropping example of the corporate rampaging that caused the financial crisis.</p> <p>Early in the crisis, politicians, regulators and commentators discussed this recklessness as being largely about the selling of dodgy assets to other consenting financiers. But as time has gone by what's become clearer is that British banks have behaved in just as predatory a fashion whether dealing with the vulnerable or powerful.</p> <p>Into the first category fall family butchers, high-street electrical shops and up to 28,000 other small businesses who, it was officially ruled last week, had been force-fed over-complex and expensive financial products. So too do the individual account-holders who were mis-sold billions in insurance they didn't need and which hardly ever paid out. As for the second category, well, even ministers aren't above the occasional poke in the eye; earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/28/barclays-confirms-tax-avoidance-scheme-shut\" title=\"\">Barclays was forced to close two tax-avoidance schemes</a> worth at least \u00a3500m. That time, Diamond didn't offer to forfeit his bonus \u2013 but shot off a missive to MPs about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/28/barclays-bob-diamond-tax-avoidance-schemes\" title=\"\">\"unnecessary damage ... placed on Barclays' reputation\"</a>.</p> <p>So in a sequence of events reminiscent of the Wall Street crash of 1929, the same industry that brought you a financial crisis, a double-dip recession and the greatest economic misery in decades is now vomiting up scandal after scandal.</p> <p>Shot through these iniquities is a high-handed sense of being above the law. It's obvious in the blatancy with which Barclays went about rigging interest rates even at the height of the crisis while taxpayers were bailing it out with subsidies and guarantees.</p> <p>And it's here that Miliband's explanation runs out of road, too. Because this isn't just an everyday story of ordinary banking folk constantly hatching schemes to pervert markets, morality and the course of justice. In his call for a public inquiry, the Labour leader is desperate to restrict the role of politicians in the financial boom and bust to a mere walk-on part. But in the Libor scandal and elsewhere, the real picture is of an industry allowed to run riot by their regulators and governments.</p> <p>As far back as 2008, the Wall Street Journal was running <a href=\"http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2012-07-02/wsj-archives-libor-2008\" title=\"\">front-page pieces</a>, beginning: \"Major banks are contributing to the erratic behaviour of a crucial global lending benchmark\". Yet neither the British Bankers' Association (which is in charge of setting Libor), nor any state regulator stepped in. More than that, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18665080\" title=\"\">Financial Service Authority (FSA) report</a> last week referred to \"a telephone conversation between a senior individual at Barclays and the Bank of England during which the external perceptions of Barclays' Libor submissions were discussed.\" As the conversation was relayed through Barclays, the FSA observes, staff \"believed mistakenly\" that they had the thumbs up from Threadneedle Street to carry on lying.</p> <p>Expect that statement to be prodded and poked in coming days. But what's clear is that politicians of both major parties sanctioned, even encouraged, the recklessness of the banks. Just a few months before Northern Rock fell over, Gordon Brown told financiers, \"This is an era that history will record as a new golden age for the City of London.\" In 2006, Ed Balls, then-City minister declared, \"Nothing should be done to put at risk a light-touch, risk-based regulatory regime.\"</p> <p>Such hostages to fortune surely explain why the two Eds would rather focus the spotlight on the City than widen it out to take in Downing Street.</p> <p>Yet Labour ministers are not the only culpable parties. Last December Cameron stormed out of a Brussels summit that threatened to put extra restrictions on the City. He did it, he said, to protect the \"national interest\".</p> <p>The most generous spin you can put on this is of prime ministerial foolishness. This, you might say, just shows how far finance has convinced the British establishment that its special pleading somehow fits hand in Herm\u00e8s glove with the national interest.</p> <p>Yet more than enough evidence shows that what bankers want is either no use to the rest of us, or positively harmful. Finance doesn't create jobs: in fact, the number of people directly employed by banks and others has remained almost flat at 1m. As Manchester University's Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change (Cresc) points out in its must-read analysis, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/After-Great-Complacence-Financial-Politics/dp/0199589089\" title=\"\">After the Great Complacence</a>, the taxes paid by finance between 2002 and 2008, during the boomiest boom in human history, came to only \u00a3193bn \u2013 and were immediately wiped out by the upfront costs of the banking bail-out.</p> <p>Most of all, banks fail to lend to the real economy. And I'm not just trotting out the old line about how crisis-stricken financiers aren't giving loans to recession-hit businesses. I mean that they haven't been lending to the productive part of the economy for years.</p> <p>In March 2008, just over three-quarters \u2013 76.2% \u2013 of all bank and building-society loans went either to other financial firms or on property for mortgages. Less than a quarter \u2013 23.8% \u2013 went to what you might call the productive part of the economy \u2013 non-financial businesses.</p> <p>You will be delighted to hear that things have improved in the crisis. This March, the proportions of loans taken by finance and property slumped all the way to a trifling 74.7%, while non-financial firms took a whopping 25.3%. And manufacturing got just 2.5% of all loans \u2013 even though it still makes up around 10% of the economy.</p> <p>Some of you might look at those figures and ask exactly how far our bankers have reformed themselves during the crisis. The rest, no doubt, are grateful for the huge and beneficial changes being made by the coalition and its \"march of the makers\".</p> <p>Given how far banking fails to serve our own national interest, let alone live up to its own propaganda, we need a better explanation of why politicians are so willing to give it another chance, then another chance \u2013 all with 20 grand from each British resident with no strings attached.</p> <p>There's the revolving door between government and the City, which enables Tony Blair to leave No 10 and be chauffeured straight into a \u00a32.5m a year part-time job with JP Morgan. Or the research I've previously cited in these pages showing how today's Tory party gets half its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/30/city-conservatives-donations\" title=\"\">funding from the finance industry</a>.</p> <p>Most of all there is evidence of how the City retains its stranglehold on economic policy. The same coalition government that likes to promise a \"rebalancing\" of Britain's economy is even now generating schemes to keep the banks flush with billions \u2013 but couldn't guarantee an \u00a380m loan to Sheffield Forgemasters.</p> <p>Or there's the fact that, nearly five years on from the collapse and subsequent nationalisation of Northern Rock, British taxpayers have still not been provided with a comprehensive review of the causes of the financial crisis. One of Barack Obama's first acts as US president was to commission the <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/apr/28/wall-street-leviathan/?pagination=false\" title=\"\">Financial Crisis Inquiry Report</a>, a 600-page document that was reviewed in the New York Review of Books as \"the most comprehensive indictment of the American financial failure that has yet been made\". What's the nearest British equivalent? The Bischoff report commissioned by Alistair Darling in the wake of the crisis, which looked into the long-term outlook for finance. Totting up the career histories of the authors of this government-sponsored review, the Cresc team calculated that three-quarters of their combined working lives had been spent either at a bank or in a closely-related field.</p> <p>The comparison is laughable. Without review of how the UK ended up in this mess, or reform beyond the narrowly technical proposals made by the Vickers Commission (40% of whose authors were ex-bankers), we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes again and again. Indeed, the evidence is that London is already gaining the reputation of being the SpivZone of international financial markets. At a hearing in the US last month into how JP Morgan lost up to $9bn in the UK in derivatives trading, congresswoman Carolyn Maloney commented: \"It seems to be that every big trading disaster happens in London.\"</p> <p>This is surely where the pressure from the Libor scandal needs to be directed. Miliband is right to demand a public inquiry. But rather than a nice, compact affair that can be swept under the ministerial carpet, any investigation needs to understand how to reform the finance sector so that crises like these don't recur; and so that banks actually work in the public interest rather than hire propagandists to pretend they do. Because in the end, financial reform is not about technicalities, but about politics: deciding what role banks should play in an economy, and what kind of economy we want.</p> <p>And just as the Leveson investigation has unpicked the toxic intimacy between the Murdoch empire and the political classes, so any inquiry into finance needs to expose the strength of its grip on our politics.</p> <p>In the wake of the Lehman's collapse of 2008, there was much talk about how the relationship between state and finance would be changed in the public interest. Those efforts were effectively killed off by the finance lobbyists and, if we're honest, the unpreparedness of progressives in Britain to seize the opportunity. The Libor scandal offers a second go at the same argument. We either have it out this time, or we run the risk of repeating 2008. Only next time, the British might need to cough more than 20 grand each. A lot more.</p>",

Events are moving quickly. The government on Monday announced a parliamentary inquiry into the Libor scandal and Diamond appears before the Treasury select committee on Wednesday, an event that will determine his short-term future. The inquiry, led by the committee's Conservative chairman, Andrew Tyrie MP, will have until Christmas to examine \"conflicts of interest, culture and standards in the banking industry\" but the big questions for this week are: what did Diamond know about the shameful Libor practices and when?</p> <p>Remember, there were two stages to the affair. In the first, Diamond maintains that only \"a small number of people\" were involved and points out that the authorities found no evidence to implicate anybody above the level of trading desk supervisor. That account leaves open the question of why Barclays' management systems could be bypassed.</p> <p>The second stage, during the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008, is more problematic. The FSA said \"senior management\" \u2013 not named \u2014 wanted Libor submissions to be lowered to present a more flattering picture of the rate at which banks were willing to lend to Barclays.</p> <p>The twist in this part of the tale is that Diamond discussed Libor on the phone with Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England. The Bank denies that any nods or winks were given to lower the submissions. Will Diamond challenge that assertion?</p> <p>If he doesn't, he will have to explain how the \"miscommunication\" \u2013 as the FSA put it \u2013 could have arisen that Barclays was somehow allowed to fiddle its submissions. If the misunderstanding arose as a result of Diamond's phone call, what did he tell his underlings? Did he check that any instructions he gave were being followed? Was he monitoring the Libor submissions himself, which would be reasonable for a chief executive to do if the issue was deemed so important that it was talked about with Tucker?</p> <p>These are detailed questions \u2013 and Diamond's detailed answers may determine whether he follows Agius out of Barclays this week.</p>",

The inquiry, led by the committee's Conservative chairman, Andrew Tyrie MP, will have until Christmas to examine \"conflicts of interest, culture and standards in the banking industry\" but the big questions for this week are: what did Diamond know about the shameful Libor practices and when? Remember, there were two stages to the affair. In the first, Diamond maintains that only \"a small number of people\" were involved and points out that the authorities found no evidence to implicate anybody above the level of trading desk supervisor. That account leaves open the question of why Barclays' management systems could be bypassed. The second stage, during the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008, is more problematic. The FSA said \"senior management\" \u2013 not named \u2014 wanted Libor submissions to be lowered to present a more flattering picture of the rate at which banks were willing to lend to Barclays. The twist in this part of the tale is that Diamond discussed Libor on the phone with Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England. The Bank denies that any nods or winks were given to lower the submissions. Will Diamond challenge that assertion? If he doesn't, he will have to explain how the \"miscommunication\" \u2013 as the FSA put it \u2013 could have arisen that Barclays was somehow allowed to fiddle its submissions. If the misunderstanding arose as a result of Diamond's phone call, what did he tell his underlings? Did he check that any instructions he gave were being followed? Was he monitoring the Libor submissions himself, which would be reasonable for a chief executive to do if the issue was deemed so important that it was talked about with Tucker? These are detailed questions \u2013 and Diamond's detailed answers may determine whether he follows Agius out of Barclays this week.",

Several economists and business groups have spoken of their belief that banks are undermining the effectiveness of quantitative easing by hoarding the extra funds rather than lending them to small businesses and first time homebuyers. What is the point if the money fails to make its way into the real economy, they ask? Previously pro-QE lobbyists, the British Chambers of Commerce and economics consultancy Capital Economics, have argued against more. A committee of economists attached to the free market thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs have joined them. Last month the bank's monetary policy committee voted to keep QE at \u00a3325bn. This month the continued weakness of the UK economy is expected to bring a change of policy. However, sanctioning more QE could prove more controversial than just antagonising a few economists. In the midst of the Barclays Libor interest-rate fixing scandal and the City regulator's damning verdict on the mis-selling of structured insurance products to small businesses \u2013 some of which went bust as a result \u2013 ordinary voters might feel QE rewards banks for their misadventures with extra funding. An extra \u00a350bn spread across the financial services industry will make Barclays' reserves look better and improve its share price. Chief executive Bob Diamond, given more funds, will have the perfect excuse to divert some of the cash to paying himself and his traders bigger bonuses. Arguably, all the banks have been doing it for the last four years. One mantra Diamond has merrily chanted since 2007 is that his bank never went bust \u2013 unlike Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds/Halifax. How else could he justify taking almost \u00a3100m out of the bank since then?

      "standfirst": "Investors shrug off disappointing global manufacturing data to push index to best level since start of May", 
      "body": "<p>As markets moved higher again, still basking in the positive mood which following last week's European summit, one of the day's big risers was<strong> Soco International.</strong></p> <p>The oil explorer and producer rose 20p to 309.4p - a near 7% increase - after it paid $95m to take full control of a key asset in Vietnam. It has bought the 20% minority interest in Soco Vietnam from Lizeroux Oil &amp; Gas, at what it said was an attractive price compared to other deals done in the country. The business includes stakes in the Ca Ngu Vang and Te Giac Trang fields, with a second production platform at the latter expected to start in the middle of this month or early August.</p> <p>The deal needs shareholder approval since Lizerouz's major shareholder is Hai Hoang Nguyen, who is also a director of Soco Vietnam. Analysts at N+1 Brewin said:</p> <blockquote> We see the deal as good value for the company, while also giving it complete control over its flagship assets. Furthermore, the deal provides a solid underpinning for the value in Soco's portfolio. Stripping out the minority interest and the cash consideration from our net asset value, we move our price target from 359p to 400p. We retain our buy recommendation. </blockquote> <p>RBC said:</p> <blockquote> Importantly the acquisition will enable Soco to assume complete management control of Soco Vietnam; the deal could also been seen as a sensible tidy up ahead of any potential sale of Soco Vietnam. <br> </blockquote> <p>Numis was also positive, and pointed out that Soco could be a potential bid target, but perhaps not immediately:</p> <blockquote> We recognise that Soco's concentrated Vietnamese resource base may be of interest to a strategic buyer, however, we believe a potential acquirer is likely to wait until there is greater certainty on TGT production potential, ultimate recoverability and is likely to use a more conservative oil price assumption than Numis forecast long term $100 a Brent barrel. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 69.49 points higher at 5640.64 - its best close since 4 May - on continuing optimism following last week's EU summit, which agreed to provide support to struggling Spain and Italy. A number of disappointing PMI manufacturing indices from China, Europe, the UK and - especially - the US took some of the shine off shares, but prompted talk of more economic stimulus to boost the global economy.</p> <p>Banks were among the gainers. <strong>Barclays</strong> added 5.55p to 168.4p after chairman Marcus Agius announced he was stepping down in the wake of the libor-fixing scandal, a move which seemed to ease some of the pressure on chief executive Bob Diamond for the moment. Other banks also moved higher, with <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rising 3.7p to 219p and <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> ending 0.385p to 31.485p.</p> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> added 29p to \u00a328.82, after it partnered with US group Bristol-Squibb Myers to pay around $7bn for diabetes specialist Amylin. Bristol will buy the business, and Astra will then make a $3.4bn contribution to the deal. In return Amylin's products and portfolio will be shared between the two.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> rose 25p to \u00a314.72. The company has agreed to pay a total of $3bn to settle a US government investigation into its marketing practices for nine products. The treatments included Paxil, Wellbutrin and Avandia, where Glaxo also pleaded guilty to misdemeanor violations. The company said the costs of the settlement were covered by existing provisions, and added that it had made fundamental changes to its procedures in the US over the last few years.</p> <p><strong>Aviva</strong> added 10.1p to 282.7p ahead of a strategic update on Thursday, with reports suggesting it could sell or close up to 15 underperforming divisions - a quarter of its business. But analysts at Panmure Gordon said the insurer had been trying to dampen down expectations ahead of the meeting:</p> <blockquote> To date we have avoided joining in the game of trying to guess what Aviva will announce at its investor morning on Thursday 5 July. We've now thrown in the towel, but only to say that we don't expect any ground breaking announcements. We expect noises about cost reductions and greater efforts being made to execute the previously announced disposal programmes with the US and Delta Lloyd likely to be mentioned. We do not believe that it would be in shareholders' best interests for the US business to be 'given away' in a market where currently there are few, if any, buyers. </blockquote> <p><strong>BP</strong> rose 10.55p to 432.5p on hopes of a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the Gulf of Mexico disaster, ahead of any court case. At the same price Investec issued a buy recommendation on the oil group, although it cut its price target from 495p to 460p.</p> <p>Among the midcaps, <strong>Invensys</strong> was back in the bid spotlight with reports over the weekend suggesting that China South Locomotive - majority owned by the Chinese government - was in the early stages of planning a move for the UK rail signalling and process controls group. But an Invensys spokesman said the company was not currently in any talks, and its shares came off their best levels to close 3.1p higher at 225.8p.</p> <p><strong>Halfords </strong>lost 5.4p to 223.8p after Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon cut his recommendation from buy to hold and his share price from 315p to 220p. He said:</p> <blockquote> We have underestimated the weakness of Halfords' markets and this has had three implications. First, our forecasts have been too high and we have had to progressively cut them. Second, we have assumed that it would generate sufficient free cashflow to be able to maintain its dividend. Finally, we have been too optimistic on the shares' prospective performance.

      "bodyText": "As markets moved higher again, still basking in the positive mood which following last week's European summit, one of the day's big risers was Soco International. The oil explorer and producer rose 20p to 309.4p - a near 7% increase - after it paid $95m to take full control of a key asset in Vietnam. It has bought the 20% minority interest in Soco Vietnam from Lizeroux Oil &amp; Gas, at what it said was an attractive price compared to other deals done in the country. The business includes stakes in the Ca Ngu Vang and Te Giac Trang fields, with a second production platform at the latter expected to start in the middle of this month or early August. The deal needs shareholder approval since Lizerouz's major shareholder is Hai Hoang Nguyen, who is also a director of Soco Vietnam. Analysts at N+1 Brewin said: We see the deal as good value for the company, while also giving it complete control over its flagship assets. Furthermore, the deal provides a solid underpinning for the value in Soco's portfolio. Stripping out the minority interest and the cash consideration from our net asset value, we move our price target from 359p to 400p. We retain our buy recommendation. RBC said: Importantly the acquisition will enable Soco to assume complete management control of Soco Vietnam; the deal could also been seen as a sensible tidy up ahead of any potential sale of Soco Vietnam. Numis was also positive, and pointed out that Soco could be a potential bid target, but perhaps not immediately: We recognise that Soco's concentrated Vietnamese resource base may be of interest to a strategic buyer, however, we believe a potential acquirer is likely to wait until there is greater certainty on TGT production potential, ultimate recoverability and is likely to use a more conservative oil price assumption than Numis forecast long term $100 a Brent barrel. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 69.49 points higher at 5640.64 - its best close since 4 May - on continuing optimism following last week's EU summit, which agreed to provide support to struggling Spain and Italy. A number of disappointing PMI manufacturing indices from China, Europe, the UK and - especially - the US took some of the shine off shares, but prompted talk of more economic stimulus to boost the global economy. Banks were among the gainers. Barclays added 5.55p to 168.4p after chairman Marcus Agius announced he was stepping down in the wake of the libor-fixing scandal, a move which seemed to ease some of the pressure on chief executive Bob Diamond for the moment. Other banks also moved higher, with Royal Bank of Scotland rising 3.7p to 219p and Lloyds Banking Group ending 0.385p to 31.485p. AstraZeneca added 29p to \u00a328.82, after it partnered with US group Bristol-Squibb Myers to pay around $7bn for diabetes specialist Amylin. Bristol will buy the business, and Astra will then make a $3.4bn contribution to the deal. In return Amylin's products and portfolio will be shared between the two. Elsewhere GlaxoSmithKline rose 25p to \u00a314.72. The company has agreed to pay a total of $3bn to settle a US government investigation into its marketing practices for nine products. The treatments included Paxil, Wellbutrin and Avandia, where Glaxo also pleaded guilty to misdemeanor violations. The company said the costs of the settlement were covered by existing provisions, and added that it had made fundamental changes to its procedures in the US over the last few years. Aviva added 10.1p to 282.7p ahead of a strategic update on Thursday, with reports suggesting it could sell or close up to 15 underperforming divisions - a quarter of its business. But analysts at Panmure Gordon said the insurer had been trying to dampen down expectations ahead of the meeting: To date we have avoided joining in the game of trying to guess what Aviva will announce at its investor morning on Thursday 5 July. We've now thrown in the towel, but only to say that we don't expect any ground breaking announcements. We expect noises about cost reductions and greater efforts being made to execute the previously announced disposal programmes with the US and Delta Lloyd likely to be mentioned. We do not believe that it would be in shareholders' best interests for the US business to be 'given away' in a market where currently there are few, if any, buyers. BP rose 10.55p to 432.5p on hopes of a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the Gulf of Mexico disaster, ahead of any court case. At the same price Investec issued a buy recommendation on the oil group, although it cut its price target from 495p to 460p. Among the midcaps, Invensys was back in the bid spotlight with reports over the weekend suggesting that China South Locomotive - majority owned by the Chinese government - was in the early stages of planning a move for the UK rail signalling and process controls group. But an Invensys spokesman said the company was not currently in any talks, and its shares came off their best levels to close 3.1p higher at 225.8p. Halfords lost 5.4p to 223.8p after Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon cut his recommendation from buy to hold and his share price from 315p to 220p. He said: We have underestimated the weakness of Halfords' markets and this has had three implications. First, our forecasts have been too high and we have had to progressively cut them. Second, we have assumed that it would generate sufficient free cashflow to be able to maintain its dividend. Finally, we have been too optimistic on the shares' prospective performance. When it announced, with its 2012 results, that retail sales in the opening few weeks of the new financial year had been 'very disappointing', we downgraded once again. However, with a forecast for free cashflow of \u00a363m, versus the cost of its dividend at \u00a344m, we believed that the 22p payment would be maintained. However, we now do not expect that first quarter sales will be materially better than 'very disappointing', given weather patterns (April to June was the wettest on record in England and Wales) and comment from other retailers that points to a vast divergence between the winners and the losers.

      "bodyText": "US factories saw their biggest one-month drop in orders last month since the 9/11 terrorist attacks as the effects from Europe's sovereign debt crisis rippled across the Atlantic. Amid growing evidence that the battle to save the euro is now having a global impact, a key monthly snapshot of business in America showed manufacturing sliding into recession territory for the first time in three years. Shares fell on Wall Street after traders were taken aback by a gloomy report from the Institute for Supply Management in the US, which followed downbeat news earlier in the day from China and the UK as well as the 17-nation eurozone. Oil prices also fell back sharply, losing almost $2 a barrel amid concerns that weaker growth across the world economy would hit demand for energy. Analysts were particularly concerned by the sharp drop in orders for US factories last month, the main factor behind a drop in the ISM's purchasing managers' index below the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction. The ISM said the fall - which puts pressure on the Federal Reserve to take fresh steps to boost growth - from 53.5 to 49.7 was the first since the US was last in recession in 2009. With weak order books pointing to a protracted slowdown in manufacturing over the coming months, the ISM will cause concern in the White House given the importance of the economy in the close presidential election race looming between president Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney. \"The fall in June's ISM manufacturing index to below 50 is the surest sign yet that the US is catching the slowdown already underway in Europe and China\", said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. Dales said it was unlikely that the entire US economy would return to recession as a result of the slowdown in manufacturing, but said the economy's expansion in the second quarter of 2012 was likely to be consistent with an annual growth rate of less than 1%. Firms that responded to the ISM survey cited \"uncertainties\" in both China and Europe for the problems they were having securing new business.

Make no mistake the actions taken in this incident were against all of the principles we live by.</p> <p>Many have rightly stated that there are questions that we have to answer. Many of you will rightly feel the same given the impact this has had on you.</p> <p>Detailed answers will continue to come. You have my commitment on that.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we are not standing still. I was restricted from seeing the full findings until just before they were published last week. Since that time I have worked with the Executive team and the Board to determine and drive execution of the further changes we must now make.</p> <p>We can and will restore Barclays reputation to the levels that the institution and you deserve.</p> <p>First, we had to get to the bottom of what happened, why and how it happened and put in place changes to make sure that nothing like it can ever happen again at Barclays.</p> <p>It is important to bear in mind that this behaviour stopped nearly three years ago. The documents released last week represent part of an industry-wide investigation and are the result of investigations which we carried out in cooperation with three different regulatory Authorities over three years.</p> <p>Those investigations studied millions of pieces of evidence, many hours of interviews and careful review of all aspects of the behaviour under question. All of that is the result of our very close cooperation with the Authorities, which they emphasise.</p> <p>We did not wait for those investigations to be completed, however. We moved to fix issues when they were uncovered - the systems, controls and training that we now have in place around the submission of LIBOR and EURIBOR are first-class.</p> <p>We have agreed with the Authorities to have our controls related to the submission processes externally audited on a regular basis. We will also publish the results of that external audit.</p> <p>Our customers and clients are particularly concerned about the potential impact of this behaviour on them. Let me be clear: it does not matter if this was perpetrated by one individual or a handful - it was wrong.</p> <p>But we must help our customers and clients recognise that on the majority of days, no requests were made at all. Even when made, the requests were not always accepted by the submitter, and the attempted adjustments were, on average, small, typically less than one basis point.</p> <p>When the ultimate rate was affected is a complex question, especially given the role of the other banks' submissions. This helps explain why the Department of Justice concluded that the rate was affected only on \"some occasions\".</p> <p>All of that said, I appreciate that some clients will be concerned that there may be an impact on them. We are setting up a dedicated process to ensure that any client concerns can be dealt with consistently.</p> <p>Second, we have to take appropriate action against those involved.</p> <p>Of course, given the nature of the Authorities involved, the investigations were accompanied by criminal enquiries, and some of those are still underway.</p> <p>Our internal disciplinary process, which began some time ago, will be completed swiftly now that the regulatory reviews are complete. We are being thorough and robust while also ensuring that we undertake due process. We are reviewing those directly responsible and those in supervisory roles. We have the full range of tools at our disposal, from clawing back compensation to asking people to leave the bank. The Board is overseeing this entire process.</p> <p>Third, we need to continue to build an industry-leading control environment across everything that we do.</p> <p>The events revealed last week arose in large part because we did not have appropriate controls in place. Frankly, we misjudged the risk associated with the underlying activity. That must never happen again. Once we better understood the risks, we put in place the right controls and systems.</p> <p>More generally, our efforts to make our operational and functional activities more integrated and independent of the businesses are vitally important. Those will improve control and drive more consistent standards, as well as improve efficiency.</p> <p>We have much more to do here, and you can expect to hear more from the Executive team over the coming weeks.</p> <p>Fourth, and most important, we must evolve our culture to a consistently high standard.</p> <p>As I said at the start, I love Barclays. That is because of you; you make this a great place to work for me. It is my responsibility to make this is a great place to work for you.</p> <p>I do not accept the view that the behaviours revealed this week are representative of our culture. They are not.</p> <p>But I do recognise that our culture, and that of the industry overall, needs to evolve. The financial crisis revealed that banks need to revisit the basis on which they operate, and how they add value to society.</p> <p>We know that a small minority have let us down. We also know that we need to rebuild bonds of trust with the society we serve.</p> <p>We began that journey some time ago, and different businesses are at different places on it. Our efforts here are about accelerating the change that we already have underway and creating consistent standards across all of our businesses.</p> <p>In particular, we have redefined our purpose and begun to re-orient our business activities around clear principles:</p> <p>Consistently putting customers and clients' interests at the heart of everything that we do - striving to improve the service that we provide - making responsible decisions in how we manage our business; and actively managing the social and environmental impacts of what we do.</p> <p>Playing an even broader role in the communities in which we live and work through community investment programmes and the direct efforts of our colleagues.</p> <p>Supporting economic growth and job creation by operating a strong, profitable business that is focused on helping individuals, businesses, institutions and governments pursue their goals.</p> <p>We have also been pushing to create One Barclays. Some still misunderstand that to be about organisational structure. It is not. It is entirely about culture and values - we must have one consistent set of standards to guide behaviours across the entire organisation. There will be no exceptions.</p> <p>Prior to this week, all of that may have been sufficient. It is no longer. We must move further and faster to show that banks, and those who work for them, consistently operate to the highest standards of probity and honesty. Every day we are trusted with billions of pounds of our customers' money. Every day we must demonstrate that we deserve that trust.</p> <p>The burden of proof externally is now much higher. Not only do we have to continue to make the right changes to our culture, but we also have to prove to external stakeholders that we have done so.</p> <p>The Board has agreed to launch an audit of our business practices.</p> <p>This audit will be led by an independent third party reporting to Sir Michael Rake and a panel of non-executive directors.</p> <p>It will have three objectives:</p> <p>To undertake a root and branch review of all of the past practices that have been revealed as flawed since the credit crisis started and identify implications for our business practices and culture going forward; To publish a public report of its findings; To produce a new, mandatory code of conduct that will be applied across Barclays.</p> <p>We will use the output of that review to adjust our HR processes so that the standards that emerge play a material role in hiring and induction - assessment and development; and reward. That will start with executive management.</p> <p>We will establish a zero tolerance policy for any actions that harm the reputation of the bank.</p> <p>We will also put in place an enforced governance process to ensure that we comply with these standards over time.</p> <p>I am committed to ensuring that the recommendations from this review are implemented in full.</p> <p>The actions that I have laid out are by no means an exhaustive outline of the change that we need to undertake to restore Barclays reputation and standing with our stakeholders. We will learn a lot as we progress on this journey.</p> <p>All of us, most importantly me, serve our shareholders at the discretion of the Board. So their support for this plan is vital.</p> <p>In that regard, let me share a few words about our chairman, Marcus. He has shown a remarkable passion for Barclays and its people. He has been a thoughtful and supportive colleague to me in all of my roles - especially since I became chief executive last year - and for this I will always be grateful.</p> <p>As you know, he has been an outstanding leader of the Board at all times, particularly during the financial crisis, and he and his Board colleagues have had an extraordinary range and number of challenges to deal with over the past six years.</p> <p>Marcus has demonstrated hands on interest in, and practical support for, all we do with our customers and clients. In particular, he and his wife have travelled to all corners of Barclays operations to see colleagues, clients and community projects.</p> <p>In leading our Citizenship Awards each year, he has championed the extraordinary commitment of our staff to the communities in which they work, as well as their efforts inside and outside Barclays.</p> <p>Nothing is a better demonstration of these qualities than his statement today which deserves all of our respect.</p> <p>I have reviewed the actions that I set out above in detail with Marcus and the other non-executive directors. We have their full support, so it is now our responsibility to execute.</p> <p>This is a great bank; full of great people. We will emerge from this period as industry leaders in every sense of the word.</p> <p>That is my commitment to you.</p> <p>Bob</p> <p>Bob Diamond</p> <p>Chief Executive</p>", 
      "bodyText": "It has been an incredibly tough period for all of you given the nature and volume of negative comment that has come against Barclays in the past few days. It must have been particularly hard for those of you on the front-line, given our customers and clients will understandably feel that we have let them down. You need better information to help in your interactions with customers and clients - and our family and friends. Let me start by saying that I understand why the reaction has been severe. No one is more sorry, disappointed and angry about these events than I am. I am sorry because we let down the people whose trust we rely on - our customers and clients; our shareholders; our regulators; and the communities in which we live and work. I am disappointed because many of these behaviours happened on my watch. It is my responsibility to make sure that it cannot happen again. More than anything, though, I am angry because the impression has been given that the behaviour revealed in the documents last week is indicative of the culture at Barclays generally. I love Barclays, and I am proud of all of you. We all know that these events are not representative of our culture, and it is my responsibility to get to the bottom of that and resolve it. Make no mistake the actions taken in this incident were against all of the principles we live by. Many have rightly stated that there are questions that we have to answer. Many of you will rightly feel the same given the impact this has had on you. Detailed answers will continue to come. You have my commitment on that. Meanwhile, we are not standing still. I was restricted from seeing the full findings until just before they were published last week. Since that time I have worked with the Executive team and the Board to determine and drive execution of the further changes we must now make. We can and will restore Barclays reputation to the levels that the institution and you deserve. First, we had to get to the bottom of what happened, why and how it happened and put in place changes to make sure that nothing like it can ever happen again at Barclays. It is important to bear in mind that this behaviour stopped nearly three years ago. The documents released last week represent part of an industry-wide investigation and are the result of investigations which we carried out in cooperation with three different regulatory Authorities over three years. Those investigations studied millions of pieces of evidence, many hours of interviews and careful review of all aspects of the behaviour under question. All of that is the result of our very close cooperation with the Authorities, which they emphasise. We did not wait for those investigations to be completed, however. We moved to fix issues when they were uncovered - the systems, controls and training that we now have in place around the submission of LIBOR and EURIBOR are first-class. We have agreed with the Authorities to have our controls related to the submission processes externally audited on a regular basis. We will also publish the results of that external audit. Our customers and clients are particularly concerned about the potential impact of this behaviour on them. Let me be clear: it does not matter if this was perpetrated by one individual or a handful - it was wrong. But we must help our customers and clients recognise that on the majority of days, no requests were made at all. Even when made, the requests were not always accepted by the submitter, and the attempted adjustments were, on average, small, typically less than one basis point. When the ultimate rate was affected is a complex question, especially given the role of the other banks' submissions. This helps explain why the Department of Justice concluded that the rate was affected only on \"some occasions\". All of that said, I appreciate that some clients will be concerned that there may be an impact on them. We are setting up a dedicated process to ensure that any client concerns can be dealt with consistently. Second, we have to take appropriate action against those involved. Of course, given the nature of the Authorities involved, the investigations were accompanied by criminal enquiries, and some of those are still underway. Our internal disciplinary process, which began some time ago, will be completed swiftly now that the regulatory reviews are complete. We are being thorough and robust while also ensuring that we undertake due process. We are reviewing those directly responsible and those in supervisory roles. We have the full range of tools at our disposal, from clawing back compensation to asking people to leave the bank. The Board is overseeing this entire process. Third, we need to continue to build an industry-leading control environment across everything that we do. The events revealed last week arose in large part because we did not have appropriate controls in place. Frankly, we misjudged the risk associated with the underlying activity. That must never happen again. Once we better understood the risks, we put in place the right controls and systems. More generally, our efforts to make our operational and functional activities more integrated and independent of the businesses are vitally important. Those will improve control and drive more consistent standards, as well as improve efficiency. We have much more to do here, and you can expect to hear more from the Executive team over the coming weeks. Fourth, and most important, we must evolve our culture to a consistently high standard. As I said at the start, I love Barclays. That is because of you; you make this a great place to work for me. It is my responsibility to make this is a great place to work for you. I do not accept the view that the behaviours revealed this week are representative of our culture. They are not. But I do recognise that our culture, and that of the industry overall, needs to evolve. The financial crisis revealed that banks need to revisit the basis on which they operate, and how they add value to society. We know that a small minority have let us down. We also know that we need to rebuild bonds of trust with the society we serve. We began that journey some time ago, and different businesses are at different places on it. Our efforts here are about accelerating the change that we already have underway and creating consistent standards across all of our businesses. In particular, we have redefined our purpose and begun to re-orient our business activities around clear principles: Consistently putting customers and clients' interests at the heart of everything that we do - striving to improve the service that we provide - making responsible decisions in how we manage our business; and actively managing the social and environmental impacts of what we do. Playing an even broader role in the communities in which we live and work through community investment programmes and the direct efforts of our colleagues. Supporting economic growth and job creation by operating a strong, profitable business that is focused on helping individuals, businesses, institutions and governments pursue their goals. We have also been pushing to create One Barclays. Some still misunderstand that to be about organisational structure. It is not. It is entirely about culture and values - we must have one consistent set of standards to guide behaviours across the entire organisation. There will be no exceptions. Prior to this week, all of that may have been sufficient. It is no longer. We must move further and faster to show that banks, and those who work for them, consistently operate to the highest standards of probity and honesty. Every day we are trusted with billions of pounds of our customers' money. Every day we must demonstrate that we deserve that trust. The burden of proof externally is now much higher. Not only do we have to continue to make the right changes to our culture, but we also have to prove to external stakeholders that we have done so. The Board has agreed to launch an audit of our business practices. This audit will be led by an independent third party reporting to Sir Michael Rake and a panel of non-executive directors. It will have three objectives: To undertake a root and branch review of all of the past practices that have been revealed as flawed since the credit crisis started and identify implications for our business practices and culture going forward; To publish a public report of its findings; To produce a new, mandatory code of conduct that will be applied across Barclays. We will use the output of that review to adjust our HR processes so that the standards that emerge play a material role in hiring and induction - assessment and development; and reward. That will start with executive management. We will establish a zero tolerance policy for any actions that harm the reputation of the bank. We will also put in place an enforced governance process to ensure that we comply with these standards over time. I am committed to ensuring that the recommendations from this review are implemented in full. The actions that I have laid out are by no means an exhaustive outline of the change that we need to undertake to restore Barclays reputation and standing with our stakeholders. We will learn a lot as we progress on this journey. All of us, most importantly me, serve our shareholders at the discretion of the Board. So their support for this plan is vital. In that regard, let me share a few words about our chairman, Marcus. He has shown a remarkable passion for Barclays and its people. He has been a thoughtful and supportive colleague to me in all of my roles - especially since I became chief executive last year - and for this I will always be grateful. As you know, he has been an outstanding leader of the Board at all times, particularly during the financial crisis, and he and his Board colleagues have had an extraordinary range and number of challenges to deal with over the past six years. Marcus has demonstrated hands on interest in, and practical support for, all we do with our customers and clients. In particular, he and his wife have travelled to all corners of Barclays operations to see colleagues, clients and community projects. In leading our Citizenship Awards each year, he has championed the extraordinary commitment of our staff to the communities in which they work, as well as their efforts inside and outside Barclays. Nothing is a better demonstration of these qualities than his statement today which deserves all of our respect. I have reviewed the actions that I set out above in detail with Marcus and the other non-executive directors. We have their full support, so it is now our responsibility to execute. This is a great bank; full of great people. We will emerge from this period as industry leaders in every sense of the word. That is my commitment to you. Bob Bob Diamond Chief Executive",

      "bodyText": "Spain's exuberant celebrations as champions of the Euro 2012 football championships could give a boost to the country's beleaguered economy. Raj Badiani of IHS Global Insight said: \"With the World Cup [which Spain won in 2010], we saw a rather large and unexpected boost to spending. A lot of it was obviously people going to bars and restaurants and the post-victory celebrations as well. [Spanish] retail sales figures have been appalling, so any boost will be very, very welcome.\" A red-and-yellow sea of fans swept through Madrid for an all-night party on Sunday, after Spain hammered Italy with a 4-0 win, to gain their third straight international title. The festivities provided a brief distraction from the dire economic crisis that has engulfed the country, where more than half of young people are unemployed. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: \"You probably get a bit of a boost on retail sales, mainly alcohol. There may be a bit of a feelgood boost but underneath all that the problems are still there.\" Data out on Monday morning showed that Spain's manufacturing sector suffered its worst month in June for more than three years.

      "bodyText": "Ed Miliband has called on the Barclays chief, Bob Diamond, to quit after the interest rate rigging scandal, and says he intends to force a vote to secure an independent investigation into banking similar to the Leveson inquiry. Speaking on the day that Marcus Agius quit as chairman of Barclays, the Labour leader called on Diamond to follow suit as part of a general change of leadership at the top of the organisation. Admitting that the last Labour government made mistakes over bank regulation, Miliband called for an overhaul of the industry and for a code of conduct to be established for bankers. Agius quit on Monday, saying he was \"truly sorry\" for the interest rate rigging scandal which had dealt a \"devastating blow\" to the bank's reputation. Despite mounting calls for his departure, Diamond, who presided over the division where the rigging took place, showed no signs of leaving as he pledged to fully implement the findings of an independently led audit into bank practices since the financial crisis. Miliband told ITV Daybreak that Diamond had called him to \"try and give his side of the story\", but he stood firm on the need for him to go. \"If you go out and nick \u00a350 from Tesco, you are punished, at least we hope that you are punished \u2013 if you fiddle, lie, cheat to the tune of millions of pounds, you should also have the full force of the law brought against you. \"I don't think that he can carry Barclays forward, Bob Diamond, because he was there, he was actually in charge of the part of Barclays where some of these scandals took place years back and we will obviously hear what he has to say at the [Treasury] select committee on Wednesday but I really don't believe that the leadership and restoring trust in Britain's banking can be done by Bob Diamond.\" He made clear that quitting alone was not enough because that would not get to the bottom of \"what happened, who is responsible and punishing those who did wrong\". \"I want to see criminal sanctions against those who broke the law,\" he said. And instead of more \"sticking plaster solutions\", an independent inquiry similar to the Leveson one into media standards, was needed. Miliband conceded that Labour \"got it wrong\" on bank regulation while in office, but he underlined his intention to learn from those mistakes. \"I think the lack of regulation was wrong, I think it was definitely wrong and it has got to change for the future. The bankers are going to be saying: 'Don't over-regulate', and of course we have to be careful, but I think we have had enough now of sticking plaster solutions. \"The scandals of the press have led to the Leveson inquiry. Now, some people in the press don't like that but at least everybody's coming forward talking about what they are doing. And we are going to put down an amendment in parliament in the coming days \u2013 I hope to try and put forward to the government to have that inquiry [into banking].\" He added: \"I do say to David Cameron that getting everything out in the open is the best way forward and people are beginning to wonder: 'Has he got something to hide?'\" Labour is due to table an amendment on Monday to the financial services bill \u2013 currently at committee stage in the Lords \u2013 which it hopes will be debated \"at the earliest opportunity\", according to a party source. Diamond, who was in charge of Barclays Capital when the breaches took place, said Agius's decision \"deserves all of our respect\". \"I welcome the board's undertaking of an independent, third-party audit of our business practices. \"I am committed to ensuring that the recommendations from this review are implemented in full, as part of a broader programme to continue to build a culture that all of those with a stake in Barclays can be proud of.\" But John Mann, a Labour member of the Treasury select committee, said Diamond was ultimately the one who should accept responsibility. He echoed Miliband's call for the American banker to resign, saying there was no role for him if the sector was to regain its reputation. He told Sky News: \"I'm sure that Diamond will want to pay back the bonuses that he wrongly got on the back of lies, and in essence defrauding homeowners across Britain, because that's what happened. But then he must resign \u2013 he's got to go.\" Lady Patience Wheatcroft, a former Barclays director, told Sky News that Agius was \"carrying the can\" and it was inevitable that Diamond would step down. Agius is still expected to face the select committee on Thursday \u2013 irrespective of his decision to quit.",

The latest snapshot of industry from CIPS/Markit showed the pace of decline eased in June after a sharp decline in May, but that the sector was still in recession. The downbeat survey of UK purchasing managers in manufacturing \u2013 mirrored by similar findings in the rest of Europe \u2013 increases the chances that the Bank of England will try to give a further boost to growth when its nine-strong monetary policy committee meets later this week.

June's result was an improvement on the three-year low of 45.0 recorded in May and not as bad as City economists had been expecting. \"There's no denying that the second quarter as a whole is looking weaker than the first quarter,\" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at data compiler Markit. \"Manufacturing output may have contracted by at least 0.5% and therefore acting as a substantial drag on the economy for the fourth successive quarter.\" The index for new orders \u2013 a guide to the conditions UK firms will face over the coming months \u2013 stood at 47.0 last month, up from 42.0 in May but the third month in a row it has been below 50.

This has been a period of unprecedented stress and turmoil for the banking industry in particular and for the wider world economy in general. Barclays has been well served by an excellent executive team \u2013 led, first by John Varley, and now by Bob Diamond \u2013 which has worked constructively with a strong and supportive board of directors.

      "bodyText": "Barclays today announces the resignation of its chairman, Marcus Agius. The search for a successor both from within the existing board members and from outside will be led by Sir John Sunderland and will commence today. Mr Agius will remain in post until an orderly succession is assured and Sir Michael Rake has been appointed deputy chairman. Commenting, Mr Agius said: \"It has been my privilege to serve as Barclays chairman for the past six years. This has been a period of unprecedented stress and turmoil for the banking industry in particular and for the wider world economy in general. Barclays has been well served by an excellent executive team \u2013 led, first by John Varley, and now by Bob Diamond \u2013 which has worked constructively with a strong and supportive board of directors. Barclays has remained resilient throughout the crisis, and has worked hard to ensure that today it is a strong, well capitalised and profitable business. \"But last week's events \u2013 evidencing as they do unacceptable standards of behaviour within the bank \u2013 have dealt a devastating blow to Barclays' reputation. As chairman, I am the ultimate guardian of the bank's reputation. Accordingly, the buck stops with me and I must acknowledge responsibility by standing aside. \"The board has also agreed to launch an audit of our business practices. \"This audit will be led by an independent third party reporting to Sir Michael Rake and a panel of non-executive directors. \"It will have three objectives: \u2022 to undertake a root and branch review of all of the past practices that have been revealed as flawed since the credit crisis started and identify implications for our business practices and culture going forward; \u2022 to publish a public report of its findings; and \u2022 to produce a new, mandatory code of conduct that will be applied across Barclays. \"This exercise will be part of a broader programme of activity intended to restore Barclays' reputation and we will establish a zero-tolerance policy for any actions that harm the reputation of the bank. \"I am truly sorry that our customers, clients, employees and shareholders have been let down. Barclays is full of hard-working, talented individuals whose integrity is not in question. \"It goes without saying that Barclays will continue to have my wholehearted support in the future.\"",
