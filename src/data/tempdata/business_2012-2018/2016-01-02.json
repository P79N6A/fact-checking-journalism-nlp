      "bodyText": "On the day Jose Mourinho was ousted as manager of Chelsea football club, the only televised interview with him ran on BT Sport, BT\u2019s pay-TV channel. The interview was pre-recorded, and had been filmed before Mourinho knew about his sacking, but its exclusivity was a feather in BT\u2019s cap and delighted its chief executive, Gavin Patterson. \u201cThat was a significant moment,\u201d he says. Liverpool-supporting Patterson has taken a colossal risk in the past couple of years by challenging Sky, previously the nation\u2019s dominant sports broadcaster, by doing big-money deals for live football rights. Other contenders, such as Setanta and OnDigital, fell by the wayside. Patterson feels the group is beginning to reap the rewards of its massive investment. \u201cNot so long ago, that interview would have run on Sky, with little chance of it appearing anywhere else,\u201d he says. But the same would have been said about most Champions League matches until, two years ago, BT Sport poached these rights for a sky-high \u00a3897m from its bitter rival. It has been broadcasting the matches this season for the first time, in an effort to gain broadband customers. Patterson says: \u201cThere remain significant competition issues in pay-TV, but there should be plenty of room in the market for two players, if not more. Sky offers a great service, at a very high price, while we offer customers access to Premier League matches for free and Uefa matches for a modest fiver a month.\u201d So far the plan appears to be working. BT says it now has 7.8 million broadband users, up from 6.9 million a couple of years ago, as customers are lured to its broadband offering by incentive deals for BT Sport. Revenue in BT\u2019s consumer division increased by 7% to \u00a34.3bn in the year to March 2015, contributing to a jump in overall profits to \u00a33.17bn. Despite the massive spend on sports rights the group\u2019s share price has performed reasonably well, especially over five years: it now stands at more than twice its 2011 level. Not that the year has all been about BT Sport. BT is also pushing other forms in a deal with US TV drama channel AMC (now broadcasting hit horror series Fear the Walking Dead), though it will be some time before BT\u2019s television service can rival the choice on offer from Sky. In what has been an all-action year, Patterson has also taken the group back into mobile telecoms with its \u00a312.5bn takeover of EE. BT was one of the pioneers of mobile telephony, launching a network in 1986. But later it spun off O2 \u2013 then called Cellnet \u2013 and put mobile on the back burner. But the growth in smartphones persuaded BT back into the business. The acquisition of EE more than trebles BT\u2019s total retail customers, adding its 10 million to EE\u2019s 24.5 million direct mobile subscribers. \u201cOur mobile plans have added to the air of excitement in our industry and I\u2019m hopeful that the Competition and Markets Authority will approve our acquisition of EE in January,\u201d says Patterson. Alongside all this consumer activity, Patterson is rolling out the group\u2019s fibre-optic broadband network. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested \u00a320bn in UK networks over the past decade and that has helped make the UK the leading digital nation in the G20 for the past five years,\u201d he says. \u201cNine out of 10 homes can now access fibre broadband and we\u2019re not stopping there: plans are in place to get that to 95% if not higher by the end of 2017.\u201d In the year ahead, Patterson\u2019s biggest battle will be to stop its Openreach division \u2013 which owns the pipes and cables that connect people to the internet \u2013 being forcibly split from the company. Most of BT\u2019s rivals, including Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone, insist the fact that BT owns the fixed network is detrimental to the UK broadband market. Earlier this year, Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, decided to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the market, with a view to splitting BT and Openreach into two companies. Ofcom\u2019s decision is due shortly, and BT, which argues that the current model has helped the UK beat its immediate European competitors, reckons it has a convincing case. Patterson may well be looking forward to watching games like Arsenal v Barcelona on BT Sport, but his biggest challenge this year probably won\u2019t be with Sky on the sports field, but with all his rivals in the regulator\u2019s office.",

      "bodyText": "Cheap American olive oil could, in a few years\u2019 time, be sitting on supermarket shelves next to the Tuscan single estate varieties loved by British foodies. At present a prohibitive tariff on US imports effectively prices them out of contention. But a groundbreaking trade deal could lower the $1,680-a-tonne tariff on US olive oil to match the $34 a tonne the US charges on imports from the EU. Or the tariffs could disappear altogether. Either way, Greek, Spanish and Italian olive farmers must fear the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a deal that aims to create a level playing field between them and massive US agri-businesses. Trade deals were once seen as a panacea for global poverty. In the 1990s, the World Trade Organisation was formed to harmonise cross-border regulations on everything from cars to pharmaceuticals and cut tariffs in order to promote the free flow of goods and services around the world. There was always a fear that, far from being a winning formula for all, lower tariffs would favour the rich and powerful and crucify small producers, who would struggle to compete in an unprotected environment. The effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), signed by the US, Mexico and Canada in 1993, appeared to justify that fear: it became in later years a cause celebre for anti-poverty campaigners, angered by the plight of Mexican workers. Not only were they subjected to low wages and poor working conditions by newly relocated US corporations \u2013 and, as consumers, to the relentless marketing power of Walmart, Coca Cola and the rest \u2013 but the major fringe benefit of cutting corruption remained illusory. This year the US hopes to sign what many believe will be Nafta\u2019s direct successor \u2013 TTIP. Should it get the green light from Congress and the EU commission, the agreement will be a bilateral treaty between Europe and the US, and, just like Nafta before it, outside the ambit of a gridlocked WTO. Supporters say it will be an improvement on its predecessor because the main proponents are a liberal US president and a European commission that considers itself concerned with workers and consumers. Why, the commission asks, would 28 relatively affluent member states with concerns about high unemployment, stagnant wages, welfare provision and climate change agree to a charter that undermines workers\u2019 rights, attacks public services or reduces environmental regulations? TTIP is also billed as an agreement between equals that allows both sides to promote trade: it is claimed that the UK\u2019s national income could be raised by \u00a34bn-\u00a310bn annually, or up to \u00a3100bn over 10 years. That amounts to a 0.3 percentage point boost to GDP, which would have pushed this year\u2019s expected 2.4% growth to 2.7%. But it strikes fear into the hearts of many, who believe it to be a Trojan horse for rapacious corporations. These corporations, hellbent on driving down costs to enhance shareholder value, spell the end for Europe\u2019s cosy welfare states and their ability to shield fledgling or, in the case of steel and coal, declining industries from the harsh realities of open competition. TTIP has been compared to the 1846 Corn Law abolition, which either swept away protectionist tariffs that impoverished millions of workers, or protected a vital source of food and led Karl Marx to ask: \u201cWhat is free trade under the present condition of society?\u201d His answer was: \u201cIt is the freedom which capital has to crush the worker.\u201d Is that the case with TTIP? Here are five key factors to consider. Health and public services From the moment TTIP became part of President Barack Obama\u2019s growth strategy, critics have feared that he little realised the expansionary intentions of US healthcare companies or was too distracted to care. The concern relates to the prospect of EU countries, under pressure from rising healthcare costs, handing over major parts of healthcare provision to the private sector. Once services are in private hands, say critics, TTIP rules will prevent them being taken back into state control. Since these fears were voiced, trade negotiators have excluded provisions that would have allowed firms to sue governments for the loss of health and public services contracts once they expired. This allows the UK\u2019s rail franchise system and the contracting-out of health services to continue under time-limited contracts. But the US private health industry, which is the largest in the world, views a Europe struggling with the needs of an ageing baby-boomer generation as ripe for the picking. For this reason alone, contracting out the distribution of drugs, the supply of medical devices and the provision of vital services could prove irresistible. Dispute resolution A little known facet of every trade deal is a separate form of arbitration for the businesses covered by the agreement, allowing them to avoid the civil courts. As such, the investor-state dispute resolution (ISDS) gives foreign investors the power to sue a government for introducing legislation that harms their investment. Famously, it was used by big tobacco to sue the Australian government when it introduced plain cigarette packaging. Before and after the scandal, other governments have come under legal challenge from corporations concerned that public policymaking is denying them revenues. In spring 2014, UN official and human rights lawyer Alfred de Zayas called for a moratorium on TTIP negotiations until ISDS was excluded. He warned that the secret court tribunals held to settle trade disputes were undemocratic. Their reliance on a small group of specialist lawyers also meant that arbitrators sitting in judgment were the ones who at other times represented corporate clients. De Zayas feared that smaller states would find themselves in the same position as many governments in trade disputes, suffering huge legal bills and long delays to public policy reforms. He was joined in his mission by NGOs and, most importantly, by MEPs in Strasbourg. As a first concession, the US side agreed to prohibit \u201cbrass-plate\u201d firms \u2013 those that exist only by name in a county, without any employees or activity \u2013 from suing a government. This aimed to prevent a repeat of the Australia incident when the Ukrainian arm of tobacco firm Philip Morris, effectively a brass-plate entity, spearheaded the attack on plain packaging. Many EU politicians said this concession was too easy to circumvent, leaving corporations in a powerful position. So Europe\u2019s chief negotiator, Swedish commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, hatched a scheme for an international court of arbitration \u2013 an open public forum instead of the private court system. Even her critics said it was a bold move, and unlikely to be accepted by the Americans. Washington has countered with proposals for a more transparent ISDS court, with live-streamed meetings and the publication of all documents. Not enough, says de Zayas, who wrote recently: \u201cAlas, countless ISDS awards have shown a business bias that shocks the conscience. To the extent that the procedures are not transparent, the arbitrators are not always independent and the annulment procedure is nearly useless, ISDS should be abolished as incompatible with article 14(1) of the ICCPR [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] which requires that all suits at law be decided by independent and competent tribunals under the rule of law.\u201d The two sides have yet to formally discuss either proposal: under deals between the US and Japan and the EU and Canada the issue was barely mentioned, but it is now expected to be among the most contentious. Regulations Michael Froman, the US chief negotiator, described the task of harmonising regulations as follows: \u201cFor years the US and EU have accepted each other\u2019s inspection of aeroplanes because it was obvious they would not be able to check all the planes landing in their jurisdiction. We seek to expand this practice to other areas.\u201d So how would Froman apply this to the fact that American cars will still be left-hand drive, restricting their use on British roads? He argues that the cost of imported cars, research and development and testing can still benefit from the harmonisation of regulations on either side of the Atlantic. Yet there is nothing US food regulators would like less than to accept processed foods tested by EU officials who failed to spot the horsemeat scandal. And EU regulators are duty bound to reject GM foods, after sustained protests by Europe\u2019s consumers in direct conflict with US farmers. Washington claims it will accept the science when it applies to regulations, which supports GM foods being accepted by the EU as part of TTIP, just as it is part of the WTO agreement. Tariffs Dispensing with tariffs seems like a straightforward process compared with tackling complex regulations. Under TTIP, tariffs on goods and services should disappear, though it is expected that some will only be reduced, and others may take years to go the way of history. Under the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) recently agreed, but not yet implemented, between the US, Japan, Australia, Vietnam and other East Asian countries, all goods, from pork to cars, are covered. A good example of how long it can take for tariffs to come down is found in the case of the 2.5% rate slapped on Japanese car imports to the US: this will start to be incrementally lowered 15 years after the agreement takes effect, halved in 20 years and eliminated in 25 years. In return, Japan will, among other things, lower its tariff on imported beef from 38.5% to 9% over 16 years. A similar programme could be possible under TTIP, with olive oil tariffs lowered over 25 years. Labour standards and workers\u2019 rights Japanese trade unions supported the TPP deal, and unions in Europe are expected to follow suit with TTIP. They accept that labour protection rules lie outside the scope of a deal, and that their governments can therefore continue to implement minimum wage legislation and other supportive measures without being sanctioned. But unions, where they exist, tend to represent workers in successful industries, which naturally welcome access to wider markets. Workers in weaker areas of the economy could find their jobs coming under pressure from harmonised regulations, lower tariffs, or even just exposure to a US rival with a work ethic that denies most employees more than two weeks\u2019 holiday a year. TTIP is important to the UK government because the US is our biggest market for goods and services outside the EU. It\u2019s seen as especially important for small and medium-sized businesses, which appreciate the lack of language barrier. Britain also has a trade surplus with the US: we export more than we import, which helps counterbalance the country\u2019s huge trade deficit. Such is the momentum behind the talks that a deal could be agreed by the end of the year, and go before Congress and EU parliaments in 2017. Both sides claim to be making good progress. But the dispute over ISDS and protests from farmers could yet quash Obama\u2019s hopes for US olive oil sales.",

These corporations, hellbent on driving down costs to enhance shareholder value, spell the end for Europe\u2019s cosy welfare states and their ability to shield fledgling or, in the case of steel and coal, declining industries from the harsh realities of open competition.</p> <p>TTIP has been compared to the 1846 Corn Law abolition, which either swept away protectionist tariffs that impoverished millions of workers, or protected a vital source of food and led Karl Marx to ask: \u201cWhat is free trade under the present condition of society?\u201d His answer was: \u201cIt is the freedom which capital has to crush the worker.\u201d Is that the case with TTIP? Here are five key factors to consider.</p> <h2><strong>Health and public services</strong></h2> <p>From the moment TTIP became part of President Barack Obama\u2019s growth strategy, critics have feared that he little realised the expansionary intentions of US healthcare companies or was too distracted to care. The concern relates to the prospect of EU countries, under pressure from rising healthcare costs, handing over major parts of healthcare provision to the private sector. Once services are in private hands, say critics, TTIP rules will prevent them being taken back into state control.</p> <p>Since these fears were voiced, trade negotiators have excluded provisions that would have allowed firms to sue governments for the loss of health and public services contracts once they expired. This allows the UK\u2019s rail franchise system and the contracting-out of health services to continue under time-limited contracts.</p> <p>But the US private health industry, which is the largest in the world, views a Europe struggling with the needs of an ageing baby-boomer generation as ripe for the picking. For this reason alone, contracting out the distribution of drugs, the supply of medical devices and the provision of vital services could prove irresistible.</p> <h2>Dispute resolution</h2> <p>A little known facet of every trade deal is a separate form of arbitration for the businesses covered by the agreement, allowing them to avoid the civil courts. As such, the investor-state dispute resolution (ISDS) gives foreign investors the power to sue a government for introducing legislation that harms their investment.</p> <p>Famously, it was used by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/philip-morris-australia-cigarette-packets\" title=\"\">big tobacco to sue the Australian government </a>when it introduced plain cigarette packaging. Before and after the scandal, other governments have come under legal challenge from corporations concerned that public policymaking is denying them revenues.</p> <p>In spring 2014, UN official and human rights lawyer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights\" title=\"\">Alfred de Zayas </a>called for a moratorium on TTIP negotiations until ISDS was excluded. He warned that the secret court tribunals held to settle trade disputes were undemocratic. Their reliance on a small group of specialist lawyers also meant that arbitrators sitting in judgment were the ones who at other times represented corporate clients.</p> <p>De Zayas feared that smaller states would find themselves in the same position as many governments in trade disputes, suffering huge legal bills and long delays to public policy reforms. He was joined in his mission by NGOs and, most importantly, by MEPs in Strasbourg.</p> <p>As a first concession, the US side agreed to prohibit \u201cbrass-plate\u201d firms \u2013 those that exist only by name in a county, without any employees or activity \u2013 from suing a government. This aimed to prevent a repeat of the Australia incident when the Ukrainian arm of tobacco firm Philip Morris, effectively a brass-plate entity, spearheaded the attack on plain packaging.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"375e03c7d9b610abbc5c4c51258495ff6cfeb91b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/375e03c7d9b610abbc5c4c51258495ff6cfeb91b/0_71_3550_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"European commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has proposed an international court of arbitration to settle investor disputes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m has proposed an international court of arbitration to settle investor disputes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many EU politicians said this concession was too easy to circumvent, leaving corporations in a powerful position. So Europe\u2019s chief negotiator, Swedish commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, hatched a scheme for an international court of arbitration \u2013 an open public forum instead of the private court system. Even her critics said it was a bold move, and unlikely to be accepted by the Americans.</p> <p>Washington has countered with proposals for a more transparent ISDS court, with live-streamed meetings and the publication of all documents. Not enough, says de Zayas, who wrote recently: \u201cAlas, countless ISDS awards have shown a business bias that shocks the conscience. To the extent that the procedures are not transparent, the arbitrators are not always independent and the annulment procedure is nearly useless, ISDS should be abolished as incompatible with article 14(1) of the ICCPR [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] which requires that all suits at law be decided by independent and competent tribunals under the rule of law.\u201d</p> <p>The two sides have yet to formally discuss either proposal: under deals between the US and Japan and the EU and Canada the issue was barely mentioned, but it is now expected to be among the most contentious.</p> <h2><strong>Regulations</strong></h2> <p>Michael Froman, the US chief negotiator, described the task of harmonising regulations as follows: \u201cFor years the US and EU have accepted each other\u2019s inspection of aeroplanes because it was obvious they would not be able to check all the planes landing in their jurisdiction. We seek to expand this practice to other areas.\u201d</p> <p>So how would Froman apply this to the fact that American cars will still be left-hand drive, restricting their use on British roads? He argues that the cost of imported cars, research and development and testing can still benefit from the harmonisation of regulations on either side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Yet there is nothing US food regulators would like less than to accept processed foods tested by EU officials who failed to spot the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/horsemeat-scandal\" title=\"\">horsemeat scandal</a>.</p> <p>And EU regulators are duty bound to reject GM foods, after sustained protests by Europe\u2019s consumers in direct conflict with US farmers. Washington claims it will accept the science when it applies to regulations, which supports GM foods being accepted by the EU as part of TTIP, just as it is part of the WTO agreement.</p> <h2><strong>Tariffs</strong></h2> <p>Dispensing with tariffs seems like a straightforward process compared with tackling complex regulations. Under TTIP, tariffs on goods and services should disappear, though it is expected that some will only be reduced, and others may take years to go the way of history.</p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/12/trans-pacific-partnership-explainer\" title=\"\">Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)</a> recently agreed, but not yet implemented, between the US, Japan, Australia, Vietnam and other East Asian countries, all goods, from pork to cars, are covered.</p> <p>A good example of how long it can take for tariffs to come down is found in the case of the 2.5% rate slapped on Japanese car imports to the US: this will start to be incrementally lowered 15 years after the agreement takes effect, halved in 20 years and eliminated in 25 years. In return, Japan will, among other things, lower its tariff on imported beef from 38.5% to 9% over 16 years. A similar programme could be possible under TTIP, with olive oil tariffs lowered over 25 years.</p> <h2><strong>Labour standards and workers\u2019 rights</strong><br></h2> <p>Japanese trade unions supported the TPP deal, and unions in Europe are expected to follow suit with TTIP. They accept that labour protection rules lie outside the scope of a deal, and that their governments can therefore continue to implement minimum wage legislation and other supportive measures without being sanctioned.</p> <p>But unions, where they exist, tend to represent workers in successful industries, which naturally welcome access to wider markets. Workers in weaker areas of the economy could find their jobs coming under pressure from harmonised regulations, lower tariffs, or even just exposure to a US rival with a work ethic that denies most employees more than two weeks\u2019 holiday a year.</p> <p>TTIP is important to the UK government because the US is our biggest market for goods and services outside the EU. It\u2019s seen as especially important for small and medium-sized businesses, which appreciate the lack of language barrier. Britain also has a trade surplus with the US: we export more than we import, which helps counterbalance the country\u2019s huge trade deficit.</p> <p>Such is the momentum behind the talks that a deal could be agreed by the end of the year, and go before Congress and EU parliaments in 2017. Both sides claim to be making good progress. But the dispute over ISDS and protests from farmers could yet quash Obama\u2019s hopes for US olive oil sales.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Through 1913 and into 1914, J Pierpoint Morgan spared no expense in the construction of an imposing headquarters that might suitably represent his reputation as the era\u2019s pre-eminent financial baron \u2013 a lair for the capitalist\u2019s capitalist smack in the heart of Wall Street. He imported blocks of pink Knoxville marble weighing as much as 35 tons, commissioned a vault with a door weighing another 52, a massive crystal chandelier and panelling of English oak. Morgan believed 23 Wall Street would be so well-known as the headquarters of JP Morgan &amp; Co \u2013 the \u201cHouse of Morgan\u201d \u2013 that he didn\u2019t even bother to order his name inscribed over the facade. But for the past nine years this imposing monument to America\u2019s most famous banker has stood neglected, its windows dirty and plastered with advertising, and without use save for occasional fashion industry parties or TV shoots. Its ownership is tied to Sam Pa, a jet-setting Hong Kong-based businessman with seven names, links to the Chinese intelligence services and a network of business contacts stretching from Pyongyang to Luanda, whose whereabouts since being detained by Chinese communist party authorities investigating corruption in China\u2019s energy industry are unknown. If that was not sufficiently rich in symbolism, keys to the 102-year-old, 150,000 sq ft Sam Pa-JP Morgan edifice are likely to soon be handed over to Simon Birch, a 41-year-old Brighton-born artist who plans to fill the space with contemporary art and sculpture based on anti-capitalist themes, he says, \u201cof empires expanding and contracting\u201d. The exhibition will not be the first time the building has attracted the attention of anti-capitalists: at midday on 16 September 1920, anarchists possibly connected to Galleanists (Italian anarchists) detonated 100lbs of dynamite hidden inside a horsecart that killed 38 people, injured 143 and caused $2m in property damage. The bombing was never conclusively solved though it was, for a time, considered the worst act of terrorism on US soil. Last summer the exhibit organisers held a champagne fundraiser; guests included Alan Cumming and Tommy Hilfiger. The exhibit, scheduled to open in April and last three months, will not answer longer-term questions over the future of a building that stands opposite the New York stock exchange and adjacent to a gold-ornamented, Trump-themed tower block. Fourteen years after 9/11, the district is resurgent less as a financial centre than as residential and luxury shopping destination thronging with visitors looking to counter the gloomy experience of the World Trade Center memorials several minutes away by foot. According to real estate agents, the Morgan building would make an ideal retail location for Apple \u2013 there is none at the lower end of the city \u2013 marrying one of capitalism\u2019s foremost edifices with the world\u2019s most highly valued firm. But Pa\u2019s arrest in a Beijing hotel two months ago serves only to deepen the intrigue. Sonangol, a company with ties to Sam Pa, purchased the building for $150m in 2008 through China Sonangol, the investment arm of 88 Queensway, an octopus-like organisation described by the US Center for Public Integrity as a \u201ctrans-national network of over 60 interlocking companies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean\u201d. Last week, Sonangol\u2019s US office in Houston directed inquiries to its headquarters in Luanda where the company is primarily involved with shipping Angolan oil to China. The number offered was not in service. Pa, who also goes by his Cantonese name of Tsui King Wah, as well as Xu Songhua, Sa Muxu, Sam King, Antonio Famtosonghiu Sampo Menezes and Ghiu Ka Leung has proved almost as difficult to track as his business interests are difficult to unravel. All his life he\u2019s worked in Chinese intelligence, one source told the Financial Times. \u201cSam is a big player in arms in Africa. Oil, diamonds and weapons go together. Everyone who was in intelligence at that time, they went into business.\u201d To many, Pa and the Queensway Group have come to symbolise Chinese economic activity in Africa that has surged from $10bn two decades ago to more than $200bn. Key to Queensway\u2019s dealings in Angola, Guinea, Madagascar, Tanzania and, most controversially, Sudan and Zimbabwe, it is Pa who allegedly developed relationships with African leaders during his service as a Chinese intelligence operative and arms dealer. In a report, The Anatomy of the Resource Curse: Predatory Investment in Africa\u2019s Extractive Industries, published last year by the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, US researcher JR Mailey described the Queensway Group as a \u201cprototypical predatory investor\u201d that engaged in deal-making that is \u201cflagrantly unfavourable to the citizens of the host country\u201d. The report alleged that having allegedly bribed African government officials and engaged in illicit arms trafficking and diamond smuggling, Queensway\u2019s deals in Africa have often had a disastrous impact on governance. Pa\u2019s arrest is believed to be linked to a corruption inquiry into Su Shulin, governor of Fujian province. Su, the former boss of China\u2019s state-owned oil giant Sinopec, has been accused of helping a relative to secure contracts to build a huge oil depot in China and reflects an ongoing anti-corruption campaign initiated by President Xi Jinping. The acquisition of 23 Wall Street is also shrouded in mystery. Sonangol acquired the building in 2008 from Africa-Israel, a firm controlled by Lev Leviev, a Russian-born entrepreneur with ties to diamond mining in Angola, the construction of ultra-orthodox settlements in the West Bank and New York property, including the former New York Times building on 43rd Street. According to the New York real estate rumour mill, Pa pursued the purchase of 23 Wall Street as a favour to Leviev or perhaps thought Sonangol was acquiring a different Leviev building \u2013 the Madison Square Clock Tower \u2013 more amenable to development. Agents for the building rejected a plan to turn the building into a vast nightclub with restaurants, a bowling alley and other entertainments operated by 360 Latitude, a Las Vegas-based entertainment company. Local residents objected to the idea of a giant leisure complex right across the street from where George Washington was sworn in as the first president of the United States. Given 23 Wall Street\u2019s history Birch should have a lot of material to play with for his show if it goes ahead in April. Viewers will apparently enter into a gallery of portraits of punk rockers from the late 1970s, past videos of bodies suspended in motion, and into a room of airplane parts. Elsewhere, video screens will show Chinese factory workers fighting and the artist crashing his Ferrari. Catherine Hughes, head of the local Community Board 1, believes Birch\u2019s ambitious art installation could be a step on the path to restoring the building\u2019s lustre. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful building in a key strategic location so if it can be properly activated that\u2019s something we\u2019d clearly look forward to.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 March 2106 to clarify that 23 Wall Street was purchased by China Sonangol, rather than Sam Pa himself, and that the building was yet to be confirmed as the venue for Simon Birch\u2019s exhibition. This statement from China Sonangol was received after publication: \u201cThere has been some difficulty with procuring tenants for the building, largely due to our company management\u2019s previous strategy of wanting to lease the entire building to a single tenant, in the hopes that it would make more economic sense for a single stakeholder to refurbish the building to a single set of specifications. We did enter into negotiations with hospitality group Latitude 360 to turn the building into an entertainment hub, but the deal fell through due to financial issues. However, we are committed to restoring the 102-year-old iconic building to its proper position as Wall Street\u2019s pre-eminent landmark, and are prepared to invest significant funds to achieve this. We are currently investing close to $20m in basic renovations, and our agents have begun negotiating leases with potential tenants. We are confident that the extensive renovation works will be done by the end of this year and that we will be able to lease the property to our tenants by November.\u201d",

Sonangol acquired the building in 2008 from Africa-Israel, a firm controlled by Lev Leviev, a Russian-born entrepreneur with ties to diamond mining in Angola, the construction of ultra-orthodox settlements in the West Bank and New York property, including the former New York Times building on 43rd Street. </p> <p>According to the New York real estate rumour mill, Pa pursued the purchase of 23 Wall Street as a favour to Leviev or perhaps thought Sonangol was acquiring a different Leviev building \u2013 the Madison Square Clock Tower \u2013 more amenable to development. </p> <p>Agents for the building rejected a plan to turn the building into a vast nightclub with restaurants, a bowling alley and other entertainments operated by 360 Latitude, a Las Vegas-based entertainment company. Local residents objected to the idea of a giant leisure complex right across the street from where George Washington was sworn in as the first president of the United States. </p> <p>Given 23 Wall Street\u2019s history Birch should have a lot of material to play with for his show if it goes ahead in April. Viewers will apparently enter into a gallery of portraits of punk rockers from the late 1970s, past videos of bodies suspended in motion, and into a room of airplane parts. Elsewhere, video screens will show Chinese factory workers fighting and the artist crashing his Ferrari.</p> <p>Catherine Hughes, head of the local Community Board 1, believes Birch\u2019s ambitious art installation could be a step on the path to restoring the building\u2019s lustre. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful building in a key strategic location so if it can be properly activated that\u2019s something we\u2019d clearly look forward to.\u201d <br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 March 2106 to clarify that 23 Wall Street was purchased by China Sonangol, rather than Sam Pa himself, and that the building was yet to be confirmed as the venue for Simon Birch\u2019s exhibition. This statement from China Sonangol was received after publication: \u201cThere has been some difficulty with procuring tenants for the building, largely due to our company management\u2019s previous strategy of wanting to lease the entire building to a single tenant, in the hopes that it would make more economic sense for a single stakeholder to refurbish the building to a single set of specifications. We did enter into negotiations with hospitality group Latitude 360 to turn the building into an entertainment hub, but the deal fell through due to financial issues. However, we are committed to restoring the 102-year-old iconic building to its proper position as Wall Street\u2019s pre-eminent landmark, and are prepared to invest significant funds to achieve this. We are currently investing close to $20m in basic renovations, and our agents have begun negotiating leases with potential tenants. We are confident that the extensive renovation works will be done by the end of this year and that we will be able to lease the property to our tenants by November.\u201d</p>",
