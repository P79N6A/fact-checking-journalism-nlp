      "bodyText": "If Fred Goodwin deserved to be stripped of his knighthood, so does Sir James Crosby. Monday's session of the commission on banking standards established that HBOS's fatal weaknesses in funding and lending were created and encouraged during Crosby's time as chief executive. Nobody seriously believed otherwise, of course, but it was still useful to hear Crosby \u2013 through gritted teeth at times \u2013 make two significant admissions. First, he said it would be wrong to try to disassociate himself from the failure of the bank, even though he departed in July 2006 and the ultimate collapse happened in late 2008. Second, he agreed that HBOS lending was incompetent and the losses could not be explained solely by the broad financial crisis. The statistics on those losses are extraordinary. The impairments on the HBOS loan book represented a loss rate of 10.5%, about twice as bad as Royal Bank of Scotland. HBOS even managed to lose \u00a33.6bn in the relatively stable Australian economy. Note, too, that the bulk of HBOS's book was mortgages, where huge losses have never materialised. It took some doing to lose so much in other areas of activity. As the commission chairman, Andrew Tyrie, put it, this was very basic stuff. The phrase Crosby used many times was \"with the benefit of hindsight\". Failed bankers always do, but the charge that sits heavily against Crosby is that his lack of foresight was greater than many others'. The commission produced a telling statistic on the pace of HBOS expansion in corporate lending. In 2002, the bank had five individual loans over \u00a3500m; by September 2006 it had 17, including two of more than \u00a32bn. The deposit base could not keep up, thus inflating the dangerous reliance on wholesale funding. Yes, it's true, as Crosby argued, that few anticipated the near-closure for a year of the wholesale funding markets. But HBOS under Crosby also appears to have been grossly complacent in believing that Bank of Scotland's corporate managers could breeze through any medium-sized crisis just because they had done so in the past. In the rogues' gallery of failed UK banks, RBS has top spot because of its sheer size, but HBOS's collapse is only fractionally less appalling. Crosby has escaped Goodwin-like levels of scrutiny largely because he wasn't on the bridge at the moment the ship went down. But, if even he admits he is closely associated with the disaster, the knighthood question is relevant. Rightly or wrongly, a precedent was set when Goodwin's gong was removed in January this year. At the time George Osborne said: \"I think we've got a special case here of the Royal Bank of Scotland symbolising everything that went wrong in the British economy over the last decade.\" A cold look at the facts, though, says HBOS' case is also \"special\" and that the bank is equally a symbol of past excesses. It's hard to spot a meaningful difference on Osborne's yardstick. That's one for the forfeiture committee. For its part, the current commission may care to make a formal request to Crosby to take a smaller pension. Even Goodwin, eventually, did that. Why should Crosby expect to continue to receive a full index-linked whack of \u00a3572,000 a year?",

    "webTitle": "VAT loophole on digital sales 'costs UK more than Olympics'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain could have financed the Olympic Games out of the VAT it is losing on the sales of digital services, new research shows, heaping more pressure on George Osborne to close tax loopholes enjoyed by multinational companies in Wednesday's autumn statement. As Britons splashed out millions on Christmas gifts on the busiest online shopping day of the year, a report by a leading telecoms and digital consultancy suggests the UK is losing over \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a year in VAT on digital services bought by British consumers from suppliers such as Amazon which are based overseas. Greenwich Consulting estimates the UK will lose \u00a310bn between 2008 and 2014. Ministers say the London Games cost taxpayers \u00a39bn. The chancellor is expected to find more cash in the autumn statement to fund a drive by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to raise an additional \u00a310bn in tax revenues. But the revelation that Britain is losing so much revenue through tax loopholes will intensify demands at Westminster and beyond for tougher action on multinationals, such as Google and Starbucks, paying small amounts of tax. The anti-tax avoidance pressure group Uncut said that it was planning protests in Starbucks cafes this Saturday, involving \"creative civil disobedience\", and follows stinging criticism of tax avoidance MPs on the public accounts committee who accused the coffee chain, Google and Amazon of \"immoral\" use of secretive jurisdictions, royalties and complex company structures to avoid paying tax on British profits. Margaret Hodge, the committee's chair, said she had already stopped buying coffee at Starbucks and ceased using Amazon. \"I think actually the government can do things like \u2026 we buy a lot of stuff, we can say we won't buy from companies. I think it's good citizenship.\" Asked whether David Cameron would back calls for a consumer boycott of firms which avoid tax, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"The issue for government is how we tackle that tax avoidance \u2026 What we have to do in government is make sure we are tackling that kind of aggressive tax avoidance. We are doing that in a number of ways. We are bringing in a general anti-avoidance rule, we are working with other countries.\" The question of a boycott was \"an issue for individuals\", said the spokesman. Sainsbury's chief executive, Justin King, recently urged consumers to vote with their wallets, boycotting those companies that avoid tax. King said: \"If you send a clear message as a consumer to any business that you don't think it pays its dues in the UK you can bet your bottom dollar that they'll make a change very quickly.\" John Lewis boss, Andy Street, has also criticised the tax avoiders, pointing out that British companies paying corporation tax were at a disadvantage to those that channel their income abroad: \"You have got less money to invest if you are giving 27% of your profits to the exchequer than if you are domiciled in a tax haven.\" Under the EU's VAT rules, digital supplies to non-business customers \u2013 such as ebooks, music downloads and online apps \u2013 are classified as services rather than products. VAT on electronic services is imposed at the rate applying to the country in which a company is headquartered rather than the rate applied by the country in which it is bought. Amazon, for example, is based in Luxembourg and therefore charges its customers 3% VAT for ebooks, compared with the 20% levied in the UK. Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative MP and a former tax lawyer, believes that the EU should accelerate plans to change the way VAT is charged on digital services, which is due to be phased in between 2015 and 2019. \"This is yet another example of industrial scale tax avoidance by foreign owned multinational corporations. Their behaviour is irresponsible, unethical and unacceptable,\" he said. \"Billions of VAT is being lost that is needed to fund schools and hospitals or cut the deficit. I welcome the action that has been taken by the government so far \u2013 yet we need urgently to close this loophole and enable British businesses to compete on a level playing field.\" The Greenwich report was commissioned by Philippe Marini, chairman of the French senate's finance committee and was prepared for a private meeting of pan-European politicians, civil servants and tax specialists in Brussels. Marini supports an earlier date for bringing into line with other goods the rules for charging EU VAT on digital services. \"At the European level we need to renegotiate the schedule for implementing the VAT directive on electronic services in order to bring its application deadline nearer than 2015 or 2019, the term of the transition phase,\" Marini said. An HMRC spokesman said: \"It is a natural consequence of the VAT rules rather than any lack of compliance that a business in say, Germany, supplying such services to UK customers will account for VAT in Germany and not in the UK. \"Businesses have the freedom to establish themselves in whichever member state they wish. However, some UK businesses claimed to have moved their operations to other member states in order to benefit from lower VAT rates where in reality the supplies were still made from the UK. HMRC has successfully challenged such arrangements.\" Richard Asquith, an indirect tax specialist and head of VAT at TMF, the international compliance consultancy group, believes the \u20ac2bn a year loss may be a conservative estimate. \"What they may not be figuring in is sales of computer games and apps over the internet from outside of the EU. Many non-EU traders simply ignore EU VAT since it is close to impossible to track down.\" The crucial business to consumer (B2C) market in Europe for electronic business services was worth \u20ac124bn in 2009, according to Greenwich. The UK was by far the biggest market, accounting for over one third of total sales. The wider internet economy contributed \u00a3121bn to the British economy in 2010 according to a report by The Boston Consulting Group. The report, published earlier this year, said the UK's internet economy is growing at a rate of 10.9%, and is expected to be contributing \u00a3225 billion to the overall economy by 2016. But the Greenwich report says the UK was the least successful country at converting B2C sales into tax revenue. Based on the highest estimates, its combined VAT and corporation tax income from B2C business was generated at a rate of 15% of total sales. France and Germany secured conversion rates of 19% and 21% respectively while Benelux countries converted 50% of their \u20ac3bn B2C trade into tax revenue. Marini is a longstanding campaigner for fair and neutral taxation of the digital economy. He has drafted a law to allow the French government to capture a greater proportion of revenues generated by the sale of digital services. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's government says it will look at proposals next year which will restrict the ability of online companies to pay taxes on revenues earned in France in European countries with lower tax rates. Marini is trying to encourage a pan-European response to the imbalance between sales revenue generated in a particular economy and the taxation generated for the host country. While the UK is the biggest loser from lost VAT revenues, France, Germany, Spain and Italy are also identified by the report as countries suffering from diversion of VAT to other countries. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 December 2012 to remove repetition in the final paragraph.",

    "webTitle": "Starbucks to slash paid lunch breaks and sick leave", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Starbucks is cutting paid lunch breaks, sick leave and maternity benefits for thousands of British workers, sparking fresh anger over its business practices. On the day the House of Commons' public accounts committee branded the US coffee chain's tax avoidance practices \"immoral\", baristas arriving for work were told to sign revised employment terms, which include the removal of paid 30-minute lunch breaks and paid sick leave for the first day of illness. Some will also see pay increases frozen. The changes affecting about 7,000 coffee shop staff emerged as the company tried to quell public and political outrage at its use of secretive company structures that has seen it pay just \u00a38.6m in UK tax over the past 13 years on sales of \u00a33.1bn. On Saturday Starbucks announced it would open talks with the UK government that could lead to it paying more tax in future and on Monday it was reported that such an announcement could come on Wednesday. But at the same time it was telling workers it was removing benefits and changing employment arrangements. The new contractual terms being circulated to staff across 750 stores include the removal of cash incentives for becoming manager or partner of the year in favour of the award of a plaque and the removal of a bonus scheme for women returning after they have had a baby because \"it is not considered a valued benefit\". A worker who claimed he was told to sign the new contract last week or leave, told the Guardian colleagues were \"really upset\" at the changes and said it appeared relatively low-paid staff were being forced to help bear the cost of the company's potentially increased tax bill. \"It's really convenient for them to say we're going to pay more taxes, when they're going to save money with us, the staff,\" said the coffee shop worker on condition of anonymity. \"It's convenient saying we'll pay more because they're going to save more \u2013 and the perfect excuse for them is to say to staff 'We're going to pay more taxes, so\u2026'.\" He said his manager explained Starbucks \"is losing a lot of money in Europe, so they said they needed to make these changes to save the company money\". Even apparently minor benefits are being cut. Starbucks is ending the practice of giving hampers to new mothers in favour of \"a card and Starbucks baby grow and bib\". The new policy on staff birthdays orders: \"Removal of birthday cards. Bakery good code to be issued in store for free birthday treat.\" Congratulations cards on the anniversary of the first four years of service are being withdrawn. A Starbucks spokeswoman defended the contract changes saying they followed several months of consultation with a group of employees and that \"all partners (employees) were given the opportunity to feed back\". \"That happened throughout the summer,\" she said. \"It is entirely unrelated to the story that we are in discussions with HM Revenue and Customs and the Treasury.\" MPs said on Monday they found it hard to believe Starbucks's claim it had made a loss for 14 of the 15 years it has been operating in the UK, given it had a 31% market share by turnover and had briefed shareholders the UK business was making 15% profits. Starbucks managers have reportedly told staff they must not discuss the new terms, and staff are afraid they could be dismissed if they do so, according to Martin Smith, national organiser of the GMB union, which represents some Starbucks workers. \"The reaction is one of confusion and fear,\" said Smith. \"On the removal of sick pay, do we really want our coffee to be made by someone struggling to work with a cold, because that is what will happen. It is not a good look for a top flight coffee maker.\" Starbucks said that was not its intention and the issue had been discussed with employees. It said in a statememt: \"Employee pay and benefits are one of the largest investments we make in our business, and the decisions we have taken over the past few months have been about finding the right way to structure packages so that they are balanced across pay, benefits and development.\" Starbucks has told staff the changes followed a review of other businesses \"to consider the competition and the norms in benefits packages\". The company is introducing a contributory pension scheme that will allow baristas to contribute 1% of their salary, which will be matched by the company. It is also removing a three-month vesting period for life insurance cover. Other benefits are unchanged. Staff who complete five years of service will continue to receive a pen and the right to take four weeks off without pay. In the revised terms and conditions, Starbucks tells staff that funding sick pay from the first day of illness \"leads to a considerable cost for the company\". \"It is not just the financial cost of paying partners for their sickness absences we have considered but also the impact this has on partners left to run the shift,\" it said. On paid 30-minute lunch breaks, it said: \"We considered that many businesses don't pay for lunch breaks. It is meant to be a break from work to have lunch and we therefore believe the long break should not be paid. We have decided to keep the 10-minute break paid as this is for a short-relief break for shifts of four hours or more\".",

      "body": "<p>The Tchenguiz brothers are suing the Serious Fraud Office for more than \u00a3200m following the agency's botched investigation into their role in the collapse of Iceland's banks.</p> <p>Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz, who once owned 1% of all the residential property in Britain but lost out heavily in the financial crisis, were arrested in dawn raids on their homes in March 2011. But the SFO was forced to drop its three-year investigation into the pair's involvement in the collapse of Icelandic bank Kaupthing after it admitted to serious failings.</p> <p>The brothers on Monday began legal action demanding the SFO pay damages estimated at up to \u00a3200m each. If they win the case, which is scheduled for trial at the high court in January 2014, it will trigger the biggest payout in the SFO's 25-year history and increase the pressure on the agency's former boss, Richard Alderman.</p> <p>Vincent Tchenguiz is claiming \u00a3200m compensation for having to sack 60 staff and scale back his business interests after his \"very public arrest\". He has also submitted a claim for trespass and is considering filing for malicious prosecution, human rights infringements and a claim for \"misfeasance in a public office\" against the SFO.</p> <p>After the pre-trial hearing at the high court on Monday he said: \"My reputation suffered serious damage during the 15 months between my arrest and the SFO conceding that they had no grounds for holding me as a suspect. Significant financial loss can be proved to have occurred as a result of the reckless actions of the former director of the SFO.\"</p> <p>Robert Tchenguiz has filed for false imprisonment and damages to his business empire. The value of his claim is unknown, but it is understood to be smaller than the \u00a3200m claimed by his brother. He declined to comment after the hearing.</p> <p>The SFO was forced to abandon the UK's biggest-ever fraud inquiry in October after it admitted to a series of blunders. This summer a high court judge accused the SFO of \"sheer incompetence\" after it admitted it had \"no clear record\" of the information it used to obtain warrants to search Vincent Tchenguiz's home.</p> <p>At one stage the SFO discussed sending an undercover officer to infiltrate his favourite Mayfair nightclub, Annabel's, to gather evidence.</p> <p>The SFO has already been ordered to pay the brothers' legal fees connected to their successful challenge against the dawn raids.</p> <p>The agency's sprawling inquiry into Kaupthing had been dogged by concerns about complexity and cost since intelligence officers started preliminary work on the case almost five years ago. It was the largest, most complex criminal investigation into a financial institution since the SFO examined the 1991 collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.</p> <p>Vincent Tchenguiz said the damages should not be paid by the taxpayer alone and added that the \"intervention of third parties in this unlawful process warrants further assessment\".</p> <p>This is understood to be a reference to the role accountants Grant Thornton played in supplying much of the information the SFO relied on for its investigation. In a letter included in evidence filed at the court, lawyers claimed that Grant Thornton made \"unfounded allegations of fraud against Vincent Tchenguiz\" in \"misleading information\" the accountants provided to the SFO.

Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz, who once owned 1% of all the residential property in Britain but lost out heavily in the financial crisis, were arrested in dawn raids on their homes in March 2011. But the SFO was forced to drop its three-year investigation into the pair's involvement in the collapse of Icelandic bank Kaupthing after it admitted to serious failings. The brothers on Monday began legal action demanding the SFO pay damages estimated at up to \u00a3200m each. If they win the case, which is scheduled for trial at the high court in January 2014, it will trigger the biggest payout in the SFO's 25-year history and increase the pressure on the agency's former boss, Richard Alderman. Vincent Tchenguiz is claiming \u00a3200m compensation for having to sack 60 staff and scale back his business interests after his \"very public arrest\". He has also submitted a claim for trespass and is considering filing for malicious prosecution, human rights infringements and a claim for \"misfeasance in a public office\" against the SFO. After the pre-trial hearing at the high court on Monday he said: \"My reputation suffered serious damage during the 15 months between my arrest and the SFO conceding that they had no grounds for holding me as a suspect. Significant financial loss can be proved to have occurred as a result of the reckless actions of the former director of the SFO.\" Robert Tchenguiz has filed for false imprisonment and damages to his business empire. The value of his claim is unknown, but it is understood to be smaller than the \u00a3200m claimed by his brother. He declined to comment after the hearing. The SFO was forced to abandon the UK's biggest-ever fraud inquiry in October after it admitted to a series of blunders. This summer a high court judge accused the SFO of \"sheer incompetence\" after it admitted it had \"no clear record\" of the information it used to obtain warrants to search Vincent Tchenguiz's home. At one stage the SFO discussed sending an undercover officer to infiltrate his favourite Mayfair nightclub, Annabel's, to gather evidence. The SFO has already been ordered to pay the brothers' legal fees connected to their successful challenge against the dawn raids. The agency's sprawling inquiry into Kaupthing had been dogged by concerns about complexity and cost since intelligence officers started preliminary work on the case almost five years ago. It was the largest, most complex criminal investigation into a financial institution since the SFO examined the 1991 collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Vincent Tchenguiz said the damages should not be paid by the taxpayer alone and added that the \"intervention of third parties in this unlawful process warrants further assessment\". This is understood to be a reference to the role accountants Grant Thornton played in supplying much of the information the SFO relied on for its investigation. In a letter included in evidence filed at the court, lawyers claimed that Grant Thornton made \"unfounded allegations of fraud against Vincent Tchenguiz\" in \"misleading information\" the accountants provided to the SFO. The letter added that there was a \"serious question\" as to whether Grant Thornton \"succumbed to a conflict of interest and may have improperly misled the SFO in order to advance their own and their clients' commercial interests\". Grant Thornton declined to comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The six banks and building societies that used a flagship scheme designed to boost lending sucked \u00a31bn out of the economy in the three months to September \u2013 including the two bailed-out banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. The funding for lending scheme (FLS) was dubbed a \"white elephant\" after the first data showed that in the three months to the end of September just \u00a3500m of lending was released by all the 35 banks and lenders signed up for the scheme, which was launched in the summer. But only six banks and building societies actually used any funds from the FLS in the three months to the end of September and their net lending \u2013 which takes account of loans being repaid \u2013 was negative by \u00a31bn because customers repaid existing loans faster than new loans were granted. At three banks more loans were repaid than new ones taken out, leading to negative net lending at Royal Bank of Scotland, 82% owned by the taxpayer, of \u00a3642m. Rival bailed-out bank Lloyds Banking Group sucked \u00a32.7bn from the economy during the third quarter while Santander removed \u00a33.4bn. The biggest injection of credit came from Barclays \u2013 at \u00a33.8bn \u2013 while Leeds Building Society added \u00a3212m and Nationwide Building Society \u00a31.8bn. RBS insisted that in its \"core\" business, which is not being run down or sold off, net lending totalled \u00a3136m to households and \u00a3160m to businesses. Paul Fisher, executive director for markets at the Bank of England, said it was \"too early to use these data as a reliable indication of the impact of the FLS on lending volumes\". But Christopher Shaw, chief executive of finance provider Platform Black, said: \"The choice of name has proved to be unintentionally ironic. The funding is there all right, but there's precious little lending going on. What launched as the Bank of England's great white hope risks looking like a white elephant.\" The FLS, launched in August this year, reduces the borrowing costs for banks and other lenders, which are then required to pass on the lower costs to their customers. Fisher said since its launch there had been \"widespread falls in funding costs across different sources and an equally wide variety of lending rate reductions\". But much of the lending appears to be lowering mortgage rates rather than helping small businesses. The Bank of England's closely watched agent's report, released last month, found that lenders were still tightening terms to small and medium-sized enterprises. John Walker, the chairman of Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"What is needed is more competition and choice for small businesses to access finance. Our data tells us that around four in 10 small firms were refused loans in the third quarter and independent data shows that businesses looking for finance for the first time are more likely to be refused. The key reason why, is the scheme does not help firms access credit, it only makes credit cheaper to those successful in their loan applications.\" The call for more competition in small business banking, an area in which RBS and Lloyds Banking Group are the major players, was also made by the EEF, the manufacturers' organisation. \"Government must also now conduct a focused three-month review on ways of bringing more private competition to bear in UK SME banking, including an explicit switching incentive or, the creation of a standard data portal for new challengers to assess potential new customers\" said Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF. Hopley called on the government to use its business bank \u2013 the details of which are still being worked on \u2013 to do more to bolster lending. Labour agreed. Chris Leslie said: \"It's time the government listened to Labour's calls for a British investment bank that's properly backed by the Treasury and not just a re-badging of existing schemes.\" The Treasury said it was too early to judge the FLS. The Treasury minister, Sajid Javid, said: \"It's still early in the life of scheme, but funding for lending has already helped to deliver half a billion in loans for households and businesses. Though it will take time to fully feed through, this positive data shows participating banks are increasing their lending.\"",

CWC is keeping a 75% stake in Monaco Telecom but has the right to sell it to Batelco within 12 months for another $345m.

Things began well enough following good manufacturing data from China and a better than expected purchasing managers' index number from the UK, as well as further details of Greece's bond buying programme.

      "bodyText": "Cable &amp; Wireless Communications has begun its restructuring with a near $1bn disposal. The company has sold the bulk of its businesses in the Monaco &amp; Islands division for an initial $680m in cash to Bahrain communications group Batelco. CWC is keeping a 75% stake in Monaco Telecom but has the right to sell it to Batelco within 12 months for another $345m. The deal is part of the group's strategy to reduce its geographical spread and focus on central America and the Caribbean, with its Macau business also currently on the block. The news lifted CWC shares more than 1% to 35.1p but they came off their early highs. The same was true of the market in general. Things began well enough following good manufacturing data from China and a better than expected purchasing managers' index number from the UK, as well as further details of Greece's bond buying programme. But a slowdown in US manufacturing as evidenced by Novembers ISM survey took the shine off, and the FTSE 100 finished just 4.42 points higher at 5871.24. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index said: The FTSE 100 rallied 17 points to briefly breach the psychologically important 5900 level but a sell off from this level of resistance is yet again something that needs to be watched. A failure to break above 5900 soon could prevent the FTSE 100 from enjoying a 'santa rally', whilst a sell off below 5860 and 5800 could indicate a potential correction of 3%-5%.

She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Among economists, analysts and even government officials there is widespread scepticism about the scheme. Speaking on the state-run TV channel NET this morning, finance experts described the buyback operation as \u201cvery problematic\u201d with many calling it the most difficult part of the latest EU-IMF backed attempt to rescue Greece.</p> <p>\u201cA big part of the bonds that have been issued are in the hands of hedge funds,\u201d said prominent economics professor <strong>Charalambos Gotsis</strong>, adding that investors had acquired them earlier in the summer at very good rates. \u201cWith Greece no longer facing the scenario of a Grexit, it is debatable whether they will want to part with them,\u201d added Gotsis who reckoned that hedge funds had acquired around \u20ac20bn worth of the government bonds.</p> <p>Greek banks, which hold an estimated \u20ac15bn of the new bonds, have also opposed the scheme claiming it will put them in the onerous position of having to forfeit potential profits.</p> <p>Their stance prompted Prime Minister Antonis Samaras to insist over the weekend that banks would actually benefit from the deal as the value of the bonds they held was far lower. Samaras, who is acutely aware that Greece\u2019s next \u20ac44bn loan tranche is dependent on the buyback (with officials saying it will pare back the country\u2019s debt load by at least \u20ac30bn), also quashed speculation that Greek pension funds would be part of the transaction. \u201cThe banks\u2019 reaction undoubtedly played a role in the offer being better than expected,\u201d said one insider referring to government prices being more generous than anticipated [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/03/eurozone-crisis-greece-bond-buyback-launched#block-50bc651db57953a96fb90baf\">as explained at 8.38am</a>]</p> </blockquote> <p>But, interestingly, Greek finance ministry officials this morning did not rule out the scheme being extended beyond the official close of the deal at 5pm Friday, adds Helena.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>'If it doesn\u2019t go well then logically [the scheme] will be extended,' said one finance ministry official.

      "bodyText": "Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras will present the details of Greece's bond buyback to fellow finance chiefs this evening. With the eurogroup meeting of finance ministers underway, including Greece and Cypus on the agenda, here's a quick rundown of the day's events: Greece released more details of its bond buying programme There was a downbeat picture from the eurozone manufacturing surveys... ..better news for UK manufacturers But a disappointing US survey Spain made an official bank (not sovereign) bailout request France's central bank boss causes controversy with City comments And with that, it's time to close up for another evening. Thanks for the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. European markets have closed for the day and some of the early optimism has faded. Details of the Greek bailout plan and news of a formal bank bailout request from Spain, added to some reasonable Chinese and UK manufacturing surveys helped sentiment initially. But markets came off their best levels after a disappointing US manufacturing reading. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 0.08% or 4.42 points \u2022 Germany's Dax was 0.4% better \u2022 France's Cac climbed 0.26% \u2022 Spain's Ibex edged 0.57% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.43% \u2022 The Athens market turned in a strong performance, up 1.27% \u2022 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.11% Still, we could see better times on the way, it seems, after this afternoon's news from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: Earlier, Germany finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and his French counterpart were very negative on the idea of extending the concessions granted to Greece to Ireland and Portugal. According to RTE, Pierre Mosocvici, said: \"This situation [ie in Portugal and Ireland] is not the same [as Greece]. I don't believe you should try to copy the solution.\" And Sch\u00e4uble said: \"Neither Ireland nor Portugal have put this idea to me.\" RTE's full report is here. Economist Carl Weinberg at High Frequency Economics has seemingly thrown the cat among the pigeons. Said by Barron\u2019s to be \"sought after as much for his provocative views on the global economies as for his deep experience\", Weinberg has apparently turned his attention to the powerhouse of Europe after Moody's downgraded the EU bailout funds late on Friday: Heading into the close for European markets and the poor US manufacturing numbers have burst the earlier bubble of enthusiasm. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Optimism over Greece's debt buyback plan and a perception that economic contraction in Europe may be bottoming out saw markets push up to their highest levels in weeks, however a disappointing US ISM manufacturing number saw markets slip back again. Here are some early pictures from the Eurogroup meeting as it gets underway. A Spanish tax amnesty has raised just half the amount expected. The country's treasury ministry said the amnesty - which offered a reduced 10% rate on up to five years of previously undeclared earnings - brought in \u20ac1.2bn. That was far short of the \u20ac2.5bn target for 2012. Remarks by the French central bank boss to the Financial Times (\u00a3) seemingly hitting out at the City of London are causing some ructions. From Brussels, Ian Traynor writes: As eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels this evening and ahead of EU governments gathering tomorrow to hammer out an agreement on a single banking supervisor for the eurozone, EU and British officials are worried about the threat to the single market delivered by France\u2019s central bank chief, Christian Noyer. Noyer told the FT in Hong Kong that the euro\u2019s financial centre should be shifted from the City to Paris or Frankfurt as there was \u201cno rationale\u201d for it being \u201coffshore\". Britain is worried about tomorrow\u2019s meeting of finance ministers which is supposed to make the European Central Bank in Frankfurt the new supervisor for all eurozone banks because it fears it will be outvoted on matters of banking regulation by a eurozone caucus and the ECB. Noyer\u2019s controversial intervention was seen as proof that the UK was right to be \u201cparanoid\u201d about eurozone banking ambitions. \u201cVery bad statement and timing,\u201d said an EU official. The European Commission could also be put on the spot over the French demand as it is the guardian of the single market and Britain would be likely to take legal action if need be to preserve its single market rights. The UK is already engaged in litigation against the ECB at the European Court of Justice on similar grounds over \u201clocation policy\u201d, contesting ECB demands that clearing of euro transactions should be the preserve of the eurozone and not take place in London. In the negotiations on Tuesday, Germany will be fighting a rearguard action to limit the scope of the new banking supervisor to avoid any interference in the operations of its dozens of small Sparkassen or savings banks. The Noyer remarks are seen in Brussels as having diverted attention from the German dispute and turning the spotlight away from Berlin on to London. And here's one reported response from the coalition: Now here's the other US manufacturing survey and following a positive reading on the Markit index, we've got something less optimistic. According to the Institute for Supply Management, US manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in November, hitting its lowest level in three years. The ISM index fell to 49.5 last month, down from 51.7 in October and lower than the forecast 51.3. As a reminder, anything below 50 marks a contraction in activity. The fall follows two months of growth. Wall Street, which had edged into positive territory after the previous indicator from Markit, has now slipped back, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a couple of points. French president Francois Hollande and Italian PM Mario Monti have repeated the \"euro is irreversible\" line at a joint press conference in Lyons. Monti has also said the spread between Italian and German bonds was still not acceptable although it was on a pleasing downward trend. Then he reportedly added: Meanwhile, in the European parliament, the German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble said solutions to the eurozone crisis can only be found step by step. Here's some more expert comment on today's Greek bond swap (via the Reuters terminal): Ricardo Barbieri, strategist at Mizuho [The pricing] indicates they really want the swap to succeed. Some investors might be tempted to participate in the swap because of the ability to simplify their position, should they wish to maintain exposure to Greece, otherwise an opportunity to exit totally, completely their positions at a level that is better than Friday's close. Stuart Thomson, manager of the Ignis Strategic Bond fund. This is just another milepost on Greece's road to Hell, which is of course, paved with good intentions. The success of this buyback depends on the hedge funds and very much on their calculation whether a holdout could eventually get them more, or whether they will face a haircut in the next round. I've got to scoot now, so Nick Fletcher is your host. Cheers all. GW In the comments section below, 200gnomes points out that I've not mentioned claims that ex-Greek PM George Papandreou's mother appears on the list of Greek tax evaders. Not a conspiracy of silence \u2013 more that I\"m not really sure what to make of the story. Anyway, the raw facts are that two Greek newspapers, \u201cTo Vima\u201d and \u201cProto Thema\u201d, reported yesterday that Margaret Papandreou (89) is on the Lagarde List, and has \u20ac550m squirreled away in a Swiss bank account. The claims (which would be absolute dynamite if true) have been very strongly denied by the Papandreou clan, with Mrs P claiming the family were being victimised for having \"never served this country\u2019s interest groups\u201d (a claim that left TheGribbler despairing in the comments below). The FT has more details of the denial (\u00a3). We may have more details later. Another positive piece of industrial data \u2013 America's manufacturing PMI (as measured by Markit) rose in November to 52.8, up from 51 in October. That means growth accelerated during the month. A sub-index that tracks new orders also rose, suggesting that the US economy is ending 2012 in better shape than much of Europe. Confusingly, we'll have another manufacturing PMI reading later this afternoon (the ISM one). The cost of the financial crisis will linger for decades, and the bill could still be being paid off in two generation's time. So warned Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's executive director of financial stability, in an interview on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme. Haldane explained that in terms of the loss of incomes and outputs, this is as bad as a world war (elaborating on a point he made in late October when he applauded the Occupy movement). Nick Sutton, the show's editor, has the key quotes: The whole programme's online here, and you can here Haldane's section here on Audioboo. Reuters has the full details of the Spanish bank bailout request: Spain on Monday requested formally the disbursement of \u20ac39.5bn ($51.4bn) of European funds to recapitalise its crippled banking sector, the Economy Ministry said in a statement. The money - \u20ac37bn for the four nationalised banks Bankia, Catalunya Banc, NCG Banco and Banco de Valencia and \u20ac2.5bn for the so-called \"bad bank\" - should be paid to the state's banking fund FROB around Dec. 12, it added. Eurozone finance ministers are expected to approve the disbursement later on Monday when they meet in Brussels for their monthly meeting. The \u20ac37bn figure was approved by the EC last week (and covered in Wednesday's blog). Just in: Spain has officially requested a bailout for its banking sector. A statement issued in the last couple of minutes shows that the aid would be dispersed to Madrid on or around 12 December. To be clear, this isn't the long-anticipated request for a full-blown bailout \u2013 it's the application to recapitalise the battered banking sector (agreed in principle this summer). The news caused a little flurry in the financial markets, sending German bond prices falling and pushing the euro to a new six-week high against the dollar ($1.3075). One fund manager reckons computer-based trading systems (the algorithmic systems that react almost instantly to the latest news) may have got confused ... Two different sets of anti-austerity protests have been taking place in Athens today. One involves municipal workers, who are continuing to demonstrate against plans to lay off staff across the state sector (as part of the austerity plan demanded by the Troika): The second protest is taking place to mark the International Day of People with Disability, with a group demonstrating against cuts to Greek welfare spending. Disability groups say that Greece's austerity programmes have deprived many people of their benefits. Here's some more photos from Athens: Italian government debt have been strengthening this morning, pushing down their yield (the interest rate on the bonds). And in the last couple of minutes the spread between Italian and German 10-year bonds has dropped below 300 basis points mark for the first time since March. Italy's 10-year bond yield: 4.39%, down 11 basis points Germany's 10-year bond yield: 1.418%, up 3 basis points. Another fillip for those who reckon the eurozone crisis is petering out (or at least entering a calmer phase) Looks like the comments section has been fixed - thanks for your patience. Apologies again for the disruption. Back to the Greek bond swap plan \u2013 and in Athens the central bank of Greece has just stated that the deal opens the way for economic recovery. In a statement, it said A new start is now possible. [The deal] creates plausible expectations of a recovery of the Greek economy, perhaps even earlier than projected at present. But before that happens, the Bank of Greece sees more pain ahead. It predicted that GDP would shrink by 'slightly more than 6%' in 2012, and another 4.5% in 2013, before 'positive growth' finally returns in 2014. We've plotted this morning's manufacturing data (see 9.44am onwards) on one graph, showing how the main eurozone countries and the UK have performed: This afternoon's Eurogroup meeting of euro finance ministers is the fourth in as many weeks. Luke Baker of Reuters reckons they're approaching their half century of crunch gatherings since the crisis began. Canaryatthewharf made a similar point in the comments section below: Hopefully we can start focusing soon on wider issues than just the euro-zone if the debt buy back works and Greece gets sufficient cash to function until end-2013. But are we really approaching a lull? Economists and assorted experts are divided, between those who reckon the eurozone isn't getting the credit for the decisive progress made in recent months, and those who reckon policymakers have only papered over the cracks. This little exchange on twitter between economist Megan Greene (bearish) and journalist Joe Weisenthal (bullish) shows the opposing views. Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith says the debt buyback has got a mixed reception this morning. She writes: Among economists, analysts and even government officials there is widespread scepticism about the scheme. Speaking on the state-run TV channel NET this morning, finance experts described the buyback operation as \u201cvery problematic\u201d with many calling it the most difficult part of the latest EU-IMF backed attempt to rescue Greece. \u201cA big part of the bonds that have been issued are in the hands of hedge funds,\u201d said prominent economics professor Charalambos Gotsis, adding that investors had acquired them earlier in the summer at very good rates. \u201cWith Greece no longer facing the scenario of a Grexit, it is debatable whether they will want to part with them,\u201d added Gotsis who reckoned that hedge funds had acquired around \u20ac20bn worth of the government bonds. Greek banks, which hold an estimated \u20ac15bn of the new bonds, have also opposed the scheme claiming it will put them in the onerous position of having to forfeit potential profits. Their stance prompted Prime Minister Antonis Samaras to insist over the weekend that banks would actually benefit from the deal as the value of the bonds they held was far lower. Samaras, who is acutely aware that Greece\u2019s next \u20ac44bn loan tranche is dependent on the buyback (with officials saying it will pare back the country\u2019s debt load by at least \u20ac30bn), also quashed speculation that Greek pension funds would be part of the transaction. \u201cThe banks\u2019 reaction undoubtedly played a role in the offer being better than expected,\u201d said one insider referring to government prices being more generous than anticipated [as explained at 8.38am] But, interestingly, Greek finance ministry officials this morning did not rule out the scheme being extended beyond the official close of the deal at 5pm Friday, adds Helena. 'If it doesn\u2019t go well then logically [the scheme] will be extended,' said one finance ministry official. 'But let\u2019s not jump the gun and talk about failure before it has even got off the ground.' Looks like we're having a few technical glitches with the Guardian's comment system at the moment.... Apologies for that (I don't think I've broken anything). Hoping it will be resolved shortly.... The UK's manufacturing sector has crawled its way back towards growth, with a PMI of 49.7 in November. That's much better than October's 47.7, and better than analysts had expected. Just slightly below stagnation isn't great - but it suggests the sector might be staging a recovery. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, warned that the eurozone's manufacturing sector remains in a \"severe downturn\", following the news that the slowdown eased last month (see 9.44am). Williamson said: The ongoing steep pace of manufacturing decline suggests that the region\u2019s recession will have deepened in the final quarter of the year, extending into a third successive quarter. With official data lagging the PMI, the rate of GDP decline is likely to have gathered pace markedly on the surprisingly modest 0.1% decline seen in the third quarter. There is also reason to be optimistic, though: Production and employment look set to fall at reduced rates in coming months as export demand slowly revives in markets such as the US and Asia. However... the ongoing uncertainty caused by the region\u2019s debt crisis means business confidence clearly remains fragile and companies continue to focus on tight cost control, meaning any robust recovery still looks a long way off and prone to a set-back if the crisis worsens. It's one of those mornings when we're inundated with manufacturing data for the previous month from across the global economy (via Markit) Today's Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) paint a mixed picture - so here are the highlights (and as a reminder, any number below 50 = contraction). \u2022 The eurozone's manufacturing sector's PMI of 46.2 for November was the highest since March, but means the sector has now shrunk for the last 16 months \u2022 Germany kept shrinking, with a PMI of 46.8, up from 46.0 in October. \u2022 France's manufacturing output fell sharply again, with a PMI of just 44.5, up from October's 43.7. [garble corrected - thanks madeupname2 !] \u2022 Greece's manufacturing sector continued to contract sharply, with a PMI of just 41.8 (slightly better than October's 41.0). The euro has risen in value this morning following the Greek debt swap announcement, up nearly half a cent against the US dollar at $1.303. The single currency has shrugged off the news that Moody's cut the triple-A rating of the European Stability Mechanism euro rescue fund late on Friday. But Kit Juckes, Global macro strategist at SocGen, isn't impressed: Those bright sparks at Reuters have created an interactive Greek bond buyback calculator, which lets you work out how much Athens could slice off its debt mountain through the swap. It's here. Remember that the buyback cost can't exceed \u20ac10bn (the maximum amount of new bonds that Greece plans to offer in exchange). Playing around with it, I can get Greece's savings up to \u20ac52bn.... Interestingly, today's offer appears to be a little more generous than had been indicated a week ago. When the deal was announced, the eurogroup suggested that Greece would pay no more than the previous Friday's closing price. Today's prices are higher - perhaps an indication that Greece simply can't let the deal fail. Greek sovereign debt is rallying in early trading as traders absorb the details of the bond swap announced this morning. Via the Reuters terminal: \u2022 GREEK BOND MATURING 2023 PRICE RISES 2.675 ON DAY TO 37.8670 \u2022 GREEK BOND MATURING 2042 PRICE RISES 1.544 ON DAY TO 29.729 Those prices are both slightly below the minimum that Greece is proposing to pay (the official statement has the full chart), suggesting some uncertainty over the deal's chances. And this image shows how the value of the 2023 bond rose this morning (from just a third of its face value). You can download the official statement from the Greek ministry of finance here (in English). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis - and other key events in the world economy. We can start with some breaking news: Greece has officially launched a scheme to buy back its debt from private investors. This scheme is a crucial part of the new deal for Athens agreed a week ago. It needs to succeed to unlock the \u20ac44bn of rescue loans due to Greece. In the last few minutes, The Hellenic Republic ministry of finance announced it will offer holders of Greek debt the chance to swap their bonds for up to \u20ac10bn of six-month bills. Investors will be offered the chance to swap their Greek bonds for a maximum price of between 40.1% and 32.2% of their face value (depending on their maturity). It will work like a \"Dutch auction\" - with Greece starting with a low offer and raising it until investors bite. The deal will run all week \u2013 concluding at 5pm Friday 7 December. The results will then be announced as soon \"as reasonably practicable\". But the Hellenic Republic also cautioned that the swap can only proceed if it meets \"all of the conditions under a financing agreement entered into with the European Financial Stability Facility\" \u2013 which is providing the funds for the swap. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras is due to present the findings to the rest of the eurozone this evening in Brussels. I'll be tracking the reaction to the debt swap plan, as well as other key events through the day. That will include a splurge of manufacturing data that will show how global industry is coping with the crisis.",

The announcement should be received well as a deal like this has been perceived as difficult to execute due to the geographic spread of the assets and the requirement to try and align eleven different governments. We are now more confident in management's ability to execute deals at good multiples, which is pertinent as we believe negotiations to sell Macau are still on-going. Overall, leading shares have edged higher after good manufacturing data from China and a better than expected purchasing managers' index number from the UK. The FTSE 100 is up 14.40 points at 5881.22, with mining groups lifted by the Chinese news. Vedanta Resources has risen 22p to \u00a310.93 and Kazakhmys has climbed 15p to 728.5p. Schroders is the top of the pile, up 53p at \u00a316.49 after analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch moved from neutral to buy. The bank said: We have liked Schroders as a business for some time, but now believe that the combination of strong positioning and a supportive backdrop outweighs the disadvantage of an over-padded balance sheet.",

      "bodyText": "Amazon, Google and Starbucks have been accused of an \"immoral\" use of secretive jurisdictions, royalties and complex company structures to avoid paying tax on British profits by a committee of MPs. A hard-hitting report released on Monday by the Commons public accounts committee, the parliamentary spending watchdog, also criticises HM Revenue &amp; Customs for being \"way too lenient\" in negotiations with corporations which pay little or no corporation tax. It calls on the government to draw up laws to close loopholes and name and shame companies that fail to pay their fair share. The report's scheduled release, following a humiliating parliamentary session for the three multinationals' executives, prompted a flurry of media activity over the weekend. On Saturday night, Starbucks announced that it is reviewing its tax approach to Britain with a view to paying more following widespread criticism of the coffee chain's tax regime. George Osborne will on Monday announce an extra \u00a377m a year for two years for more staff at Revenue &amp; Customs to pursue companies which avoid paying tax. The chancellor said the extra investment would help secure an extra \u00a32bn a year in unpaid tax. He is also expected to confirm a deal with Switzerland which the chancellor hopes will raise more than \u00a35bn in previously uncollected taxes from Swiss bank accounts over the next six years. Danny Alexander, the Treasury chief secretary, said of the Starbucks statement: \"I am delighted they are taking this issue seriously and they are listening to the feedback from their UK taxpaying customers.\" He too had been boycotting Starbucks. \"I might be able to buy a coffee from Starbucks again soon.\" Margaret Hodge, the chair of the PAC, said its report showed that corporations had been allowed to get away with \"ripping off\" taxpayers because of a weak tax authority, poor legislation and a lack of international co-operation. \"Global corporations with huge operations in the UK generating significant amounts of income are getting away with paying little or no corporation tax here. This is an insult to British business and individuals who pay their fair share. \"Corporation tax revenues have fallen at a time when securing proper income from taxes is more vital than ever. \"The inescapable conclusion is that multinationals are using structures and exploiting current tax legislation to move offshore profits that are clearly generated from economic activity in the UK,\" she said. Executives from the multinationals who appeared before the committee last month were singled out for criticism. Responses to questions by Andrew Cecil, Amazon's director of public policy, were \"evasive\", \"unprepared\" and lacking credibility. The company's UK website reported a turnover of \u00a3207m for 2011, but its tax bill was just \u00a31.8m. Amazon avoids UK taxes by reporting European sales through a Luxembourg-based unit, MPs alleged. This structure allowed it to pay a rate of less than 12% on foreign profits last year \u2013 less than half the average corporate income tax rate in its major markets. Troy Alstead, Starbucks' global chief financial officer, claimed that the firm has lost money in the 15 years it has been operating in the UK except in 2006. The world's biggest coffee chain paid \u00a38.6m in total UK tax over 13 years during which it recorded sales of \u00a33.1bn. Alstead's claim was \"difficult to believe\" when contrasted with boasts of success sent to shareholders, according to the report. Starbucks has been able to cut its tax bill, MPs said, by paying fees to other parts of its global business, such as royalty payments for use of the brand. Google had \u00a32.5bn of UK sales last year, but despite having a group-wide profit margin of 33%, its main UK unit had a tax charge of \u00a33.4m in 2011. The company avoids UK tax by channelling non-US sales via Ireland, an arrangement that has allowed it to pay taxes at a rate of 3.2% on non-US profits. It also diverts some profits through Bermuda. Revenue &amp; Customs has been asked by the committee to be bolder in challenging tax avoidance by multinationals and to be ready to prosecute if necessary. \"Top officials need to challenge the status quo and be more assertive, for example in accepting that excessive levels of royalty payments are appropriate when businesses are making a loss,\" the report states. Benchmarks for common charges such as royalty payments and intellectual property rights could be published by the Treasury or tax officials. A company's tax practices should also be made part of its mandatory reporting requirements, which would increase transparency, the MPs say. The government and the tax authorities should also take a greater lead internationally in closing loopholes and increasing transparency in tax havens, particularly across Europe, the report concludes. Osborne told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show that he will work closely with France and Germany to close tax loopholes. \"It will be a big priority for the G7, G8, which we host next year,\" he said. A spokesman for HMRC said it had reduced tax avoidance by large businesses in recent years. \"We relentlessly challenge those that persist in avoiding tax and have recovered \u00a329bn additional revenues from large businesses in the last six years, including \u00a34.1bn in the last four years from transfer pricing inquiries alone. These figures speak for themselves.''",
