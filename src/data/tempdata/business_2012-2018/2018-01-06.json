      "bodyText": "Shares are expensive \u2013 keep buying them. That appears to be investors\u2019 consensus view. The storming run for stock markets in 2017 seemed almost too good to be trusted, but 2018 has started in similar style. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average soared past 25,000 last week, almost exactly 12 months after 20,000 was achieved. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index stands at a record high. Even the Japanese market, for years an international laggard, is back at a 26-year high. Last year the MSCI World index \u2013 a proxy for a global stock market \u2013 delivered a return of 20.1%. Optimists expect more of the same. The other camp warns that a dangerous bubble is about to burst. Both sides could probably agree that the recent run in stock markets has been astonishing. Or, rather, the truly remarkable feature has been the steady and unbroken pace of the march upwards. Stock markets, we used to think, offered thrills, spills and rollercoaster rides. Individual shares still provide such excitement, of course, but the overall market seems bizarrely free of stress. Andrew Lapthorne, who crunches the market numbers for French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, called 2017 \u201cthe year volatility died\u201d in his end-of-year round-up. He wrote: \u201cThose of us expecting greater market turbulence in 2017 could not have been more wrong. Not only did global equity markets perform well, but they did so with such low volatility and consistency that, if this were a fund, it would perhaps merit a visit from the authorities to check exactly what you were up to.\u201d What happened? First, investors seem to have decided that rising interest rates in the US, a big worry a year ago, are not the bogeyman they seemed. The US Federal Reserve has been a protective nurse. Rate rises have been gradual, and ultra-cheap money has been followed by very cheap. A US rate of 1.5% ain\u2019t so bad. Second, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, amid its chaos and crises, has delivered the policy investors in companies cared about most: corporate tax cuts. Maybe a growth-generating splurge on infrastructure, the second part of his economic agenda, will follow. There are no certainties in investment, but the \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d theory is plainly credible. Kenneth Taubes, chief US investment officer at Amundi, Europe\u2019s largest asset manager, reckons the US reforms are \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cnot fully priced into the market\u201d. \u201cLooking into 2018, we believe that the concerns about a bubble for US equities are overdone,\u201d he says. \u201cCompared to past crises [2000, 2007], we don\u2019t see excess in terms of flows. Mergers and acquisitions will likely revive and support the market now that the tax reform has been legislated. Financial conditions are still benign. We expect that the combined impact of an improving US economy, a stronger global economy and lower taxes will support earnings per share growth.\u201d That won\u2019t silence those who worry about a bubble. On hard and traditional measures such as dividend yields, the US shares look plain over-valued. Prices have climbed so high that the average yield on stocks in the S&amp;P 500, the broadest US index, has slipped below 2%. That implies huge faith in companies\u2019 ability to crank up dividends even further, despite profit margins already being fat. Or take your pick of any number of signs of market madness elsewhere: the Bitcoin craze; or the fact that European junk bonds, which are supposed to be high risk, were yielding less than safe-as-houses US Treasury notes last month. Amid it all, geopolitics seems to have been forgotten. North Korea? Iran? Saudi Arabia? An imploding US presidency? A Chinese slowdown? None has upset financial markets \u2013 yet. Accurately predicting the timing of the bursting of the bubble, if it exists, is tricky, of course, which is why the forecast of a possible \u201cmelt-up\u201d by the normally cautious Jeremy Grantham is so intriguing (see below). Is a melt-up \u2013 a last wild fling for highly valued markets \u2013 credible? It\u2019s certainly plausible because it\u2019s happened in the past. To many minds, the dotcom mania seemed crazed in 1998. Then the US tech-heavy Nasdaq index gained 85% in 1999 before the inevitable crash arrived in 2000. Silly things happen in financial markets. \u2018Inflated asset prices and valuations:\u2019 Neil Woodford Neil Woodford, Britain\u2019s best-known fund manager and a proud contrarian, spent 2017 becoming increasingly sceptical about valuations in many areas of the stock markets. By the end of the year \u2013 a poor one for his funds \u2013 he was convinced an unsustainable investment bubble had formed and was about to burst. \u201cTen years on from the global financial crisis, we are witnessing the product of the biggest monetary policy experiment in history,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInvestors have forgotten about risk and this is playing out in inflated asset prices and inflated valuations \u2026 There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count.\u201d One flashing light was the extreme difference between the performance of US \u201cvalue\u201d stocks \u2013 the type of reliable profit and dividend-earners he tends to prefer \u2013 and \u201cgrowth\u201d companies. The disparity was \u201cgreater than at any stage in stock market history\u201d, Woodford said \u2013 yes, even including the 1929 Wall Street crash. Woodford, who manages \u00a315bn, famously sat out the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and cleaned up afterwards. He sees echoes of those days but thinks there are more similarities with the \u201cNifty Fifty\u201d bubble in US markets in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was led by companies such as Coca-Cola and IBM. \u201cThe few stocks that are perceived to be capable of delivering dependable growth have become very popular, and that popularity has manifested itself in extreme and unsustainable valuations,\u201d he argues. He has sold a few beneficiaries of this trend, such as household and healthcare group Reckitt Benckiser, on the grounds that it is a good but overvalued company. He sees opportunity in domestically focused UK stocks, just as he did in 1992 after the sterling devaluation that followed the UK\u2019s chaotic crash out of European exchange rate mechanism, the forerunner of the euro. In Woodford\u2019s view, the UK economy is fundamentally healthy in 2018, with more people in work, more wage growth, less inflation, more investment spending and a continued recovery in manufacturing and exports. He is buying UK housebuilders, construction companies, retailers, leisure stocks and property. As for Brexit worries, he thinks they\u2019re as overdone as the turn-of-the-century hysteria surrounding the \u201cmillennium bug\u201d, when it was feared that computers couldn\u2019t handle the transition from 1999 to 2000. \u2018Look out for extremes of euphoria\u2019: Jeremy Grantham Brace yourself for a stock market \u201cmelt-up\u201d, said Jeremy Grantham this week \u2013 a startling prediction from a generally bearish investor, who is regarded as one of most insightful historians of financial bubbles. Grantham is the British-born veteran fund manager who in 1977 co-founded Boston-based GMO, which today manages $75bn (\u00a355bn) of assets. The firm\u2019s fame partly derives from its skill in having identified, and dodged, the last two big market blow-ups \u2013 the dotcom bubble of 1998-2000 and the US housing crisis that preceded the financial crash of 2007-09. His \u201cmelt-up\u201d theory starts from the premise that, yes, markets \u2013 or, specifically, the US stock market \u2013 are highly priced. The data is \u201cclean and factual\u201d, he says. \u201cWe can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high.\u201d But there\u2019s more to bubbles than just high prices, he argues. \u201cAmong other factors, indicators of extremes of euphoria seem much more important than price.\u201d Grantham\u2019s argument, in essence, is that signs of real frenzy \u2013 the wild excess that accompanies the late stage of bubbles \u2013 are only starting to fall into place now. \u201cWe know we\u2019re not there yet, but we can perhaps see some early movement,\u201d he says. Bitcoin, for example, is \u201ca true, crazy mini-bubble of its own\u201d. He defines a bubble as being \u201cexcellent fundamentals euphorically extrapolated\u201d. In recent years, market fundamentals have been disappointing \u2013 share prices, in the old phrase, were \u201cclimbing the wall of worry\u201d. Now, though, the fundamentals are improving, creating conditions for excess. President Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts are \u201cvery likely to further fatten the corporate share of the GDP pie and perhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising\u201d, Grantham says. There\u2019s another, more technical, point: the rise in the US market (perhaps unlike the Brexit-influenced UK one) has been broadly based. In classic bubbles, the market tends to be led higher in its last stage by an increasingly small collection of \u201cwinners\u201d, whose gains outweigh the majority of \u201closers\u201d. That process hasn\u2019t happened yet in the US. A word of warning. Grantham isn\u2019t saying a \u201cmelt-up\u201d phase is certain; he\u2019s merely saying it is likely within the next six months to two years. And if \u201cmelt-up\u201d happens, then prepare for meltdown: Grantham thinks there would be a 90% chance that the US market would fall 50% from its peak. CRAZY TIMES, CRAZY PRICES Salvator Mundi Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s painting of Jesus Christ was sold at auction for $450m in November, about three times more than expected and way beyond the previous record. When Picasso\u2019s Les Femmes d\u2019Alger fetched $179m in 2015, the auctioneer who sold the cubist masterpiece predicted the figure would not be exceeded at auction for a decade. Bitcoin The cryptocurrency is a bigger speculative gamble than the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s and the South Sea bubble of the 1720s, according to calculations by asset manager GMO. The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman says of Bitcoin: \u201cThere\u2019s been no demonstration yet that it actually is helpful in conducting economic transactions. There\u2019s no anchor for its value.\u201d Just Eat The fast-food delivery company joined the FTSE 100 index at the end of last year. It is worth \u00a35.5bn, slightly more than Sainsbury\u2019s, whose profits are about five times as great. Sovereign debt Argentina has defaulted on its debts eight times in the past 200 years, most recently in 2001. So who would want to buy a sovereign-backed bond that matures in 100 years\u2019 time? Plenty of people, it seems. Argentina\u2019s issue of $2.75bn of bonds last June was heavily oversubscribed. NP",
