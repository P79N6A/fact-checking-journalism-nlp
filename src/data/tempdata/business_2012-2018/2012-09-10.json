There was even an inexplicable 1% who claimed to long for the sweary living nightmare of working with shouty monster chef Gordon Ramsay. That must have been a joke. It'll be the same people who voted for Wagner on The X Factor and put \"Jedi\" as their religion on the census. It's as if some people don't take privately commissioned polls designed to create headline-grabbing pseudo-statistics seriously. Shocking. Indeed. But let's park the cynicism and get back to Branson. Sure. What makes people think he's so great, then? According to the poll, the most important trait we want in a boss is that they make the people working for them feel comfortable. And Branson's good at that, is he? He certainly comes across as a pretty easygoing kind of guy. You have to be fairly liberal to instruct your executives \u2013 as Branson did last year \u2013 to actively attempt to hire \"as many ex-convicts as possible\". Fair point. It also probably didn't do any harm that he's known for flying out rank-and-file employees for lavish holidays on his private Caribbean island. But what do the people who haven't been whisked away to a private island think of him? You'd have to ask a Virgin employee on that one. Although they'd probably tell you: \"I don't really interact with him much myself.\" Do say: \"You're the boss!\" (To people who aren't actually your boss.) Don't say: \"You're not the boss of me!\" (To your boss.)",

Whatever else Xstrata shareholders think about Glencore's improved terms (and there's a wide range of views out there), there's no campaign to save Bond and install him as chairman of a Glenstrata combo. Bond's first mistake in February was to agree an all-share deal with a tiny takeover premium of 8%. The rationale then was that the two companies were merging as equals. Yeah, right. The merger-of-equals idea was always a nonsense, as Glasenberg has now brutally demonstrated with his proposal that Xstrata chief Mick Davis must go, albeit with six months to say his goodbyes. So much for Glasenberg's previous acquiescence with the line that Davis' presence was critical to future operational success. What Glasenberg really thinks is he can do a better job himself. Bond's second mistake was to propose an absurdly generous \u00a3170m retention package for Davis and 80 Xstrata executives, supposedly to protect the interests of shareholders in a \"merged\" company. On this logic, it is now more dangerous for Xstrata shareholders to accept Glencore paper because the new deal is closer to a takeover, with Davis departing early. But it's a tricky argument to make because Bond was prepared to deal at 2.8. Refusing to recommend 3.05 will look \u2013 fairly or not \u2013 like an attempt to protect Xstrata management's bumper rewards. In other words, Bond has cut the negotiating ground from beneath his own feet. What should he have done? Recognised at the outset that the merger-of-equals idea was a nonsense; championed Xstrata's long-term prospects as a standalone company; and invited Glasenberg to pay up in full for 100% control. Keep it simple, in other words, and appeal to the loyalty of shareholders. Yes, we all know that having a 34% shareholder makes life uncomfortable. But the net result now is that Xstrata's shareholders are in serious danger of receiving a takeover premium of just 17% on the pre-talks level. If you're in Glencore's shoes, the figure is 27% because of the weakness in Xstrata's share price after the fall in commodity prices this year. Okay, but Bond &amp; co could surely have reached, and probably surpassed, even that figure if they had employed some Glasenberg-style hardball tactics at the outset. Time was on their side: Xstrata did not need to be taken over in 2012. The better moment to enter talks was 2015, when outsiders can better judge whether the heavy investment spending of the past couple of years has paid off. Of course, Qatar Holding, with 12% of Xstrata, could yet spring a surprise by refusing Glencore's new proposal and continuing to buy shares. That would spare Bond's blushes. But it's not the way to bet. Instead, Glasenberg looks to be close to achieving a successful bear hug, the very thing Bond was there to guard against.",

      "bodyText": "The reputation of Barclays bank took an enormous blow during the Libor rate-fixing scandal, a YouGov poll reveals, plunging its standing to below the depths endured by oil company BP during the 2010 Gulf of Mexico blowout when 11 rig workers were killed. This year has been an annus horribilis for Britain's banks, with NatWest/Royal Bank of Scotland suffering a serious computer glitch, HSBC fined for money laundering in Mexico, and a Lloyds employee admitting major fraud. But it was the reputation of Barclays \u2013 after it was fined for fixing Libor interest rates \u2013 that declined most sharply. The reputational score of Barclays declined from +5 to -40 on YouGov's \"favourability brand index\", which asks a representative sample of the public how proud or embarrassed they would be to work for an organisation. The fall of 45 percentage points is more than twice as large as the equivalent falls for NatWest (from +6 to -20) and its bailed-out parent, RBS (from -12 to -29) just after the crisis in their computer systems had left customers unable to access accounts. BP's scored fell to -33 during the Deepwater disaster but has now recovered to a far less exceptional -16. Additional YouGov polling ahead of a conference in Cambridge this week on reputational issues, in which the Guardian is the media partner, found that Barclays came last for \"favourability\" among the major banks while Co-operative Bank has a higher score than even the BBC. YouGov's conclusion that banks are held in low regard by the public comes on the eve of the first public hearing by the new parliamentary standards committee on banking which was set up by the coalition following the Libor scandal. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP chairing the committee, has called City veteran Sir David Walker to give evidence on Wednesday about his work on banking ethics for Labour after the banking crisis, rather than in his new capacity as chairman-designate of Barclays. The pollsters found that 70% of the public thought banks were driven by greed, while half of those questioned agreed that British banks had lower ethical standards than other major UK businesses such as manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies or retailers. However, only12% of customers polled last month were considering moving their main current account to another provider. Customers of RBS, which includes NatWest and Ulster, were found to be the most likely (17%) to move their accounts, with 35% of those customers considering a switch to the Co-op, which is in the throes of buying more than 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group.RBS, Barclays and Lloyds customers put the Co-op top as their preferred alternative bank while the building society Nationwide came second with 17%.

      "bodyText": "Petrol pump prices jumped to 139.7p a litre this weekend, within 3p of the 142.5p record set in the spring, according to figures from the AA. The cost of diesel also rose as Europe's major refiners blamed hurricanes in the US and a string of refinery shutdowns for a spike in the cost of crude oil. A rising oil price will spook the Bank of England, which has relied in its inflation forecasts on a fall in oil prices linked to falling demand across the world. The central bank's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, could be prevented from adding to its \u00a3375bn programme of quantitative easing to boost lending in the economy if inflation takes hold, analysts said. Higher pump prices will also add to concerns that the UK will join continental Europe in a stagflation trap as inflation rises while growth remains flat. Fears that the economy will remain in recession for the rest of the year were heightened by a report on Monday that found optimism among UK businesses has hit a 20-year low. BDO's optimism index, which predicts business performance two quarters ahead, fell to 89.1 in August from 93.1 in July. This is the sixth consecutive month that the data has registered a drop, with a four-point plunge from 93.1 in July. BDO's output index \u2013 which predicts short-run turnover expectations \u2013 also fell sharply, to 90.8 in August from 93.9 in July, reaching its lowest point for 40 months. Better news has come from a survey showing industrial production on the rise in August and the latest Lloyds TSB regional purchasing managers' index, which showed higher levels of business activity in all of the English regions except the north-east during August. But surveys showing a rise in activity have tended to be only shortlived and only partially recovered falls in previous months. Petrol is a key factor in household budgets and transport industry costs and rising prices can severely damage economic activity. Petrol had fallen to a low of 130.81p and 136.12 for diesel in the summer. Last week, European petrol refining margins rose to their highest level for five years, blamed on the impact of Hurricane Isaac, upcoming refinery maintenance schedules and refinery fires in North and South America. Edmund King, the AA's president, said: \"Once again UK drivers find themselves being dragged over a barrel, as does business and Bank of England inflation targets. Last week, government statistics showed that traffic on minor country roads fell by 5% \u2013 such was the impact of record high fuel prices on rural communities.\" The Treasury has come to rely on the Bank of England to increase quantitative easing to boost the stagnant UK economy and will be concerned that it could be forced to abandon tentative plans for a further round of QE later in the year. MPs will debate the effects of the oil market on the price of petrol and diesel on Thursday amid claims that a lack of capacity in the oil refining industry has encouraged them to push up prices rapidly in reaction top falling supply. And a Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday looks at the effect of rising prices on rural communities. King said: \"The Office of Fair Trading has launched an investigation, but drivers are growing weary of words \u2013 they want action.

      "body": "<p>Xstrata chairman Sir John Bond is set to clash with shareholders if he recommends the \"final\" $36bn (\u00a322.5bn) all-share bid made for the miner by commodities trader Glencore.</p> <p>Even though Glencore, Xstrata's largest shareholder with a 34% stake, warned it would not improve the terms again after making concessions to recalcitrant shareholders, several investors have publicly opposed the new offer, saying it is still too low. Talks brokered by Tony Blair last week between Glencore and the miner's second-largest shareholder, the Qatar sovereign wealth fund, led to the fresh proposal being tabled on Monday.</p> <p>But Qatar Holding is still believed to harbour reservations because of Glencore's stipulation that Xstrata boss Mick Davis should leave after six months. Bond would stay on as chairman of the merged group.</p> <p>Xstrata said its independent directors were considering the fresh bid and would respond by 24 September after consulting with major shareholders. Several City analysts said it would be hard for the miner's board not to recommend the improved offer to shareholders, as it had backed the previous deal.</p> <p>In the latest twist in the long-running saga \u2013 which began as a friendly merger of equals in February but has since turned sour \u2013 Glencore is now offering 3.05 new shares for every Xstrata share held, up from 2.8.</p> <p>\"Glencore confirms that it is an all-share merger and it will not increase the merger ratio further,\" the firm said.</p> <p>It now proposes that Davis, who would have become chief executive of the merged group under the original plan, will only stay on for six months before passing the reins to Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's chief executive. Retention bonuses worth \u00a3173m for 70 senior Xstrata executives requested by the miner remain, although Glencore asked the board to consider what changes could be made to ensure they are acceptable to shareholders. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/25/xstrata-glencore-tie-up-in-jeopardy\" title=\"\">The retention package provoked fury among investors and delayed the vote on the deal.</a> Davis would have received just under \u00a330m over three years \u2013 but the board will now have to decide what, if anything, he should get for six months.</p> <p>\"The interesting dilemma is going to be that the Xstrata board, having supported the offer at 2.8 and now being presented with an offer at 3.05, is going to find it pretty hard to refuse it,\" said John Robinson, chairman of Global Mining Investments, a fund managed by BlackRock, Glencore's biggest investment management shareholder. \"It now comes down to personalities.\"</p> <p>Some shareholders are still holding out for more. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/09/knight-vinke-xstrata-glencore-offer?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Activist investor Knight Vinke, which owns just under 0.7% of Xstrata, rejected the improved offer</a> on Sunday night as too low, arguing that Glencore's offer had changed from a merger to a takeover and therefore commanded a higher premium. Richard Buxton at fund management group Schroders, another Xstrata shareholder, also rejected the revised terms, saying \"the price is absolutely still too low\".</p> <p>However, Standard Life, which holds 1.4% of Xstrata and 0.8% of Glencore, backed both the improved terms and the changes to the executive governance arrangements.</p> <p>Qatar Holding, which upped its Xstrata stake to 12% from 3% over the summer, is understood to be happy with the new ratio of 3.05, even though it had originally pushed for 3.25. But it has historically supported the Xstrata management and was surprised by Glencore's new insistence that Davis should leave. Qatar will wait for the Xstrata board to consider the fresh proposal before deciding how to vote. Described as a kingmaker, it could block a deal \u2013 but is expected to go along with whatever the Xstrata board recommends.</p> <p>Former prime minister Blair intervened in the talks between Glencore and Qatar last week, after it emerged that Qatar would lead other Xstrata shareholders in blocking the merger. The Qataris softened their stance after Blair mediated late-night discussions between Glasenberg, the Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani and their advisers. Blair works for JP Morgan, Xstrata's main adviser on the deal, and knows the sheikh through his work as Middle East envoy.</p> <p>Liberum Capital analyst Ash Lazenby expects the revised offer to get the Xstrata board's recommendation.

      "bodyText": "Xstrata chairman Sir John Bond is set to clash with shareholders if he recommends the \"final\" $36bn (\u00a322.5bn) all-share bid made for the miner by commodities trader Glencore. Even though Glencore, Xstrata's largest shareholder with a 34% stake, warned it would not improve the terms again after making concessions to recalcitrant shareholders, several investors have publicly opposed the new offer, saying it is still too low. Talks brokered by Tony Blair last week between Glencore and the miner's second-largest shareholder, the Qatar sovereign wealth fund, led to the fresh proposal being tabled on Monday. But Qatar Holding is still believed to harbour reservations because of Glencore's stipulation that Xstrata boss Mick Davis should leave after six months. Bond would stay on as chairman of the merged group. Xstrata said its independent directors were considering the fresh bid and would respond by 24 September after consulting with major shareholders. Several City analysts said it would be hard for the miner's board not to recommend the improved offer to shareholders, as it had backed the previous deal. In the latest twist in the long-running saga \u2013 which began as a friendly merger of equals in February but has since turned sour \u2013 Glencore is now offering 3.05 new shares for every Xstrata share held, up from 2.8. \"Glencore confirms that it is an all-share merger and it will not increase the merger ratio further,\" the firm said. It now proposes that Davis, who would have become chief executive of the merged group under the original plan, will only stay on for six months before passing the reins to Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's chief executive. Retention bonuses worth \u00a3173m for 70 senior Xstrata executives requested by the miner remain, although Glencore asked the board to consider what changes could be made to ensure they are acceptable to shareholders. The retention package provoked fury among investors and delayed the vote on the deal. Davis would have received just under \u00a330m over three years \u2013 but the board will now have to decide what, if anything, he should get for six months. \"The interesting dilemma is going to be that the Xstrata board, having supported the offer at 2.8 and now being presented with an offer at 3.05, is going to find it pretty hard to refuse it,\" said John Robinson, chairman of Global Mining Investments, a fund managed by BlackRock, Glencore's biggest investment management shareholder. \"It now comes down to personalities.\" Some shareholders are still holding out for more. Activist investor Knight Vinke, which owns just under 0.7% of Xstrata, rejected the improved offer on Sunday night as too low, arguing that Glencore's offer had changed from a merger to a takeover and therefore commanded a higher premium. Richard Buxton at fund management group Schroders, another Xstrata shareholder, also rejected the revised terms, saying \"the price is absolutely still too low\". However, Standard Life, which holds 1.4% of Xstrata and 0.8% of Glencore, backed both the improved terms and the changes to the executive governance arrangements. Qatar Holding, which upped its Xstrata stake to 12% from 3% over the summer, is understood to be happy with the new ratio of 3.05, even though it had originally pushed for 3.25. But it has historically supported the Xstrata management and was surprised by Glencore's new insistence that Davis should leave. Qatar will wait for the Xstrata board to consider the fresh proposal before deciding how to vote. Described as a kingmaker, it could block a deal \u2013 but is expected to go along with whatever the Xstrata board recommends. Former prime minister Blair intervened in the talks between Glencore and Qatar last week, after it emerged that Qatar would lead other Xstrata shareholders in blocking the merger. The Qataris softened their stance after Blair mediated late-night discussions between Glasenberg, the Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani and their advisers. Blair works for JP Morgan, Xstrata's main adviser on the deal, and knows the sheikh through his work as Middle East envoy. Liberum Capital analyst Ash Lazenby expects the revised offer to get the Xstrata board's recommendation. Alain William at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said the \"3.05 ratio has a greater chance of winning approval from 'unhappy' shareholders, including Qatar\".

It reported particularly strong sales at its Primark stores in Britain this summer while continental Europe was buoyant, as trading in new stores such as its July opening in Berlin exceeded expectations, and early sales of autumn and winter ranges were encouraging. Its flagship Oxford Street store in central London saw some slowdown during the Olympic Games, but other stores compensated for this and the Oxford Street outlet soon recovered. Primark's 242 stores expect annual sales to rise 15%, while like-for-like sales are expected to rise 3% for the full year, ahead of the first half's 2% rise. Primark's finance director, John Bason, said: \"We've just powered our way through the Olympics. The Westfield [Stratford] store has been absolutely chocker with people.\" In contrast, the Oxford Street store suffered a fall in like-for-like sales during the two weeks of the Olympics. Primark will open a second Oxford Street store at the Tottenham Court Road junction with 80,000 sq ft of space over four floors on 20 September. This summer's bestsellers include coloured skinny jeans, shift dresses and lace blouses and lace knitted jumpers. Customers in Primark's Oxford Street store on Monday confirmed that price was their main reason for choosing the shop. Although the products were cheap, they remained fashionable and of reasonable quality, shoppers said. One customer, Melanie, 29, said she was there because the products were \"cheap and cheerful\" \u2013 while an American shopper described the clothes as \"nice for the price\". Many overseas customers were in Primark on the recommendations of friends. John, 27, said: \"I am in Primark because they don't have one in Australia and they certainly don't have anything this cheap.\" Another shopper, Ying, 32, visits the shop up to five times a month; Dema, 24, said she would be visiting Primark many times before returning to Saudi Arabia. Sylvia, an Italian shopper, noted prices were incredibly low for shoes and bags, which would cost much more in Italy. ABF, which also sells Silver Spoon sugar and Twinings tea, said profits at its sugar business for the full year will be \"considerably higher\" than last year due to rising European and African revenues, and despite a lower price in China hitting annual sales there. Analyst Graham Jones at house broker Panmure Gordon forecasts earnings for the full year to September 2012 will rise 15.6% to 85.5p a share and he upgraded his Primark profit forecast after an acceleration in top-line growth. \"ABF will deliver impressive earnings growth in 2012, driven by a significant rise in sugar profits, but it is Primark's long-term growth potential in continental Europe that most excites us,\" Jones added.",
