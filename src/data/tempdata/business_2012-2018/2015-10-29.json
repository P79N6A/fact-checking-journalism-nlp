The report, commissioned by Prof Ian Chubb but written by an innovation consultant, suggests the entrepreneurship education activities of most Australian universities are relatively immature by global standards. It questions the system for public funding of university research, saying there is an emphasis on output as measured by peer-reviewed research publications. The report (PDF), released on Friday, says the process drives academics \u201cto focus their efforts on producing publications rather than on engaging with industry or teaching students\u201d. \u201cIt discourages academics from pursuing applied research and commercial proof-of-concept work that will not lend itself to publications in top journals, even if it could lead to significant economic impact via creation of new technologies and startups,\u201d writes Colin Kinner, director of Spike Innovation, a consulting firm. \u201cIt [also] steers academics toward research topics that are of academic interest and therefore likely to lead to publications in top journals and citations from other researchers, whether or not the research ultimately represents a good investment of taxpayer funds.\u201d The report calls for an increased emphasis on economic impact measures such as startups created by staff and graduates, capital raised and jobs created, with a particular focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics. \u201cIncentives linked to funding would also encourage universities to recognise academic staff for engagement in student entrepreneurship activities,\u201d Kinner writes. \u201cFew universities have frameworks of this nature in place today. When staff do get involved with student entrepreneurship, it is often an unfunded activity or a labour of love. In contrast, universities in the UK are assessed not just on quality of research but also their impact.\u201d Australia was the only country in the OECD that did not have a science and innovation strategy, and lacked a consistent narrative about how the country would shift to a knowledge-intensive economy. \u201cAustralia needs to become known as an entrepreneurial country, not a lucky one,\u201d Kinner writes. Chubb, whose term as chief scientist expires at the end of the year, says in a foreword that universities are pivotal in encouraging entrepreneurship, and schools should also help shift mindsets. Other nations had not been content to wait for the one-in-a-million person to seize a once-in-a-lifetime chance. \u201cFrom the United States to Korea, fostering entrepreneurs has become a national priority, pursued with energy, ambition and imagination,\u201d Chubb says.",

      "bodyText": "Congratulations to Marks &amp; Spencer and Kingfisher, the owner of B&amp;Q. The two retailers have not enjoyed the easiest time on the high street in the past five years, but they have led the way in the battle to increase female representation on Britain\u2019s boards. M&amp;S and Kingfisher only rank sixth and third in the FTSE 100 in terms of the proportion of directors who are women, 41.7% and 44.4% respectively. However, they each have two full-time female executive directors which marks them out from their peers. M&amp;S has Helen Weir, the finance director, and Laura Wade-Gery, the executive director for multichannel, while V\u00e9ronique Laury and Karen Witts run Kingfisher as chief executive and chief financial officer. For all the progress made by FTSE companies since the launch of the government-backed Davies review in 2010, women remain staggeringly unrepresented in the key decision-making roles at Britain\u2019s top companies. Lord Mervyn Davies set a target almost five years ago that 25% of FTSE 100 board members should be women, up from 12.5% at the time. That target has been reached \u2013 a major achievement \u2013 and the UK now ranks sixth in the world in terms of the number of women at the top of its leading companies. However, there is still much more to do. The target has been reached largely by companies bringing in women to part-time non-executive roles. There are now 143 more female non-executive directors in the FTSE 100 than at the start of 2011. However, there are just eight more female executive directors, which is unacceptable. This means that women make up just 9.6% of executive roles at FTSE 100 companies. While the achievements of the Davies review must be applauded, the battle for gender equality within businesses can only really be achieved by an increase in the number of women executives. Hiring a woman who has prospered within another business to be a non-executive director is one thing, but creating a culture whereby women can rise up the ranks within a business to become an executive director is entirely another. It is disappointing, therefore, that the Davies review has not yet set a target for the proportion of FTSE 100 executives who should be women. The CIPD has said this should be set at 20% at least. To be fair to Davies, who is now stepping aside from his role at the helm of the campaign, he said he would strongly recommend to his successor that executive targets are introduced. Britain has come along way since Davies started gathering evidence in the autumn of 2010. The approach of setting a voluntary target rather than implementing a legislative quota has made an impact. But what happens next is vital. Britain\u2019s leading companies must kick on towards a 50-50 representation and increase the number of female executives. If not, then calls for a quota system \u2013 used by most of the countries above Britain in the global legal table \u2013 will grow louder. Big business, big trouble The western economy may be recovering from the financial crisis, but big business is not enjoying the ride. Many of the world\u2019s leading companies have reported results this week, with shrinking profits, job losses and cuts to capital expenditure a common theme. On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank were the latest companies to post mixed results. Varying reasons lay behind the results, including falling oil prices, regulatory issues and a slowdown in China, although some big businesses are still performing well, notably Apple, the biggest of them all. It is a notable reversal of fortunes from a few years ago, when the US and European economies were struggling to bounce back from recession while big business were sitting on record cash piles. Could we now be seeing the fruits of companies choosing to use that cash to keep their investors happy with dividends and share buybacks rather than investing it in their operations? Bold BT, ahead of the curve? One company that has invested heavily and is enjoyingthe rewards is BT. The company shocked analysts in 2012 when it first bought rights to buy Premier League football matches. Since it moved into sports broadcasting, shares in BT have more than doubled. The company\u2019s latest results show that an extra 106,000 customers signed up to its television service in the last three months, a record performance. Gavin Patterson, BT\u2019s chief executive, aided by his predecessor Lord Ian Livingston, is reaping the benefit of a bold move ahead of the curve. Patterson is now trying to do the same again, at an even greater cost, by buying mobile operator EE for \u00a312.5bn.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has said he would be willing to go to Beijing if necessary to continue lobbying China not to dump steel at under cost price, following a visit to a plant in Scunthorpe where 900 job losses were announced last week. The Labour leader accused the government of being in thrall to \u201cthe idea of a global market economy\u201d and called on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to intervene after he toured the Tata steelworks on Thursday. \u201cSteel is the basis of all manufacturing industries. It\u2019s the basis of everything that we make in this country,\u201d Corbyn said. He also attacked the government\u2019s economic approach: \u201cThey have a philosophy which says basically that anybody can produce anything, anywhere and send it anywhere around the world. So we have dumped Chinese steel being sold under the price of production, which is of course ruinous to our industries. It requires intervention from the government and political pressure on the Chinese. It also requires the WTO to do something about it. Otherwise we all lose.\u201d Corbyn said the steel crisis undermined the personal mission of the chancellor, George Osborne to rebalance England\u2019s economy away from London and the south-east. \u201cThe whole northern powerhouse idea, as I understood it, was that there would be economic generation across the north of England, the creation of a powerhouse that would be a combination of local government, economic industry and training. And if you destroy a crucial part of that three-legged stool, namely the manufacturing industry, then you don\u2019t have a northern powerhouse,\u201d he said. Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, accompanied Corbyn on his visit. She said the northern powerhouse would be \u201cvery floppy\u201d without British steel, and that Conservatives did not care about steel because so few of their MPs represent industrial areas. \u201cIf there were steel works in Witney then David Cameron would have acted by now,\u201d Eagle said, referring to the prime minister\u2019s Oxfordshire constituency. She said ministers were too ashamed of their inaction to come to Scunthorpe and meet the workers at risk of redundancy. \u201cI just think they don\u2019t want to look the people in the eye whose jobs their neglect is putting at risk,\u201d she said, accusing her government counterpart, Sajid Javid, of being philosophically opposed to the government intervening in anything. In his speech to the Conservative party conference in October, Osborne announced the creation of an infrastructure commission to invest in large building projects of national importance, headed by the former Labour peer Lord Adonis. Eagle said the steelworks at Scunthorpe and Redcar, where 2,200 jobs will go when the plant closes, were strategic national assets and should be protected. \u201cIf we are to believe the government, we are just at the beginning of a huge investment into our infrastructure. If you think about it, why on earth can\u2019t we ensure that we keep these strategic assets in our country until this difficult time has passed, so that we can bring them back into use? It makes no sense,\u201d she said. It would cost at least \u00a3600m for another operator to reopen the coke ovens at Scunthorpe once they are allowed to go cold, she added.",

      "bodyText": "Heavy job losses are feared in the City of London after Deutsche Bank set out plans to boost its performance by axing 15,000 roles and selling off operations employing a further 20,000. The move comes as the new boss, John Cryan, conceded that Germany\u2019s biggest bank would not pay a dividend for two years as it battled to restore its fortunes after being stung by legal costs and fines. The bank also faces investigations over alleged Russian money laundering. Cryan previously announced a restructuring of the investment bank, which employs thousands in London\u2019s financial district, after a \u20ac6bn (\u00a34.4bn) loss in the third quarter. The loss was caused by the sale of its Postbank retail banking division, a \u20ac600m writedown on the value of its 20% stake in China\u2019s Hua Xia Bank, and \u20ac1.2bn in litigation costs. Deutsche will close operations in 10 countries \u2013 Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Malta, and New Zealand \u2013 and halve the number of customers in its investment bank, where 30% of clients produce 80% of the revenue. Approximately 15,000 roles will go, including 6,000 contractors, while the workforce will fall by a further 20,000 as businesses are sold off. The aim is to achieve savings of \u20ac3.8bn although the changes will cost up to \u20ac3.5bn to implement. According to reports, the 9,000 full-time roles being lost equates to 10% of the workforce, while the number of contractors targeted equates to 20% of the total. Cryan promised to tackle the job cuts sensitively. \u201cThis is never an easy task, and we will not do so lightly,\u201d he said. There was little detail about where the job cuts might fall, although 4,000 of the 9,000 full-time roles are to be lost in Germany. Bonuses are also thought to be in the firing line after the results which were described as \u201chighly disappointing\u201d by Cryan. A British banker, Cryan became chief executive in July, replacing Anshu Jain, who spent 20 years developing a major investment banking operation. Reuters reported that Cryan delivered his presentation in German, in contrast to Jain who had faced criticism for speaking English. The bank\u2019s shares fell 7% on disappointment about the results and the scale of the project to restore the fortunes of the German bank. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said: \u201cWe believe Deutsche Bank\u2019s strategy has the potential to deliver a more sustainable business model and stronger balance sheet. However, the bank faces an extended restructuring period and requires disciplined execution to achieve its ambitions amid ongoing regulatory and legal challenges\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Strong sales of luxury cars and fine art have helped push the global luxury goods market higher than \u20ac1tn (\u00a3700bn) for the first time, according to a new report, despite slowing demand for personal luxuries such as jewellery and handbags. The personal luxury market has been hit by weaker demand in China and Hong Kong, said the annual report from consultancy Bain &amp; Co. Chinese consumers account for 31% of global luxury sales, followed by US consumers at 24% and Europeans at 18%. Chinese consumers are still spending, but they are now heading to Europe and Japan \u2013 attracted by the weak euro and yen \u2013 rather than their traditional shopping destinations of Hong Kong and Macau. About 80% of Chinese luxury goods shopping is done abroad. The findings echo recent comments from British luxury fashion house Burberry, which has blamed a sharp sales slowdown on weaker demand among shoppers in China. The fastest growth was for sales of luxury cars, up 8% year on year, and fine art, up 6% - with postwar and contemporary work particularly strong. Growth in the personal luxury goods markets, which includes jewellery, watches and leather goods as well as fashion and perfumes, slowed to 1-2% from 3% in 2014. It is now worth \u20ac253bn. Back in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the market grew by 13%, 5% and 6% respectively. \u201cFor the last several years, we\u2019ve referenced \u2018luxury\u2019s new normal\u2019 with a deceleration of the personal luxury goods market. Now, we are starting to feel the impact of that slowdown,\u201d said Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a Bain partner in Milan and lead author of the study. \u201cThe challenge for luxury brands in this environment is how to successfully navigate through hard-to-predict volatility.\u201d Another reason for the slowdown is the retreat of Russians, particularly from their shopping hotspots such as Dubai and Milan. They cut their tax-free spending in Europe by 37%. A year ago, they were the world\u2019s second biggest buyers of luxury goods behind the Chinese, but their purchasing power has halved with the rouble\u2019s devaluation. Asia registered its worst performance ever, due to the lacklustre trend of mainland China and a sharp drop in sales in Hong Kong and Macau. However, in Europe, Chinese tax-free purchases increased by 64% while Americans increased their spending in Europe by 67%. The \u201csuper dollar\u201d made the US too expensive for many global tourists. Nevertheless, the US remains the world\u2019s largest luxury market at \u20ac79bn; New York City alone outweighed all of Japan. Local buying by Europeans and Americans has fallen in the past five years. D\u2019Arpizio said many major brands had alienated local consumers by raising prices for certain items such as bestselling handbags. The increases, which she estimated at 30-50% over the past three years for some items, were partly driven by the desire to bring prices into line with other regions such as Asia, where prices were higher due to tariffs and other factors. D\u2019Arpizio said: \u201cI think some luxury brands focused on China too much and lost focus on the local European customer base and as a result, some of them feel betrayed by these brands. Those who could afford these goods in Europe started asking themselves: \u2018Why should I pay so much money for this product?\u2019\u201d Local European and American consumers increasingly prefer to shop at discount outlets. Bain estimates the outlet market now represented 10% of total luxury sales, with its revenue doubling in the past three years to \u20ac26bn. All figures are at constant exchange rates.",

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s what you need to know about the slowing US economy: US economic growth braked sharply in the third quarter as businesses cut back on restocking warehouses to work off an inventory glut, but solid domestic demand could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.5% annual rate after expanding at a 3.9% clip in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. The inventory drag, however, is likely to be temporary and economists expect growth to pick up in the fourth quarter given strong domestic fundamentals. The Fed on Wednesday described the economy as expanding at a \u201cmoderate\u201d pace and put a December rate hike on the table with a direct reference to its next policy meeting. The US central bank has kept benchmark overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008. The economy has struggled to sustain a faster pace of growth since the end of the 2007-2009 recession, with average yearly growth failing to break above 2.5%. Economists had forecast GDP expanding at a 1.6% rate in the third quarter. Businesses accumulated $56.8bn worth of inventory in the third quarter, the smallest since the first quarter of 2014 and down sharply from $113.5bn in the April-June period. The small inventory build sliced off 1.44 percentage points from third-quarter GDP growth, the largest since the fourth quarter of 2012. The blow from inventories was blunted by bullish consumers, who are getting a tailwind from cheaper gasoline and firming housing and labor markets. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, grew at a 3.2% rate after expanding at a 3.6% pace in the second quarter. A measure of private domestic demand, which excludes trade, inventories and government spending, rose at a sturdy 3.2% pace..... Here\u2019s the full story: And that\u2019s probably a good time to wind up this blog. Back tomorrow for more of the same. Cheers. GW This GDP report doesn\u2019t resolve the confusion over when US interest rates will rise. Although growth slowed, the economy doesn\u2019t look weak enough to rule out a hike this year. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Forward-looking surveys have been signalling a slowdown, the strong dollar is hitting corporate profits, business investment is growing at only just over 2%, and inflationary pressure eased in the third quarter. The US central bank would have known what the growth figures were before it met this week. It clearly wants to leave all options open, not least even though a move before the end of the year would probably require a big jump in non-farm payrolls \u2013 the key measure of the health of the labour market \u2013 in the next couple of months. Today\u2019s growth figures look better if you ignore the fact that US companies reduced their spending on inventory-building. Capital Economics explains: The slowdown in GDP growth to 1.5% annualised in the third quarter, from a very strong 3.9% in the second, was mainly due to a big drag from inventories, which subtracted 1.4% points after making a neutral contribution in the previous quarter. The growth rate of final sales to domestic purchasers, a better gauge of underlying demand that strips out inventories and net external demand, was still as high as 2.9% in the third quarter. Alasdair Cavalla, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, believes the Federal Reserve won\u2019t be deterred from hiking rates in December by today\u2019s report. He says: This is a disappointing result for the world\u2019s largest economy, but not disastrous. The rate was expected to fall given evidence from reduced hiring activity compared to earlier in the year, while leading indicators corroborated the slowdown.... Yesterday the Federal Reserve revised its guidance. It was interpreted to mean a rate rise in December, barring disastrous domestic performance before then, regardless of what happens in the global economy. (The last proviso had been in doubt.) Today\u2019s slowdown was as expected \u2013 something the Fed would have no doubt known yesterday. We maintain our expectation of a December rate rise. A reminder that this recovery is historically rather weak: It\u2019s quite possible that US growth will bounce back this autumn. Sky News reckons the slowdown between July and September is a temporary affair: The slowdown was blamed on businesses in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors reducing unwanted stockpiles or deciding not to restock heavily, taking 1.4 percentage points from the third quarter\u2019s growth. However, economists expect that to be a blip - with GDP growth picking up in the current fourth quarter given the looming holiday season, low inflation and stronger wage growth and hiring. Some argue that healthy levels of consumer spending give the Federal Reserve the scope to raise its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting in December..... Shares are dipping at the start of trading in New York, as investors ponder the health of the US economy. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped 35 points, or 0.2%, to 17,743 after the opening bell - which was rung by a musical star: I fear Genie didn\u2019t dole out any free wishes to the trading floor, alas James Knightley of ING says the detail of today\u2019s report isn\u2019t all bad: Inventories was a huge drag, subtracting 1.44 percentage points from growth. Investment in non-residential structures was down 4%, but everything else grew and net exports didn\u2019t really take anything away either. Here\u2019s Chris Williamson of Markit on today\u2019s growth figures: \u201cIn particular, third quarter GDP was dragged down by a far smaller accumulation of inventories than in the second quarter, which is estimated to have reduced growth by 1.4%. This could therefore reverse in the fourth quarter as stock levels are rebuilt. \u201cThe composition of growth was also noteworthy from a policy perspective. As expected, exports acted as drag on growth, reflecting sluggish demand in overseas markets and the dollar\u2019s appreciation, as did the energy sector, which is slashing capacity due to falling prices. But, importantly, consumer spending remained robust, with growth of expenditure merely easing from 3.6% in the second quarter to 3.2% and hinting at only a modest slowing of demand in the domestic economy. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key points in the US GDP report: Consumer spending: +3.2% in the third quarter of 2015, down from +3.6% in Q2 Business spending: +2.1% down from 4.1% in Q2 Home investment: +6.1%, down from +9.3% in Q2 Business investment: -4%, down from +6.2% in Q2 Business inventories: +$56.8bn, down from $113.5bn. This cut 1.44 percentage points off the GDP growth rate. The US economy has now grown for six quarters in a row, since suffering a shock contraction during the bad winter of early 2014. The Financial Times have helpfully drawn a barchart showing US annualised growth over the last 14 quarters (from their news story, here) We\u2019ve also got data showing that consumer inflation in the US fell during the last quarter. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) fell to 1.2%, down from 2.1% in the second quarter. Dan Alpert, Managing Partner of New York investment bank Westwood Capital. says it suggests the economy is cooling. He\u2019s not impressed with the growth figures either: Bloomberg\u2019s Carl Riccadonna reckons this growth report suggests US interest rates should remain at their current record low: This excellent spreadsheet shows which parts of the US economy grew in the last quarter (in green) and which shrank (in red): It highlights that consumer spending gave the biggest positive bump to the US economy in the last three months. The US has grown by an average of 2% so far this year -- is that really enough to justify a rate hike in December? Today\u2019s GDP report shows that US consumers drove growth in the last three months. Household spending grew 3.2% in the quarter, suggesting the domestic economy remains strong. However, US companies expanded their stockpiles at a slower rate, as they worked off inventories they had build up earlier this year. That was a drag on growth. The report also shows that exports were hit by the strength of the US dollar (due to speculation that the Federal Reserve hikes US borrowing costs soon) This US slowdown means that Britain is growing faster than America, at least over the last three months. UK GDP rose by 0.5% in the third quarter, which equates to an annualised rate of 2%. This growth reading is broadly in line with forecasts: Here we go! The US economy has slowed sharply in the third quarter of this year. GDP rose by an annualised rate of just 1.5% during Q3, according to data JUST released by the Commerce department. That\u2019s a serious slowdown on the 3.9% recorded in the second quarter. That means the US economy grew by less than 0.4% between the start of July and the end of September as weakness in the global economy hits the world\u2019s largest economy. More to follow! Just 10 minutes to go until we learn how the US economy fared in the last three months. Remember: Wall Street expect a sharp slowdown, from an annual rate of 3.9% in Q2 to around 1.6% in Q3. Economists will be looking for several things. including: Did trade weaken? A fall in exports will mean that the global slowdown is hitting US companies Did inventories rise? US firms typically stockpile goods when demand falls. That can help to boost GDP, but \u2018steals\u2019 growth from future quarters. How did the housing sector perform? A strong performance could indicate the domestic US economy is picking up, which raises the chances that interest rates are raised in December.... The UK has made significant progress in creating gender diversity in the UK, but more needs to be done to get the City closer to parity. As flagged up early this morning, Lord Mervyn Davies has called for women to hold at least 33% of all board positions by the end of this decade. There are more women on FTSE 350 boards than ever before \u2013 26.1% at FTSE 100 companies and 19.6% at FTSE 250 firms. Davies said there had been 550 new women appointments in just over four years. And ever FTSE 100 company has at least one women on the board Davies argues that this progress shows that the City doesn\u2019t need fixed quotas. There is no evidence to warrant an about turn, but plenty of evidence to show the voluntary regime is working, as each and every month the percentage of women on FTSE boards increases.\u201d Here\u2019s our story on today\u2019s report: It also sounds like the message hasn\u2019t got through to the more old-fashioned areas of finance: Back in the UK, the latest snapshot of retail sales has come in weaker than expected, raises further questions about the strength of the wider economy. After news earlier this week that UK GDP growth eased in the third quarter, the CBI\u2019s survey of retailers points to a subdued start to the final three months of the year. The business group\u2019s indicator of retail sales volumes signalled the slowest growth for six months in October after a strong September. The CBI survey of 112 firms, which assesses the sector based on a balance of responses from individual companies, showed 38% said volumes were up on a year ago, and 20% said they were down. That gave a balance of +19%, compared with +49% in September. Retailers themselves had been expecting a reading of +51%. But sales were regarded as above average for the time of year and growth was expected to improve slightly next month. Growth in orders placed upon suppliers was also lower than expected but remained above its long run average. Internet sales volumes accelerated in the year to October, with growth set to pick up further next month, the CBI said. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, comments: \u201cGrowth in sales and orders for high street retailers remains resilient, but there has been a slight slowdown in the pace of that growth following a strong September. \u201cInternet sales are starting to ramp up again as we head towards Christmas and we would expect them to continue this positive pattern until the end of the year. \u201cLow inflation and improving wages mean the prospects for sales growth are decent, but challenges remain, like the weakening global economy and competitive pressures in the retail sector, so we can\u2019t take this positive outlook for granted.\u201d City veteran George Magnus makes a typically astute point: Rising prosperity can bring better access to contraception, better education and job prospects for women (which is also a key factor in reducing poverty). It can also make it harder for couples to settle down early.... We should remember that China\u2019s one-child-per-family policy had already begun to be relaxed before today\u2019s news. In 2013, Beijing said couples could have two children if one of them was an only child (fairly likely, given the old policy) The FT\u2019s David Keohane has done a nice analysis. Here\u2019s a flavour: You could have a second child if you or your partner were yourself an only child. That alongside the fact it was already possible to buy yourself an exception and it didn\u2019t count if you were a rural family whose first child was a girl meant there were quite a few loopholes. And in 2007, via JPM, a family-planning official in China estimated the one-child policy applied to less than 40% of the population. . Better hope this attempt goes better than that 2013 attempt to shake things up. As Cap Econ said of that move, \u201cPartial easing of the policy in late 2013 \u2013 the government allowed couples to have a second child if one of the parents is an only child \u2013 didn\u2019t increase the birth rate by as much as the government had anticipated. The New Zealand dollar is also getting a boost; its dairy industry could benefit from faster population growth in China. Shares in French consumer giant Danone have jumped by 2% after news broke that China is ending its one-child-per-family policy. Danone is a major producer of baby food and formula, so should benefit quite quickly from the change. Big news breaking in China... Beijing is abolishing the one-child per family policy as part of its attempts to boost growth. That\u2019s according to the official newswire, Xinhua, which is reporting that all couples will be allowed two children. This ends its three-decades policy, and could have a significant long-term impact on China\u2019s economic prospects. Eventually..... Top Communist party officials have been setting the country\u2019s new five-year plan this week, with a big focus on growth. We also have new consumer confidence figures for the eurozone, which show a small deterioration this month. The latest survey of European economic confidence is out, and it shows that firms are a little more optimistic. The Commission\u2019s Economic Sentiment index has risen to 105.9 in the eurozone, up from 105.6 in September, and closer to the wider EU measure. That\u2019s the fourth rise in a row, suggesting conditions are steadily (and slowly) improving. Traders in Frankfurt aren\u2019t too impressed by Deutsche Bank\u2019s new turnaround plan. Shares in the company have slumped by 6% this morning, as investors digest the thousand of job cuts announced by John Cryan today. His decision to axe dividends in 2015 and 2016 has not helped the mood. Reuters explains why: \u201cWe still believe there are major risks here and therefore think a capital increase in 2016 is still highly probable,\u201d Citi analysts said in a note. A trader said: \u201cInvestors are very disappointed. Two years of no dividends and CEO Cryan cautions 2016 and 2017 won\u2019t be strong in terms of business either. That\u2019s a long time and shareholders are wondering why they should stay invested.\u201d Something for London property owners to ponder... Today\u2019s US growth report (due in under three hours) could be less grim than some economists predict, reckons Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX. He believes that Wall Street forecasts may not capture the latest economic data, such as better-than-expected trade figures released yesterday. So the slowdown might not be quite as severe.... Spivak says: The preliminary set of third-quarter US GDP figures is in focus. The annualized growth rate is expected to register at 1.6%, down from 3.9% recorded in the three months through June. US economic news-flow has improved relative to consensus forecasts recently, hinting analysts\u2019 models are underestimating the economy\u2019s vigor and opening the door for an upside surprise. Such a result may boost the likelihood of a 2015 Fed rate hike in the minds of investors, pushing the US Dollar higher. The impact on risk sentiment trends is unclear for now but whatever happens may help establish a dominant paradigm in the days and weeks ahead. Deutsche Bank has also revealed that 4,000 of its 9,000 job cuts will fall in Germany. Staff who survive the cull could also be also hit in the pocket. John Cryan says it would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d to not share the consequences of recent poor behaviour. That poor behaviour includes a record $2.5bn fine for Deutsche\u2019s role in the Libor rigging scandal. It\u2019s a black morning for Deutsche Bank staff, as new chief executive Jon Cryan wields the axe at Germany\u2019s biggest bank. Cryam has just announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs, and sell businesses which employ another 15,000 people. That\u2019s around 25% of the company\u2019s workforce. Deutsche is pulling out of a swathe of developing and smaller advanced economies. It will close operations in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Malta and New Zealand. Around 6,000 consultants are also facing the chop, as part of a cost-cutting spree that will also see dividend payments suspended until 2017. News of the restructuring came shortly after Deutsche reported a net loss of \u20ac6bn in the three months to the end of September, and a 7% slide in revenues. Cryan, who took over in July, told reporters that the company faces \u201chard decisions\u201d after its \u201chighly disappointing\u201d performance, adding: \u201cWe must reduce Deutsche Bank\u2019s complexity\u201d Those disappointing results from Barclays and Royal Dutch Shell have helped to wipe almost 1% off the FTSE 100 this morning. The blue chip index is down 53 points at 6383, with mining stocks among the big fallers. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Helping drag the commodity sector as a whole further into the red was Shell; announcing its third quarter results less than 48 hours after revealing its latest ($2 billion) write-down in relation to its failed Carmon Creek project, the oil giant slipped to a $6.1 billion loss after the cost of ending multiple long term projects added up to a whopping $8.2 billion. This pushed Shell nearly 2% lower after the bell, worsening the situation in an already loss-loving sector. Other European stock markets are faring better this morning: Shares in Barclays have fallen by 3.5% in early trading, after the bank missed profit forecasts and posted a 10% drop in adjusted earnings. Barclays also revealed that ring-fencing its retail banking arm will cost \u00a31bn, on top of \u00a32.3bn bill on legal costs and compensation. And intriguingly, the company also warned that it faces new compensation claims to foreign exchange customers. But Barclays refused to give much information in a conference call with the media.... My colleague Jill Treanor tells us what we know: As its new boss, Jes Staley, pledged to clean up the bank\u2019s reputation, Barclays said it was facing \u00a3290m redress costs as a result of an internal review relating to rates for foreign exchange transactions between 2005 and 2012. The figures were released a day after Barclays named Staley, a US investment banker, as its new chief executive. He is on a \u00a310m pay packet and will start on 1 December. The \u00a3290m is part of \u00a31.3bn set aside for compensating customers in the fist nine months of this year, while there is \u00a31bn for on going investigations and litigation. More here: The UK government has taken another step towards untangling itself from the banking sector, by selling more shares in Lloyds Banking Group. This cuts the taxpayers stake in Lloyds to below 10%, seven years after bailing out the company during the financial crisis. Morgan Stanley reckons the Federal Reserve will be feeling pleased with itself: Britain\u2019s economy may be slowing down, but house prices are still rising. Nationwide has reported that prices rose by 0.6% this month, pushing the annual house price inflation up to 3.9%. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, says house prices will probably keep rising. But can building firms keep up? Gardner says: \u201cOver the past five months annual price growth has remained in a fairly narrow range between 3% and 4%, broadly consistent with earnings growth over the longer term. While this bodes well for a sustainable increase in housing market activity, much will depend on whether building activity can keep pace with increasing demand. This explains why the markets are taking the Federal Reserve\u2019s comment about considering a rate rise at its \u201cnext meeting\u201d so seriously: Today\u2019s US GDP report will probably show that growth has fallen back below the 2% trend rate. The Wall Street Journal explains: The economy has grown at little better than a 2% pace since the recovery began in mid-2009. That\u2019s largely because a quarter or two of above-trend growth has been upended by a weak performance. If the third-quarter data turns out as economists project, growth for the year will have decelerated from last year\u2019s 2.4% increase. As this chart shows, the US economy has been held back by two bad winters: Before last night\u2019s Fed meeting, investors were only pricing in a 35% chance that US borrowing costs would rise in December. It\u2019s now a 48% chance: In a few hours we find out how badly the US economy has suffered from the problems in emerging markets, and China\u2019s slowdown. Economists expect that the first estimate of US GDP for the last quarter, due at 12.30pm GMT, will show a sharp drop in growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy. Wall Street estimates that US GDP rose at an annualised rate of around 1.5%, or roughly 0.4% in pure quarterly terms. If so, that\u2019s a big slowdown compared to the second quarter of 2015, when the US posted annualised growth of 3.9% (or 1% quarter-on-quarter). A weak GDP print will add to growing concerns over the global economy. Earlier this week, UK growth slowed from 0.7% to 0.5%, suggesting advanced economies are coming off the boil. BUT.... the report may also show that the US domestic economy is strengthening. If consumer spending is strong, then the Federal Reserve may feel emboldened to push on and raise interest rates in December.... Good morning , and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be mopping up the reaction to last night\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, where US policymakers floated the serious possibility of raising interest rates in December. America\u2019s central bank dropped its previous warnings about risk that global financial problems pose to the US economy. And it added a crucial new sentence to its monetary policy statement: \u201cIn determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\u201d This suggests that a first rate rise in almost a decade could finally be close. And emerging market currencies have slid overnight, as money pours back into the US dollar. IG\u2019s Angus Nicholson explains: A new sentence in the Fed monetary policy statement has put a December rate hike by the Fed back on the table. G10 currencies slid against a resurgent US dollar, while the worst was left for emerging market currencies. The Korean won, Indonesian rupiah and Malaysian ringgit saw the heaviest selling in Asia. The euro has also weakened, which could send Mario Draghi scurrying off to hang up the Christmas decorations early: European stock markets are expected to take the news in their stride, perhaps taking comfort that the Fed isn\u2019t as worried as last month. That sets the scene for the main news of the day - the US growth figures, due at 12.30pm GMT, which are expected to show a sharp slowdown (more on that in a moment). Lots of financial results to wade through this morning, including Deutsche Bank (which has reported a \u20ac6bn loss and is suspending its dividend in an attempt to cut costs and drive profits), Barclays (which has just posted a 13% drop in adjusted profits), and Royal Dutch Shell. We also get the latest measure of UK house prices, from the Nationwide building society. And the City will be set a new target on gender diversity today. Lord Davies is expected to say that at least 33% of all board members at Britain\u2019s biggest firms should be female, by 2020: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day",

The inventory drag, however, is likely to be temporary and economists expect growth to pick up in the fourth quarter given strong domestic fundamentals.</p> <p>The Fed on Wednesday described the economy as expanding at a \u201cmoderate\u201d pace and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/federal-reserve-interest-rates-unchanged\">put a December rate hike on the table</a> with a direct reference to its next policy meeting. The US central bank has kept benchmark overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008.</p> <p>The economy has struggled to sustain a faster pace of growth since the end of the 2007-2009 recession, with average yearly growth failing to break above 2.5%. Economists had forecast GDP expanding at a 1.6% rate in the third quarter.</p> <p>Businesses accumulated $56.8bn worth of inventory in the third quarter, the smallest since the first quarter of 2014 and down sharply from $113.5bn in the April-June period. The small inventory build sliced off 1.44 percentage points from third-quarter GDP growth, the largest since the fourth quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The blow from inventories was blunted by bullish consumers, who are getting a tailwind from cheaper gasoline and firming housing and labor markets.</p> <p>Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, grew at a 3.2% rate after expanding at a 3.6% pace in the second quarter. A measure of private domestic demand, which excludes trade, inventories and government spending, rose at a sturdy 3.2% pace.....</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s the full story:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/29/us-economy-third-quarter-growth\">US economic growth slows in third quarter as businesses cut back</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And that\u2019s probably a good time to wind up this blog.

The charges, which sent the company to a quarterly loss of $7.4bn, included a $2.6bn write-off for withdrawal from the Alaskan Arctic and an additional $2bn charge on the Carmon Creek oil sands project in Canada, where the company suspended building on Tuesday. It also reflected other impairment charges triggered by the downward revision of the long-term oil and gas price outlook, Shell said. Oil prices have fallen from a peak of more than $115 a barrel last year to less than $49 on Thursday. \u201cIn headline terms, this was a challenging quarter,\u201d said Shell\u2019s chief financial officer, Simon Henry. The costs came as underlying earnings fell by 70% to $1.8bn. The position would have been worse had it not been for a robust performance from the \u201cdownstream\u201d refining and marketing business. Lower prices and reduced costs saw earnings here grow to $2.6bn from $1.8bn a year ago. But the company\u2019s \u00a347bn acquisition of BG Group remains on track for completion early next year. Henry stressed the importance of the takeover. \u201cThe deal is a springboard from which we will focus on fewer and more profitable themes, especially deep water and integrated gas,\u201d he said. It was estimated that the Carmon Creek thermal oil sands project would contribute 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day when it was originally sanctioned in October 2013, but it was postponed earlier this year. After a review, Shell concluded that the project no longer justified its position in the group portfolio. Shell abandoned drilling in Alaska last month after $7bn of spending ended with a well that failed to find hydrocarbons. At the same time, environmental activists argued that industrial activity would hurt fragile ecosystems and marine mammals. They insisted the icy Arctic waters could not be cleaned in the event of a spill. Henry said: \u201cIt was a challenging quarter, but the underlying performance does give us confidence that we will be able to capture the significant value, which is available in the BG combination.\u201d The dividend is maintained at 47 cents per share and the company suggests the payment to shareholders can be maintained with an oil price of about $60 dollars a barrel. The refining and marketing business provided strength for Shell\u2019s cash flow. This meant net investments and dividends were covered by operating cash flow over the past year, when oil prices have averaged $60 a barrel. Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was $11.2bn. That is a relatively modest reduction when compared with the $12.8bn recorded in the same quarter last year. Shell\u2019s share price fell by more than 2%, down 36p to 1,706p. The company was not alone in recording the impact of a lower oil price regime, with Eni of Italy and Total of France reporting profit falls. The scale of the writedowns surprised some analysts, but they took comfort from the progress Shell was making to balance cash flow with spending and its ability to maintain the dividend. \u201cGetting out of previous strategic missteps (Alaska, shale, more oil sands) via the impairments is a necessary evil,\u201d said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in London.",

When asked by Jim Shannon, Democratic Unionist MP for Strangford, whether VW should meet the \u201cfull financial implications\u201d of falling resale values, McLoughlin said: \u201cThat is one of the issues which I think VW will have to address in due course.\u201d The transport secretary also pledged to push VW to fix the affected vehicles by the end of 2016. \u201cI will be looking to Volkswagen who have, it has to be said, acted disgracefully in this whole episode, to ensure that they live up to the expectations which they promised originally,\u201d McLoughlin said. \u201cWe will be working to make sure that does happen.\u201d VW has admitted that 11m vehicles around the world were fitted with a defeat device. The carmaker has put aside \u20ac6.7bn (\u00a34.4bn) to meet the costs of recalling the vehicles, but also faces the threat of fines and legal action from shareholders and customers. The company has hired accountancy firm Deloitte and law firm Jones Day to investigate who fitted the device into its vehicles. It is understood that the carmaker believes a group of between 10 and 20 employees were at the heart of the scandal. The transport secretary said the automotive industry would take steps to ensure that a similar scandal never happens again. He said: \u201cIndustry across the piece, as far as this is concerned, is very embarrassed about what has happened and I am pretty sure they will take proper action to make sure the right regulatory measures are taken.\u201d No other carmaker has admitted using defeat devices, but there remain concerns among campaigners about discrepancies between test results and the on-road performance of certain vehicles. McLoughlin defended plans for new emissions tests in Europe which will come into force from 2017. Critics have claimed the new regime is not strict enough. Carmakers will be allowed to exceed the legal limit for nitrogen oxide emissions by 110% between 2017 and 2020, and then by 50% after that, a move designed to give the industry time to adapt. McLoughlin said: \u201cThe current difference between laboratory testing and real world emissions is unacceptable. \u201cThe UK has been actively pressing Europe to address this problem and the agreement we secured in Brussels to introduce real-world testing in 2017 is an important milestone. \u201cWhat is important is that we got agreement for real-world emission testing right across the whole of Europe and this has been something which has been objected to in the past. We pressed for it in May. I am very pleased that we achieved it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Pfizer and Allergan are considering a merger that would unite the US makers of Viagra and Botox to create a drugs giant worth more than $300bn. The Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer had approached Allergan, but cautioned that the process was at an early stage and might not lead to a deal. The mega-merger would be by far the biggest in a flurry of deals in the industry this year. Allergan has a market value of $113bn (\u00a381bn); Pfizer is worth $219bn. Together they would overtake Johnson &amp; Johnson, worth $278bn, as the world\u2019s largest healthcare company. Pfizer is attracted to Allergan because it is domiciled in Ireland and its tax rate is far below Pfizer\u2019s in the US. The New York-based drug maker had a stab at shifting its tax base last year, but failed in its \u00a370bn takeover attempt of British firm AstraZeneca. Last autumn, a US crackdown on tax avoidance deals scuppered AbbVie\u2019s agreed takeover of Shire, which is based in Dublin, like Allergan. It is unclear whether the rule changes would affect the potential tax advantages from a Pfizer-Allergan deal. Pfizer also wants to beef up its branded-drug portfolio after boosting its off-patent business with the $16bn acquisition of Hospira at the start of the year. Pfizer boss Ian Read has made no secret of his desire to split the two businesses at some point. Stephen Brozak, analyst at WBB Securities, said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re the size of Pfizer, an acquisition like this may be the only choice you have in order to be able to move the needle for sequential growth ... so the question now becomes, if not this, what? And if not now, when?\u201d Pfizer produces Viagra and the cholesterol pill Lipitor, once the world\u2019s bestselling drug; Allergan is best known for Botox and also makes the dry-eye treatment Restasis. Shares in Allergan jumped nearly 9% to $312.45 in on the reports. In London, GlaxoSmithKline and Shire shares were down 1.5% and 2.4% respectively, as Pfizer had been mooted as a potential buyer for the companies. AstraZeneca was down by 0.8%. Pfizer previously failed in its attempt to buy Actavis, which went on to acquire Allergan and adopted the company\u2019s name. Allergan sold its generic business to Israel\u2019s Teva Pharmaceutical for $40.5bn in July. Analysts said one of the main hurdles in the way of a Pfizer-Allergan deal was price. Jonathan Morgan, head of research at The Edge Consulting Group, said: \u201cLooking at valuations, Allergan trades at a higher multiple versus GSK \u2013 or for that matter AstraZeneca \u2013 and we believe the pricing of the deal may be something of an obstacle. \u201cIf the deal does go through a further restructuring at Pfizer would be a possibility, as the company at some point would like to separate its patent-protected drugs portfolio from its off-patented drugs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "At least a third of boardroom positions at Britain\u2019s biggest companies should be held by women by the end of the decade, according to a report, although it does not recommend that quotas are imposed. The government-backed report from Lord Mervyn Davies, who has been championing gender equality in the boardroom, shows that FTSE 100 companies have exceeded the target of having 25% women on their boards \u2013 more than doubling the number in 2011 when the target was set. Then, just 135 of 1,076 (12.5%) FTSE 100 directorships were held by women. There are more women on FTSE 350 boards than ever before \u2013 26.1% at FTSE 100 companies and 19.6% at FTSE 250 firms. Davies said 550 women had been appointed in just over four years. There has also been a dramatic reduction in the number of all-male boards. There were 152 in 2011, but there are no all-male boards in the FTSE 100 and only 15 in the FTSE 250, compared with 131 four years ago. Davies hailed the \u201cnear-revolution which has taken place in the boardroom and profound culture change at the heart of British business\u201d. The former trade minister and chairman of Standard Chartered bank has set a new target of 33% female board members by 2020 and widened the scope to all FTSE 350 firms. But he says the introduction of legally enforced quotas was unwarranted as the progress so far proved that the voluntary approach is working. \u201cThere is no evidence to warrant an about-turn, but plenty of evidence to show the voluntary regime is working, as each and every month the percentage of women on FTSE boards increases,\u201d the report says. However, Krystyna Nowak of executive search firm Norman Broadbent, who was at the launch of the report, deplored a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d and said Davies\u2019 recommendations were disappointing. She said many companies would simply continue appointing women to non-executive director positions, leaving the executive board to continue to be dominated by men. She called on the government to address this in its equality-boosting measures planned for 2016. The UK ranks sixth in Europe behind Norway, Sweden, France, Finland and Belgium, many of which \u2013 including Norway, where women make up 35% of board members \u2013 have set formal quotas for female representation. Nora Senior, president of the British Chambers of Commerce, said there was no need for \u201coverbearing government regulation\u201d and called on business to \u201cstep up to the task of nurturing the pipeline of women at middle management level on to executive teams\u201d. While British companies have been appointing more female directors, they have been slower to promote women into the top jobs \u2013 the chief executive, chief finance officer and chairmanship roles. Most female directors hold non-executive roles. Research by the Guardian conducted this year showed there were more men called John running FTSE 100 companies than all the female bosses combined. The Davies review says \u201cfurther work and a renewed focus is required\u201d to increase women\u2019s representation further and have more appointed to chair and senior independent director roles. It called for or an independent steering body to be set up to support companies and report next year. Fiona Woolf, former lord mayor of the City of London, said: \u201cThis is no time to rest on our laurels and think the job is done. The figures of 26% of boards now being women of only 100 companies are still far too low when you consider 47% of the workforce and 53% of our graduates are female. The figure of 9.6% in relation to executive positions shows how much room there is for improvement.\u201d At FTSE 100 companies, consumer goods group Unilever is leading the way after doubling the number of women on its board to 50% since 2011 \u2013 the only company to achieve gender parity. At Marks &amp; Spencer, female board representation has risen to 41.7%, from 27.3% four years ago. Drinks giant Diageo has gone to 40% from 36.4%. At drugmaker AstraZeneca, as well as Sainsbury\u2019s, the proportion of women has risen to 33.3% from 27.3%. British American Tobacco has moved up to 30.8% from 25%; insurer Standard Life has seen a rise to 30% from 27.3%. The companies in the FTSE 350 with all-male boards were named as Allied Minds, Centamin, Deajan Holdings, HellermannTyton Group, Nostrum Oil and Gas, Perpetual Income and Growth Investment Trust, Telecom Plus, Wizz Air Holdings, Al Noor Hospitals Group, Clarkson, Genus, Lookers, P2P Global Investments, Scottish Investment Trust, and Tritax Big Box Reit. \u201cIt is unacceptable in this day and age to have any all-male boards,\u201d Nicky Morgan, education secretary and minister for women and equalities, said at the launch of the review. The FTSE 100 board with the most dramatic change was Old Mutual, which went from no female representation to 38.5%. Rolls-Royce went from 7.1% to 33.1% while HSBC rose from 16.7% to 42.1%. Davies called on investors to play a more active role in improving gender balance in companies. He said customers and potential employees should act against companies which do not \u201cget\u201d gender diversity. \u201cI think the customer should not be buying the product from those sorts of companies and young people should not be going to work for them,\u201d he said. Reacting to the review, the CBI called on the government to assist companies in increasing the representation of women with more free childcare and promoting flexible working. The Institute of Directors said headhunters and recruiters had a big responsibility to ensure they were looking at candidates from \u201cas wide a pool as possible\u201d. Its chair, Barbara Judge, added: \u201cWomen that make it to the top must also help others follow in their footsteps, by acting as role models and mentors.\u201d New research from Audeliss suggests Britain\u2019s boardrooms risk going into reverse gear over the next 18 months, as the terms of current female non-executive directors expire. The executive search firm warns that because there are too few female executives in the pipeline to replace them, it is likely that the percentage of female non-executive directors on boards will fall from 31% to 26%.",

The bill, which took its legal and compensation costs to \u00a32.3bn in the first nine months of the year, was revealed just 24 hours after its new boss, investment banker Jes Staley, pledged to clean up the bank\u2019s reputation. Barclays declined to give any detail about the latest scandal, but the City regulator said it was aware of the new problem at the bank. The finance director, Tushar Morzaria, said it followed an internal review of foreign exchange transactions between 2005 and 2012, when the bank believed it had not been applying appropriate rates. He declined to say whether corporate or retail customers were affected or if they had already received compensation. The Financial Conduct Authority said it was \u201caware of the issues and [we] are liaising with the firm on this matter\u201d. The \u00a3290m is part of \u00a31.3bn set aside for compensating customers in the first nine months of this year. A further \u00a31bn is earmarked for ongoing investigations and litigation, including \u00a3270m for two claims relating to the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US. In the third quarter, there was no additional provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling but the new charge follows a wave of scandals at Barclays, which has been hit by fines for rigging currencies and interest rates. The Robin Hood Tax campaign, which is calling for taxes on banks, said: \u201cSetting aside another massive provision for scamming its customers does little to restore faith in Barclays\u2019 tarnished reputation.\u201d The figures were contained in the nine-month results, which set out the challenges facing Staley. He is on a \u00a310m pay packet and will start on 1 December, earlier than expected. Barclays\u2019 shares sank more than 5% to 239p after the results were released on Thursday morning. Nine-month profits rose 7% to \u00a33.9bn and the bank focused on underlying profits of \u00a35.1bn, a 4% increase, although the City reacted to the fall in the profits in the third quarter. Even before Staley takes over \u2013 replacing Antony Jenkins, who was forced out in July \u2013 the bank reduced its targets for returns to shareholders. It blamed the \u00a31bn cost of complying with UK and US rules intended to make the bank safer along with a new corporation tax surcharge announced by George Osborne in July. Morzaria gave no details of the bank\u2019s plans to meet the so-called Vickers reforms, which require retail banking operations be protected from investment banking by a ringfence. But they are known to be causing Barclays difficulties and the bank is considering putting its retail banking arm under the ownership of its investment bank. John McFarlane, chairman and interim chief executive since July, said: \u201cAs we align Barclays around our three priorities \u2013 focus on core [segments and markets], generating shareholder value and instilling a high performance culture with strong ethical values \u2013 we now have a forward agenda that has been discussed and agreed with Mr Staley. \u201cWe will update the market on our plans for structural reform after we have agreed them with the regulator.

The retailer, which has 450 stores nationwide, has come under fire for keeping the vast majority of its 27,000-strong workforce on the controversial contracts.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Australian share market has lost more than 1% after a weaker than expected $7.2bn profit from ANZ and a warning from Woolworths about future earnings dragged stocks sharply lower. Woolworths and its rival, Coles owner Wesfarmers, were among the worst performers on the market after Woolies said its profit was likely to fall by up to 35% in the first half of the financial year. The retailer\u2019s shares ended the day down 9.8% at $24.70 while Wesfarmers was down 4.3% at $40.20, despite its much more positive sales update last week. The ASX/S&amp;P 200 lost 1.28% to finish on 5,266 points, not helped by ANZ missing analyst forecasts despite bumper profits. Shares in the bank were down 2% at $28.17 as its cash profit and steady dividend missed expectations on weaker earnings from its international business following the stock market and currency turmoil in Asia in July and August. Profit at the bank\u2019s Australian unit rose 7.2% to $3.27bn as the strong housing market helped grow customer numbers along with increased sales and market share. \u201cIn a constrained environment, we have continued to see growth in our core customer franchises in Australia, in New Zealand and in key Asian markets, partly offset by the effect of macro-economic headwinds on the international and institutional banking division,\u201d said outgoing chief executive Mike Smith. The broader market picture was clouded by suggestions overnight from the US Federal reserve that it could raise rates at its next meeting in December. Although analysts detected a slight lift for the ASX on the news, the Australian dollar fell as it continued to retreat from recent highs. The prospect of a hike in US borrowing costs was dampened after the Fed\u2019s September meeting, sparking a rally in the Aussie\u2019s fortunes, but now appeared to be firmly back on the agenda with several fed members known to favour a rise. The dollar was buying US71.02c at 2.30pm. Figures released on Thursday showed a decline in the number of new house sales in Australia. Housing Industry Association data showed that new home sales fell 4% in September, after rising 2.3% in August. Tighter lending requirements for investors introduced by the banks and the recent rise in mortgage rates were thought be behind the fall. A softening housing market could give the Reserve Bank of Australia more room to cut rates at its monthly meeting on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Woolworths has been rocked by the ongoing supermarket price war which has led to the departure of chairman Ralph Waters while chief executive Grant O\u2019Brien will leave once a successor has been found. The company recently launched a $500m program to lower food and grocery prices in a bid to win back customers and to contain German discounter Aldi, which is aggressively expanding into South Australia and Western Australia. But CMC Markets chief market analyst Ric Spooner said that while the market expected a weak result, the steep profit warning raised fears that there was more bad news in the pipeline. \u201cWoolworths appears to have lost more market share to Coles and there are fears there may be worse to come as it progresses its huge investment in lowering prices, which hurt profit margins,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors are going to be nervous until Woolworths shows signs of things stabilising or of a turnaround.\u201d",
