      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has set aside an initial \u20ac6.5bn to deal with the cost of the emissions scandal, though the final sum when potential compensation and fines are included is likely to be far greater. However, reputational damage, both to the Wolfsburg-based carmaker and the country\u2019s \u201cmade in Germany\u201d badge of manufacturing excellence, is harder to quantify. Growth in German factory activity fell to a three-month low in October, according to Markit\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), down to 52.1 from 52.3 the previous month. The data, published on Monday, suggests Europe\u2019s largest economy has weathered the Volkswagen scandal \u2013 so far. The German chancellor also remains confident. \u201cI do not believe that \u2018made in Germany\u2019 got a scratch by what happened at Volkswagen,\u201d Angela Merkel said on Saturday. Others are more sceptical. Among them is the UK-based research firm Brand Finance. Until the VW scandal broke in September, its analysts expected \u201ca fairly positive year for Germany\u2019s international reputation and the prospects of its nation brand\u201d. But after the recent \u201chammer blow\u201d, they changed their minds. Brand Finance\u2019s analysts now value the country\u2019s reputation at $4,166bn, down 4% from last year. \u201cThis scandal threatens to undo decades of accumulated goodwill,\u201d it says in its annual report. Germany prides itself on its manufacturing heritage, typified by the likes of Gottlieb Daimler, a pioneer of the internal combustion engine in the late 19th century. The dedication to technical details has been one of the country\u2019s strongest assets ever since. Global headhunting firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles found that more than one in four (27%) chief executives in Germany had a background in engineering. In other countries the proportion is much lower. In the UK it is only one in eight (13%). Heidrick &amp; Struggles does not expect this will change soon. \u201cGerman management style is very much focused on details\u201d, said partner Christine Stimpel. \u201cEngineers are educated that way.\u201d Nevertheless, German engineering prowess has faced stiffer competition in recent years in sectors it has traditionally led, such as automotive. When it comes to hybrid and electric cars, Asian companies and new rivals such as Tesla, Google and Apple are driving innovation. \u201cThe Germans are good in pushing things further, not in developing something completely new,\u201d says Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the centre of automotive research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. The new Berlin Brandenburg international airport is another example of doubts being raised about German ingenieurskunst, the so-called art of engineering. The hub was billed as the most modern in Europe. But instead of opening in 2011, the site on the outskirts of the German capital has remained under construction for almost a decade, mainly because of problems with the fire safety system. By the end of September, even construction workers were no longer allowed to enter parts of the building amid worries the roof could not carry the weight of smoke extractor fans . Some politicians are asking if it might be better to demolish the terminal and build a new one. The Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg has suffered similar difficulties. While its architecture is impressive, it took a long time to get there. Due to planning errors the opening had to be postponed several times; likewise, costs ballooned \u2013 instead of the originally planned \u20ac186m, they are now estimated to reach \u20ac865m. The airport and the Elbphilharmonie are due to open in 2017. The German Engineers\u2019 Association, VDI, blames politicians for pursuing prestige projects and taking management roles as a major factor in the delays. \u201cThe engineers have warned them, but they weren\u2019t heard,\u201d said Ralph Appel, its director. Politicians traditionally have a big influence on Volkswagen\u2019s management decisions as well, with Lower Saxony owning a fifth of the shares and the state chancellor, Stephan Weil, on the supervisory board. Industry analyst Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer warns against drawing general conclusions about the state of German manufacturing based on what has happened at Volkswagen. \u201cThe scandal is not about the quality of German engineering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about bad management.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Companies usually commission independent reports into their failings only when they think the worst mistakes have been rectified and the author will find as many positives as negatives. Thomas Cook\u2019s board may have been hoping for such a conclusion from Justin King\u2019s inquiry. If so, it will badly disappointed. The shameful finding in King\u2019s report is that, even nine years after the deaths of Bobby and Christi Shepherd from carbon monoxide poisoning while on a Thomas Cook holiday, the company is only in the early stages of shedding an ugly culture that put legal considerations before doing the right thing for customers. King says \u201cin recent history, the axis of the business has been around financial, contracting, the airlines and destination\u201d. He notes that key functions, including health and safety, have been reorganised, but adds damningly: \u201cIt is clear that to date the actions have been insufficient or progress has been slow.\u201d A new contract for auditing hotels is described as an improvement on the old regime but \u201cthe option chosen was at the lower end of the scale reflecting budgetary constraints\u201d. King concludes: \u201cAs such the current level of auditing can best be described as adequate and industry matching.\u201d In other words, a market leader should be capable of doing better. As you would expect from a long-serving former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, King is strong on the pressures affecting Thomas Cook, from its financial crisis in 2011-12 to the rise of do-it-yourself holidays. But the message is that the company has not helped itself by failing to explain the difference between a cheap holiday and a value-for-money version. Representatives in resorts \u2013 a main way in which Thomas Cook is supposed to be offering extra service \u2013 have been denied resources to fix problems and given the wrong incentives. King, with his polite hat on, says he is confident that reforms started by the current chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, will lead to \u201creal and lasting change\u201d. An encouraging thought is that Thomas Cook\u2019s Scandinavian business already run on many of the lines King advises for the UK unit. Outsiders, though, will remember that Fankhauser is the third chief executive since the tragedies in Corfu in 2006 (the others being the over-rewarded Manny Fontenla-Novoa and Harriet Green) and will be astonished that Thomas Cook still needs to be told by an outsider that its attempts at improvement are inadequate. Will Shire\u2019s $6bn bet on Dyax be a turkey? The most used phrase in Shire\u2019s presentation of its $5.9bn (\u00a33.8bn) purchase of Dyax, a US biotech firm, was \u201cif approved\u201d. Shire\u2019s chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov, was not talking about the deal itself, which looks a formality: regulators, almost certainly, won\u2019t object and Dyax\u2019s shareholders will surely jump at a cash offer pitched 35% above last Friday\u2019s share price and three times the level of a year ago. Rather, \u00d8rnskov was referring to Dyax\u2019s main drug in development \u2013 DX-2930, a potential treatment for hereditary angioedema, a relatively rare disease that attacks the immune system. If the drug is approved for use, Shire\u2019s boasts about \u201csignificant earnings accretion\u201d in the future are plausible. If not, this $6bn bet will be a turkey. Those are the risks in the biotech business, of course, and Shire, to be fair, has a decent record of picking winners among development drugs. In this case, it is buying a potential direct competitor to two of its established drugs, so ought to know the field. Even so, not all medicines pass late-stage trials: $6bn for a development drug that is only just entering phrase three, and won\u2019t be approved until 2018 at the earliest, seems an extremely rich price. Bank-friendly measures put HSBC in a spin Few major decisions taken by committee happen quickly, so perhaps we should not be surprised that the 19 members of HSBC\u2019s board of directors want more time to decide whether to quit London. White smoke had been promised from the boardroom by the end of this year; now the bank says it may miss the deadline. One suspects what has really happened is that back in April, when this review was launched, there was a strong bias towards Hong Kong. Now, after George Osborne\u2019s many bank-friendly measures, such as the changes to the bank levy in a manner that massively favours international banks such as HSBC, second thoughts are creeping in. It would be logical. In the UK, a bank with a beef can air its arguments publicly, lobby politicians and talk to regulators who are answerable to a democratically elected parliament. In Hong Kong, under the intense gaze of the Chinese Communist party, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re signing up to, now or in the next few decades. And if Hong Kong/China turns out not to be a bed of regulatory roses, HSBC can\u2019t expect to be granted an exit visa back to Blighty.",

      "bodyText": "The Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal has deepened after US authorities accused the carmaker of installing defeat devices into luxury sports cars including Porsches. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which uncovered the initial emissions rigging at VW, claims the carmaker installed defeat devices in VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles with three-litre engines in models with dates ranging from 2014 to 2016 This marks the first time that Porsche, which is owned by VW, has been dragged into the scandal. It is troubling for the new chief executive of VW, Matthias M\u00fcller, because he ran Porsche before becoming boss of the group. The EPA has made the allegations after conducting further tests on diesel vehicles in the US since VW admitted in September it had used defeat devices to cheat emissions tests. The new allegations include the 2015 Porsche Cayenne as well as the 2014 VW Touareg and the 2016 Audi A6 Quattro, A7 Quattro, A8, A8L, and Q5. In total, it involves 10,000 vehicles in the US. In a statement VW denied it had fitted any devices on the vehicles. The statement said: \u201cVolkswagen AG wishes to emphasise that no software has been installed in the 3-liter V6 diesel power units to alter emissions characteristics in a forbidden manner. Volkswagen will cooperate fully with the EPA clarify this matter in its entirety.\u201d VW has already admitted fitting a defeat device to 11m vehicles worldwide, but this related to cars with smaller engines and did not include any Porsche cars or sports utility vehicles (SUVs). Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the office for EPA\u2019s enforcement and compliance assurance, said: \u201cVW has once again failed its obligation to comply with the law that protects clean air for all Americans. All companies should be playing by the same rules. EPA, with our state, and federal partners, will continue to investigate these serious matters, to secure the benefits of the Clean Air Act, ensure a level playing field for responsible businesses, and to ensure consumers get the environmental performance they expect.\u201d The EPA has issued a second notice of violation (NOV) of the Clean Air Act to VW as a result of its findings. VW faces fines of up to $37,500 per vehicle, which means an extra $375m (\u00a3243m) could be added to its penalities if it is found guilty. The company already faces a potential $18bn fine for the initial recall by the EPA in September of 482,000 VW and Audi cars. Richard Corey, executive officer of the California Air Resources Board, said: \u201cOn 25 September, the California Air Resources Board sent letters to all manufacturers letting them know we would be screening vehicles for potential defeat devices. Since then ARB, EPA and Environment Canada have continued test programmes on additional diesel-powered passenger cars and SUVs. These tests have raised serious concerns about the presence of defeat devices on additional VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles. \u201cToday we are requiring VW Group to address these issues. This is a very serious public health matter. ARB and EPA will continue to conduct a rigorous investigation that includes testing more vehicles until all of the facts are out in the open.\u201d The carmaker has put aside \u20ac6.7bn (\u00a34.4bn) to meet the costs of recalling the 11m vehicles, but also faces the threat of fines and legal action from shareholders and customers. The company has hired the accountancy firm Deloitte and the law firm Jones Day to investigate who fitted the device into its vehicles. It is understood that the carmaker believes a group of between 10 and 20 employees were at the heart of the scandal. Martin Winterkorn stepped down as chief executive of VW as a result of the scandal. His replacement, M\u00fcller, last week vowed to be \u201cruthless in punishing those involved\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are leaving no stone unturned to find out what exactly happened and to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK factory growth jumps, but China shrinks again - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a summary after a raft of manufacturing reports from around the world. In the US, the Markit PMI was revised higher but the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) index of US factory activity suggested growth almost ground to a standstill last month. Employment in the sector fell, according to the ISM survey, prompting some expectations of a gloomy picture when the closely watched non-farm payrolls report on the US labour market is published on Friday. With markets seizing on downbeat news as positive for shares, because it is seen cutting the chances of a US rate hike in December, Wall Street extended gains after the manufacturing report. October was a mixed month overall for global manufacturing. China\u2019s malaise continued, with activity shrinking for the eighth month in a row. Economists say it means Beijing may need to cut interest rates again soon, to prop up demand. The UK smashed forecasts, with growth hitting its fastest rate in 16 months. Some analysts couldn\u2019t quite believe the numbers, and argued that the underlying picture was less healthy. The Eurozone had a rather subdued month - with growth in Germany and Spain slowing, and French factories posting little growth. Italy did surprisingly well, though. Over in Athens, Greek bank shares jumped after stress tests showed they \u201conly\u201d need \u20ac14.4bn in new capital.... ...while students are protesting about education cuts. Britain\u2019s biggest bank, HSBC, noted a reduction in income from overdraft fees as it reported a rise in profits but drop in revenues. The bank also warned it may delay until next a year its decision on whether to remain based in London. In other banking news, the UK\u2019s high street banks are each in line for multimillion-pound windfalls from the sale of Visa Europe in a deal valuing the credit and debit card company at \u20ac21.2bn (\u00a315bn) And the Turkish stock market and lira have both jumped after Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s party won last night\u2019s general election. Investors welcomed the decisive result, even though it may lead to more discontent among opposition supporters. On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. President Barack Obama has highlighted his hope that the US will be spared eleventh-hour government shutdown threats as he signed a new budget bill today. By signing into law the pact agreed last week by Congress, Obama also averts the threat of a default on US government debt. The US Congress reached the two-year budget agreement in a rare bipartisan breakthrough. The pact takes volatile issues like the debt limit and government funding off the table until after the 2016 presidential election, thus paving the way for soon-to-be speaker of the House Paul Ryan to ease into his new role as John Boehner resigns from Congress. Reuters reports that in a brief signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Obama noted lawmakers would still need to pass spending bills, but said he was confident they could get them done on time, and that the bill should free the nation from last-minute government shutdown threats. European markets have now closed and most main indices have got off to a solid start to November. Only London\u2019s FTSE 100 is left behind, flat at 6,362 after gains for banking stocks were offset by weaker miners in the wake of more downbeat manufacturing data out of China. Here\u2019s how the main indices finished the day: In the US, stock markets are also higher. Sticking with financial services, the UK\u2019s high street banks are each in line for multimillion-pound windfalls from the sale of Visa Europe in a deal valuing the credit and debit card company at \u20ac21.2bn (\u00a315bn). Owned by thousands of lenders, Visa Europe is being sold to its one-time sister company, Visa Inc, which was floated on the US stock market in 2008. The UK\u2019s main banks could receive up to \u00a31bn between them, reports Jill Treanor. She writes: The deal sparked a flurry of stock market announcements from the lenders that had to reveal their profits. Barclays expects to make \u00a3400m and bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u00a3300m and \u00a3200m respectively. HSBC\u2019s profit was estimated at \u00a3150m. Chirantan Barua, analyst at Bernstein Research, warned the benefits might not be long-standing: \u201cAlthough we see this as a positive in the short term for the UK banks as this represents a boost to capital we do not see this as a free lunch. Now that the banks will be \u2018external\u2019 to the payment system they will see their fee income margin start to be squeezed and we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Visa tried to increase the margins in Europe at the expense of the banks.\u201d Worldpay, the payments company recently floated on the London Stock Exchange, said it expected to receive \u20ac1.2bn. There are more than 500m Visa cards issued across Europe and the deal is being announced \u2013 after years of speculation \u2013 at a time when new regulations will cap fees that banks can charge retailers for debit and credit card use. A rise in the use of cards is also expected in the years ahead and this would allow Visa to compete more effectively with Mastercard. The full news story: Elsewhere in the banking sector, Barclays has agreed to pay out $94m to settle US antitrust lititgation by investors, Reuters reports. According to the news service, the UK-listed bank was among 11 banks accused by investors of conspiring to manipulate the benchmark European Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) and related derivatives. Barclays is the first defendant to settle, according to court papers. Reuters continues: Kenneth Feinberg, a prominent mediator who helped broker the accord, said in an affidavit \u201cthis first and early settlement with Barclays provides plaintiffs with a precedent and settlement structure that may encourage other interested defendants to settle.\u201d Barclays\u2019 preliminary settlement requires court approval. Other defendants include BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc, Credit Agricole SA, Deutsche Bank AG , HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co , Rabobank BA, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Societe Generale SA and UBS AG. The electronic broker-dealer ICAP Plc is also a defendant. The full story is here. HSBC caused a political storm in April when it announced it was considering whether to keep its headquarters in London. Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive, has previously said the decision would be known by the end of 2015 but now it seems the wait may be longer. My colleague Jill Treanor has been reporting on the bank\u2019s results today and HSBC\u2019s comments that it may delay a decision on whether to remain based in London until next year. Here is a flavour of Jill\u2019s updated story following HSBC\u2019s delayed conference call. As the bank announced results for the first nine months of the year, it said a decision might take longer. \u201cAn announcement will be made when the board makes its final decision and, if necessary, a further update will be provided at the time of the full year results,\u201d the bank said. Douglas Flint, the HSBC chairman, said the board had requested additional information as part of the review. He said the decision would be based \u201con long-term perspectives rather than short-term factors\u201d. \u201cWe take it very seriously and give it the appropriate amount of work,\u201d said Flint, who was speaking from China, where the bank had just sealed a deal to create a securities trading venture in Shenzhen. \u201cWe are halfway through.\u201d The bank has been linked with a series of alternative locations in addition to Hong Kong, including the US and Canada. Since HSBC announced its review, the British government has made changes to the taxation of banks that are regarded as preferable to HSBC. It has also clarified parts of the regulatory regime that had been concerning the bank. Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said: \u201cWe think that HSBC should move ahead with a re-domicile out of the UK as soon as possible.\u201d Despite the reduction in the bank levy announced by George Osborne in July, Gordon said HSBC was still expecting to pay $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) towards the levy, which is based on the size of bank balance sheets in 2017. The full story: Shares in HSBC are down almost 1%, or 4.3p, at 503.1p. They are down 17% from the start of the year. On Wall Street, traders appear to have latched onto to the downbeat tone of the latest manufacturing report, which pointed to a drop in employment last month. US non-farm payrolls numbers due on Friday will be all important to how the Federal Reserve judges the state of the labour market but in the meantime, this week reading from an admittedly small sector of the US economy is seen as reducing the chances of a December rate hike. The Dow Jones industrial average has extended earlier gains to be up around 100 points at 17,764. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 36 points at 5,090. The S&amp;P 500 is up 10 points at 2,089, having been flat at the open before the manufacturing reports. In the UK, where a manufacturing report earlier signalled a rebound in output and orders, the FTSE 100 down, but only by one point, at 6360. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread-betting firm Spreadex has been following US reactions: It appears that investors took the negative news to heart, lifting the Dow Jones to near 3-month highs as November\u2019s first piece of crucial information (in what is going to be a month full of over-scrutinised data) arguably dealt a blow to the Fed\u2019s hopes of raising rates in December. The fervour around US news is only going to increase in importance as the week goes on, with factory orders, Markit and ISM services PMIs, a testimony from Janet Yellen and, of course, Friday\u2019s non-farm jobs report still to come. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) highlights various headwinds in its report showing a slowdown in US manufacturing growth in October. Comments from the panel reflect concern over the high price of the dollar and the continuing low price of oil, mixed with cautious optimism about steady to increasing demand in several industries.\u201d Reacting to the report, which just beat expectations but showed barely any growth last month, James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets says there are possible implications for the closely watched US non-farm payrolls report due on Friday: The details are very mixed. Both new orders and production improved to stand at 52.9, but employment fell to 47.6 from 50.5. By falling into contraction territory (sub-50) this suggests some downside risk for Friday\u2019s jobs number, although manufacturing is dwarfed by the service sector in terms of overall employment and a stronger non-ISM figure would raise optimism once again. It is clear that the manufacturing sector is going to continue to underperform non-manufacturing given that dollar strength and external demand weakness are clear drags for the sector. However, we are more hopeful for the service sector while construction spending grew 0.6% month-on-month. As such, the US economy in aggregate should perform better in the fourth quarter than the disappointing third quarter reading of 1.5% annualised. This will keep thoughts of a December Fed rate hike alive.\u201d Hot on the heels of Markit\u2019s US manufacturing PMI, a separate report paints a somewhat gloomier picture of the sector\u2019s fortunes in October. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) index of US factory activity suggests growth slowed last month, holding at its weakest level since May 2013. The index dipped to 50.1 from 50.2 in September. That left it only just in expansion territory - as with the PMI, 50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction. The forecast in a Reuters poll of economists was for 50.0. The report\u2019s jobs index fell to the lowest level since the downturn days of mid-2009 and at 47.6 was below the key 50-mark for the first time since April this year. More details and reactions to follow soon... US manufacturing PMI rises Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit says the latest manufacturing report is encouraging after growth slumped in the third quarter of this year. He notes that companies reported the largest monthly jump in new order inflows since March. Export growth had also revived, suggesting firms were managing to adapt to the stronger dollar, as job creation picked up after slowing in September, he added. On what it means for US interest rates, Williamson commented: With the Fed eagerly watching the data flow to see whether the third quarter economic slowdown will intensify, the improvement in the manufacturing sector increases the odds of policymakers voting to hike rates at the FOMC\u2019s December meeting. \u201cHowever, with inflationary pressures remaining very subdued and signs of the slowdown persisting into the fourth quarter in the larger service sector, the policy outlook is by no means certain and debate about whether the economy yet needs higher interest rates will no doubt remain intense.\u201d The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) index of national factory activity is out shortly. US manufacturers enjoyed slightly faster growth in October than previously thought, according to the latest PMI report from Markit. Its main index of factory performance has been revised up to a six-month high of 54.1 from a previous estimate of 54.0 for October and compared with 53.1 in September. It was well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction. The survey compilers said the figure represented a \u201cmodest rebound in US manufacturing performance\u201d, driven by faster rises in output, new orders and employment levels. The index pointed to the sharpest improvement in overall business conditions since April. Markit\u2019s press release with more details can be found here, and here\u2019s the pdf. US stock markets have opened slightly higher, with investors anticipating some weak manufacturing numbers out shortly, which would be seen as cutting the chances of a rate hike before year end. That\u2019s right, as we reported earlier, markets are in one of those bad=good phases when it comes to US economic news. Whether it works both ways remains to be seen. But there is a fair chance that an upside surprise in one or both of the manufacturing surveys from the US this afternoon will mean shares fall back because the chances of a rate rise are seen to increase. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 42 points to 17,705, the Nasdaq is up 13 points at 5,066 and the S&amp;P 500 was just 2 points higher at the open at 2,081. HSBC has reported its latest financial results today and as we covered earlier Britain\u2019s biggest bank said profits were up because of a fall in fines and legal costs. But revenues were down and my colleague Jill Treanor has been looking into one of the causes: a reduction in income from overdraft fees. Jill reports: Customers of HSBC and First Direct saved $135m (\u00a385m) in overdraft charges after the bank started sending text messages to warn them they were about to go into the red. The bank started sending texts to its customers a year ago, alerting them when they risked incurring charges for unauthorised overdrafts. In the first month, it sent 1.2m texts and by September this year the number had risen to 1.5m. The bank found that 72% of First Direct customers sent the alerts were able to avoid fees as were 50% of those of its high street network HSBC. The bank charges \u00a35 a day for customers with unauthorised overdrafts and caps the monthly fee at \u00a380. This charging structure has been in place for a year and replaced the \u00a325 fee charged each time a customer slides into the red. The full story: As \u2018manufacturing Monday\u2019 continues, investors are now looking ahead to data due out of the US. The backdrop for numbers is markets in full-on \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d debate over the prospects of a rate hike from US Federal Reserve next month. The US PMI report by Markit - the group behind the European ones published earlier today is out at 14.45GMT and then the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) index of national factory activity is out at 15.00GMT. The Fed has certainly left the door very much open to a hike while insisting, as usual, that what matters mores than its own guidance is how the data plays out. What that could well mean for markets is that any weaker data is taken as a positive because it reduces the chance of a hike. Looking ahead to the manufacturing data, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread-betting firm Spreadex explains further: Still to come are the USA\u2019s own manufacturing figures; the official figure is expected at a stable 54, whilst the ISM number is forecast to fall slightly from 50.2 to a teetering even closer to contraction 50. The spectre of a weak number appears to be lifting the Dow, if only just, ahead of the US open, the index edging up by around 12 points. Following the surprisingly hawkish FOMC statement last week US data is arguably back to the old good is bad/bad is good trend that has defined 2015, something that will get a full workout this week as non-farm Friday approaches. Time for a recap. October was a mixed month for global manufacturing, according to a flurry of data released this morning. China\u2019s malaise continued, with activity shrinking for the eighth month in a row. Economists say it means Beijing may need to cut interest rates again soon, to prop up demand. The UK has smashed forecasts, with growth hitting its fastest rate in 16 months. Some analysts can\u2019t quite believe the numbers, and argue that the underlying picture is less healthy. The Eurozone had a rather subdued month - with growth in Germany and Spain slowing, and French factories posting little growth. Italy did surprisingly well, though. Over in Athens, Greek bank shares have jumped after stress tests showed they \u201conly\u201d need \u20ac14.4bn in new capital.... ...while students are protesting about education cuts. And the Turkish stock market and lira have both jumped after Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s party won last night\u2019s general election. Investors welcomed the decisive result, even though it may lead to more discontent among opposition supporters. Greek students have taken to the streets today, to protest against government cutbacks that are harming their education. These photos just arrived, showing a solid turnout as students shout slogans against the government and its plans to cut the education budget: The Kathimerini newspaper has more details: School pupils demonstrated in the central Athens on Monday, demanding improved learning conditions. According to authorities, tensions rose when a group of youngsters hurled stones at police forces. The rally, which was organized through the Internet, was billed as \u201cwarning\u201d action, with youngsters protesting against staff, books and infrastructure shortages, among others. Also on Monday, the union representing secondary school teachers, OLME, was holding a three-hour stoppage running through 2 pm [local time]. Many schools failed to open for the start of the autumn term, due to staff shortages. One report says Greece needs 21,000 extra teachers. That could have really serious consequences for young Greeks, who can\u2019t be blamed for any of the country\u2019s deep-seated problems. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s children should be OK, though - their left-wing father recently dispatched them to one of Athens better private schools.... China\u2019s manufacturing sector passed a significant milestone today - with the unveiling of its first ever homegrown passenger jet. The C919 rolled smartly off the assembly line in Shanghai, to be admired by the assembled crowd. The Communist party\u2019s official mouthpiece newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, declared the accomplishment \u201can historic breakthrough\u201d, as my colleague Tom Phillips reports: The development of China\u2019s first large passenger jet has huge symbolic value for the Communist party as President Xi Jinping pursues what he calls the \u201cgreat rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d. \u201cA great nation must have its own large commercial aircraft,\u201d Li Jiaxiang, the head of China\u2019s civil aviation authority, told those invited to the plane\u2019s unveiling ceremony, according to Bloomberg. \u201cThe air transportation industry of China cannot completely rely on imports,\u201d he said. However, the twin-engine C919 jet won\u2019t be delivered to airlines for at least another three years, having originally been aiming to hit the skies next year. Here\u2019s the full story: Noted.... We\u2019ll have more details from HSBC\u2019s (delayed) call later.... Shares in Greek banks have jumped this morning, after new official tests showed that they needed slightly less new capital than expected. Eurobank, Alpha Bank and Piraeus Bank are all up over 10% this morning, with Athens traders calculating that the stress test results could have been worse. The ECB announced on Saturday that Greece\u2019s banking sector needs \u20ac14.4bn of fresh funds, to cover a jump in bad loans during this year\u2019s debt crisis. A serious sum, but below the \u20ac25bn allocated to the sector in the bailout deal agreed this summer. This could encourage investors to put money back into the sector. Piraeus bank was told to raise almost \u20ac5bn of new capital, followed by the National Bank of Greece \u20ac4.6bn, Alpha Bank \u20ac2.7bn and Eurobank \u20ac2.1bn. The clock is ticking -- the banks want to raise this funds before new rules are implemented in 2016, which would allow large depositors to be \u2018bailed in\u2019. And this doesn\u2019t mean that the Greek banking sector is fixed, as analyst Silvia Merler writes for Bruegel: First, the biggest source of risk for the Greek banks may still be not accounted for. The exercise does not deal with Greek banks\u2019 reliance on sizable Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs). For some banks, these make up about 50% of CET1.. DTAs are by no means used by Greek banks only, and the issue is ultimately rooted in the definition of capital in our regulatory framework, so it would make absolutely no sense for the ECB to change the rule only for Greek banks in this exercise. Rather than solving the problem, this would delay finding a solution. The slump in Greece\u2019s factory sector has almost bottomed out, according to today\u2019s data from Markit. The Greek manufacturing PMI jumped to 47.3 last month, a five-month high, having slumped to almost 30 this summer. But although the downturn eased, Greek manufacturing did still deteriorate further. Firms reported that new orders were down again, while job cuts continued. Not a surprise, given capital controls make it hard for companies to trade abroad: HSBC has suffered a nasty attack of gremlins. The banking giant is due to be holding a conference call with investors and analysts now, to discuss its latest results. But the call has been stricken by a technical glitch that has stopped anyone - including the bank itself - from dialling in. Those results showed a 32% increase in profits in last quarter, to $6.1bn, mainly due to smaller bill for compensation and fines (welcome to modern banking!) There\u2019s also no progress on whether HSBC will move its headquarters out of London, as our City editor Jill Treanor reports: HSBC has warned that the outcome of its review of whether to remain based in London could be delayed beyond the end of this year, as it reported a rise in profits because of a fall in fines and legal costs. Britain\u2019s biggest bank caused a political storm in April when it announced it was considering whether to keep its headquarters in London, where it moved to in 1992 from Hong Kong to facilitate the takeover of Midland bank. Stuart Gulliver, the bank\u2019s chief executive, later said the decision would be known by the end of 2015. But, as the bank announced its results for the first nine months of the year, it said a decision might take longer.... Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, is also a little sceptical about the PMI report. He\u2019s surprised that UK factories would have enjoyed such a strong October, given the ongoing weaknesses in Europe and the strength of the pound: \u201cThough much-needed, after three consecutive quarters of falling output, many will find October\u2019s rebound in manufacturing numbers a tad surprising and will eagerly await November\u2019s figures to see how sustainable the bounce back is. Buoyant as orders from some exports markets may have been, the appreciation of sterling and the impact this has on competitiveness within our main export market, the Eurozone, continues to test UK manufacturers.\u201d This chart from Berenberg underlines how the UK factory PMI has bucked the recent downward trent... Berenberg Bank\u2019s Kallum Pickering also urges caution over the UK factory PMI report. He points out that it shows one of the best monthly improvements in recent history, surprising economists who expected a slight deterioration: Monthly data can be volatile, and often survey data is at best loosely related to the underlying trend in the official data. Therefore, it is important to see this trend both established over an extended period and reflected in the underlying data before claiming victory. Still, the 3.7 point monthly gain to 55.5 is one of the steepest in the surveys history and was significantly above both the market consensus of a slight decline and our above own optimistic view of unchanged on the month. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, isn\u2019t convinced by this UK PMI report. He calls it a \u2018striking outlier\u2019, given that the UK manufacturing sector is currently in recession (according to the official GDP figures). Tombs writes: In one line: Take with a pinch of salt. He adds that: We doubt that exports will see sustained growth, given that they are uncompetitive at the current exchange rate. And domestic demand growth is likely to weaken too as consumers\u2019 real income growth slows as inflation rebounds and job gains slow. So to us, this doesn\u2019t look like the start of a manufacturing resurgence. Large UK factories led the revival last month, rather than smaller manufacturers, according to Markit: David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains why: \u201cThe sector rode on the crest of an exports market wave taking full advantage of the opportunity to create a surge of output growth and new orders. \u201cThough domestically orders were still strong, it was export orders primarily from the Middle East, East Asia and the USA, that supported this expansion of work. Larger corporates were the overall winners more able to meet the demands of the overseas markets and employing more staff, as SMEs lagged behind with little change. It\u2019s all quite surprising, given the recent warning signs from across the global economy... James Knightley of ING says the revival of UK manufacturing last month is \u201cvery impressive given the strength of sterling and external growth worries\u201d. The British economy may grow by as much as 1% in this quarter, if the strong factory growth recorded last month persists. That would be twice as fast as in the third quarter of 2015. Output and new orders both accelerated last month, pushing Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI up to 55.5, from 51.8. That\u2019s a significant acceleration in growth. It was mainly due to strong domestic demand, although overseas sales also picked up. Markit\u2019s Rob Dobson says: Based on historical comparisons, the survey is consistent with a quarterly rate of growth of around 1%, a vast improvement on what we have seen in recent months. The big question now is whether this bounceback is a one-off or the start of a sustained re-emergence from recession. \u201cThe ongoing strength of the domestic market and a welcome improvement in new export orders led to a broad-based upturn in production of consumer, intermediate and investment goods. And here\u2019s the key points from the report (online here) Delighted to report that Guardian Towers has not burned down, and we\u2019re allowed inside again. The pound has jumped against the US dollar on the back of that strong manufacturing report. An early interest rate rise just became a little more likely.... Wow. UK factory output smashed forecasts last month, with much stronger growth than expected: That\u2019s pretty encouraging at first glance, suggesting fears over the British economy may be overdone.... Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has analysed today\u2019s eurozone PMI reports (presumably from a nice warm office, the lucky blighter). He says that they show modest improvement: On the positive side, overall export growth was reported to have improved to a four-month high in October. While this includes intra-regional trade, it lifts hopes that the Eurozone is so far not being significantly hit by weakened growth in China and the Emerging Markets. Total orders growth improved in October to be at the best level since April 2014, which supports hopes that manufacturing activity cab see further modest improvement over the final two months of 2015. Among the individual Eurozone countries, manufacturing expansion encouragingly clearly accelerated in Italy (up to 54.1 from 52.7) while there was also improvement in the Netherlands (up to 53.7 from 53.0) and Austria (up to 20-month high of 53.0 from 52.5). Meanwhile, France managed to eke out a second successive month of modest expansion in October as its index was unchanged from September at 50.6. However, German manufacturing growth slowed slightly in October (down to 52.1 from 52.3 in September), while Spanish expansion notably slowed to a 22-month low (down to 51.3 from 51.7). There was also slower manufacturing growth in Ireland (down to 52.6 from 53.8). Finally, the contraction in Greek manufacturing activity moderated in October to the slowest rate since May (up to 47.3 from 43.3 in September and a record low of 30.2 in July). Good news: I\u2019ve set up a mobile hotspot outside our local pub. Bad news, it\u2019s closed.... Gosh it\u2019s cold outside this morning. Anyway, it takes more than a fire alarm to stop this blog - so here\u2019s a chart showing how the Big Four eurozone countries performed last month: The upshot of today\u2019s PMI reports is that growth in the eurozone manufacturing sector ticked higher in October. Markit\u2019s final Eurozone Manufacturing PMI has just been announced, at 52.3 in October, up from 52.0 in September. The final PMI data for output, new orders and employment all came in stronger than the earlier flash estimates. And with that, the fire alarms are going off here. Back soon (hopefully).... Now for Germany.....and growth in its factory sector has hit a three-month low in October. The German factory PMI has dipped to 52.1 last month, from 52.3 in September. It\u2019s too early to say if that means the economy is actually weakening, or merely entering a \u2018soft patch\u2019. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, says there are some \u201cwarning signs\u201d in the data set. In particular, stocks of finished goods rose for the first time in a year, suggesting that a future rise in demand could be satisfied by using existing stock, rather than scaling up production levels. \u201cMoreover, growth was largely consumer-led, with the strong performance of the sector sitting in stark contrast with a contraction in the intermediate goods sector and only modest growth at investment goods firms. France\u2019s factory sector has posted modest growth again, lagging behind Spain and Italy: Good news from Italy! The Italian manufacturing PMI rose to 54.1 in October, up from 52.7 in September. That means the sector expanded for the ninth month running, and at the fastest rate since July. Italian firms told Markit that output and new orders both rose at accelerated rates last month, meaning they continued to hire more staff. Phil Smith, Economist at Markit, adds: Encouragingly, according to panel member reports sources of growth were both domestic and international, boding well for the sustainability of the recovery. China\u2019s lacklustre factory growth has helped to push Europe\u2019s stock markets down in early trading. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Any signs of improvement from China are a bonus; however, the markets haven\u2019t exploded into life in light of that better than expected Caixin figure largely because in its pre-50 form it still signals the 8 consecutive month of manufacturing contraction in the country. Spain\u2019s economic recovery appears to have come off the boil last month. Growth in the Spanish manufacturing sector has hit its lowest rate since December 2013, according to Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck. Firms reported that production growth slowed, due to weaker demand from clients. However, they also reported a pick-up in export orders, suggesting the sector is still quite robust. Economic growth in Spain could be pegged back until the country had voted in December\u2019s general election.\uf0a7 Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, explains: \u201cIt\u2019s looking like a low key end to the year for the Spanish manufacturing sector as growth rates for output, new orders and employment have all slowed to a crawl in recent months. The forthcoming election is likely resulting in some caution among firms and clients alike as they wait to see the outcome of the December vote. Ireland\u2019s manufacturing PMI has fallen to 53.6 in October, down fractionally from 53.8 in September. That still shows robust growth, thanks to a rise in new business. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, Chief Economist at Investec Ireland, has the details: \u201cThere was a welcome quickening (to a three month high) in the rate of expansion in New Orders in October. A key factor behind this improvement was the ongoing substantial growth in New Export Orders, with a number of panellists reporting higher new business from clients in the US and UK. Once Erdo\u011fan has finished celebrating his election win, he can turn his attention to Turkey\u2019s struggling economy. And the latest PMI report, just released, shows that its factory sector shrank again last month, although at a slower pace. The Turkish factory PMI rose to 49.5, up from 48.8 in September, showing a \u201cmarginal deterioration in Turkish manufacturing business conditions\u201d. Output and new orders both fell, but exports and job levels rose, indicating a turnaround may be close. Trevor Balchin, Senior Economist at Markit, said: \u201cTurkey\u2019s manufacturing malaise continued in October, although the latest survey results suggest that the extent of the downturn remains modest. Investors have welcomed the news that Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan secured a decisive win in Sunday\u2019s general election. Shares on the Turkish stock market are rallying in early trading, up over 5%, and the Turkish lira has strengthened against the US dollar: Erdo\u011fan\u2019s campaign was based on the message that only his conservative, Islamic-leaning AKP could guarantee stability in Turkey. The country is facing the overspill of turmoil in the Middle East, the refugee crisis, and its own economic problems. This unexpected victory gives Erdo\u011fan\u2019s renewed influence over the Turkish parliament, although he\u2019s not got the \u2018supermajority\u2019 needed to reshape the political landscape into a US-style presidency. The result could also exacerbate divisions Turkey, as we reported overnight: The prime minister and AKP leader Ahmet Davuto\u011flu tweeted simply \u201cElhamdulillah,\u201d or \u201cThanks be to God,\u201d before emerging from his family home in the central Anatolian city of Konya to tell crowds of cheering supporters that the win was \u201ca victory for our democracy, and our people\u201d. Describing the results as a disaster, the main secularist CHP opposition saw its share of the vote slip to 25.4%, some 134 seats, while support for the nationalist MHP party fell sharply to 12% or about 40 seats, compared to 80 in June\u2019s election. Angus Nicholson of IG argues that today\u2019s Caixin PMI manufacturing report is encouraging for China, even though it showed that activity contracted in October. [It is] noticeably above expectations for 47.6 at 48.3, its highest since the stock market collapsed in June. Caixin is usually more associated with smaller private sector firms, so to see such a big jump from the multi-year low the previous month is certainly a positive. But Asia\u2019s main stock markets have still fallen today: China\u2019s factory decline helps to explain why Beijing lowered interest rates last month. So say analyst at ING, who believe further cuts will be needed: \u201cThe data reinforce our view that the last PBOC interest rate cut (announced on Oct 23) was to preempt weak October activity data. \u201cIn addition to setting global investor sentiment to risk-off, we think they will raise the consensus forecast for PBOC rate cuts.\u201d (via Reuters) European markets are expected to fall this morning, as investors digest the news that China\u2019s factory sector shrank again in October. China has got PMI Day up and running, by reporting that activity across its factory sector shrank again last month. But this year\u2019s slump might soon be over. The Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index(PMI) edged up to 48.3 in October from 47.2 in September. This is the 8th month running that the PMI has been below 50 - which is the cut-off point between expansion and contraction. And the report shows that conditions in the Chinese factory sector were tough. Total new business fell again, pushing down total output and employment levels. But there is a glimmer of hope -- export orders rose last month. Here\u2019s the key points: Production falls at the weakest rate in four months \uf06e Total new work contracts at slower pace amid improvement in new export order intakes Input costs and output prices continue to decline at marked rates Dr. He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group, argues that the sector may be benefitting from recent stimulus measures from Beijing: The slight upswing shows the manufacturing industry\u2019s overall weakening has slowed down, indicating that previous stimulating measures have begun to take effect. Weak aggregate demand remained the biggest obstacle to economic growth, and the risk of deflation resulting from the continued fall in the prices of bulk commodities needs attention. This is the second survey of Chinese manufacturing. On Sunday, the official PMI came in at 49.8, matching September\u2019s reading. Better than Caixin, but still a worry: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new month, which means a new set of data showing the health of world\u2019s factory sectors. A rash of \u201cPMI\u201d reports are due today from the eurozone, the UK and America, which will show whether the recent manufacturing slowdown continued in October. These Purchasing Managers Indices show whether activity, output and experts speeded up or slowed down last month, and whether firms took on or laid off staff. Spain: 8.15am Italy: 8.45m France: 8.50am Germany: 8.55am The Eurozone: 9am UK: 9.30am GMT US: 2.30pm GMT. A poor set of figures may add weight to fears that the global economy is ending the year in poor shape. CMC Markets Michael Hewson has rounded up the expectations: Expectations are for Italy and France manufacturing to improve to 53 and 50.7 respectively, while German manufacturing PMI is set to slip back to 51.6. Also coming up today.... investors will be chewing through financial results from banking giant HSBC and budget airline Ryanair. We\u2019ll also be watching the financial reaction to last night\u2019s Turkish election (won by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan), and the stress tests which show Greek banks must raise \u20ac14.4bn in new capital by Friday.",

However, we are more hopeful for the service sector while construction spending grew 0.6% month-on-month.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest care home operator will run out of cash next year unless it undergoes a radical restructuring of its finances, a leading credit ratings agency has said. Four Seasons Health Care operates 470 homes and has more than 20,000 beds. The warning about its future from Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s underlines the growing pressure on Britain\u2019s beleaguered care home industry. Industry experts said at the weekend that half of the country\u2019s care homes were at risk of closure as the sector faced a bigger crisis than the steel industry. S&amp;P said Elli Investments, the parent company of Four Seasons, faced a cash crunch in the next six months. In the absence of additional funding, it said \u201cthe group\u2019s currently available liquidity will likely be consumed by the first semester of 2016 from annual cash interest and rent obligations totalling around \u00a3110m, as well as capital expenditure in relation to the group\u2019s ongoing [reorganisation] and refurbishments across its homes,\u201d it said. Elli Investments is owned by Terra Firma, private equity company run by two of Britain\u2019s best known businessmen. It was founded by the tax exile Guy Hands, who is still chairman, and Justin King, the former Sainsbury\u2019s boss is vice-chairman. King joined Terra Firma last month and oversees the day-to-day operations of the firm\u2019s businesses, which also include the Odeon cinema chain. Terra Firma used Elli Investments as a vehicle to buy Four Seasons for \u00a3825m in 2012, but care homes are being squeezed by a decline in the fees that local authorities pay for places and a rise in staffing costs, which will increase further with the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d next April. Four Seasons said it had enough financial flexibility for the medium term and that residents\u2019 care would not be affected. It said it would pay a \u00a326m interest bill due in December and had appointed advisers to review its finances before a potential restructuring. The company is struggling under the weight of \u00a3500m of debt with an annual interest bill of \u00a350m. Four Seasons operates across three brands. Four Seasons itself has 350 care homes, brighterkind has 80 focussed primarily on private customers, and the Huntercombe Group runs 40 hospitals and specialist centres focussed on mental health. S&amp;P said Four Seasons\u2019 capital structure was unsustainable in the short term and that it would have less than \u00a320m in cash left by the end of the year. It said that fees from local authorities would remain constrained in 2016 because of the government\u2019s austerity programme, and that the national living wage and a shortage of nurses would hurt the company further. The Resolution Foundation has said the introduction of the national living wage will cost the social care industry \u00a31bn between now and 2020. The living standards thinktank has urged the Treasury to cover the cost by using the comprehensive spending review this month to increase the amount local authorities pay care homes. S&amp;P said Four Seasons was likely to try to raise funds by selling care homes, hitting its profits further. \u201cWe believe the company will focus on repositioning services and disposing of underperforming sites to stabilise profitability over the medium term,\u201d the agency said. \u201cHowever, as a result, short-term profitability will likely be impacted by a temporary loss of occupancy and the additional costs associated with the group\u2019s segmentation plan.\u201d Four Seasons hit back at the ratings agency. It said: \u201cWe are confident we have financial flexibility well beyond S&amp;P\u2019s projections. We said in August that the group has sufficient medium-term financial flexibility and that remains our position. We also announced in October the appointment of advisers to help us improve that flexibility. \u201cS&amp;P acknowledged they are not able to consider the ongoing programme of disposals of selected homes that are no longer core to the business, which will generate additional cash. Also they have not factored into their projections our flexibility in respect of capital expenditure. Both of these considerations will improve our liquidity position. \u201cAdditionally, we are confident that the benefits of the operational improvements we have put in place will flow through to financial improvements. We cannot envisage any scenario that would have any effect on the quality of care for residents in our homes or patients in our specialist care units.\u201d Care England, the sector\u2019s umbrella organisation, said new proposals from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to increase the fees that care homes pay the regulator would place further strain on the industry. Martin Green, Care England\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAt a time when the care sector is facing enormous financial challenges resulting from years of underfunding and increases in staff costs following the implementation of the new living wage, it is totally unacceptable for the regulator to levy higher charges for regulation. \u201cAs a regulator with market oversight responsibilities, the Care Quality Commission should understand that this sector is nearing collapse because of local authorities\u2019 refusal to pay the true cost of care, and there is no justification for the CQC to add to the financial burdens of the sector.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Ryanair boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, has pledged to back David Cameron\u2019s campaign to keep Britain in a reformed Europe, saying it made the UK better off, as the Irish airline announced soaring half-yearly profits of more than \u20ac1bn. The airline, Europe\u2019s biggest by passenger numbers, increased its pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of September by 37% to \u20ac1.09bn (\u00a3780m) after a bumper summer. O\u2019Leary said a strong pound and bad weather in northern Europe had encouraged more people to fly to warmer climes, with a 13% jump in passengers filling Ryanair\u2019s planes. Cheaper fuel cut the airline\u2019s costs by 6% from a year ago. O\u2019Leary said Ryanair would continue to expand in Europe and that his airline would be urging British voters to stay in the EU. \u201cWe will be very actively supporting a yes vote in the referendum. There is absolutely no doubt that the UK economy is better off in Europe than outside,\u201d he said. The prime minister has promised a referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership by the end of 2017, and is attempting to persuade other states to renegotiate terms. O\u2019Leary said: \u201cWe need a reformed Europe with some sensible voices around the table or we are all at the mercy of the French and the Germans. The UK is a very sensible and effective counterbalance to the regulation that comes out of Brussels. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a lot less regulation and a lot more freedom of movement of goods, capital and labour. We should be free to create more jobs and not have artificial restrictions.\u201d The airline has had frequent run-ins over the employment status of crew in bases around Europe, and O\u2019Leary has called for a ban on strikes by air traffic controllers. While Ryanair has improved its image with customers, its hardline approach to trade unions and workers\u2019 rights has persisted. It closed its Danish bases after a bruising row with unions and Copenhagen\u2019s mayor accused it of \u201csocial dumping\u201d because of low wages. However, O\u2019Leary said Ryanair was \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d in Copenhagen, doubling the number of flights and customers served. He said: \u201cApparently industrial relations terrorism is now legal in Denmark. So we\u2019ve shipped our aircraft out of Denmark and we fly in from London, Dublin and Kaunas \u2026 but they can\u2019t blockade us because we don\u2019t employ people there.\u201d He said long-haul Ryanair flights were now \u201coff the table, off the radar\u201d. However, he confirmed that the airline had held talks to provide short-haul connections into other airlines\u2019 long-haul services \u2013 including Aer Lingus in Dublin, TAP in Lisbon, and Norwegian and Virgin at Gatwick. \u201cIt will be a small part of our business but it\u2019s an inevitable development,\u201d he said. But he ruled out codesharing \u2013 where airlines can market each other\u2019s flights \u2013 saying Ryanair had told the full-service carriers: \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of that cumbersome, complicated crap. You look after the passenger, it\u2019s your responsibility \u2026 Life is too short for the complexities.\u201d Ryanair has partially transformed its uncompromising image by scrapping some charges and restrictions, improving customer service and revamping the company website. O\u2019Leary said the next venture would be to host price comparisons on his website to \u201cdrive Skyscanner out of business\u201d. He said he was attempting to persuade other airlines \u2013 notably easyJet \u2013 to sign up, without success: \u201cI\u2019m full, I don\u2019t need your passengers. We would spill to each other, to more expensive airlines. But it makes no sense for us, because of our refusal to work together, to create a business for SkyScanner or the pirates of eNightmares [eDreams].\u201d Ryanair expects to fly 105 million passengers this year, rising to 180 million by 2024 \u2013 20 million more than previously forecast. O\u2019Leary said hedging activity would also bring fuel savings of \u20ac430m by 2017. \u201cMost airlines in Europe next year are going to look like management geniuses. You\u2019ve only lowered your costs because your fuel bills fell,\u201d he said. Ryanair is pushing into Germany and O\u2019Leary said he expected Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, to cut prices. \u201cIf anyone wants to have a price war in our markets, just let us know. We will be happy to meet you,\u201d he said.",

O\u2019Leary said: \u201cWe need a reformed Europe with some sensible voices around the table or we are all at the mercy of the French and the Germans. The UK is a very sensible and effective counterbalance to the regulation that comes out of Brussels. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see a lot less regulation and a lot more freedom of movement of goods, capital and labour.

While Ryanair has improved its image with customers, its hardline approach to trade unions and workers\u2019 rights has persisted. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/17/ryanair-closes-denmark-operation-temporarily-to-sidestep-union-dispute\">It closed its Danish bases</a> after a bruising row with unions and Copenhagen\u2019s mayor accused it of \u201csocial dumping\u201d because of low wages. <br></p> <p>However, O\u2019Leary said Ryanair was \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d in Copenhagen, doubling the number of flights and customers served. He said: \u201cApparently industrial relations terrorism is now legal in Denmark. So we\u2019ve shipped our aircraft out of Denmark and we fly in from London, Dublin and Kaunas \u2026 but they can\u2019t blockade us because we don\u2019t employ people there.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/16/ryanair-plans-to-offer-flights-between-europe-and-america\">long-haul Ryanair flights</a> were now \u201coff the table, off the radar\u201d. However, he confirmed that the airline had held talks to provide short-haul connections into other airlines\u2019 long-haul services \u2013 including Aer Lingus in Dublin, TAP in Lisbon, and Norwegian and Virgin at Gatwick. \u201cIt will be a small part of our business but it\u2019s an inevitable development,\u201d he said. </p> <p>But he ruled out codesharing \u2013 where airlines can market each other\u2019s flights \u2013 saying Ryanair had told the full-service carriers: \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of that cumbersome, complicated crap.

O\u2019Leary said the next venture would be to host price comparisons on his website to \u201cdrive Skyscanner out of business\u201d. He said he was attempting to persuade other airlines \u2013 notably easyJet \u2013 to sign up, without success: \u201cI\u2019m full, I don\u2019t need your passengers. We would spill to each other, to more expensive airlines. But it makes no sense for us, because of our refusal to work together, to create a business for SkyScanner or the pirates of eNightmares [eDreams].\u201d<br></p> <p>Ryanair expects to fly 105 million passengers this year, rising to 180 million by 2024 \u2013 20 million more than previously forecast. O\u2019Leary said hedging activity would also bring fuel savings of \u20ac430m by 2017. \u201cMost airlines in Europe next year are going to look like management geniuses. You\u2019ve only lowered your costs because your fuel bills fell,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>Ryanair is pushing into Germany and O\u2019Leary said he expected Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, to cut prices. \u201cIf anyone wants to have a price war in our markets, just let us know.

      "bodyText": "HSBC has warned it may delay until next a year its decision on whether to remain based in London, as it reported higher profits because of a fall in fines and legal costs. Britain\u2019s biggest bank caused a political storm in April when it announced it was considering whether to keep its headquarters in London, where it moved in 1992 from Hong Kong to facilitate the takeover of Midland bank. Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive, later said the decision would be known by the end of 2015. But, as the bank announced results for the first nine months of the year, it said a decision might take longer. \u201cAn announcement will be made when the board makes its final decision and, if necessary, a further update will be provided at the time of the full year results,\u201d the bank said. Douglas Flint, the HSBC chairman, said the board had requested additional information as part of the review. He said the decision would be based \u201con long-term perspectives rather than short-term factors\u201d. \u201cWe take it very seriously and give it the appropriate amount of work,\u201d said Flint, who was speaking from China, where the bank had just sealed a deal to create a securities trading venture in Shenzhen. The bank has been linked with a series of alternative locations in addition to Hong Kong, including the US and Canada. Since HSBC announced its review, the British government has made changes to the taxation of banks that are regarded as preferable to HSBC. It has also clarified parts of the regulatory regime that had been concerning the bank. Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said: \u201cWe think that HSBC should move ahead with a re-domicile out of the UK as soon as possible.\u201d Despite the reduction in the bank levy announced by George Osborne in July, Gordon said HSBC was still expecting to pay $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) towards the levy, which is based on the size of bank balance sheets in 2017. The bank incurred $28m of costs in the third quarter to work on ringfencing retail customers in the UK from its investment banking arm, to comply with the rules drawn up by Sir John Vickers. HSBC has stepped back from reintroducing the Midland name on the high street as part of this exercise. Nine-month profits were up 16% to $19.7bn; in the third quarter, profits were 32% higher at $6.1bn, largely as a result of a $1.4bn drop in fines and customer compensation. A year ago, HSBC was among the banks bracing for fines for rigging currency markets and facing payouts to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. In the third quarter, the bank added \u00a343m to its PPI provision, which has reached \u00a32.7bn. Stripping out one-off items and currency changes, profits were down for both periods. Revenue fell by 4% in the three-month period. The bank cited the stock market turmoil in China and other parts of Asia, as well as a reduction in revenue from overdraft fees in the UK, which had fallen by $133m. Flint was asked about calls from investors to change the management and said the board backed Gulliver and his team. \u201cManagement has good traction on delivering against the plan that has been set out, so I don\u2019t know why anybody would want to change horses mid-course of a strategy that was well received and which is being delivered against,\u201d he said. In June, in a strategic plan intended to boost the bank\u2019s returns to shareholders, Gulliver outlined plans to cut 25,000 jobs around the world, including up to 8,000 in the UK. Another 25,000 roles would be removed through the sale of operations in Turkey and Brazil. The latest update shows that the number of staff rose by 2,231 from the end of last year to 259,834 at the end of September, as more compliance and legal experts were hired. The bank is attempting to rectify past bad behaviour, which includes breaching money laundering rules in the US \u2013 for which it was fined \u00a31.2bn in 2012 \u2013 and the tax avoidance activities in its Swiss arm revealed by the Guardian and other publications. Gulliver has said he is \u201cpivoting\u201d the business to Asia, where HSBC has traditionally been based.",

      "bodyText": "HSBC and First Direct customers saved $135m (\u00a385m) in overdraft charges after the bank started sending text messages to warn them they were about to go into the red. Britain\u2019s biggest bank, HSBC, started sending texts to its customers a year ago, alerting them when they risked incurring charges for unauthorised overdrafts. In the first month, it sent 1.2m texts and by September this year the number had risen to 1.5m. The bank found that 72% of First Direct customers sent the alerts were able to avoid fees as were 50% of those of its high street network HSBC. The reduction in income from overdraft fees is mentioned as one of the causes for the bank\u2019s fall in revenue in the first nine months of the year. The bank charges \u00a35 a day for customers with unauthorised overdrafts and caps the monthly fee at \u00a380.

Other banks also send text messages to warn customers who are at risk of incurring fees although it is not clear what impact this is having on their revenues. The subject is topical as overdraft charges are often said to be the reason banks are able to offer free banking to customers who remain in credit, a topic investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority in its investigation into current accounts and small business banking. Publishing its preliminary findings last month, the CMA stepped back from draconian measures to rule that free banking should end or that banks should be broken up to encourage competition. But among the CMA\u2019s recommendations was that customers should be sent text messages to warn them if they were going overdrawn and prompt them to look for better offers. The CMA cited data from the Financial Conduct Authority which found that signing up to text alerts and mobile banking reduced the amount of unarranged overdraft charges incurred by customers by 24%. It also said that if customers switched to the cheapest current account, average customers would save \u00a370 a year, overdraft users would save on average \u00a3140 a year and heavy overdraft users would save on average \u00a3260 a year.",

No cyclical boom and bust, just onwards and upwards. The observation was made by the analytical arm of the credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s and explains why, along with the limited capacity for private housebuilding, an investment in housing will remain the preferred option of every UK household. The starting point is the forecast from the Office for National Statistics that predicted a 4.4 million rise in the UK\u2019s population in the next decade from last year\u2019s 64.6 million, eventually reaching 70 million in 2027. Moody\u2019s Investors Service is interested in the subject from the narrow view of clients that buy and sell mortgage-backed securities.

As we can see from Moody\u2019s graphs, Britain and the Netherlands have all the right ingredients, unlike Spain and Ireland. Low unemployment provides the security investors need of a low default rate by mortgage borrowers. A high and growing number of 25- to 35-year-olds provides the army of first-time buyers that fuels property sales. And a rising general population makes for property as a secure investment. Spain and Ireland, in particular, have seen a huge outflow of young adults seeking work and that trend is expected to continue. Even though the young people who remain are likely to encounter healthy wage rises in tighter labour markets, giving them bigger spending power, this trend is unlikely to compensate for the lack of people seeking to get on the property ladder, Moody\u2019s says. So the young might find it easier to get a job in the UK and the Netherlands relative to other EU countries, but they will never be able to afford a home in the areas where wages are halfway decent because house prices will always accelerate at a faster pace.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook has prioritised cost cuts over customers and still needs to address safety issues nine years after two children died from carbon monoxide poisoning at a hotel booked through the travel company, according to a report. Bobby and Christi Shepherd, aged six and seven, died in 2006 as a result of a faulty boiler at a bungalow attached to the Louis Corcyra Beach hotel on Corfu. Thomas Cook was slow to respond to their deaths and was insensitive in its dealings with their parents, Justin King, the former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, said in his report commissioned by Thomas Cook and published on Monday. Financial considerations have been more important to the company than treating customers well, including ensuring their safety, King said. King said he had not found specific examples of cost concerns overriding safety but he painted a picture of a company that put its own interests ahead of customers after coming close to collapse in 2012, and that failed to learn the lessons of Bobby and Christi\u2019s deaths. Presenting his report, King said: \u201cThis is a business that has been through tremendous financial pressures and an almost existential threat a couple of years ago and has sought to achieve a balance that has put the existence of the business ... ahead of doing the right thing for customers. The financial parts of the business have been the powerhouse and the customer voice has not been strong enough.\u201d The report said Thomas Cook must spend much more on health and safety to improve training for staff and fund more checking at resorts. King\u2019s other recommendations include: Launching an improved whistleblower hotline so that staff at resorts can report problems, anonymously if they wish Providing customers with information and advice about carbon monoxide risks Selling customers low-cost carbon monoxide monitors for use on holiday Spending on systems so that customer complaints are used as an early warning about problems at a resort Advice for customers on general risks while on holiday, such as pool safety, and risks specific to a country Rewarding staff for solving customers\u2019 problems instead of fending off complaints Thomas Cook said parts of King\u2019s report were uncomfortable reading and it would act on his recommendations. It is holding a carbon monoxide conference on 16 November and has donated \u00a31m to set up a safer tourism foundation. In May, an inquest reached a verdict of unlawful killing into Bobby and Christi\u2019s deaths and said Thomas Cook had breached its duty of care. The jury decided that the hotel misled Thomas Cook about its gas supply and that the holiday firm\u2019s health and safety audit of the complex was inadequate. King criticised Thomas Cook for its abrupt and late replies to contact from Sharon Wood and Neil Shepherd, Bobby and Christi\u2019s parents and for ignoring Shepherd\u2019s attempt to arrange a meeting in 2013. When the company contacted the family, its approaches were \u201cintermittent, sometimes ill-timed and often ill-judged\u201d, King said. \u201cHaving been an observer of the particular process around the coroner\u2019s inquest, I was staggered by the position at that time that the company was seeking to defend itself in a very legalistic way,\u201d King said. Thomas Cook failed to balance legal considerations with the need to behave in a humane way towards a grieving family, he said. He praised the \u201cextraordinary\u201d campaign by Shepherd and Wood and said the section of his report on their treatment by Thomas Cook would be the most shocking to readers. Wood and Shepherd said: \u201cWe welcome Justin King\u2019s report and Thomas Cook\u2019s new proactive approach in addressing the mistakes they made that led to the deaths of Christi and Bobby. It is a move in the right direction and the next step in what has been a long, hard fight for justice. \u201cOur hope is that we can bring about change that will dramatically reduce the number of deaths and injuries from carbon monoxide, both in the UK and abroad. We feel optimistic for the future but continue to call for all tour operators to put the health and wellbeing of their customers at the heart of their industry.\u201d Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, met Shepherd and Wood in May after taking personal responsibility for the handling of the children\u2019s deaths. He did so after it emerged Thomas Cook was paid \u00a31.5m in compensation by the Corfu hotel. It donated the money to Unicef, the children\u2019s charity, after the payment was revealed. King interviewed current and past employees of Thomas Cook, including Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who ran the company when the children died, and Harriet Green, chief executive from July 2012 until Fankhauser took over last November. Green agreed in May to donate a third of a \u00a310.5m share payout to charity following the inquest verdict. The travel company has increased its health and safety efforts in the past two years but \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d remain, King said. Customers can be made safer by giving health, safety and risk operations more money and clout, he added. The health and safety department has improved but is very stretched, and other parts of the business do not take enough responsibility, the report says. Thomas Cook has only kept pace with progress elsewhere in the travel industry, which is behind the times in its treatment of customers, King said. Thomas Cook said immediate actions would include more staff on location to solve problems, more spending on better audits at popular resorts, and customer satisfaction as part of senior managers\u2019 bonus reviews. Fankhauser said: \u201cIt took us nine years to correct the mistakes of the past and to do what everyone would have expected of us. My priority is to drive this reorganisation as quickly and effectively as possible. It costs what it costs.\u201d",

Thomas Cook failed to balance legal considerations with the need to behave in a humane way towards a grieving family, he said. </p> <p>He praised the \u201cextraordinary\u201d campaign by Shepherd and Wood and said the section of his report on their treatment by Thomas Cook would be the most shocking to readers.</p> <p>Wood and Shepherd said: \u201cWe welcome Justin King\u2019s report and Thomas Cook\u2019s new proactive approach in addressing the mistakes they made that led to the deaths of Christi and Bobby. It is a move in the right direction and the next step in what has been a long, hard fight for justice.</p> <p>\u201cOur hope is that we can bring about change that will dramatically reduce the number of deaths and injuries from carbon monoxide, both in the UK and abroad. We feel optimistic for the future but continue to call for all tour operators to put the health and wellbeing of their customers at the heart of their industry.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/thomas-cook-says-sorry-over-handling-of-chidrens-deaths-compensation-case\">met Shepherd and Wood </a> in May after taking personal responsibility for the handling of the children\u2019s deaths. He did so after it emerged Thomas Cook was paid \u00a31.5m in compensation by the Corfu hotel. It donated the money to Unicef, the children\u2019s charity, after the payment was revealed.<br></p> <p>King interviewed current and past employees of Thomas Cook, including Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who ran the company when the children died, and Harriet Green, chief executive from July 2012 until Fankhauser took over last November. Green agreed in May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/27/harriet-green-to-give-away-third-of-10m-payout-after-corfu-child-deaths-outcry\">to donate a third of a \u00a310.5m share payout to charity</a> following the inquest verdict.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/05/coroner-hotel-carbon-monoxide-deaths\">Coroner calls for action over hotel carbon monoxide deaths</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The travel company has increased its health and safety efforts in the past two years but \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d remain, King said. Customers can be made safer by giving health, safety and risk operations more money and clout, he added.<br></p> <p>The health and safety department has improved but is very stretched, and other parts of the business do not take enough responsibility, the report says. Thomas Cook has only kept pace with progress elsewhere in the travel industry, which is behind the times in its treatment of customers, King said.<br></p> <p>Thomas Cook said immediate actions would include more staff on location to solve problems, more spending on better audits at popular resorts, and customer satisfaction as part of senior managers\u2019 bonus reviews.<br></p> <p>Fankhauser said: \u201cIt took us nine years to correct the mistakes of the past and to do what everyone would have expected of us. My priority is to drive this reorganisation as quickly and effectively as possible. It costs what it costs.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers enjoyed a recovery in output and new orders last month, according to a survey that will raise hopes the sector is finally shrugging off its recession. Manufacturers notched up the fastest growth in production for 16 months, according to the latest Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI. The report defied economists\u2019 expectations for a fall and instead jumped to 55.5 in October from an upwardly revised 51.8 in September. The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists was for a 51.3 reading \u2013 barely above 50, the mark that separates growth from contraction. The survey follows official data last week showing overall UK economic growth slowed in the third quarter as the manufacturing sector continued to contract. Other reports have pointed to pressures on British factories from sluggish global demand and a relatively strong pound, which makes UK goods more expensive for overseas buyers. Contrasting with those signals, the PMI report showed export and domestic orders picking up across all parts of the industry. Companies saw improved demand from clients in the Middle East, east Asia and the US, according to the poll of more than 600 purchasing managers. Manufacturing employment rose for the 30th successive month. Rob Dobson, a senior economist at Markit, the survey compilers, said: \u201cThe start of the final quarter saw UK manufacturing spring back into life and record its best month of factory output growth since June 2014. The revival provides a tentative suggestion that the manufacturers are pulling out of their recent funk, having been dogged by recession since the start of the year, and may help boost economic growth in the fourth quarter. \u201cBased on historical comparisons, the survey is consistent with a quarterly rate of growth of about 1%, a vast improvement on what we have seen in recent months. The big question now is whether this bounceback is a one-off or the start of a sustained re-emergence from recession.\u201d With headwinds from China\u2019s downturn and wider global struggles, other economists cast doubt on whether the sector can keep up the pace of growth suggested by the PMI report. Other surveys pointed to continued recession, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cFor now, the PMI is a striking outlier,\u201d he said. \u201cWe doubt that exports will see sustained growth, given that they are uncompetitive at the current exchange rate. And domestic demand growth is likely to weaken too as consumers\u2019 real income growth slows as inflation rebounds and job gains slow. So to us, this doesn\u2019t look like the start of a manufacturing resurgence.\u201d Manufacturing accounts for about 10% of the UK economy, which means forecasters will want to see the PMI report on the bigger UK services sector published on Wednesday to get a clearer idea of whether GDP growth will rebound in the final quarter of 2015. But signs of a manufacturing recovery could help sway more Bank of England policymakers to vote for an interest rate rise in the coming months, economists said. Only one member of the nine- member monetary policy committee, Ian McCafferty, has voted for an increase in recent months. Against the backdrop of softer global and domestic growth, no forecasters expect the Bank to raise rates when it meets this week. However, minutes from the meeting could show the committee becoming more divided over when to start increasing it after more than six years of record low rates. Commenting on the stronger PMI report, James Knightley from ING Capital Markets said: \u201cThis bodes well for output and employment in the sector and suggests that fourth quarter GDP growth should improve ... It also backs up recent positive comments from Bank of England officials and suggests at the very least one further MPC member \u2013 most likely Martin Weale \u2013 will join Ian McCafferty in voting for an interest rate rise on Thursday.\u201d",

Bad weather in northern Europe and the strong pound encouraged people to fly to warmer climes, the company said.</p> <p>Fuller planes mean Ryanair will fly 1 million more passengers than it had expected in the year to the end of March. As a result, annual profit is likely to be towards the upper end of the \u20ac1.175bn to \u20ac1.225bn range it announced in September.<br></p> <p>O\u2019Leary, who used to revel in Ryanair\u2019s cheap and nasty image, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/30/ryanair-being-nice-fewer-rules-less-hassle-more-profit\">has tried to transform the airline\u2019s image</a> by scrapping irksome charges and restrictions, revamping the company\u2019s website and improving customer service. </p> <p>The change in approach <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/ryanair-profits-warning-lower-fares\">followed two profit warnings</a> in late 2013 that showed Ryanair failing to keep up with its rivals, including easyJet, whose friendlier image had attracted flyers.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019d only learned in college that being nice was good for business I\u2019d have done it years ago,\u201d O\u2019Leary told Bloomberg TV. \u201cAs long as it boosts profitability I don\u2019t think there is any limit to my niceness.\u201d</p> <p>The Irish airline\u2019s largest base is at London Stansted airport, where it flies more than 18 million passengers a year.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary said Ryanair wanted Britain to remain in the European Union when the country holds a referendum planned for 2017 at the latest.</p> <p>\u201cThe referendum is going to be very important for Ryanair as a business and Ireland generally.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, claims being pleasant to customers has paid off as the budget airline reported first-half profits up by more than a third. Europe\u2019s biggest airline by passenger numbers said pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of September rose 37% to \u20ac1.09bn (\u00a3780m) after a bumper summer. Bad weather in northern Europe and the strong pound encouraged people to fly to warmer climes, the company said. Fuller planes mean Ryanair will fly 1 million more passengers than it had expected in the year to the end of March. As a result, annual profit is likely to be towards the upper end of the \u20ac1.175bn to \u20ac1.225bn range it announced in September. O\u2019Leary, who used to revel in Ryanair\u2019s cheap and nasty image, has tried to transform the airline\u2019s image by scrapping irksome charges and restrictions, revamping the company\u2019s website and improving customer service. The change in approach followed two profit warnings in late 2013 that showed Ryanair failing to keep up with its rivals, including easyJet, whose friendlier image had attracted flyers. \u201cIf I\u2019d only learned in college that being nice was good for business I\u2019d have done it years ago,\u201d O\u2019Leary told Bloomberg TV. \u201cAs long as it boosts profitability I don\u2019t think there is any limit to my niceness.\u201d The Irish airline\u2019s largest base is at London Stansted airport, where it flies more than 18 million passengers a year. O\u2019Leary said Ryanair wanted Britain to remain in the European Union when the country holds a referendum planned for 2017 at the latest. \u201cThe referendum is going to be very important for Ryanair as a business and Ireland generally. We very much want the UK to stay [in the EU] \u2026 When push comes to shove, when it comes to the Scottish referendum and in the general election, people will vote in the best interests of the economy and stay in Europe,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. Ryanair expects to fly 105 million passengers this year, up 16% from last year, rising to 180 million by 2024 \u2013 20 million more than previously forecast. Ryanair also benefited from insuring against the cost of fluctuating oil prices. O\u2019Leary said hedging activities would bring fuel savings of \u20ac430m by 2017, buttressing Ryanair for a possible price war after fares weakened in recent weeks. Prices will fall about 4% in the first three months of 2016, he predicted. Ryanair shares fell 1.6% to \u20ac13.28. \u201cIf anyone wants to have a price war in our markets, just let us know. We will be happy to meet you,\u201d he said. Ryanair is pushing into Germany and O\u2019Leary said he expected Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, to cut prices. \u201cIn a price war, everybody focuses on prices. We win,\u201d he said. Ryanair has improved its image with customers but its hardline approach to trade unions and workers\u2019 rights has persisted. Ryanair closed its Danish bases after a bruising row with unions and Copenhagen\u2019s mayor accused it of \u201csocial dumping\u201d because of low wages. Ryanair also called for a ban on strikes by air traffic controllers.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s big four banks face a mounting threat from falling profits and rising costs which could result in reduced dividends and branch closures in coming years, a report has said. After nearly 20 years of stellar growth on the back of the mining and housing booms, the banks must tackle the challenges or see their grip on lending and financial services loosened by upstart disruptive competitors, the consultancy KPMG warned in the report. On Monday Westpac became the latest of the big four banks to report higher profits, Australia\u2019s second largest lender lifting its full-year cash profit 3% to $7.82bn on the back of increased home loans. NAB and ANZ reported big profit increases last week. Commonwealth Bank reports its latest figures on Thursday. But Westpac said that a slowdown in mortgage lending would hurt its bottom line, compounding what KPMG noted was a fall in profitability among the big banks thanks to stronger competition. Shares in the big four dragged the share market sharply lower on Monday as investors gave their verdict on the announcements, hinting at what the Australian Financial Review has called the end of a 15-year \u201cgolden era\u201d for the banks. The benchmark ASX/S&amp;P200 share index closed down 1.4% at 5,166 points on Monday. KPMG Australia\u2019s report, titled Major Australian Banks Full Year Results 2014-15, said the majors delivered combined cash earnings of $30.0bn, up 5.4% from last year. But their return on equity \u2013 a key measure of shareholder value \u2013 was down from 15.5% to 15% from the previous year. This downward trend was \u201clikely to continue\u201d as banks were forced to hold more capital, the report said. Net interest margins \u2013 or the amount of money it makes on lending \u2013 also fell to a record low 2.02%, down from 2.07% last year. \u201cRevenue and margin headwinds, rising costs and capital levels, with a deteriorating credit quality outlook all mean the majors will face challenges in reversing declining returns in the years ahead,\u201d said Andrew Dickinson, Asia Pacific head of banking for KPMG. \u201cRecent increases in home lending rates have shown that the banks do have some market power to improve margins. But careful balancing of shareholder and customer interests will be required in future to ensure disruptors are not further emboldened to attack established lenders\u2019 business models,\u201d he said. Banks needed to \u201cfundamentally change their operating models\u201d to enable them to improve customer service and reduce costs in future. This would mean boosting online services at the cost of branches. \u201cAt the core of this will be the digital enablement of distribution channels, particularly branches which represent such a significant portion of the banks\u2019 overall cost base,\u201d said Ian Pollari, head of bankingfor KPMG Australia. \u201cIn addition, banks need to continue redesigning middle and back office processes and increase the use of outsourcing.\u201d Balancing the challenges of increased competition from disruptors, increasing bad debts, and a need to generate returns on ever more shareholder capital would provide a serious problem for bank boards and management, the report said. \u201cReal courage will need to be shown by bank management over the next few years, and if banks push too hard on maintaining short-term return to shareholders, they risk significantly damaging their long-term franchise value and reputations,\u201d said Mr Dickinson. \u201cLonger term, we see customer behaviour and competitive dynamics continuing to rapidly evolve, driven by demographic changes, the digital revolution and the rise of fintech competition, presenting both threats and opportunities for the major banks.\u201d \u201cIn order to enhance their level of agility, the majors will need to intensify their efforts to simplify, standardise and automate their operating models, as well as preserve optionality in their strategies in order to capitalise on opportunities as they arise,\u201d he concluded.",

      "bodyText": "Fresh signs the UK economy is losing steam amid a global slowdown will force the Bank of England to keep interest rates at their record low this week. Policymakers, however, will likely warn households to prepare for higher borrowing costs next year. Only one of the nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), Ian McCafferty, is expected to vote for rates to be increase from 0.5%, where they have been since the depths of the financial crisis more than six years ago. Investors and mortgage holders will be hoping the Bank uses its latest economic forecasts, which is published alongside the rates decision, to give clearer clues on the outlook for borrowing costs. Financial markets are pricing in a rate rise in late 2016 but some economists see the Bank moving much sooner, possibly in February. There will be plenty to chew over as the Bank simultaneously releases its inflation report, interest rate decision and the minutes of that policy meeting followed by a press conference with its governor, Mark Carney. It is only the second such deluge from the Bank, dubbed \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d in the City and marks a move away from the previous trickle of information favoured by Threadneedle Street. But with the committee of rate-setters seemingly divided over when is the right time to finally start raising interest rates, economists warn not to expect a clear steer this week. \u201c5 November is highly unlikely to see any fireworks from the Bank of England,\u201d said Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight. \u201cThe current wide range of differing views within the MPC highlights just how uncertain the outlook for UK interest rates is \u2013 although it still seems to be a question of when will the Bank of England start to raise interest rates rather than will they?\u201d The backdrop to the latest report is one of waning global growth and turmoil in emerging markets such as China that have rattled business and consumer confidence in the UK. Official figures last week showed Britain\u2019s economic growth dipped in the third quarter. \u201cA slowdown in growth offers even more cause for the UK\u2019s monetary policymakers to sit on their hands,\u201d said Martin Beck at the consultancy Oxford Economics. \u201cThe latest developments in the economy offer more support for the view that borrowing costs will see no rise until well into 2016.\u201d The majority of economists in a Reuters poll forecast only McCafferty will vote for a rise this month, having done so for the previous three months. But some experts see one or two other MPC members joining him soon, perhaps even this week. Kristin Forbes recently said a rate rise will come \u201csooner rather than later\u201d and pessimism about the state of the global economy was overdone. Martin Weale, who voted for increases last year, might also resume that stance soon, said Simon Wells chief UK economist at HSBC. But Andy Haldane and newcomer Jan Vlieghe \u201cappear to be firmly in the \u2018dovish\u2019 camp\u201d, Wells said, adding: \u201cThe inflation report is therefore very likely to keep all options open and make no commitments on policy,.\u201d A clutch of reports on Monday highlight an uncertain outlook for UK businesses. Among them, a poll of small- and medium-sized (SME) manufacturers shows their output fell in the three months to October, as both domestic and export orders dropped. It was the sharpest decline in output for more than two years, according to the survey of 434 smaller firms by business group CBI. There was also a drop in business optimism and in confidence over export prospects. Drop in confidence A separate report puts UK business confidence at a two-year low amid flagging economic growth. The gloomier mood has knocked companies\u2019 capital investment and is likely to continue to weigh on spending over the coming year, according to a survey of 1,000 chartered accountants by their professional body, the ICAEW. \u201cAfter a post-election bounce, confidence has fallen further. The political honeymoon is over and George Osborne will need to remember this when delivering his autumn statement later this month,\u201d said Stephen Ibbotson, ICAEW director of business. \u201cAlthough business confidence remains in positive territory, a number of factors cannot be ignored. Business investment is muted, skills shortages are becoming more of a challenge and staff and salary increases for 2016 are lower than for the last 12 months and the outlook for exports remains poor.\u201d Such concerns about skills shortages are echoed in a separate report on Monday that suggests competition for jobs has dropped to a post-recession low of 0.58 jobseekers per advertised vacancy. There were more vacancies advertised than jobseekers in 41 out of 56 cities in the UK, according to jobs search engine Adzuna. There were 1,178,129 positions available in September, up 2.4% from August and 30.0% year-on-year \u2013 but many vacancies were left unfulfilled due to lack of skilled labour, Adzuna added.",

Official figures last week showed Britain\u2019s economic growth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/27/uk-gdp-growth-slows-george-osborne\">dipped in the third quarter</a>.</p> <p>\u201cA slowdown in growth offers even more cause for the UK\u2019s monetary policymakers to sit on their hands,\u201d said Martin Beck at the consultancy Oxford Economics. \u201cThe latest developments in the economy offer more support for the view that borrowing costs will see no rise until well into 2016.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of economists in a Reuters poll forecast only McCafferty will vote for a rise this month, having done so for the previous three months. </p> <p>But some experts see one or two other MPC members joining him soon, perhaps even this week. Kristin Forbes recently said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/16/bank-england-policymaker-rate-rise-sooner-kristin-forbes\">a rate rise will come \u201csooner rather than later\u201d</a> and pessimism about the state of the global economy was overdone. </p> <p>Martin Weale, who voted for increases last year, might also resume that stance soon, said Simon Wells chief UK economist at HSBC. </p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/18/interest-rates-rise-bank-of-england-chief-economist-andy-haldane\">Andy Haldane</a> and newcomer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/oct/13/uk-inflation-chinese-imports-slump-markets-live#block-561ce6dae4b0951b0272360f\">Jan Vlieghe</a> \u201cappear to be firmly in the \u2018dovish\u2019 camp\u201d, Wells said, adding: \u201cThe inflation report is therefore very likely to keep all options open and make no commitments on policy,.\u201d</p> <p>A clutch of reports on Monday highlight an uncertain outlook for UK businesses. Among them, a poll of small- and medium-sized (SME) manufacturers shows their output fell in the three months to October, as both domestic and export orders dropped.</p> <p>It was the sharpest decline in output for more than two years, according to the survey of 434 smaller firms by business group CBI. There was also a drop in business optimism and in confidence over export prospects.</p> <h2>Drop in confidence</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f76081e3b480db62788ac314358e0781c032b581\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/30/1446225396155/3845cd0c-f273-43bd-a272-81ccff182615-460x272.png\" alt=\"Confidence index at two-year low\" width=\"460\" height=\"272\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A report from chartered accountants body ICAEW found business confidence had fallen to a two-year low but was still in positive territory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ICAEW</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A separate report puts UK business confidence at a two-year low amid flagging economic growth. The gloomier mood has knocked companies\u2019 capital investment and is likely to continue to weigh on spending over the coming year, according to a survey of 1,000 chartered accountants by their professional body, the ICAEW.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a post-election bounce, confidence has fallen further. The political honeymoon is over and George Osborne will need to remember this when delivering his autumn statement later this month,\u201d said Stephen Ibbotson, ICAEW director of business.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough business confidence remains in positive territory, a number of factors cannot be ignored. Business investment is muted, skills shortages are becoming more of a challenge and staff and salary increases for 2016 are lower than for the last 12 months and the outlook for exports remains poor.\u201d</p> <p>Such concerns about skills shortages are echoed in a separate report on Monday that suggests competition for jobs has dropped to a post-recession low of <strong> </strong>0.58 jobseekers per advertised vacancy. There were more vacancies advertised than jobseekers in 41 out of 56 cities in the UK, according to jobs search engine Adzuna. </p> <p>There were 1,178,129 positions available in September, up 2.4% from August and 30.0% year-on-year \u2013 but many vacancies were left unfulfilled due to lack of skilled labour, Adzuna added.</p>",
