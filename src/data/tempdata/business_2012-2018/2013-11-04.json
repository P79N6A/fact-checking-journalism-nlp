      "bodyText": "They say money can't buy love, but controversial payday lender Wonga is attempting to win the hearts of its critics with a film that promises to tell the \"real stories\" of its hard-pressed borrowers. Twelve Wonga customers are the stars of a 30-minute film commissioned by the firm to counter criticism that it targets the vulnerable with interest rates of up to 5,853%. Billed as a \"modern, authentic and relevant\" portrait of British life, the movie pulls at the heart strings by showing people trying to bounce back from low ebbs, including a woman who borrowed \u00a3200 to pay for flowers at two family funerals in the same week. For Wonga the film marks the start of a PR fightback against what it calls a ceaseless \"misrepresentation\" in newspapers. \"The reason we commissioned that film is that we wanted to redress the debate about Wonga out there,\" said Niall Wass, its chief operating officer, after the film's low-key premiere in London on Monday night. \"What we felt was that the voice of the silent majority was not being heard, but there were perceptions out there that weren't justified.\" The debut of the film \u2013 before an audience of business journalists, film critics and a smattering of Wonga customers \u2013 comes before a grilling by MPs in Westminster on Tuesday as calls grow for tighter curbs on payday lenders. The half-hour movie, named 12 Portraits, marks a surprise departure from routine corporate marketing tactics \u2013 not least because it does not mention Wonga or borrowing until the closing credits. Instead, it tells the \"unscripted\" stories of 12 customers who volunteered to participate in the film earlier this year \u2013 for free. Viewers see Angela, from Dewsbury, who borrowed \u00a3200 to pay for flowers at two family funerals in the same week and repaid under \u00a3235, including interest and fees, two weeks later. Dawn from Doncaster loaned \u00a3180 to hire camera equipment after deciding to switch careers following a breast cancer diagnosis two years ago. She repaid \u00a3208, including interest and fees, the film says. Others did not fall upon such hard times. Blackpool karaoke king Dennis found himself stuck for cash and borrowed \u00a3101 from Wonga to fund his travel costs between gigs. Four days later he repaid \u00a3111. But the film's debut failed to quieten all of the firm's critics. Gary Tarn, its Bafta-winning producer, bristled when asked by one audience member if his work was \"artfully-produced propaganda\". \"If someone called it that I would say I don't see it that way. I don't think I was toeing the party line,\" he said. \"I was given the freedom to go out there and make the film and if that happens to reinforce a position they're happy with, so much the better, but if it didn't happen to have done that, that would be the film it would have been. Sorry if it didn't meet with people's preconceptions, but these were the people I met.\" In a Q&amp;A after the screening, Wass refused to classify the film as advertising or marketing and declined to reveal the cost of marketing the film in cinemas and on Channel 4 later this year. Business minister Jo Swinson responded to the film by saying payday lenders have \"far bigger advertising budgets than debt charities or government money advice could ever hope to have\". She added: \"I've been concerned about vulnerable customers being lured by adverts into taking out payday loans that aren't right for them. While for some people in some circumstances payday loans can be a useful product, there are many others who are already in financial difficulty and need debt advice, rather than more debt.\" Wonga's previous experiments with advertising have failed to do much for its image. Only last month, the advertising watchdog banned a radio skit featuring the rewritten lyrics from the 1950s song Mr Sandman: \"You make it easy when the month feels too long. Thanks for everything you've done. Mr Wonga, you're No 1.\" Its sponsorship of Newcastle United also went awry earlier in the year when Papiss Cisse, the striker, temporarily refused to wear the shirt after complaining that it conflicted with his Muslim beliefs.",

It must pay a&#xa0;$900m fine and forfeit another $900m to the federal government, though $616m that SAC companies have already agreed to pay to settle parallel actions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be deducted from the $1.8bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Most of the money will come from founder&#xa0;Steven A Cohen rather than outside investors. Bharara said the fine would not be tax-deductible.</p> <p>Anyone working at SAC currently will also have to face obstacles to their futures. No one at the firm, even those who co-operated, will have immunity from further prosecution, Bharara said.</p> <p>SAC also agreed to accept a five-year probation period \u2013 in which any employee seeking to start a new investing business would require government permission \u2013 and agreed to shut down its advisory business, which accepts money from outside investors.&#xa0;</p> <p>The agreement still has to be approved by a judge, officials said.&#xa0;</p> <p>The move isolates SAC, which once reigned at the center of the hedge-fund world and whose founder was listed by Forbes as being worth $8.8bn. \"SAC will no longer be able to invest anyone's money but their own,\" said Brooks.</p> <p>Brooks quoted the July indictment, which called the insider trading at SAC \"substantial, pervasive and on a scale without known precedent\", adding that \"it was nothing short of institutional failure\".&#xa0;</p> <p>She also indicated that government regulators, including the Department of Justice, FBI and the SEC, plan to use SAC as a lesson to other fund managers. Brooks said officials will \"relentlessly pursue\" insider traders. \"How your employees make their money is just as important as how much they make,\" she said.&#xa0;</p> <p>In a statement, FBI assistant director George Venizelos said SAC Capital's plea demonstrates \"that cheating and breaking the law were not only permitted but allowed to persist\".</p> <p>In the July indictment, prosecutors said evidence against SAC was \"voluminous\" and included electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings.&#xa0;</p> <p>Prosecutors said a work culture at SAC permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading. Authorities alleged that SAC Capital earned hundreds of millions of dollars illegally from 1999 to 2010 as its portfolio managers and analysts traded on inside information from at least 20 public companies. Bharara in July said SAC Capital \"trafficked in inside information on a scale without any known precedent in the history of hedge funds\u201d.</p> <p>Of the roughly $15bn in assets that SAC managed as of earlier this year, about half belonged to Cohen and his employees. The rest was client money.</p> <p>Cohen was not named as a defendant in the case. He was repeatedly referenced in court papers at the \"SACowner\" who \"enabled and promoted\" insider trading practices.</p> <p>In a separate case, the SEC is pursuing Cohen, SAC's founder, in an attempt to ban him from the securities industry for failing to prevent insider trading at the company, which he founded in 1992. Cohen has disputed the SEC's allegations. That case remains unresolved.</p> <p>As part of the deal announced Monday, prosecutors said they will not assert claims for financial recovery against any present owner or shareholder of the SAC defendants for insider trading on behalf of the SAC up to 21 December last year, except for criminal fines or forfeiture claims related to insider trading profits or avoided losses. The agreement also reserved the right of prosecutors to charge others criminally.</p> <p>Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business who studies corporate reputation, said the settlement, despite its size and impact, would likely not serve as a deterrent to others who might be pondering insider trading.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Think about how many people didn't get fined today that should have,\" Argenti said. \"Think about how many companies have done things like this before, over a long period of time. When I track how people think of reputation in the financial sector and business, it's never been worse. Trust in business is at an all-time low. People look at this and say, 'Look at this. They made tons of money and now we know how.'\"</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>",

SAC also agreed to accept a five-year probation period \u2013 in which any employee seeking to start a new investing business would require government permission \u2013 and agreed to shut down its advisory business, which accepts money from outside investors. The agreement still has to be approved by a judge, officials said. The move isolates SAC, which once reigned at the center of the hedge-fund world and whose founder was listed by Forbes as being worth $8.8bn. \"SAC will no longer be able to invest anyone's money but their own,\" said Brooks. Brooks quoted the July indictment, which called the insider trading at SAC \"substantial, pervasive and on a scale without known precedent\", adding that \"it was nothing short of institutional failure\". She also indicated that government regulators, including the Department of Justice, FBI and the SEC, plan to use SAC as a lesson to other fund managers. Brooks said officials will \"relentlessly pursue\" insider traders. \"How your employees make their money is just as important as how much they make,\" she said. In a statement, FBI assistant director George Venizelos said SAC Capital's plea demonstrates \"that cheating and breaking the law were not only permitted but allowed to persist\". In the July indictment, prosecutors said evidence against SAC was \"voluminous\" and included electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings. Prosecutors said a work culture at SAC permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading. Authorities alleged that SAC Capital earned hundreds of millions of dollars illegally from 1999 to 2010 as its portfolio managers and analysts traded on inside information from at least 20 public companies. Bharara in July said SAC Capital \"trafficked in inside information on a scale without any known precedent in the history of hedge funds\u201d. Of the roughly $15bn in assets that SAC managed as of earlier this year, about half belonged to Cohen and his employees. The rest was client money. Cohen was not named as a defendant in the case. He was repeatedly referenced in court papers at the \"SACowner\" who \"enabled and promoted\" insider trading practices. In a separate case, the SEC is pursuing Cohen, SAC's founder, in an attempt to ban him from the securities industry for failing to prevent insider trading at the company, which he founded in 1992. Cohen has disputed the SEC's allegations. That case remains unresolved. As part of the deal announced Monday, prosecutors said they will not assert claims for financial recovery against any present owner or shareholder of the SAC defendants for insider trading on behalf of the SAC up to 21 December last year, except for criminal fines or forfeiture claims related to insider trading profits or avoided losses. The agreement also reserved the right of prosecutors to charge others criminally. Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business who studies corporate reputation, said the settlement, despite its size and impact, would likely not serve as a deterrent to others who might be pondering insider trading. \"Think about how many people didn't get fined today that should have,\" Argenti said. \"Think about how many companies have done things like this before, over a long period of time. When I track how people think of reputation in the financial sector and business, it's never been worse. Trust in business is at an all-time low. People look at this and say, 'Look at this. They made tons of money and now we know how.'\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group was scrambling late on Monday to convince the 4.6 million customers of its banking arm that its ethical stance could survive aggressive US hedge funds taking a stake in the troubled bank. As details of a \u00a31.5bn rescue package were announced, the group disclosed the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, was asking questions about information it provided about its financial strength in its 2012 annual report. The bank had concluded it did not need to reissue the accounts. About 50 of the 324 Co-op bank branches are to close and a significant number of jobs from the 10,000-strong workforce are under threat as the new management team attempts to reverse steep losses. It could take five years to make the bank profitable again after losses caused by bad lending and the merger with the Britannia building society in 2009. The troubles at the bank are forcing the wider Co-operative Group, which owns supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes, to pump \u00a3462m into the bank \u2013 equivalent to around \u00a360 for each of the group's 7.9 million owner-members. While this is less than the \u00a31bn the group originally expected to stump up, it means the UK's largest mutual will own just 30% of the bank; the rest will be owned by its bondholders. Those include a group of hedge funds, led by the US-based Silver Point and Aurelius, that has forced the rewriting of a radical proposal first outlined in June, when the \u00a31.5bn shortfall was identified. Despite concerns that the millions of pounds being used to prop up the bank would starve the Co-op of cash to invest in its other businesses, the finance director, Richard Pennycook \u2013 part of a new management team installed in the last six months \u2013 said the alternative would have been worse. \"We are all extremely sorry about what has happened,\" said Pennycook. \"But there is a difference between today and June. In June, if we hadn't taken this action the bank was going to go bust \u2026 the impact on the wider group would have been disastrous.\" Bondholders including 30,000 retail investors, largely pensioners, still need to back the deal, without which the bank fears it would fall under control of the Bank of England, or could be nationalised. In an attempt to demonstrate commitment to the ethical stance the bank has been known for since 1992, the new bank will poll its customers in the spring about the businesses it should turn away on ethical grounds. Since 1992 it has turned away \u00a31.2bn of business, including backing for arms shipments, coalmining and cleaning products tested on animals. But Andre Spicer, a professor at Cass Business School, warned: \"With hedge funds at the wheel, the bank will become more ruthlessly commercial. Cutting 1,000 jobs at the same time as you launch an ethics policy is quite a contradiction.\" The bank will be able to use the Co-operative name only if it keeps an ethical stance that will be overseen by an independent director who will chair an ethics and values committee. The bank said \"customer power\" would keep it ethical. The Co-operative Group on Monday warned its brand could be damaged by the bank continuing to use the Co-op name. The City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority and the business secretary, Vince Cable, can force the bank to change its name if the description is misleading. The bank's constitution will be written from 15 November to force it to take account of the \"highest standards of ethical principles\" and being a \"good corporate citizen \u2026 contributing to building a stronger and sustainable society\". It will not be able to pay dividends to shareholders unless it also considers its commitment to society and the environment. The group of hedge funds, advised by Caroline Silver of the Wall Street investment bank Moelis, and known as LT2, stressed that it was determined to maintain the ethical stance, which Silver described as a \"unique mission\". The hedge funds will put in an extra \u00a3125m of capital in addition to their bonds. The secretive group admitted only on Monday that it included Aurelius \u2013 known for a long-running battle to force Argentina to pay out \u00a3800m \u2013 and Silver Point, linked to troubled financial firms such as Lehman Brothers. Others, including Beach Point Capital Management, Caspian Capital, Canyon Capital Advisors and Monarch Alternative Capital, then stepped forward. Euan Sutherland, who arrived from B&amp;Q to run the Co-op in May, refused to criticise the hedge funds, describing them as \"very economically rational people\" who were investing in the bank because they believed it could become profitable again. He said the bank had lost its way over the previous five years, during which it had expanded rapidly, merging with the Britannia and then attempting the audacious but ill-fated takeover of more than 600 so-called Verde branches from Lloyds Banking Group, in a move that would have given the Co-op a 1,000-strong network. Under Niall Booker, who also joined in May, the bank's high-street presence will shrink. At least 15% of the 324 branches are to be shut, and \u00a3500m ploughed into investing in IT systems that previous management neglected. Sutherland said it was his idea for Co-op Group would use \u00a3130m of the \u00a3462m it is pumping into the bank to issue new bonds to some 30,000 private investors who would otherwise have been wiped out.",

    "webTitle": "J Crew eyes share of Britain's retail bonanza with new Regent Street store", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Michelle Obama's favourite clothes store, J Crew, opens its first major British outlet on Regent Street in London this week it will be just the latest foray from a battalion of US retailers levelling their sights on the competitive UK market. Hot on the heels of the bright premium fashion retailer could be American Eagle, a casual clothing chain, which is thought to be looking to sign its first outlets in London, probably at the Westfield shopping centres in Stratford and White City. Meanwhile, homewares group Williams-Sonoma is set to open its first store in the UK, a branch of its upmarket West Elm brand, on Tottenham Court Road in central London on 5 December. It is understood to be looking for at least five more London stores and may take its Pottery Barn fascia there next year. J Crew itself has already opened a small menswear store on Lambs Conduit Street in Bloomsbury and plans a women's store in Brompton Cross later this month, with more stores expected. The newcomers follow a string of high-profile arrivals in the past five years, including lingerie specialist Victoria's Secret, young fashion chain Forever 21, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's younger sister brand Hollister and its lingerie boutique, Gilly Hicks. While McDonald's and KFC have long been familiar to British shoppers, a new wave of more upmarket US fast food joints are also arriving, with Shake Shack and Five Guys having opened their first London outlets this summer. With the economy showing signs of improvement, US retailers are looking to the UK to find a new avenue of growth. \"They often see the UK as a good jumping off point for Europe,\" said Maureen Hinton, an analyst at market research company Verdict. James Ebel, of property advisory firm Harper Dennis Hobbs, which has helped a number of US retailers enter the UK, agrees. \"When a US retailer reaches an optimum number of stores in its domestic market they turn to Canada and then to Europe or Asia. Many choose the UK because it is a sophisticated retail market, while London is at the centre of the worldwide fashion scene. It's important to be here.\" Peter Mace, head of central London property at advisory firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said: \"There's a bit of a herd mentality. Forever 21 paid a lot of money to open on Oxford Street and that has given confidence to other brands.\" Also at the head of the pack is Victoria's Secret, which now has five UK stores after launching at Westfield Stratford in time for the London Olympics. The retailer wants to add five or six more locations next year and could open up to 50 full-sized stores, while owner Limited Brands could potentially bring over other names such as Bath &amp; Body Works. Martin Waters, president of international for Limited Brands, told investors earlier this year: \"By concentrating on a relatively tight geography we can see a path to a $1bn business.\" But the new wave of arrivals are entering a fiercely competitive market \u2013 particularly in fashion, where homegrown chains such as Topshop, New Look and Oasis already vie with European giants including Zara and H&amp;M. Gap, the grandaddy of US clothing retailers in the UK, has suffered a rollercoaster ride since it opened its first store in 1987, and has been slightly reducing its presence in recent years. Others, from women's clothing store Talbots to kidswear chain Gymboree, have pulled out after struggling to make an impact, while the likes of Brookes Brothers and Urban Outfitters' sister brand Anthropologie have arrived with great fanfare but failed to get beyond a couple of outlets. Best Buy, the giant US electricals store, beat a rapid retreat, closing all 11 stores in 2011 after less than 18 months in the UK. \"The record of success of US retailers coming to Britain, especially in clothing, ought to be more than sufficient to put anyone off coming here,\" said Richard Hyman, an independent retail consultant. \"US retailers see the UK as a source of relatively easy incremental growth borne out of insufficient knowledge of the market.\" He suggested few US retailers had made serious profits as they face heavy competition and a very different trading environment from the US. Property taxes and rents are much higher in the UK while store sizes tend to be smaller, meaning retailers need to rapidly adapt to a new way of working. Exporting goods to a diminutive chain over the Atlantic also ramps up costs, so most US clothing retailers try to price UK goods at the same figure in pounds as they would in dollars back home \u2013 in other words much higher prices once exchange rates are taken into account. That can prove off-putting for savvy shoppers if what's on offer is not sufficiently different or of high quality to justify such a premium. Over here \u2026 Gap The grand-daddy of US clothing retailers came in 1987 but only brought its more upmarket Banana Republic brand chain to the UKover in 2008. It now has 145 Gap and eight Banana Republic shops in Britain. Victoria's Secret Ubiquitous US lingerie specialist opened its first UK outlet at Westfield Stratford shopping centre in London last year as it aims for a $1bn (\u00a3600m) business in the UK. Forever 21 The young fashion chain launched here two years ago in Birmingham and now has eight shops but is already looking to downsize that particular outlet. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch: Opened its sole UK store shop in 2007. Its Hollister brand, which has 30 outlets, is now across Britain but its Gilly Hicks lingerie chain, with four shops, has proved less popular. Urban Outfitters: First opened in the UK in 1998, selling a mix of trendy outfits, vintage and homewares at 25 shops. Its more upmarket Anthropologie brand opened in 2009 but its two outlets have struggled to find its niche in the UK. J Crew Plans to open three London stores this year, with more expected. American Eagle Thought to be looking at opening two London stores. Williams-Sonoma The aspirational design-led homewares group is planning two of its West Elm outlets.",

Others, from women's clothing store Talbots to kidswear chain Gymboree, have pulled out after struggling to make an impact, while the likes of Brookes Brothers and Urban Outfitters' sister brand Anthropologie have arrived with great fanfare but failed to get beyond a couple of outlets. Best Buy, the giant US electricals store, beat a rapid retreat, closing all 11 stores in 2011 after less than 18 months in the UK.</p> <p>\"The record of success of US retailers coming to Britain, especially in clothing, ought to be more than sufficient to put anyone off coming here,\" said Richard Hyman, an independent retail consultant. \"US retailers see the UK as a source of relatively easy incremental growth borne out of insufficient knowledge of the market.\"</p> <p>He suggested few US retailers had made serious profits as they face heavy competition and a very different trading environment from the US. Property taxes and rents are much higher in the UK while store sizes tend to be smaller, meaning retailers need to rapidly adapt to a new way of working. Exporting goods to a diminutive chain over the Atlantic also ramps up costs, so most US clothing retailers try to price UK goods at the same figure in pounds as they would in dollars back home \u2013 in other words much higher prices once exchange rates are taken into account. That can prove off-putting for savvy shoppers if what's on offer is not sufficiently different or of high quality to justify such a premium.</p> <h2>Over here \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Gap </strong>The grand-daddy of US clothing retailers came in 1987 but only brought its more upmarket Banana Republic brand chain to the UKover in 2008. It now has 145 Gap and eight Banana Republic shops in Britain.</p> <p><strong>Victoria's Secret</strong> Ubiquitous US lingerie specialist opened its first UK outlet at Westfield Stratford shopping centre in London last year as it aims for a $1bn (\u00a3600m) business in the UK.</p> <p><strong>Forever 21 </strong>The young fashion chain launched here two years ago in Birmingham and now has eight shops but is already looking to downsize that particular outlet.</p> <p><strong>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch: </strong>Opened its sole UK store shop in 2007. Its Hollister brand, which has 30 outlets, is now across Britain but its Gilly Hicks lingerie chain, with four shops, has proved less popular.</p> <p><strong>Urban Outfitters: </strong>First opened in the UK in 1998, selling a mix of trendy outfits, vintage and homewares at 25 shops. Its more upmarket Anthropologie brand opened in 2009 but its two outlets have struggled to find its niche in the UK.</p> <p><strong>J Crew</strong> Plans to open three London stores this year, with more expected.</p> <p><strong>American Eagle </strong>Thought to be looking at opening two London stores.</p> <p><strong>Williams-Sonoma </strong>The aspirational design-led homewares group is planning two of its West Elm outlets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The technology company behind plans by Tesco to use face-scanning software to target adverts at its shoppers has hit back at claims the system will breach customers' privacy. It emerged on Sunday that Tesco is planning to install the Optimeyes system in all 450 of its petrol stations. The software can analyse images and distinguish men from women and segment them by age, raising privacy fears among some who think it could be used to monitor people's movements. But Ke Quang, chief operating officer of Quividi, the Paris-based company that developed the software, insisted the system did not retain information about faces it identifies and so cannot track people's movements. \"We don't do facial recognition, we do face detection,\" Quang told the Guardian on Monday. \"It's software which works from the video feed coming off the camera. It can detect if it's seeing a face, but it never records the image or biomorphological information or traits. It picks up if it's seeing a man or a woman, the amount of time they pay attention to the screen, and their presence in front of the screen. The key thing though is that it never records or remembers any information. If you go from one camera in one location to another, it can't tell.\" The advertising system developed by the British company Amscreen, which is owned by Labour peer Lord Sugar and uses the information about the number, age and gender of the people who are in viewing range of the screen, is able to alter the adverts that it shows depending on who is there. Advertisers can use the information to screen adverts in locations and at times of day that will be most effective at reaching their target audience. Nick Pickles, of the pressure group Big Brother Watch, said the system did raise privacy concerns: \"Scanning customers as they walk through the store without customers ever giving permission for them to be scanned in that way \u2026 there's a huge consent issue there.\" Quividi's tests have found it to be more than 90% effective at picking men from women. It also aims to segment viewers by age into child, young adult, adult and senior adult. But tests in the US did find that its accuracy dropped substantially \u2013 to only 50% \u2013 when people, especially women, wore baseball caps. Those obscure parts of the face which the system needs to recognise key elements of the face. Ke Quang refused to say how the system tells the difference between male and female faces. \"That's our secret sauce,\" he said. But facial recognition systems have long been able to determine gender based on the ratios of the length to the width of the face, placement of eyes, relative height of forehead, and the shape of the chin. Simon Sugar, the son of Sugar and chief executive of Amscreen, told industry magazine The Grocer that \"it's like something out of Minority Report\" \u2013 the Tom Cruise film in which adverts were tailored to passersby, who were identified by retinal scans \u2013 \"but this could change the face of British retail and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible.\" The system has already been used in the UK by the charity Plan UK, which in early 2012 used it for an advertising campaign in bus shelters. The screens identified whether the viewer was a man or a woman; men would see information about the Plan website, while women would see a video about the experiences of a number of women from around the world.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Ryanair boarding scramble is to become part of airline history, with allocated seating only on all flights from next year, the budget carrier has announced, as it warned that it was on course for its first fall in profits in five years. The Irish airline said average fares were likely to fall by 9% for the six months to the end of the financial year in March 2014. It predicted second-half losses extending to \u20ac90m and cut its full-year profit guidance to around \u20ac510m (\u00a3432m) from \u20ac570m. The news sent its shares down 10% and hit the wider airline sector, with easyJet and British Airways group IAG shares both trading sharply lower. Announcing the airline's second profits warning in the space of two months, chief executive Michael O'Leary said the financial situation was \"a bit grim at the moment\". He pointed to passenger numbers continuing to climb to 81m over the last 12 months but admitted: \"Our traffic is up but it's up on the back of lower fares.\" O'Leary said he didn't want to keep finding excuses, having blamed earlier weakness on an unusually warm northern summer. But he attributed the underperformance to \"softer pricing\" \u2013 or lower fares \u2013 exacerbated by the weakness of sterling and \"the culmination of three to four years of austerity across Europe\". The airline will be continuing its new-found focus on customer service in the coming year, in a rare period of static fleet capacity. Expansion resumes with the first deliveries from an order of 175 Boeing 737-800 planes arriving in September 2014. Allocated seating will be introduced for all passengers from 1 February, following the apparent popularity of the airline's reserved seating, which allows customers to book seats at the front of the plane. Choosing those seats or exit rows will cost \u00a310, or passengers can choose any other seat for \u00a35 \u2013 otherwise they will be allocated a seat without charge. O'Leary said the move was in response to both growing demand for reserved seating and customer feedback via the airline's website. While O'Leary said he anticipated some extra revenue \u2013 with such ancillary revenues making up an increasing proportion of the airline's take as fares fall \u2013 he said the move to allocated seating was primarily prompted by the new policy of listening to customers. Joining such innovations as a more flexible baggage allowance, the curbing of in-flight sales announcements and lighter penalties for reissuing boarding passes, the move appeared to be eroding some of the perceived differences between Ryanair and traditional airlines. O'Leary said the flag carriers Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways and Iberia were now his greatest competitors, but added that he did not regard his airline as necessarily more no-frills. He said: \"What exactly are the frills BA gives you apart from lost bags and flight delays?\" When it was suggested that the conversion to presenting a warmer, nicer Ryanair to the public had coincided with profits falling, O'Leary said: \"There must be some Biblical lesson in that.\" The new customer service odyssey, which started at Ryanair's annual meeting in September when O'Leary told shareholders he recognised the need to address the \"abrupt culture\" at the airline, will also see major changes to its cumbersome website. Admitting Ryanair had lagged behind easyJet in its online booking facility, O'Leary said a \u20ac10m redevelopment of the website would mean customers would soon be able to make a booking in five clicks instead of 17. He added: \"You'll no longer be asked to buy life insurance, orphaned children from Romania or anything else.\" A cheapest fare finder and new mobile app will be introduced by the end of May. Despite the gloomier financial outlook, Ryanair said it would press ahead with its plan to return up to \u20ac600m to shareholders through buy-backs and special dividends before the end of the 2015 financial year. For the first half of 2013-14, it announced revenue up 5% to \u20ac3.25bn and profit after tax rising 1% to \u20ac602m.",

      "bodyText": "What a lively day. Time for a closing summary of the key points. \u2022 More than one in seven Co-op banking branches face closure, as part of a rescue deal hammered out between the Co-operative Group and hedge funds which own its bonds. The agreement will mean substantial job cuts, according to CEO Euan Sutherland. Speaking to the press this afternoon, Sutherland insisted that the bank can stick to its ethical history. \u2022 Ryanair shares have tumbled over 10% after the budget airline hit investors with another profit warning. It blamed intense price competition and the weak European economy.... although analysts suggested the firm faced its own particular challenges. \u2022 Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw is to waive his bonus for this year, should he be offered one, in a response to public anger and mistrust in the energy industry \u2022 Twitter has raised the pricing of its stock market float, due later this week, from $17-$20 per share to $23-$25 per share. \u2022 Hedge fund SAC Advisors is to pay penalties totalling $1.8bn to settle insider trading charges. \u2022 BlackBerry's proposed sale is off.... \u2022 The UK Serious Fraud Office has launched a criminal investigation into G4S and Serco over their electronic tagging contracts In economics... \u2022 UK construction activity has hit its highest rate since the credit crunch \u2022 The Eurozone's manufacturing sector continues to recover, modestly. Here's some analyst reaction. \u2022 While there are signs that American firms held back from major purchases in September, as they braced for the US Federal government shutdown I'll be back tomorrow... until then thanks, and goodnight. GW European markets have closed on a relatively positive note, buoyed by reasonable manufacturing figures from the eurozone and China, as well as talk of a possible interest rate cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday. Here are the closing scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 28.88 points or 0.43% higher at 6763.62 \u2022 Germany's Dax ended 0.33% better at 9037.23 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.36% at 4288.59 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.76% ahead at 19,310.69 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 0.36% to 9873.8 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 10 points or 0.07%. Breaking -- US hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors has reached a $1.8bn deal with US prosecutors to settle insider trading charges. The firm will pay a $900m fine, and forfeit another $900m - which looks like the biggest fine for insider trading ever. It will also shut its investment advisory business. The Reuters newsflashes tell the story: 04-Nov-2013 15:50 - U.S. SAYS SETTLES CRIMINAL AND CIVIL CASES AGAINST SAC CAPITAL ADVISORS, INCLUDING AN AGGREGATE $1.8 BILLION FINANCIAL PENALTY -- COURT PAPERS 04-Nov-2013 15:51 - U.S. SAYS SAC TO PLEAD GUILTY TO EVERY COUNT IN THE INDICTMENT WITH WHICH IT IS CHARGED 04-Nov-2013 15:51 - U.S. SAYS SAC TO TERMINATE ITS INVESTMENT ADVISORY BUSINESSES 04-Nov-2013 15:52 - U.S. SAYS SETTLEMENT REQUIRES COURT APPROVAL 04-Nov-2013 15:53 - U.S. SAYS SETTLEMENT REQUIRES SAC ENTITIES TO FORFEIT $900 MLN TO THE UNITED STATES, PAY A $900 MLN CRIMINAL FINE 04-Nov-2013 15:53 - U.S. SAYS SAC WILL RECEIVE A CREDIT AGAINST THE FORFEITURE FOR THE $616 MLN THAT IT PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO PAY IN U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CASES 04-Nov-2013 15:54 - U.S. SAYS BELIEVES THE AGGREGATE $1.8 BLN FINANCIAL PENALTY IS THE LARGEST IN HISTORY FOR INSIDER TRADING OFFENSES 04-Nov-2013 15:55 - U.S. SAYS THE SAC SETTLEMENT PROVIDES NO IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL 04-Nov-2013 15:56 - U.S. SAYS AGREEMENT CALLS FOR SAC CAPITAL ADVISORS LP, THREE AFFILIATES TO PLEAD GUILTY TO FOUR COUNTS OF SECURITIES FRAUD 04-Nov-2013 15:57 - U.S. SAYS AGREEMENT CALLS FOR SAC CAPITAL ADVISORS LP, THREE AFFILIATES TO PLEAD GUILTY TO ONE COUNT OF WIRE FRAUD 04-Nov-2013 15:58 - U.S. SAYS EACH OF THE SAC ENTITIES WILL ADMIT THAT AT LEAST ONE EMPLOYEE ENGAGED IN INSIDER TRADING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF HIS EMPLOYMENT, AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE RESPECTIVE SAC ENTITY A gentle start to trading on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones up 0.15%, or 21 points, at 15637 after an hour's trading. Two volleys of US economic data didn't cause much alarm. US factory orders rose by 1.7% in September, bouncing back from August's 0.1% decline. However, orders for general machinery fell by 2.6% and non-military orders for capital goods (excluding aircraft) fell 1.3%. That suggests some firms may have resisted major purchases as America headed into the federal government shutdown. Separately, a survey of New York's manufacturing sector showed a healthy rise in activity during October. The New York ISM survey jumped to 59.3 from 53.6 in September, mirroring last Friday's data which showed activity across the wider US factory sector hit its fastest rate of 2013 in October. Over in Greece, unions are preparing to hold another anti-austerity strike on Wednesday. People have been warned to expect transport disruption from Tuesday, Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: On Tuesday, a day ahead of the strike, workers on inter-city trains and the Proastiakos suburban railway will walk off the job between 9 a.m. and noon. Hellenic Railways Organization (OSE) and Proastiakos staff will not attend work at all on Wednesday. The metro, electric railway and tram will operate as normal on Wednesday but buses and trolley buses will only run between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. State hospitals are expected to operate with a skeleton staff only (details here). The strike comes as Troika officials return to Athens. As our correspondent Helena Smith wrote last night, mission chiefs from the EU, the ECB and the IMF will meet government officials in Athens on Tuesday. Greece is also on edge after two members of the far-right Golden Dawn party were killed on Friday evening. A third man was injured in the shooting, which is being investigated by counterterrorism police. As Helena reported last night, police hope that he could give them details of what happened: Golden Dawn shooting survivor could hold clues to identities of killers European president Martin Schulz spoke about the shooting during a visit to Athens today, saying it was a a signal of alarm. Greece needs to heal through growth and investment not violence, he said. Twitter has just hiked the target price of its stock market float by around 30%, a sign that the social media network's IPO is proving a favourite with investors. In a new filing to the SEC, Twitter said it expects to sell 70 million shares at an average price of between $23 and $25 each. It has previously expected to sell shares at between $17 and $20 each, when the flotation takes place later this week. If Twitter hits the $25 price tag, it would be valued at around $17bn.... All change at BlackBerry -- the struggling smartphone maker has just announced that its planned sale is off.... ...as is chief executive Thorsten Heins, it appears. Under the new plan, BlackBerry will raise about $1bn from institutional investors, including its largest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. Back in September, BlackBerry had agreed to be taken over by a consortium led by Fairfax, for $4.7bn (\u00a33bn). There were reports last week that Fairfax was struggling to raise the funds for the deal. Wall Street isn't taking the news too well, with BlackBerry shares sliding 20% in pre-market trading..... Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw has bowed to public and political criticism over rising energy prices, pledging not to take a bonus for this financial year. The news broke at the CBI annual conference in London, where Laidlaw was speaking on the topic of \"Business Trust Under the Spotlight\". He announced that he had decided not to accept any bonus this year, given the slump in public trust in the energy sector (Centrica is the parent company of British Gas). The Press Association has the quotes: There was a need for leadership in the current environment, Laidlaw said, adding it had to be balanced with being able to attract employees. \"Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it.\" Mr Laidlaw repeated the industry's pledge to cut bills if the Government switches environment and social costs to other forms of taxation. Mr Laidlaw, said the energy industry was \"in the eye of the storm\", conceding that firms should be more transparent, explain how bills are made up and improve the process of switching suppliers. Mr Laidlaw said he was focused on helping customers struggling to pay bills this winter. British Gas announced plans for a 9.2% hike in prices last month, and compounded the move with a disastrous Q&amp;A session on Twitter. Of course, we don't know if Sam Laidlaw would actually have been granted a bonus...but hats off to ITV's Laura Kuenssberg for getting him to pre-waive it. Co-op Group chief Euan Sutherland has pledged that the Co-op bank must stick to ethical standards once its restructuring is complete, otherwise it will lose the right to use the Co-op brand at all. He's speaking to the banking press pack in London -- from where Jill Treanor tweets: The Kellogg Company \u2013 purveyor of breakfast cereals and bars \u2013 has announced plans to cut its workforce by 7% by 2017, as part of a 'global four-year efficiency and effectiveness' programme dubbed Project K. John Bryant, president and CEO, said the firm is taking \"difficult decisions necessary to address structural cost-saving opportunities\". Project K includes whizzy initiatives such as \"optimization of supply-chain infrastructure\" and \"a new global focus on categories\". Kellogg is taking a pre-tax charges of between $1.2bn and $1.4bn today, in the hope of cash savings of between $425 million and $475 million per year in 2018 once it has shed 7% of its global workforce. It made the announcement after reporting a 1.7% decline in 'reported quarterly operating profit', and a slight drop in net sales. More here. Home affairs editor Alan Travis writes: The Serious Fraud Office has launched a formal criminal investigation into two of the government's biggest suppliers, G4S and Serco, following claims by the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, of tens of millions of pounds of overcharging on electronic tagging contracts for offenders. Grayling asked the SFO to look into the billing allegations in July when he told MPs that an external audit had revealed that the overcharging included billing for tracking the movements of criminals who had moved abroad, who were back in prison, who had had their tags removed and even, in a few cases, those who had died. The justice secretary said in some cases the bills had continued to be presented years after active monitoring had stopped. Serious Fraud Office launches inquiry into G4S and Serco overcharging claims RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton has been on refreshingly blunt form at the CBI annual conference. Twitter provides the best lines: And here's Katie Allen on today's strong UK construction data: British construction companies have enjoyed their fastest pick-up in business since before the financial crisis, boosting hopes that the UK's economic recovery will continue over coming months. Housebuilding was the biggest driver as the property market continues to pick up but civil engineering and commercial projects also enjoyed a boost in October, lifting a closely watched activity index for the sector to a six-year high. UK construction output highest since September 2007 Another development this morning -- two independent investigations into the suicide of Zurich Insurance Group's chief financial officer this summer have found that Pierre Wauthier was not under \"undue pressure\" before his death. My colleague Angela Monaghan reports: The death of Zurich Insurance Group's chief financial officer cannot be blamed on \"undue pressure\" at work despite the reference in Pierre Wauthier's suicide note to the former chairman Josef Ackermann. Zurich, Switzerland's largest insurer, reported the conclusion on Monday following two independent investigations into the circumstances surrounding Wauthier's suicide in August. Ackermann was referred to in a note left by Wauthier, with the finance boss suggesting he was demoralised by a new, aggressive tone under Ackermann, according to Reuters. More here: Zurich Insurance says pressure at work is not to blame for finance boss's death Europe's stock markets are all slightly higher this morning, with the FTSE 100 up 31 points, or nearly 0.5%, at 6765. The French CAC is up 0.3%, and Germany's DAX is 0.35% higher. Investors have been cheered by today's encouraging eurozone manufacturing data and anticipation that the European Central Bank might cut interest rates when it meets on Thursday. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, explains: Market chatter around the possibility of an ECB rate cut either this week or at their December meeting has seen traders putting risk back into the market this morning, reclaiming some of the ground we lost to Fed tapering speculation last week. The different recovery stages in which major economies find themselves may well make for some interesting divergence in the global equity indices in the coming six months, as Central bankers in different geographies tighten/loosen their belts. That the Eurozone is in need of additional stimulus at a time when the UK and US look to be on the verge of growing their way out of trouble will provide further ammunition to those who argue that centralizing monetary policy across the region was doomed to failure from the start\u2026 Here's Nick Fletcher's market report on the main moves in the City this morning: Weir weaker after profit warning but FTSE 100 moves higher The Serious Fraud Office has just announced it has opened a criminal investigation into G4S and Serco's electronic monitoring contracts. G4S has also issued a statement to the City, saying it is co-operating fully. Here's the full G4S statement: SFO Investigation G4S confirms that it has today received notice that the Director of the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into the \"contract for the provision of electronic monitoring services which commenced in April 2005 as amended and extended until the present day\". G4S has confirmed to the SFO that it will co-operate fully with the investigation. Back in July, the government announced it was calling in the SFO to examine whether G4S had overcharged the government over the contracts, to monitor offenders who have been electronically tagged. Shares in G4S have dropped by 1.7% this morning. Serco are down 0.3%. IG analyst Brenda Kelly says that today's Ryanair profit warning can't simply be blamed on Europe's weak economy. Something else is amiss... The eurozone recession has been given a lot of the blame for the decline in annual profit yet when one compares the share price action to that of rival easyJet over the past few months it has become clear that something else is amiss. The concept created by Ryanair of low cost flights has to a degree been cannibalised by other airlines and has thus made the competition in this space fiercer than ever. When you have the likes of Aerlingus and easyjet all vying for the same business it\u2019s not difficult to see where the profit is flowing. Both competitors have fallen in sympathy in early trade today but now look to be seeing a mild recovery as bargain hunters step in. The same cannot be said for Ryanair shares just yet. Brenda also points out that CEO Michael O Leary held a Twitter Q&amp;A last month, in an attempt to change perceptions of the airline: Going on twitter and answering a variety of questions posed by customers, the main take-away from the entire incident is that customer service or the lack thereof is the main problem and that passengers given a choice will not necessarily choose Ryanair straight off the bat as a result. Ryanair announced today that it will offer fully allocated seating on all flights from 1 February 2014, in a response to customer feedback. It also cited a new 24 hour \"grace period\" to allow passengers correct minor booking errors, and \"significantly reduced boarding card reissue and standard bag fees\". Its shares are still down almost 12% today. Heads-up: David Cameron has declared that Britain's economy is \"on the right track\", and denied 'playing games' with the UK's place in the European Union by promising a referendum on EU membership. The prime minister is speaking in London at the annual conference of the CBI (which declared last night that it was vital that Britain remains in the EU) . My colleague Andrew Sparrow has all the details in his Politics live blog. Here's a flavour: The BBC's Nick Robinson asks Cameron if he will heed the CBI's warning to stop playing games with the EU membership. Cameron says he is not playing games with EU membership. His view is that consent for Britain's EU membership is \"wafer-thin\". He says his approach has the overwhelming support of the British people. And it has strong business support too. You cannot stay in these organisations unless you take the British people with you. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will be speaking later this morning. No relief for Ryanair - its shares are now down almost 12% after today's profit warning. My colleague Angela Monaghan reports: Ryanair is on course for its first fall in profits in five years, saying that increased competition and a weak economic backdrop will force it to cut fares by up to 10% for the winter months. The budget airline issued its second profit warning in as many months after average fares fell 2% during the first half of the financial year. It said fares were likely to fall by up to 10% by the end of the financial year to 31 March 2014, despite slightly higher forward bookings. Ryanair blames lower fares for latest profit warning Time to catch up on the Co-op bank rescue. Jill Treanor confirms that hundreds of jobs are at risk as a sweeping restructuring begins, with 15% of the bank's 324 branches to close. It plans to move more customers to online banking and its network of corporate banking sectors is also to be rationalised. Even so, it warned that it would not make profits until 2015 at the earliest, and possibly not \"for some years thereafter\". Co-op Bank to close 50 branches as hedge funds broker rescue deal One more point on October's rosy UK construction data -- housing remained the strongest performing area of the construction sector, although activity didn't match September's 10-year high. UK construction sector has posted its biggest rise in activity in six years, driven by the housing sector. Data firm Markit's monthly construction PMI survey jumped to 59.4 in October, ahead of City expectations, and beating September's reading of 58.9 and the previous six-year high recorded in August. That's the fastest rise in activity since September 2007, the month in which the credit crunch struck, prompting bank runs at Northern Rock. Here's the key points: Residential construction remains strongest performing area of activity Civil engineering and commercial activity also record robust growth Job creation accelerates to fastest pace in six years It's the latest sign that the building sector is back on its feet (partly due to the government's Help to Buy scheme.) The survey is based on interviews with UK construction bosses, who reported a rise in new business and an increase in employment. Clients are spending more, while 'better housing market conditions' also driving activity. Markit economist Tim Moore commented: UK construction output continues to rise like a phoenix from the ashes, with housing, commercial and civil engineering activity all seeing strong rates of expansion at the start of the fourth quarter. While David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, was encouraged to see firms hiring more staff: The on-going growth of new business levels, climbing confidence and positive market conditions has resulted in the steepest rise in staffing levels for six years. Caution on employment experienced in the first half of 2013 has now been replaced by rising expectations and a strong belief that growth can be sustained in the year to come. HSBC says it has not suspended any employees over suspected currency market manipulation (as flagged up earlier, the bank is assisting with the investigation into the issue). Here some reaction to the news that eurozone manufacturing activity rose in October (see 9.18am): Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit: The eurozone manufacturing economy is undergoing its strongest growth period for two-and- a-half years, since the mounting uncertainty caused by the escalating sovereign debt crisis hit businesses hard in 2011. While it is in some respects disappointing that the PMI has failed to show a steeper pick-up over the last two months, the recent growth revealed by the survey indicates a marked turnaround in the health of the manufacturing economy. While the survey was signalling a 2-3% annual rate of decline in industrial production earlier in the year, a 2-3% rate of expansion is now being indicated. However, while the recovery goes on, it is by all measures frustratingly slow. In particular, the modest gains in output and new orders remain insufficient to encourage firms to take on more staff. More encouraging indications about the recovery can be gained by looking at the increasingly broad- based nature of the upturn, and especially the fact that increasingly robust gains in production are now being seen in countries such as Spain, Italy and Ireland, to suggest that structural reforms to boost competitiveness are starting to pay off. Howard Archer, chief UK + European economist at IHS Global Insight: While the October PMI indicates that Eurozone manufacturing expansion improved marginally compared to September, the rate of growth remains modest and it has been unable to strengthen further overall since reaching a 26-month high in August. This reinforces suspicion that while the Eurozone is likely to keep on growing after finally exiting extended recession in the second quarter, the region still faces a hard slog in developing decent recovery and remains vulnerable to setbacks. The eurozone's manufacturing sector posted a rise in activity in October, despite French firms posting a weaker performance than expected. Markit's monthly PMI survey, which measures thousands of firms across the euro area, rose to 51.3, from 51.1 in September. That suggests the sector kept expanding during the month, with only France and Greece failing to post growth. As Markit put it: The eurozone manufacturing sector carried its modest third quarter recovery into the final quarter of the year. German factories posted a decent rise in activity (its PMI rose to 51.7 from 51.1), on the back of a rise in new orders and higher production volumes. Manufacturers in both Ireland and Austria both reported their strongest rise in activity in over two years. Activity across France's factories fell, though, with its PMI dropping to 49.1 from 49.8 in September. That's worse than the 'flash' reading of 49.4 two weeks ago, and indicates a bigger drop in output (50 points is the cut-off mark between expansion and contraction). The details are online here. And here's a graphic showing the main points: HSBC also predicted that that UK will outperform the eurozone in the months ahead, as it struck a pretty upbeat tone in its outlook statement. The banking giant, which reported a 30% rise in pre-tax profits, said it sees \"reasons for optimism with some evidence of a broadening recovery\". Indications are that economic growth in mainland China is stabilising with positive implications for Hong Kong and the rest of Asia-Pacific. The US should continue to grow, albeit at a low rate by historical standards. The UK should see positive growth and outperform the eurozone. We expect GDP growth in Latin America to remain slow, although the Mexican economy should strengthen in 2014. Our forecasts for global growth remain constant at 2.0% in 2013 and 2.6% in 2014. HSBC shares are up 2% this morning. Here's the full statement. More banking news -- HSBC has told the City that it is assisting the regulators with their inquiries into whether currency traders manipulated foreign exchange rates. There's no suggestion, though, that it has suspended any employees over the issue. HSBC's latest financial results, released this morning, explain: The Financial Conduct Authority is conducting investigations alongside several other agencies in various countries into a number of firms, including HSBC, relating to trading on the foreign exchange market. We are cooperating with the investigations which are at an early stage. The global investigation into allegations of rigging in the currency markets escalated late last week, when Barclays suspended six of its traders. Both JP Morgan and Citigroup said they were co-operating with regulators (joining Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and UBS). For background, here's our story from Friday night: Regulators contact more banks over currency market manipulation Another key line from the Co-op bank conference call -- it will take five years to turn the bank around, suggesting that it may not return to profits until 2018. Here 's Reuters's news flashes: 04-Nov-2013 08:11 - CO-OP GROUP'S CEO EUAN SUTHERLAND SAYS BRANCH CLOSURES HAVE ALREADY STARTED, WON'T SAY HOW MANY JOBS WILL BE CUT 04-Nov-2013 08:12 - CO-OP GROUP'S CEO SAYS NOT SEEING ANY REAL MOVEMENT IN CUSTOMER NUMBERS, CUSTOMER NUMBERS VERY STABLE 04-Nov-2013 08:18 - CO-OP BANK'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAYS IT WILL TAKE 4 TO 5 YEARS TO TURN AROUND THE BANK'S FORTUNES 04-Nov-2013 08:22 - CO-OP GROUP'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAYS 'IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THE BANK LOST ITS WAY' 04-Nov-2013 08:28 - CO-OP GROUP'S CEO SAYS COULD WELL BE THE CASE IN TIME THAT GROUP WILL LOOK TO INVEST MORE IN BANK Back to the Co-op bank rescue plan. The Co-operative Group has been fielding some tough questions from the media after announcing its plans for its financial arm. Our own Jill Treanor asked about the branch closure plan -- Euan Sutherland, boss of Co-op Group, admitted that there will be \"significant\" job cuts at the bank, but full details still aren't available. And on the issues of ethics -- the Co-op explained that the Bank will only be allowed to used the 'Co-operative ' name if it maintains proper ethical standards. Ryanair's profits warning (see opening post) has given airline investors a nasty dose of turbulence this morning. Shares in Ryanair have tumbled by 10% in early trading after it predicted that profits will be sharply below previous forecasts. Michael O'Leary's warning of \"softer economic conditions\" in Europe and increased price pressure has also wiped 3% off Easyjet's share price, and sent IAG (owner of British Airways and Iberia) down 2.3%. Co-op management are putting on a brave face, saying this morning's deal is a big step towards securing the future of the Bank. But the recapitalisation plan also admits that the banking arm will continue to lose money for at least the next year -- and possibly a lot longer. It warns: The Directors continue to believe that the Bank will not be profitable in 2013 and 2014 and can give no assurance that the Bank will generate a profit for some years thereafter. Co-op Group's chief executive Euan Sutherland is also trying to calm fears that the bank's ethical stance faces extinction. Speaking on the Radio 4 Today programme, he said: What\u2019s really important to our customers and our members is that the bank continues and that the values and ethics of the bank are right at the heart of that and for the first time ever we\u2019ve written that into the constitution of the bank. It's official, the Co-operative Group is ceding control of its banking arm as part of the recapitalisation plan to patch up a \u00a31.5bn black hole in its balance sheet. And in a blow to customers -- and probably staff too -- the company expects to shut around 15% of branches. By our reckoning, that means up to 50 branches could be shut. As Co-op puts it: Between 30 June 2013 and the end of 2014, the Bank expects to significantly rationalise its branch network by at least 15 per cent of its current estate (as at 30 June 2013) of 324 branches and migrate basic transactions onto a predominantly self-service basis, in particular through the digital channel. That comes from an announcement outlining its rescue plan have been announced - you can see a copy here: Co-operative Bank Recapitalisation Plan Under the plan, Co-op Group will own just 30% of the bank (making it the biggest single shareholder) and will contribute \u00a3462m towards the recapitalisation. The two US hedge funds who own Co-op bank bonds, and who forced the co-operative organisation to surrender majority control, will contribute \u00a3125m of fresh capital. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. It looks like an interesting day ahead. For starters, Ryanair has warned that its annual profits will fall for the first time in five years. The budget airline's CEO, Michael O'Leary, blamed \"softer economic conditions in Europe\" and stronger competition as it predicted profits of \u20ac500m-\u20ac520m in 2013, down from a previous forecast of \u20ac570m-\u20ac600m. The news comes just two months after Ryanair startled investors with a profits warning. Faced with further weak demand, the firm is planning plenty of low fare seat sales. Fares are expected to fall by 10% over the winter \u2013 which O'Leary is keen to brand as good news for customers. It's clear, though, that Ryanair is suffering from the tough economic times. As chief financial officer Howard Millar put it to Bloomberg: People have less money to spend. We had a strong August, since then we\u2019ve started to see a weakening environment. I'll mop up some reaction shortly. There's also plenty of banking news this morning, with the Co-operative Group announcing its plans for its troubled banking arm this morning. There's a press conference shortly -- my colleague Jill Treanor sets the scene in today's paper: Co-operative Bank is expected to signal on Monday that hundreds of jobs could be under threat as part of a pledge by the new management team to cut costs. In documents due to be published by the bank, it will signal a need to shed costs from a business that employs 10,000 people as it scrambles to return to profit. The bank, which declined to comment, has sunk to a loss and needs to raise \u00a31.5bn under a controversial proposal that will require the Co-operative Group to concede control of the bank after pressure from two major US hedge funds. Prospectuses setting out details for bondholders are scheduled to be published on Monday to provide information about the new business plan of the bank and the exact terms being offered to bondholders who are to own 70% of it. Co-operative Bank to cut hundreds of jobs as new chiefs clamp down on costs Banking giant HSBC is also releasing its financial results later this morning. In the eurozone, there's growing pressure on the European Central Bank to consider an interest rate cut after last week's inflation data. And Greece is bracing for the imminent return of its troika of international lenders (they're expected in Athens tomorrow, after much too-ing and fro-ing over whether the visit was on). And we'll also get another healthcheck on the eurozone manufacturing sector, with Markit's monthly PMI survey, followed by its latest report on the UK manufacturing sector. I'll be tracking all the action through the day as usual.",

    "webTitle": "Boss of British Gas owner Centrica waives bonus after bills furore", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has waived his bonus this year after admitting that the energy industry urgently needs to rebuild trust with consumers. Sam Laidlaw, who was paid a total of nearly \u00a35m last year including almost \u00a31.5m in cash bonuses, said he understood the anger and frustration felt by many after bills rocketed by more than three times the rate of inflation in 2013. Speaking at the CBI's annual conference in London, he said trust in the energy sector is at an \"all-time low\" and acknowledged an urgent need to rebuild it. He said the reputation of the company and the industry had been damaged by the furore over rising bills and industry leaders needed to tackle the issue head on. But Centrica, which has almost 9 million UK customers of its British Gas subsidiary, was innocent of profiteering, he said, and was unable to subside retail prices from profits in other parts of the business. He said Centrica's gas exploration business, which has been mentioned as a possible cash cow for the retail arm, lost \u00a3130m last year. Other parts of the organisation were also less profitable than critics imagined, while profit margins on worldwide sales were a modest 5.9%, he said. Laidlaw pledged to cut bills if the chancellor goes ahead in his autumn statement with plans to absorb the green levy into general taxation. He said British gas would cut bills by the amount of the levy if the rumoured change goes ahead. Currently the green levy, which is used to subsidise the extra costs of generating electricity from renewable sources, is imposed on the larger energy providers, which pass on the bill to customers. The commitment appeared to give a boost to proposals circulating inside the Treasury for an immediate cut in household bills by transferring the green levy to the government budget. Officials had feared that energy companies would absorb the cut and boost profits rather than pass on the benefit to customers. Laidlaw said there was a need for leadership in the current environment, though a decision to deny bonuses needed to be balanced with being able to attract employees. \"Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it.\" Laidlaw said the energy industry was \"in the eye of the storm\", conceding that firms should be more transparent, explain how bills are made up and improve the process of switching suppliers. Laidlaw said he was focused on helping customers struggling to pay bills this winter. More than half a million British Gas customers will receive a special discount of \u00a360, on top of a \u00a3135 warm home discount, he said. Laidlaw said his company had reduced its costs by \u00a3300m over the past few years, and would immediately pass on any reductions in the social and environmental part of energy bills. \"We are listening \u2013 we get it, absolutely. We know there is a problem.\"",

But Centrica, which has almost 9 million UK customers of its British Gas subsidiary, was innocent of profiteering, he said, and was unable to subside retail prices from profits in other parts of the business.</p> <p>He said Centrica's gas exploration business, which has been mentioned as a possible cash cow for the retail arm, lost \u00a3130m last year. Other parts of the organisation were also less profitable than critics imagined, while profit margins on worldwide sales were a modest 5.9%, he said. Laidlaw pledged to cut bills if the chancellor goes ahead in his autumn statement with plans to absorb the green levy into general taxation. He said British gas would cut bills by the amount of the levy if the rumoured change goes ahead.</p> <p>Currently the green levy, which is used to subsidise the extra costs of generating electricity from renewable sources, is imposed on the larger energy providers, which pass on the bill to customers.</p> <p>The commitment appeared to give a boost to proposals circulating inside the Treasury for an immediate cut in household bills by transferring the green levy to the government budget. Officials had feared that energy companies would absorb the cut and boost profits rather than pass on the benefit to customers.</p> <p>Laidlaw said there was a need for leadership in the current environment, though a decision to deny bonuses needed to be balanced with being able to attract employees.</p> <p>\"Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it.\"</p> <p>Laidlaw said the energy industry was \"in the eye of the storm\", conceding that firms should be more transparent, explain how bills are made up and improve the process of switching suppliers.</p> <p>Laidlaw said he was focused on helping customers struggling to pay bills this winter. More than half a million British Gas customers will receive a special discount of \u00a360, on top of a \u00a3135 warm home discount, he said.</p> <p>Laidlaw said his company had reduced its costs by \u00a3300m over the past few years, and would immediately pass on any reductions in the social and environmental part of energy bills. \"We are listening \u2013 we get it, absolutely. We know there is a problem.\"</p>",

Gulliver would not deviate from a statement issued by the bank. \"The Financial Conduct Authority is conducting investigations alongside several other agencies in various countries into a number of firms, including HSBC, relating to trading on the foreign exchange market. We are co-operating with the investigations, which are at an early stage.\" The bank said there was uncertainty about the amount of capital it might need to hold because of changes being discussed with regulators. Gulliver gave few clues as to how the bank would deal with the cap on bonuses being imposed by the EU after the bank had warned in the summer it was considering increasing salaries. Gulliver was upbeat about the UK and Hong Kong, and appeared to express commitment to the UK, where the bank has been headquartered since taking over Midland Bank in the mid-1990s. \"Our home markets of the UK and Hong Kong contributed more than half of the group's underlying profit before tax. Hong Kong performed well in the quarter, reflecting broad-based revenue growth. Hong Kong continues to benefit from its close economic relationship with mainland China. We remain well positioned to capitalise on improving economic conditions in these markets,\" Gulliver said. He was positive about China and also the UK, which he said \"should see positive growth and outperform the eurozone\". But he warned that economic growth in Latin America would remain slow, although the Mexican economy should strengthen in 2014. The bank's forecasts for global growth remain constant at 2.0% in 2013 and 2.6% in 2014.",

Zurich, Switzerland's largest insurer, reported the conclusion on Monday following two independent investigations into the circumstances surrounding Wauthier's suicide in August. Ackermann was referred to in a note left by Wauthier, with the finance boss suggesting he was demoralised by a new, aggressive tone under Ackermann, according to Reuters. It has also been suggested that Ackermann insisted that Wauthier make changes to the second-quarter earnings presentation a day before the results were due to be released, causing Zurich to flag a lack of progress on business targets. Wauthier, 53, was found hanged at his home in Zug less than two weeks later. \"The investigations found no indication that Pierre Wauthier was subjected to any undue or inappropriate pressure, and furthermore, the presentation of the financial figures was confirmed as appropriate,\" the company said in a statement on Monday. The investigations were conducted at the request of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, and involved the assessment of documents and correspondence, and questioning of Wauthier's colleagues. Tom de Swaan, the chairman of Zurich, said: \"We are still deeply saddened by the loss of Pierre Wauthier and we are unable to explain the motivation behind his tragic decision.\" Ackermann resigned at the end of August, saying Wauthier's family had let it be known that \"I should take my share of responsibilty, as unfounded as any allegations might be\". He said at the time he was deeply shocked by the death, and decided to resign for the sake of Zurich's reputation.

Despite the opportunity of 'landmark' contract wins in Oil &amp; Gas and Minerals, it also highlights the concerns that the market has regarding any potential recovery in 2014, we feel, and this applies to all divisions. Valuation also gives only modest downside protection we feel. We remain happy to stay at hold. Despite Weir's mining woes, the sector has moved higher after a positive manufacturing index for China, a key consumer of commodities. Antofagasta has added 15p to 852p while Rio Tinto has risen 44p at \u00a332.28. This has helped put the FTSE 100 up 35 points to 6769.74, as has talk of a possible rate cut by the European Central Bank this week. Leading the risers is HSBC, 15.9p higher at 703.2p after third quarter profits rose 10% and despite the bank saying it was the latest to confirm it is helping with a probe into possible manipulation of currency markets. Ryanair's profit warning left rival easyJet 55p lower at \u00a312.41. Meggitt, meanwhile, has lost another 9.9p to 499.1p.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's recovery will accelerate over the coming months and into the new year after a strong rise in business confidence, according to two surveys of company bosses. But wage rises are likely to remain below inflation, fuelling concern that living standards will fall for a sixth year after the financial crash. The latest ICAEW/Grant Thornton UK Business Confidence Monitor (BCM) forecasts that the economy will grow by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013, up from 0.7% in the third quarter. The near doubling of the growth rate is a sign that businesses expect a surge in exports andbusiness investment over the next year, the report said. A separate survey by the Federation of Small Businesses found confidence levels among owners and managers had doubled to a record high in response to the improved economic climate. Until now official figures have shown a reluctance among business leaders to match an increase in confidence among consumers with higher business investment. Analysts have argued that without a rise in business investment, firms are unlikely to improve their productivity and be in a position to offer higher wages. Much of the recovery this year is based on higher consumer spending driven by the resurgence in the housing market. Fears that consumers are borrowing heavily to maintain their spending and standard of living were fuelled last week by figures showing a jump in unsecured lending. Labour has urged the coalition to bring forward initiatives to encourage private sector investment alongside plans for greater public sector infrastructure and investment spending. George Osborne is expected to emphasise the need for public and private investment to support the recovery in his autumn statement in December. However, the chancellor is unlikely to pledge new government funds, preferring to stick to previously announced spending limits. Michael Izza, chief executive of ICAEW, said the lack of a significant rise in pay meant the recovery remained fragile over the longer term. \"The recovery is still not completely secure because spare capacity remains in the economy, and weak pay growth is likely to continue the squeeze on household incomes,\" said Izza. But he added that the immediate outlook was rosy: \"If it continues at this rate, the UK economy will be one of the fastest-growing economies in the western world going into 2014. \"As significantly, the shape of the recovery is changing as businesses respond to rising confidence by looking to new markets and increasing their investment plans. However we cannot be complacent and all of us need to work hard to maintain the momentum built up this year while remaining alive to the threats to our recovery, especially those outside the UK,\" he said. The BCM Confidence Index stands at +31.7, up from +24.0 in the third quarter of this year, its highest level in the 10 years that the BCM has been running. Businesses reported the strongest expected employment growth since the financial crisis with an average increase of 1.7% in headcount over the next 12 months. This growth applies to all sectors apart from banking and the City, which has shed jobs over the last year and expects to continue to do so. \"As the economy recovers, staff turnover and skills availability are becoming more of an issue. This is not however reflected in salaries, with growth of just 1.8% predicted over the coming year, well below current inflation levels,\" the report said. The reports follow an upbeat assessment of the economy by Britain's business association, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which revised up its forecast for the country's economic growth next year to 2.4% over the weekend. It predicted a rebound in business and housing investment. The previous quarterly forecast from the CBI, in August, expected 2014 gross domestic product growth to be 2.3%. \"The recovery that started in the service sector has fanned out to manufacturing and construction, and is shaping up to be more broad-based,\" said CBI director-general John Cridland. Many economists have revised up their growth forecasts in recent months on signs of strong expansion in the third quarter of the year. An October 2013 Reuters poll of economists showed an average forecast of 2.2% for 2014, building on expected growth of 1.4% this year, matching the forecast by the CBI. A Treasury spokesman said the CBI report showed the government's economic policies were effective.",
