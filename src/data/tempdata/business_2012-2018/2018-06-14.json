      "bodyText": "The World Cup kicked off at 4pm on Thursday afternoon \u2013 but not for some people streaming the match on ITV\u2019s website, who missed the start of the tournament. Viewers reported that the online streaming service showed an advert for a betting company as host Russia\u2019s opening match against Saudi Arabia got underway in Moscow. All 64 World Cup matches are being shown live on British TV, with ITV and BBC splitting the rights to show the matches on both their traditional channels and respective online services. BBC journalism trainer Marc Blank-Settle expressed surprise viewers \u201cmissed the kick-off of the first game because ITV Player was showing an advert\u201d and said it was \u201cnot a problem you\u2019ll ever get with the BBC\u201d. ITV also attracted complaints about the quality of its online stream, with some viewers suggesting they would instead use illegal pirated streams, apparently to obtain a better-quality picture. Viewers also pointed out that the audio volume on the ad-supported service was automatically louder during commercial breaks, with one suggesting on Twitter it made it hard to watch the football \u201con the sly at work\u201d. A spokesperson for ITV said it was investigating why viewers missed kick-off: \u201cFor a small number of viewers watching the Hub on PC and mobile the scheduled ad break overran by 30 seconds due to a technical issue and we are investigating how this happened.\u201d The glitch only affected individuals watching on a computer and iPhones, with people streaming the match on Android phones unaffected. ITV\u2019s issues with livestreaming the opening match of the World Cup now stretch back almost a decade. In 2010 it launched an experimental web service named ITV Live which buckled under the demand of people attempting to watch hosts South Africa open the tournament with their game against Mexico. Four years later the broadcaster was back with ITV Player. However, once again, the stream collapsed after viewers attempted to watch Brazil open the tournament, with a spokesperson attributing the outage to \u201cunprecedented numbers of users during this game\u201d. There were no reported issues with the main broadcast on ITV1, with fans focusing on the commentator Clyde Tyldesley\u2019s observation during the match that \u201cStalin had a proper \u2018tache\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is off track in its mission to improve the diversity of staff after figures showed a fall last year in the share of senior jobs held by women and ethnic minority employees. The Bank\u2019s annual report reveals that the proportion of women in senior roles fell from 30% to 29% while the share of black and minority ethnic (BME) staff in senior positions fell from 6% to 5%. The governor, Mark Carney, is likely to be embarrassed by the figures after he set targets to push the number of women at the top of the organisation to 35% and BME senior officials to 13% by 2020. It means Threadneedle Street, which has monitored the proportion of women and BME staff since 2015, has a huge amount of ground to make up in just two years. A spokeswoman for the Bank said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we need to re-double our efforts. We have put in place a sponsorship programme that nominates candidates for intense mentoring. We have also introduced anonymous recruitment, which means removing all personal information in the initial selection process.\u201d Carney has used several speeches in recent years to emphasise his commitment to increasing the number of women and BME staff at the Bank. Last year he said: \u201cHistorically, there were times when this institution was run by the City for the City. \u201cFrequent charges levelled at this central bank \u2013 like many of our peers \u2013 include being mono-culture, secretive and ridden with groupthink.\u201d He pledged to increase diversity and inclusiveness to make the Bank\u2019s 4,378 staff more in tune with the modern economy. But he is hampered by procedures that mean some staff are appointed by the government. The Treasury recently appointed a white man to the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee from a shortlist of five that included four women. The decision was taken despite Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, calling last year for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to ask for confirmation from the bank that everything is being done to encourage gender and ethnic diversity among applicants for roles on its policy committees. Overall, the number of women outside the senior ranks working at the Bank has only risen from 44% to 45% in the last four years and the number of BME staff in the same category has only grown from 16% to 18%. The bank aims to reach targets of 50% and 20% respectively.",

      "bodyText": "The boardroom bust-up at Stobart has escalated after the infrastructure group fired the former chief executive and founder Andrew Tinkler and launched legal proceedings. The firm accused Tinkler, who was paid more than \u00a35m last year in bonuses and long-term awards, of breaching his contract and fiduciary duty to shareholders, and trying to destabilise the company. Tinkler had been trying to oust the group chairman, Iain Ferguson, with the backing of a purported 20 managers and significant investors, including the City fund manager Neil Woodford, and install his associate and neighbour Philip Day, who owns the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group. Announcing the termination of Tinkler\u2019s contract, the chief executive, Warwick Brady, said: \u201cMr Tinkler\u2019s actions, particularly in recent days, have threatened to destabilise the company and severely impacted my ability and that of my team to manage the business on a day to day basis and deliver the agreed strategy. This is against the interests of all of our shareholders.\u201d In a letter outlining the reasons for his dismissal, Stobart\u2019s law firm Rosenblatt accused Tinkler of having a \u201cflagrant disregard for his fiduciary and contractual duties\u201d, and having \u201cset about subverting and disrupting the company in his own interests\u201d. Specific allegations include having \u201cwished to extract at least \u00a330m in cash from the company\u201d through a share buyback that the board rejected; planning to acquire the company\u2019s airline business as part of a potential takeover of Flybe for no cost, \u201cto the advantage of himself ... and the disadvantage of the company\u2019s shareholders as a whole\u201d. Tinkler is also accused of orchestrating an unlawful tax avoidance scheme, and having \u201cnumerous and substantial expenses\u201d for personal entertaining, as well as the extensive use of aircraft and helicopters to visit his associates. Tinkler said the allegations \u201ccontain malicious falsehoods\u201d. Stobart had already started legal proceedings against Tinkler and another former director, William Stobart, over the \u00a34m tax claim, which dates back to 2008. Tinkler, a 7.7% shareholder in the company and childhood friend of the original Stobart family, has counter-sued five directors for defamation. Last week lawyers for 20 unnamed employees at Stobart accused Brady of \u201cbullying\u201d them to find out if they backed a letter purporting to represent 80% of senior management, supporting Tinkler. Stobart alleged that the letter was \u201cclearly orchestrated by Tinkler\u201d, who was \u201cfabricating a grievance\u201d, which he has denied. Tinkler, who has said his only objective was to ensure that Stobart \u201csticks to the agreed company strategy\u201d, said: \u201cIn the last few days, we\u2019ve seen the Stobart chairman and CEO involved in allegations of bullying and ignoring their own senior team. Today\u2019s announcement confirms that they are desperately attempting to pre-empt the wishes of shareholders. \u201cThey are also attempting to deny shareholders the right to determine the leadership of the board. This is not how a listed company should behave.\u201d The group, which sold off its trucking business in 2013, is now largely split between the supply of biomass for renewable energy generation and aviation, with a small domestic airline and the fast-growing London Southend airport.",

      "bodyText": "The online ethical grocer Farmdrop has raised \u00a310m from investors, including the founder of Skype, to take its home delivery service to the north of England. The London-based company, launched by an ex-city broker, Ben Pugh, in 2014, wants to open a warehouse in Manchester after expanding to Bristol and Bath late last year. Farmdrop began by delivering produce from local farmers to libraries, community centres and pubs, but now uses a fleet of electric vans to deliver directly to homes. Pugh says the company gives its 300-plus producers a bigger share of profits than the supermarkets by keeping costs low and using high-tech apps to make ordering, processing and delivering goods as efficient as possible. Farmers, most of whom come from within 150 miles of shoppers\u2019 homes, keep 70% of the retail price, compared with just over half at a traditional retailer, partly as many of them only harvest and ship to order, reducing waste. Pugh says giving them \u201cthe lion\u2019s share of the value\u201d enables farmers to look after the environment and their animals more effectively. \u201cIt\u2019s a more symbiotic food system with everyone looking after everyone rather than a horrible zero sum game with a few bully winners,\u201d he says. He says the major supermarkets \u201care having to annihilate producers on price year in, year out \u2013 a situation created by a dysfunctional system in which producers are not being paid enough to farm properly\u201d. Farmdrop sells more than 2,000 products, from meat, dairy and organic fruit and veg to eco washing-up liquid, a similar size of range to a discount retailer rather than the 30,000-plus products stocked by a traditional supermarket. Stock is mostly delivered daily, so there is no need for a large warehouses, and sorted into delivery crates by packers guided by an app on a tablet computer, rather than any expensive robot-led system. Critics suggest that, despite the group\u2019s laudable aims, it will struggle to make a profit and find a wide enough audience. Pugh admits that Farmdrop is still a \u201csignificantly loss-making startup\u201d that has got to grow into profit. Pugh left his job at Morgan Stanley in 2012 to work on the idea. He ploughed in all his savings and raised \u00a3750,000 through the crowdfunding site CrowdCube from 190 backers including Asos co-founder Quentin Griffiths. Including the latest round of fundraising, the group has raised more than \u00a317m to support its efforts. \u201cAre we well-meaning hippies splashing around venture capitalists\u2019 money, or are we redrawing the food system? I promise you it\u2019s the second one,\u201d Pugh said. He says sales have doubled in the last nine months to about \u00a36m a year, and he expects them to double again in the next nine months. The Skype founder Niklass Zennstr\u00f6m is sufficiently convinced to be pumping more cash into the business on top of a previous investment. Zennstr\u00f6m said: \u201cWhat we find so compelling about Farmdrop is the way they\u2019re using technology for good. By creating a direct route to market for farmers, Farmdrop is helping to create a healthier and more efficient supply chain. We\u2019re proud to invest in such a fantastic team.\u201d New investors contributing to the \u00a310m investment round also include Impact Ventures, which invests in businesses that make a positive contribution to society, such as the social enterprise letting agency Homes for Good in Scotland, as well as the renewable energy specialist Belltown Ventures, which has backed a string of solar, wind and hydro projects in the UK.",

In fact, what is needed is a radical reform of the current passenger rail franchising model, and an end to the highly damaging separation of track and train operation. This could be achieved through the creation of a set of vertically integrated franchises along each main line of route, with a single entity responsible for management and operation of both fixed and mobile assets. These \u201cvertically integrated\u201d franchises would be awarded for terms of 20 to 30 years, to encourage franchisees to take a longer-term view of their businesses, and the financial terms would be subject to periodic review and adjustment, to address the problems that have arisen with the east coast franchise.

    "webTitle": "ECB to end QE in December, but keep rates at record lows - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has shrugged off evidence of a slowdown in the eurozone and announced that it will phase out the stimulus provided by its massive three-year bond-buying programme to the eurozone economy by the end of the year, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes. Despite warning that the single currency area was going through a soft patch at a time when protectionist risks were rising, the ECB said it would wind down its bond purchases over the next six months. The ECB is currently boosting the euro zone money supply by buying \u20ac30bn of assets each month, but this will be reduced to \u20ac15bn a month after September and ended completely at the end of the year. The move follows strong pressure from some eurozone countries, led by Germany, that were uncomfortable about the more than \u20ac2.4tn of assets accumulated by the ECB since it launched its quantitative easing programme at the start of 2015. Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s president, said at the end of a meeting of the bank\u2019s governing council in Latvia, that the QE programme had succeeded in its aim of putting inflation on course to meet its target of being below but close to 2%. Eurozone activity has accelerated markedly over the past three years, with some estimates suggesting that QE contributed 0.75 percentage points a year to the average 2.25% annual growth rate. The ECB\u2019s statement reflected the battle between hawks and doves on the bank\u2019s council, with the decision on QE matched by a softening of its approach to interest rates. Draghi said there would be no prospect of an increase in the ECB\u2019s key lending rate \u2013 currently 0.0% \u2013 until next summer at the earliest. More here... That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Europe\u2019s stock markets have surged today, as traders take the ECB\u2019s decision to end QE in their stride. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped 62 points to 7765, a gain of 0.8%. There are headier gains across Europe, as the sliding euro boosts exporters. David Madden of CMC Markets says Draghi\u2019s pledge not to raise interest rates before next summer, at the earliest, cheered markets. European stocks have soared as it appears the European Central Bank (ECB) won\u2019t be hiking interest rates until at least the back end of 2019. Mario Draghi, the ECB chief, confirmed the stimulus package would be wound down in 2018, and we could see a taper of the bond buying scheme in the final quarter of this year. The update was far more dovish than some traders were expecting, and the euro sold off heavily on the back of it. The slide in the single currency prompted buying of eurozone equities. Mike Ingram, chief market strategist at WHIreland, agrees that Mario Draghi was more dovish than expected today. The pledge not to raise interest rates for at least a year has caught traders unawares. It has trumped the decision to end the bond-buying stimulus programme in December - which is why the euro has fallen, not risen, today. Ingram explains: The ECB has (conditionally) pre-committed to keeping interest rates at their current, extraordinarily low levels until at least the summer of 2019 and in any event \u2018as long as necessary\u2019. This sort of language was not expected from the ECB until the end of the 2018 and was the most biggest dovish surprise for markets. Up until this point, markets had been expecting about a 40% change on an ECB rate hike in a year\u2019s time. Elsewhere in the markets, some extremely strong US retail spending figures have cheered investors. US retail sales jumped by 0.8% in May, new data shows, and were up 5.9% over the past 12 months. That suggests US consumers are confident, and spending accordingly. And it means the US economy could be running faster than thought - perhaps at a sizzling annual rate of over 4%. This has driven the US dollar higher, and helped to pull the euro and pound down. It\u2019s official: Greece has just unlocked the next \u20ac1bn of its bailout programme, having satisfied its lenders that its meeting its targets. Over in Athens MPs have just approved the last multi-bill of reforms the country will have to take before its bailout expires this summer. It means fresh austerity and economic reforms for Greece, as our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Final results saw 154 deputies vote in favour of the draft bill \u2013 which foresees more pension cuts, labour market regulations, health care measures and sell-offs in the energy sector \u2013 and 144 against. The ballot took place in an atmosphere of growing political drama in Athens following the decision of the main opposition conservative party to call a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government over its handling of the Macedonia name row, and an accord unveiled earlier this week, that will see the Slavic state being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia. Addressing parliament, Tsipras said he welcomed the motion. Here\u2019s Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, on the ECB\u2019s announcement and press conference: \u201cMr Draghi acknowledged that risks from an increase in protectionism and financial market volatility had become more prominent, but maintained a relatively positive view of the outlook, brushing off signs of softer economic growth in the euro zone that prompted quite a sizeable a downward revision to the ECB\u2019s forecast for 2018, to 2.1% from 2.4% previously. However higher oil prices and rising domestic cost pressures meant that the bank\u2019s forecasts for inflation went up to 1.7% in both 2018 and 2019, from 1.4% previously. Against this backdrop the ECB felt ready to announce moves towards a less accommodative policy stance, albeit not an overtly hawkish one. Principal payments from maturing securities under the asset purchase programme will continue to be reinvested, and the forward guidance on interest rates demonstrates that the bank is planning to keep policy loose for some time. Mr Draghi added that the ECB stands ready to adjust all of its instruments if necessary. We had expected the ECB\u2019s net monthly asset purchases to be reduced in the final months of 2018 and now expect a first move towards policy normalisation in 2019, with an increase in the deposit rate, and a rise in the main refinancing rate in early 2020. The next rate hike will probably be delivered by the successor to Mr Draghi, whose term ends in October 2019.\u201d Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea Markets, predicts that the ECB won\u2019t raise interest rates until the end of next year: Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital, says today\u2019s meeting had something for hawks and doves. \u201cDespite political turmoil in the Eurozone\u2019s periphery and a recent soft patch of economic results, the ECB has set the stage for an end of QE later this year. Indeed, for the hawks, the ECB announced that it will taper the pace of monthly asset purchases after September (from \u20ac30bn/month to \u20ac15bn/month) and then end the purchase program in December. \u201cHowever, for the doves \u2013 the ECB tempered this stance somewhat by reiterating its pledge that interest rates will remain unchanged until the back-half of 2019 (\u201cat least through the summer of 2019\u201d) \u2013 which is slightly longer than markets were expecting.\u201d And finally, Draghi denies that the ECB plotted against the new Italian government by stopping buying its bonds last month. There\u2019s not conspiracy here, he insists. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: What impact will the US tariffs, and worries about a trade war, have on the Eurozone? Draghi says that the ECB\u2019s latest economic forecasts do not include the effects of trade measures that have not been implemented yet. They only include measures that have already been imposed, and the impact of these is pretty limited. Draghi then warns that trade discussions must take place within the \u201cexisting multilateral framework\u201d. That is as important as the nature of the measure under discussion, Draghi says sternly. Otherwise, great damage could be caused if the multilateral framework created after the end of the second world war, and has helped create prosperity since, is undermined, he concludes. Mario Draghi is declining to give more details about when eurozone interest rates might rise from their record lows. It all depends when we achieve the necessary convergence, he says, adding tersely: \u201cIf \u2018through the summer\u2019 meant September [2019], we would have said September\u201d Q: When might savers in the eurozone get some help from the ECB with an interest rate rise? Draghi hits back, saying that savers benefit from the eurozone recovery - which more than makes up from the impact of low interest rates. The balance is vastly positive, he insists. Draghi famously declared in 2012 that he would do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to save the euro. He hasn\u2019t lost that belief today, as he tells reporters that the euro is \u2018irreversible\u2019. He points out that 340 million people live in the eurozone, and more countries want to join. Mario Draghi plays down the prospect that Italy creates a new eurozone crisis. He says there was little \u201ccontagion\u201d from Italy, and little \u201credenomination risk\u201d (ie, that Italy leaves the euro and returns to the lira) Draghi also plays down the political drama that unfolded in Rome this year: We have 19 countries, we are bound to have 19 elections every now and then. The important thing is that political changes are discussed within the current eurozone treaties, Draghi says. Draghi says there has been much sacrifice and struggle in the eurozone, so it is important that the achievements achieved in recent years is not destroyed. A reporter (rightly) ignores the warning not to ask about the allegations that Latvia\u2019s central bank chief Ilmars Rimsevics has sought bribes. Draghi refuses to comment about the case, but insists the ECB is not taking any sides. Our mantra is to be patient, prudent, and persistent, declares Draghi. He reveals that today\u2019s decisions were unanimous. The euro is falling more sharply as traders listen to Mario Draghi explain today\u2019s decision. It\u2019s now down a whole cent against the US dollar, at $1.169. The fall accelerated as Draghi warned about rising economic uncertainty, and reiterated that the ECB was in no rush to raise interest rates. A weak currency will not worry the ECB though -- it should help exporters, and keep inflation rising towards their target. Q: Why does the ECB think risks are broadly balanced? Where do you see upside risks? Draghi says there is undeniably an increased risk in global political uncertainty [a downside risk]. But on growth, Draghi predicts \u201cpositive surprises\u201d from the fiscal expansion in the United States, and - in the medium term - in the eurozone. Onto questions (after a warning to reporters not to mention the corruption allegations against Latvia\u2019s central bank governor - who isn\u2019t allowed into today\u2019s press conference). Q: Do you expect to raise interest rates before you leave the ECB in October 2019? Draghi says the ECB governing council didn\u2019t discuss when they might raise interest rates, and then adds that economic uncertainty is rising. He points out that eurozone growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, down from 0.7% in the last quarter of 2017. Draghi ends his statement by calling on eurozone politicians to up their game. Draghi says the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be \u201csubstantially stepped up\u201d to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. He also calls for eurozone countries to rebuild their \u201cfiscal buffers\u201d, and appears to single out Italy, saying: This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. That looks like a warning shot to the new Italian government not to boost government spending and cut taxes. The ECB has also hiked its forecast for inflation this year and in 2019. It now expects the price of living to rise by 1.7% per year, up from 1.4% previously. That\u2019s due to the higher oil price. That\u2019s bad news for households (although the ECB will see it as a success, as it is aiming for inflation close to 2%). Boom! The ECB has cut its forecast for growth this year. It now expects eurozone GDP to increase by 2.1% this year, down from 2.4% back in March. President Draghi says that global risks have risen in recent months, and points to rising protectionism -- a clear nudge towards Donald Trump who has imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminium makers. Growth in the eurozone economy is solid, and broad-based, Mario Draghi says. But growth had moderated due to temporary factors, he adds, such as weaker trade with the rest of the world. We stand ready to adjust all our instruments as appropriate to ensure that we meet our inflation goals, Draghi continues. That\u2019s a reminder that today\u2019s decisions aren\u2019t set in stone - the ECB can change policy whenever it deems it appropriate. Mario Draghi begins by saying that the governing council undertook a careful assessment of the progress of its asset-purchase scheme, and of the inflation situation. The governing council concluded that there has been \u201csubstantial\u201d progress towards a sustained adjustment of inflation towards the ECB\u2019s target (of just below 2%). He confirms what we already know - that the ECB will maintain its asset purchase scheme at \u20ac30bn per month until September, then drop to \u20ac15bn until December, and then stop. Draghi also confirms that interest rates have been left unchanged at their record lows, and will remain there until \u201cat least the summer of 2019\u201d. The ECB president declares: Today\u2019s monetary policy decisions maintain the current ample degree of monetary accommodation that will ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. ECB president Mario Draghi has arrived at his press conference in Riga, to explain today\u2019s decisions. Some history: The ECB launched its QE programme back in early 2015, as policymakers tried to fight off the threat of deflation and persistently weak growth. It began by buying \u20ac60bn of eurozone bonds each month -- despite opposition from some countries, such as Germany, who worried that the ECB could be monetising eurozone debt. The ECB was late to the QE party - the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve both moved much faster. But it made up for lost time by raising its bond-buying to \u20ac80bn per month, and extending the programme until this autumn. Having originally planned to buy \u20ac1 trillion of bonds, the ECB has ended up expanding its balance sheet by over \u20ac2.6 trillion. QE has been criticised for making the wealthy wealthier (as it pushes up asset prices). Central bankers, though, argue that it keeps unemployment down - and that politicians should address the \u2018distributional consequences\u2019 of their actions (perhaps through a wealth tax). So, has QE worked? Well, inflation has finally moved close to the ECB\u2019s target and unemployment is at a 10-year low. That looks like success. Swiss bank UBS argued last week that QE actually saved the eurozone, by giving it a growth jolt at a vital time. But you could argue that policies such as QE have also fed into the rise of populist parties, and helped European politicians to put off trick decisions about eurozone integration. Historians will give their verdict eventually.... Here\u2019s Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, on the ECB\u2019s decision: \u201cThe ECB takes the plunge and announces a three months taper to finish QE at the end of December (\u20ac15bn per month in Oct, Nov. Dec). The reinvestments commitment stays in place. And in terms of interest rates they will remain on hold until \u201cat least through the summer of 2019\u201d. So the ECB is sending a signal that rates are to remain on hold for 6-9 months after QE finishes. Draghi\u2019s last Press Conference and Q&amp;A is on 24 October 2019 (he leaves the ECB at the end of October 2019) \u2013 so the focus will now be on whether he can raise rates before he departs.\u201d Remember: Mario Draghi will explain today\u2019s decision in around 20 minutes. Stay tuned! Today\u2019s decision is something of a surprise. Many economists had expected the ECB would delay a final decision on its QE programme until its July meeting. But instead, Mario Draghi and colleagues have bitten the bullet and decided to stop buying eurozone government bonds with newly created money. The governing council was split between hawkish members who argued that QE had run its course, and doves who worried at the eurozone economy wasn\u2019t strong enough to cope without stimulus. Carsten Brzeski says the council have reached a wise compromise: You might have expected the euro to rally, on the back of the ECB\u2019s historic decision to end its huge bond-buying programme. But instead, the single currency is dropping sharply - probably because the ECB has also promised not to raise interest rates for some time. The euro is now down 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.173. In another important move, the ECB has also pledged to keep interest rates unchanged until at least the middle of next year. That means the headline cost of borrowing will probably remain at zero for many months to come. Banks will continue to be charged a negative interest rate of -0.4%, in an attempt to get them lending. The ECB says: The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with the current expectations of a sustained adjustment path. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has decided to end its bond-buying stimulus programme! The ECB has decided to halve the pace of its QE programme after September to just \u20ac15bn per month, from \u20ac30bn per month at present. And then it will stop buying new bonds altogether at December. That\u2019s a significant move; the ECB has decided that it can finally take away the punch bowl of easy money and ultra-loose monetary policy. The ECB says: At today\u2019s meeting, which was held in Riga, the Governing Council of the ECB undertook a careful review of the progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, also taking into account the latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, measures of price and wage pressures, and uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook. Based on this review the Governing Council made the following decisions: As regards non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion until the end of September 2018. The Governing Council anticipates that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council\u2019s medium-term inflation outlook, the monthly pace of the net asset purchases will be reduced to \u20ac15 billion until the end of December 2018 and that net purchases will then end. More to follow! Today\u2019s meeting is in Riga, as part of the ECB\u2019s policy of taking the governing council around the eurozone. But it\u2019s not great timing, as Latvia\u2019s central bank governor instead fighting corruption allegations and is barred by national authorities from even entering the central bank #awkward Tension is mounting in the markets as we await the European Central Bank\u2019s decision on monetary policy, in under 25 minutes time. As explained earlier, traders are desperate to know whether the ECB has taken a decision on its bond-buying stimulus programme, which is due to expire in September. The meeting comes at a fascinating time. There\u2019s a new populist government getting to work in Italy, trade war tensions growing among G7 members, and some signs that the eurozone economy has entered a softer patch just as inflation picks up. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, says the ECB has a lot on its plate. \u201cUsually hints on policy come from anonymous \u2018ECB sources\u2019 but last week\u2019s decision by the chief economist, Peter Praet, to go on manoeuvres and make statements about the QE programme could represent a major shift. It looks like the bank is prepared to discuss moving towards an end date for its QE programme, even if that end-date is still further away than many expect. \u201cTo give the ECB its due, it does look like the eurozone recovery is firmly in place. As we discussed here, the eurozone economy is still seeing increased strength, with unemployment falling overall and consumer spending rising, and even recent weakness in the composite PMI is not necessarily a cause for concern given the overall strength of the past year. \u201cInflation has also begun to pick up, with CPI rising to 1.9% for May, close to the bank\u2019s 2% target. Sustained price growth above this level has yet to be seen, but the overall trend is still higher from the lows of early 2016. There\u2019s more political drama in Greece; the opposition has called a no-confidence vote! It\u2019s related to the \u201cMacedonia issue\u201d. Earlier this week, the tiny Balkan state agreed to rename itself as the \u201cRepublic of North Macedonia\u201d following negotiations with Greece (whose territory includes the province of Macedonia). Macedonia\u2019s president then pulled the plug on the deal, arguing that too many concessions had been made to Greece. But the Greek opposition also criticised the deal, given the importance of Macedonia (Alexander the Great and all that) in its history. Back in the eurozone, Greek MPs are preparing to vote today on the last omnibus bill of reforms-for-rescue funds the debt-stricken country must take before its current bailout ends. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After being the focus of parliamentary debate for much of the week, the multi-bill will be voted on this afternoon. This will be the last time MPs are called to pass deeply unpopular reforms, or \u2018prior actions,\u2019 demanded of Athens if it is to successfully complete its last inspection review in time to exit the country\u2019s third bailout in August. It\u2019s taken the best part of a decade but never again will they have to vote on pension cuts, labour market reforms and energy sector privatisations \u2013 all outlined in the bill \u2013 to secure the funds needed to keep Greece afloat. Unions are NOT missing the chance to take to the streets in protest with a barrage of strikes being announced to coincide with the vote. Public sector workers have already begun amassing for a march on parliament. The leftist-led government, however , is keen to rush through the legislation so that euro area finance ministers can begin discussing debt relief at their next meeting on June 21st. Addressing MPs, the country\u2019s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos insisted Greece would not be needing further aid in the form of a precautionary credit line when the foreign funds officially expire. The governor of the Bank of Greece, Yannis Stournaras, has openly opposed that view saying a credit line \u201ceven if never used\u201d is essential to the country\u2019s post-bailout return to normality. \u201cThere will not be a precautionary credit line so that you can call it a fourth memorandum,\u201d Tsakalotos told opposition MPs earlier this week using the official term used to describe Greece\u2019s bailout programs. \u201cWhat there will be is a system of enhanced surveillance without preconditions, without money and without other measures.\u201d Here\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott on the recovery in UK retail sales last month: Better weather brought some much-needed respite to Britain\u2019s struggling retail sector last month as the hottest May on record brought consumers flocking back to the high street. The volume of goods sold in shops and online was 1.3% up on April \u2013 comfortably beating predictions in the financial markets of a 0.5% increase. The Office for National Statistics said feedback from retailers suggested that a hot, dry spell and royal wedding celebrations boosted spending in supermarkets and household goods stores during the month. Annual growth in retail sales picked up sharply from 1.4% to 1.9%, although the ONS said that was partly due to a weak month for consumer spending in May 2017. In the three months to May \u2013 a better guide to the trend than one month\u2019s data \u2013 retail sales volumes rose by 0.9%. The latest three-month period includes both the weakness caused by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d cold snap and the more recent bounce back in consumer spending. Samuel Tombs, of PantheonMacro, said \u201cThe jump in retail sales in May has all the hallmarks of a weather-related blip, rather than a sustainable pick-up in spending. Overall growth was boosted by sharp increases in sales of clothing, sporting goods and garden items, up 1.7%, 3.3% and 6.2% month-to-month, respectively. The CBI\u2019s chief economist, Alpesh Paleja, is also worried about the underlying trends in UK retail: Jacob Nell, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief UK economist, cautions that \u201cidiosyncratic factors\u201d - including sunny weather and the Royal Wedding - flattered UK retail sales last month. But still, the growth was broad-based: The jump in retail sales last month is encouraging, but it won\u2019t get Britain\u2019s high street out of trouble. So argues Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, who points to the relentless advance of internet shopping: Despite today\u2019s positive report from the ONS, news from individual companies continues to paint a somewhat gloomy picture for the UK\u2019s bricks-and-mortar retailers. House of Fraser and Poundworld are the latest names to run into trouble. With the most recent set of numbers from online fashion retailer boohoo.com showing a 49% jump in UK sales, it\u2019s not difficult to work out where those high street customers have been going. Ted Baker\u2019s results earlier this week were notable for showing some positive growth, but even that was driven by a 33.6% increase in online sales. However, a good result from the UK wholesale business suggests that Ted\u2019s higher price point and quirky style are helping to insulate it from the worst of the downturn. That supports our belief that the names that survive the current turbulence will be those that treat high street shopping as a pastime rather than an essential. Just as the days of nipping out to the local bakers every morning is a thing of the past, so too is a trip to M&amp;S for a white shirt and packet of socks \u2013 the artisanal shop looks like the future of the high street. Ian Gilmartin, head of retail &amp; wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, is encouraged by the jump in retail sales: \u201cRecord breaking temperatures in May had shoppers running to the tills to stock up on food and drink, with DIY and garden stores also receiving a boost from the warm weather. The really encouraging aspect to today\u2019s figures is the breadth of positive data, with growth posted across the different parts of the retail sector. We shouldn\u2019t get carried away as it\u2019s still very tough out there, but the truth is that despite continued rumours of the demise of our retail industry, many retailers are simply getting on with the job and continuing to attract customers through their doors. Football fever could give retailers another lift, he adds: Of course, we\u2019re not going to have a heatwave and a Royal Wedding to help drive sales every month, but the World Cup kick off should help supermarkets in particular maintain this momentum over the next month or so.\u201d The recent pick-up in UK wages may also be driving retail sales higher, suggests Chris Williamson of Markit. The unexpectedly strong UK retail sales figures have sent the pound sharply higher. Sterling is up 0.5% at $1.344, as traders predict that an August interest rate hike is more likely. More on the Meghan and Harry effect from the ONS: Food stores provided a positive contribution to growth with supermarkets commenting on good sales in celebration of the Royal Wedding during good weather. Newsflash: UK retail sales were stronger than expected in May, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. Sales volumes jumped by 1.3% compared to April, smashing forecasts of a 0.3% rise. On an annual basis, the amount sold by retailers jumped by 3.9%, with growth across the board: The ONS says there are two factors - good weather in May, and the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle (now the Duchess of Sussex). This encouraged spending on food (all those Royal Wedding BBQs?) and on household goods. Retail sales had been suppressed by the bad weather earlier in the year, when ice and snow kept shoppers off the streets. Things seem to be improving now, though, with sales rising in line with temperatures: Today\u2019s ECB meeting is the first since Italy\u2019s new coalition government was sworn in, and began announcing policies that could breach Europe\u2019s budget rules. A clash is brewing between Brussels and Rome, even though Italy\u2019s new finance minister has insisted the country is committed to the euro. The ECB is often accused of being too political -- Mario Draghi regularly chides elected politicians to implement structural reforms. But on this occasion, the governing council may be keen to take its big decisions on QE before a crisis blows up. Bank of America Merrill Lynch say: \u201cWe believe the ECB may be in a hurry to close the QE chapter,\u201d \u201cWe think this is essentially political, as the ECB would not want its monetary policy to be affected by claims of supporting or conversely impairing the new policy course in Italy.\u201d Economists and investors are split over whether the European Central Bank will make a decision about its stimulus programme today, or kick the can down the road to July\u2019s mereting. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada predicts the ECB will have an \u201cactive debate\u201d about whether to let its QE programme expire in September. However, she doesn\u2019t expect the final decision until July\u2019s meeting, adding: The other point of focus should be the updated staff forecasts, and in particular the 2020 inflation forecast (currently at 1.7%). We look for an upward revision, which would be positive for the euro \u2013 though unclear whether that will be enough given yesterday\u2019s rally. The first hike is currently priced for June 2019 but with the deposit rate [on bank deposits at the ECB] at -0.4%, there is a long way to go to get to neutral. Draghi will almost certainly be grilled on the Italian situation in the Q&amp;A but we doubt that he will let himself be drawn in. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management suggests we shouldn\u2019t expect a major announcement from the ECB today: ECB President Draghi\u2019s extensive rehabilitation to overcome an addiction to easing seems to have paid off. There are hopes of either 1) an announcement of the timetable to end bond buying, or 2) an announcement of an announcement of the timetable to end bond buying. Marchel Alexandrovich, senior european economist at Jefferies, says investors want to know more than just the end-date of QE: After more than three years of QE, and against the background of what Peter Praet judges to be improving inflation dynamics, the ECB is preparing to end its net asset purchases. Whether the formal announcement comes this week, or in July (our guess), and what profile the taper will take (a straight 3 months drawdown to zero, or something more creative) are the immediate questions. But at this point in the process, a few months and a few extra billion in purchases either way are not crucial; the markets are more focused on how the ECB amends its interest rate guidance, any technical changes around bond reinvestments and whether Draghi delivers a relatively dovish taper by leaving the door open to the possibility of restarting the programme if the recovery were to splutter. European stock markets are in the red this morning, as central banks hog the headlines. The FTSE 100 dropped nearly 50 points at the open (-0.6%) and there are similar losses in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid: This follows a down day on Wall Street, where the Dow lost 119 points to 25,201 points last night. Traders are worried that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates too aggressively over the next 18 months. The Fed is now forecasting four hikes in 2018 (we\u2019ve had two already) and three in 2019. That would take borrowing costs up to 3.25%. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, explains: As Fed chairman Jerome Powell acknowledges, the risk remains that officials overcook it and bring an end to the Trump trade once and for all. Achieving the \u2018not too fast, not too slow\u2019 Goldilocks approach to monetary policy will be key to extending the equities bull run. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on Riga as the European Central Bank weighs up whether to pull the plug on its stimulus programme, despite signs that the eurozone recovery is slowing. The ECB governing council faces a tricky decision as it holds its monetary policy meeting in Latvia today. Its huge bond-buying stimulus programme runs out in September, so policymakers must decide whether to call time - or extend the scheme into 2019. The ECB has bought more than \u20ac2.5 trillion bonds under its quantitative easing (QE) programme, in an attempt to fight off deflation. It\u2019s currently committed to buying \u20ac30bn per month until September. Hawks on the council believe the scheme has run its course, and would like to pull the plug. But, with growth slowing in the eurozone - particularly in Germany - and geopolitical tensions growing, the ECB may be reluctant to turn off the QE tap. A decision could be delayed until July\u2019s meeting, but at the very least the governing council must discuss the issue today. They must tread cautiously, or risk spooking the markets and triggering a sell-off. Traders will be keen to hear Mario Draghi\u2019s views at the press conference following the decision. President Draghi should expect questions on trade war fears, and the new government in Italy. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, explains: The stakes are high for the ECB President, and for many people he has to send a message that the European central bank is planning to end its asset purchases\u2019 program and the date to start that has to be September. There has been a lot of chatter leading up to this meeting and if, for whatever reason, Draghi fails to deliver what investors expect then the euro will be in trouble. The ECB will also release its latest growth and inflation projections, which will help determine what they do today. Whatever the ECB decides, they are lagging far behind their counterparts across the Atlantic. Last night the US Federal Reserve vote to raise American interest rates to 2%, and signalled that it expects two more hikes this year. Fed chair Jerome Powell insisted that America\u2019s economy can handle higher borrowing costs, declaring: \u201cThe decision you see today is another sign the US economy is in great shape. \u201cGrowth is strong, labour markets are strong, inflation is close to target.\u201d Also coming up It\u2019s been a tough few months for UK retailers, with tens of thousands of job cuts and several chains shutting down. So the latest UK retail sales figures, due this morning, could be interesting. Economists predict growth slowed to 0.3% in May, down from 1.3% in April Plus, it\u2019s a bad day for Rolls-Royce workers as the engineering firm announces thousand of job cuts.

However higher oil prices and rising domestic cost pressures meant that the bank\u2019s forecasts for inflation went up to 1.7% in both 2018 and 2019, from 1.4% previously.</p> <p>Against this backdrop the ECB felt ready to announce moves towards a less accommodative policy stance, albeit not an overtly hawkish one. Principal payments from maturing securities under the asset purchase programme will continue to be reinvested, and the forward guidance on interest rates demonstrates that the bank is planning to keep policy loose for some time. Mr Draghi added that the ECB stands ready to adjust all of its instruments if necessary.</p> <p>We had expected the ECB\u2019s net monthly asset purchases to be reduced in the final months of 2018 and now expect a first move towards policy normalisation in 2019, with an increase in the deposit rate, and a rise in the main refinancing rate in early 2020.

The ECB is currently boosting the eurozone money supply by buying \u20ac30bn of assets each month, but this will be reduced to \u20ac15bn a month after September and ended completely at the end of 2018. The move follows strong pressure from some eurozone countries, led by Germany, that were uncomfortable about the more than \u20ac2.4tn of assets accumulated by the ECB since it launched its quantitative easing programme at the start of 2015. Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s president, said at the end of a meeting of the bank\u2019s governing council in Latvia that the QE programme had succeeded in its aim of putting inflation on course to meet its target of being below but close to 2%. Eurozone activity has accelerated markedly over the past three years, with some estimates suggesting that QE contributed 0.75 percentage points a year to the average 2.25% annual growth rate. The ECB\u2019s statement reflected the battle between hawks and doves on the bank\u2019s council, with the decision on QE matched by a softening of its approach to interest rates. Draghi said there would be no prospect of an increase in the ECB\u2019s key lending rate \u2013 currently 0.0% \u2013 until next summer at the earliest. \u201cWe decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged and we expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path,\u201d Draghi said. The euro lost more than a cent against the dollar after the news, with dealers contrasting the decision to leave rates unchanged in the eurozone for at least a year with signs from the Federal Reserve that it planned two further increases in US rates in 2018 and three more in 2019. Danielle Haralambous, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cDraghi acknowledged that risks from an increase in protectionism and financial market volatility had become more prominent, but maintained a relatively positive view of the outlook, brushing off signs of softer economic growth in the eurozone that prompted quite a sizeable a downward revision to the ECB\u2019s forecast for 2018, to 2.1% from 2.4% previously. \u201cHowever, higher oil prices and rising domestic cost pressures meant that the bank\u2019s forecasts for inflation went up to 1.7% in both 2018 and 2019, from 1.4% previously.\u201d Draghi said there was little risk of Italy leaving the eurozone and that tension had abated over the past fortnight. Dean Turner, a UK economist at UBS Wealth Management, said: \u201cToday\u2019s meeting came at a challenging time for the ECB, considering the political turbulence in Italy and the string of soft data coming out of the eurozone in recent months. Yet it seems that the ECB has decided to look through some of the short-term concerns. \u201cWith the ECB signalling that interest rates are unlikely to budge until the autumn of next year, investors\u2019 immediate focus seems to be on this forward guidance for interest rates, rather than the end of QE, which is reflected in the sharp drop in the euro.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The European commission has said the \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d imposition of high tariffs by the US on Spanish olives is already having a major effect on producers in southern Spain. This week the US Department of Commerce announced that tariffs ranging from 7.52% to 27.02% would be needed to counteract Spanish olive prices, arguing that the fruits were being sold for 16.88% to 25.5% less than their real value. On Wednesday, a commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels that the preliminary duties were already hitting producers in Andalusia, where olive production \u201chas a very significant economic and social impact\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are also well aware of the possible wider implications of this process and that is why the commission got involved so actively in these proceedings and will continue to do so.\u201d The US has said its move covers Spanish olives of all colours, shapes, size, pitted and non-pitted, whole, sliced, minced, wedged or broken. Exports to the US were worth \u00a350.3m in 2017. Exports of black olives to the US fell 42.4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2017, dropping from 6.9m kgs to 4m kgs, according to Spain\u2019s association of table olive producers and exporters (Asemesa). \u201cThe decision by the US Department of Commerce to impose unreasonably high and prohibitive anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties on Spanish olives is simply unacceptable,\u201d said the commission spokesman. \u201cThis is a protectionist measure targeting a high-quality and successful EU product popular with US consumers.\u201d Spain\u2019s agriculture minister, Luis Planas, called the tariffs unjust and said he would raise the matter at a meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Luxembourg on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfair measure because it has no economic or technical basis and it\u2019s worrying as it could call into question the rules governing international trade,\u201d Planas said on Wednesday. He said the tariffs not only affected Spanish producers but could also challenge the common agricultural policy (CAP). \u201cA unilateral action of this nature cannot go unanswered,\u201d said Planas, adding that Spain\u2019s trade, industry and tourism minister would also be raising the issue with the EU trade commission. Antonio de Mora, the secretary general of Asemesa, recently called on the EU commission to \u201cdefend the sector on the political stage as forcefully as it has defended steel and aluminium\u201d, saying CAP rules were at stake. He added: \u201cThis precedent could mean that any agricultural sector in any country that competes with EU products that receive CAP assistance could ask its government to act like the US is.\u201d The issue of US tariffs has been a cause of concern in Brussels for months, with the commissioners for both trade and agriculture, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m and Phil Hogan, working behind the scenes to protect the Spanish industry. Brussels claims that Spain\u2019s support for producers is consistent with World Trade Organisation rules because they do not target a single industry or product. The final US decision on the imposition of the tariffs is expected to be made on 24 July.",

    "webTitle": "Fall in UK rail passenger numbers casts doubt on viability of franchises", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rail passenger numbers in the UK fell last year to 1.7bn in the biggest decrease since privatisation in the 1990s, casting fresh doubt on the viability of struggling franchises. According to figures published by the Office of Rail and Road, usage fell by 1.4% in the 2017-18 financial year, the first annual fall since 2009-10 and the biggest since 1993-4. Season ticket sales have plummeted 9.2%, suggesting commuters no longer place the same faith in the rail network, when fares have risen inexorably while services are beset by strikes and overcrowding. Fares rose by 2.3% in 2017 and another 3.4%, the highest in five years, in January, which meant overall revenue has continued to grow for operators \u2013 although by just 2.3%, the industry\u2019s lowest since 2000-01. The decline in train usage has been pronounced in the first three months of 2018, with 9m fewer journeys from January through to March this year than in the same period in 2017. South Western Railway showed its lowest ever recorded figure for the period, a 7% fall from last year, partly ascribed to industrial action and the adverse weather in February, when the so-called beast from the east swept through Britain. The numbers could spell more grim news for the struggling First Group, which admitted last month that it would lose \u00a3106m on its TransPennine Express franchise due to stagnating passenger numbers. It won the South Western franchise last year with a \u00a32.6bn bid that ex-boss Tim O\u2019Toole said was \u201cdisciplined\u201d, with clauses that reduced its risk should the UK and regional economy hit the buffers after Brexit. Last month First parted company with O\u2019Toole, but said South Western remained profitable despite \u201cchallenges\u201d. However, operators usually pledge higher payments to government in the later years of the franchise. A spokesman for First said it had won the franchise with a focus on quality, with new trains and more capacity to come, and its bid had not been the highest in cash terms. Concerns over franchising are high, with Virgin Trains East Coast due to cease operating on 23 June after its owners Stagecoach and Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group were unable to meet their promised \u00a33.3bn payments with passenger numbers below forecasts. The East Coast franchise will be taken back into public sector operation, and the latest figures will increase speculation that more franchises could fail. Questions have been raised by MPs over whether Abellio overbid for Greater Anglia, which suffered a further 2% decline in passengers last quarter, or Arriva for Northern, where customer numbers fell 9% in a strike-hit period. An industry source said: \u201cThere were four or five franchise agreements which relied on massive growth rates \u2026 instead of which we are seeing them in decline. There is a structural problem here which could dwarf the timetabling issues, because it is more widespread.\u201d Labour said passengers were being priced off the railway. The sshadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cWith fares rising three times faster than average wages since 2010 and severe disruption across the network, it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019re seeing the biggest drop in passenger numbers in 25 years. \u201cThis not only worsens congestion and air pollution and contributes to climate change, it also threatens the sustainability of the railways [and] increases the likelihood of further bailouts, bankrolled by the taxpayer.\u201d The rail industry insisted that the drop was a blip. Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said: \u201cThere are over 1.7bn rail journeys made every year and despite some slowing down, this growth isn\u2019t expected to hit the brakes in the long term. \u201cWhile technology may mean fewer people are travelling into work every day, anyone taking the train into our major cities will know that investment to run more trains is essential.\u201d",

South Western Railway showed its lowest ever recorded figure for the period, a 7% fall from last year, partly ascribed to industrial action and the adverse weather in February, when the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2018/feb/27/the-beast-from-the-east-hits-the-uk-in-pictures\">beast from the east</a> swept through Britain.</p> <p>The numbers could spell more grim news for the struggling First Group, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/firstgroup-dumps-chief-executive-as-firm-reports-326m-loss\">admitted last month that it would lose \u00a3106m</a> on its TransPennine Express franchise due to stagnating passenger numbers. It won the South Western franchise last year with a \u00a32.6bn bid that ex-boss Tim O\u2019Toole said was \u201cdisciplined\u201d, with clauses that reduced its risk should the UK and regional economy hit the buffers after Brexit. </p> <p>Last month First parted company with O\u2019Toole, but said South Western remained profitable despite \u201cchallenges\u201d. However, operators usually pledge higher payments to government in the later years of the franchise.</p> <p>A spokesman for First said it had won the franchise with a focus on quality, with new trains and more capacity to come, and its bid had not been the highest in cash terms. </p> <p>Concerns over franchising are high, with Virgin Trains East Coast due to cease operating on 23 June after its owners Stagecoach and Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group were unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/29/east-coast-rail-franchise-terminated-three-years-early-virgin-trains\">meet their promised \u00a33.3bn payments</a> with passenger numbers below forecasts. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/16/east-coast-rail-line-to-be-temporarily-renationalised-virgin-stagecoach\">East Coast franchise</a> will be taken back into public sector operation, and the latest figures will increase speculation that more franchises could fail. Questions have been raised by MPs over whether Abellio overbid for Greater Anglia, which suffered a further 2% decline in passengers last quarter, or Arriva for Northern, where customer numbers fell 9% in a strike-hit period. </p> <p>An industry source said: \u201cThere were four or five franchise agreements which relied on massive growth rates \u2026 instead of which we are seeing them in decline. There is a structural problem here which could dwarf the timetabling issues, because it is more widespread.\u201d</p> <p>Labour said passengers were being priced off the railway. The sshadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cWith fares rising three times faster than average wages since 2010 and severe disruption across the network, it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019re seeing the biggest drop in passenger numbers in 25 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis not only worsens congestion and air pollution and contributes to climate change, it also threatens the sustainability of the railways [and] increases the likelihood of further bailouts, bankrolled by the taxpayer.\u201d<br></p> <p>The rail industry insisted that the drop was a blip. Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said: \u201cThere are over 1.7bn rail journeys made every year and despite some slowing down, this growth isn\u2019t expected to hit the brakes in the long term. </p> <p>\u201cWhile technology may mean fewer people are travelling into work every day, anyone taking the train into our major cities will know that investment to run more trains is essential.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The online fashion retailer N Brown plans to close all 20 of its high street stores in the UK, which trade under the names High &amp; Mighty, Jacamo and Simply Be, with the loss of 270 jobs. It is the latest retailer to shut stores amid difficult conditions on the high street and a long-term shift to online shopping. A spokesman for N Brown said the tough retail climate accelerated the decision, but added the move was part of the firm\u2019s strategy to become a purely online retailer. The shops, which are dotted around the UK, from London to Belfast and Glasgow, contributed \u00a315m, or 2% sales, last year and made a loss of \u00a33m. About 240 people working in the shops are at risk of redundancy, along with 15 head office staff in Manchester and 35 working at the Duke Mill warehouse in Shaw. The news came as N Brown posted 0.4% growth in revenues for the 13 weeks to 2 June. Angela Spindler, the chief executive, said: \u201cThis was a challenging period for fashion retail. In line with our online strategy, and given continued weak high street footfall, we have today commenced a consultation process with colleagues over the future of our small-store estate. This action has not been taken lightly.\u201d Michelle Byrne, area organiser of the shop workers\u2019 union Usdaw, said the move was a \u201creal shock for staff\u201d. She said the union would \u201cinterrogate the business case for the proposed store closures\u201d during the consultation. \u201cOur priority is to save jobs,\u201d she said. N Brown expects the consultation to end by October and said if all 20 stores were closed, there would be a one-off cost of \u00a318m to \u00a322m covering redundancy payments and other costs. Targeting younger shoppers, Jacamo for men and Simply Be for women are among N Brown\u2019s main brands. JD Williams, its biggest brand, caters for over-45s. Sofie Willmott, a senior retail analyst at GobalData, said: \u201cJD Williams is well placed to benefit from clothing spend shifting online as mid-market retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams close stores and consumers look to digital channels for choice and convenience.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Better weather brought some much-needed respite to Britain\u2019s struggling retail sector last month as the hottest May on record brought consumers flocking back to the high street. The volume of goods sold in shops and online was 1.3% up on April \u2013 comfortably beating predictions in the financial markets of a 0.5% increase. The Office for National Statistics said feedback from retailers suggested that a hot, dry spell and royal wedding celebrations boosted spending in supermarkets and household goods stores during the month. \u201cAs we began to experience warmer weather in April, temperatures rose to above average in May, which contrasts with the lower than average temperatures experienced in February and March. This shift to warmer weather may have encouraged consumers to spend later in the year\u201d, the ONS said. Annual growth in retail sales picked up sharply from 1.4% to 1.9%, although the ONS said that was partly due to a weak month for consumer spending in May 2017. Traditional high-street retailers have been facing tough trading conditions, with a structural shift towards online shopping accompanied by a squeeze on real incomes throughout 2017 caused by the fall in the value of the pound following the EU referendum. Recent months have seen earnings grow slightly more quickly than prices, adding to consumer spending power. While retailers are hopeful that the World Cup will underpin spending in June and July, the pick-up has come to late to prevent a spate of retail failures and almost 6000 store closures during 2017. In the three months to May \u2013 a better guide to the trend than one month\u2019s data \u2013 retail sales volumes rose by 0.9%. The latest three-month period includes both the weakness caused by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d cold snap in early March and the more recent bounce back in consumer spending. Samuel Tombs, of PantheonMacro, said: \u201cThe jump in retail sales in May has all the hallmarks of a weather-related blip, rather than a sustainable pick-up in spending. Overall growth was boosted by sharp increases in sales of clothing, sporting goods and garden items, up 1.7%, 3.3% and 6.2% month-to-month, respectively. \u201cAverage temperatures were 1.8 degrees above their 1970-to-2016 May average, persuading households to purchase items that they forewent in February and March when the weather was unusually cold.\u201d Ruth Gregory, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said that even if retail sales were to fall by around 1% in June, they would still rise by 1.8% over the quarter, the largest quarterly gain since early 2016 and a vast improvement on the 0.3% quarterly fall in the the first three months of 2018. \u201cSince retail sales account for around a fifth of GDP this could add as much as 0.4 percentage point to growth in the second quarter relative to the first quarter \u2013 although the boost is unlikely to be quite this large given the evidence of weak spending off the high street.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The EU is raising its target for the amount of energy it consumes from renewable sources, in a deal lauded by the bloc\u2019s climate chief as a hard-won victory for the switch to clean energy. Energy ministers agreed a binding renewable energy target of 32% by 2030, up from the previous goal of 27%, but fell short of the hopes of some countries and green groups for a more ambitious share. The EU council deal caps 18 months of negotiations. It was welcomed by the renewables industry and the trade body for European energy utilities called it: \u201ca well-balanced compromise\u201d. The talks saw the UK call for a target of 30%, below the 32% a newly pro-renewables France wanted and the 35% that new governments in Spain and Italy argued for. Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, EU climate commissioner, said: \u201cThis new ambition will help us meet our Paris agreement goals and will translate into more jobs, lower energy bills for consumers and less energy imports.\u201d He added that the binding nature of the goal would provide certainty to investors. Whether the target will apply to the UK after it leaves the EU will depend on the exit deal reached by London and Brussels. The agreement also includes plans for a 2023 review on whether the target should be bumped even higher. Around 17% of EU energy consumption in 2016 was from renewables, with the UK on about 9%. Green energy advocates argued the existing 2030 target was unambitious because member states were already on track to exceed it. Environmental groups said the increase did not go far enough and were critical of a decision to keep counting biomass as renewable energy. Molly Walsh, renewable energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said: \u201cEU decision-makers have agreed a paltry 32% target for renewable energy that is inadequate for a climate-safe fossil-free future, and shows a failure to grasp a shifting energy landscape, including rapidly falling renewables costs.\u201d However, the group welcomed the deal\u2019s recognition of rights for consumers to produce and sell their own renewable energy, such as from solar panels on rooftops. The agreement now needs to be formally approved by the EU parliament and council in coming months.",

    "webTitle": "Rolls-Royce to cut 3,000 jobs in UK", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has announced it is to cut 4,600 jobs as part of a major shakeup of its business, mainly affecting managerial and administrative roles in the UK. Warren East, the aircraft engine maker\u2019s chief executive, said the UK would bear the brunt with around 3,000 of the job losses, and that he could not rule out compulsory redundancies. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible decision, never easy,\u201d he said, but that the cuts were necessary \u201cif we want to be around for the next 100 years\u201d. The job losses will fall heavily on Derby, the group\u2019s biggest manufacturing base in the UK, which currently has a workforce of 15,700 people. The firm\u2019s HR, finance, and legal departments are also based in Derby. Some corporate and support jobs in Bristol, its second-biggest base in the UK, will also go. While most of the cuts will be in middle management jobs, engineers working on early-stage design will also be laid off as they are not needed at present, the group said. Rolls-Royce said it was still hiring engineers in electrification and digitalisation. Approximately 1,500 of the jobs will be axed by the end of the year. It is the company\u2019s biggest round of redundancies since 2001. Rolls-Royce said the move would simplify the business into three customer-focused units with smaller corporate and support functions and reduce management layers and complexity, including within engineering. At the same time, it is ramping up production and hopes to be making 600 engines for wide-body aircraft a year by 2020, twice as many as five years ago. The company employs 55,000 people worldwide. It has a workforce of 26,000 in the UK, which includes contractors. Britain\u2019s biggest union, Unite, warned Rolls-Royce against cutting \u201ctoo deep and too fast\u201d. Its assistant general secretary for aerospace, Steve Turner, said: \u201cThis announcement will be deeply unsettling for Rolls-Royce workers and their families and could have a dire economic impact on local communities reliant on Rolls-Royce jobs.\u201d East, who took the helm three years ago, expressed frustration at the pace of change at the business, and said: \u201cWe must create a commercial organisation that is as world-leading as our technologies. We need to modernise the way in which we do business.\u201d He said the 33,000 non-manufacturing staff were \u201ctoo many for a business of our size\u201d. This week, Rolls-Royce said it had discovered new problems with its troubled Trent 1000 engines, which power Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner aircraft. More than 30 aircraft have been grounded, and analysts reckon the bill for fixing the problems and paying compensation to airlines could total up to \u00a31bn. The firm said it would stand by a deal made with the unions a year ago that will protect 7,000 engineering jobs in the east Midlands \u2013 Derby, Hucknall and Annesley \u2013 as part of a \u00a3150m investment. Unite said the collective agreement included a guarantee against compulsory redundancies, and that it would be seeking a similar guarantee for its members affected by Thursday\u2019s announcement who were not covered by that agreement. The redundancies and other restructuring costs are expected to reach \u00a3500m, but would save \u00a3400m annually by 2020. In recent years East has reduced the workforce in the loss-making marine division, which is now up for sale, by 2,000 and laid off 800 managers across the group, but because the company has also been hiring, the net number of job cuts was 600. A government spokesman said the government was \u201cin regular contact\u201d with Rolls-Royce on its plans to reduce its back-office and support functions. \u201cThis is clearly an uncertain time for affected employees and their families and Jobcentre Plus Rapid Response stands ready to help people back into employment as soon as possible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to a six-month low in May \u2013 but the new jobs being created in the economy are overwhelmingly part-time in nature. Full-time jobs fell by 20,600 during the month, and part-time jobs rose by 32,600, leaving a net improvement of 12,000 positions, while the monthly hours worked in all jobs decreased, by 1.4%. The overall unemployment rate fell to 5.4%, down from a figure of 5.6% in April. Economists say the figures are disappointing and the improvement in the unemployment rate is not what it seems. They say the unemployment rate declined because the participation rate eroded. In trend terms, which smoothes the volatility in seasonally adjusted figures, the unemployment rate held steady at 5.5%, where it has sat since August 2017. Malcolm Turnbull welcomed the news, saying the fall in the unemployment rate and the small lift in jobs shows the Coalition\u2019s policies are job-creating. \u201cJobs and growth is what we said in 2016 and we\u2019re delivering on it, because we have got the policies that are building a stronger economy,\u201d he said on Thursday. But economists say a closer look at the figures shows the decline in the unemployment rate occurred because the labour force actually declined by 14,800 persons. The \u201clabour force\u201d is defined as the number of persons who are either employed or unemployed but actively looking for work. If an unemployed person stops looking for work altogether, they will drop out of the official \u201clabour force\u201d and the labour force will shrink. The labour force declined in May, in seasonally adjusted terms, from 13,247,700 persons to 13,232,900 persons. That means the participation rate \u2013 which is the \u201clabour force\u201d expressed as a percentage of the working population aged 15 years and over \u2013 also declined, by 0.1 points to 65.5%. The participation rate is now 0.3 points off its January high of 65.8%. Data shows the pace of annual jobs growth has also slowed to 2.5% \u2013the slowest rate since July last year. The \u201cunderemployment rate\u201d (tracking those who are employed but who want more work) has also increased slightly, by 0.1 points to 8.5%, and the underutilisation rate (unemployed persons + underemployed persons) is still sitting at 13.9%. Kate Hickie from Capital Economics said: \u201cOverall, even if the pace of job creation picks up again in the coming months, this excess slack and other structural forces are likely to prevent wage growth from increasing much above its current rate of 2.1% this year. In fact, we suspect it will remain below 2.5% throughout this year and next.\u201d Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe told a business audience in Melbourne this week that the RBA was still trying to figure out why countries such as Australia were not experiencing the traditional increase in wages growth in response to tightening labour markets.",
