      "bodyText": "The latest cost of living figures, released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, reveal that while inflation might be just at the bottom of the Reserve Bank\u2019s target range, the cost of living for most families is rising faster than are wages. With interest rates no longer falling and the cost of petrol rising sharply, in the past 12 months the average working household has seen its standard of living fall. Every three months, in the week after the consumer price index figures are released, the ABS produces its cost of living indices. Whereas CPI aims to paint a picture for the average Australian household, the cost of living figures break households into different types, dependent upon their income. Thus, there are cost of living figures for employee, age pensioner and self-funded retiree households, and for those whose main source of income is from non-age pension government benefits. Not surprisingly, different households on average divide their spending rather differently. Pensioners, for example, spend more of their weekly income on food and health than employee households, but less on alcohol and transport. The average household dependent upon government benefits, however, spends a lot more on tobacco than do all others: So, when the cost of an item \u2013 which a household spends more on than the average included in the CPI figures \u2013 rises by more than average, that household\u2019s cost of living will likely rise by more than overall inflation. In the past quarter the households that have seen the biggest increase in cost of living are employee households and self-funded retirees. But over the past year the biggest increase in burden has been for government beneficiary households and employees. While the CPI rose by 2.1% over the past year, the cost of living for employee households rose by 2.3% while for government beneficiary households it rose by 2.7%: Given that in the 12 months to March private sector wages grew by just 1.9%, unless there has been a very big surge in wages in April, May and June, it means that the standard of living for workers went backwards in the 2017-18 financial year. The reason is not that wages growth is slowing, but that for most households the cost of living is rising faster than it was one or two years ago, and the increase has been most pronounced for employee households: A major reason for the increase in cost of living for government beneficiary households is their general tendency to smoke more than the average household. As I noted last week, the inflation data showed that the increase in tobacco excise was producing an annual inflation figure that was 0.4% points higher than if we excluded alcohol and tobacco. For such households the rise in alcohol and tobacco has contributed to nearly half of the rise in their cost of living since September last year, with the other big driver the cost of transport due to rising petrol prices. But tobacco excise does not explain why the cost of living for employees is now rising faster than inflation \u2013 something that for the most part has not occurred since the end of 2011: The reason goes to the makeup of cost of living compared with inflation. The absence of interest payments in the inflation figures is done because one of the primary reasons for interest rate rises is to slow inflation growth. So if interest payments were included in the CPI figures, you would have the very tool being used to curb inflation actually contributing to its growth. But in our day-to-day lives, mortgage repayments are very much a factor in our cost of living, which is why they are included and the cost of a new house is not. Employee households are more affected by interest payment changes because they are much more likely to be paying off a mortgage, compared with other households. Age pensioners have mostly paid off their mortgages, and those on government benefits are much more likely to be renters. The ABS calculates on average (which includes households both with and without a mortgage) employee households spend 8.2% of their weekly income on mortgage interest charges compared with, for example, just 1.1% by pensioner households: This is of course the tyranny of the average. If you do have a mortgage it is likely you are spending much more than 8.2% (let alone the 1.1% of aged pensioners) of your income to pay it off. But until the ABS starts doing cost of living indices for those with a mortgage and those without, this is the best we can do. And we can see that the period of falling interest rate payments has ended. There have now been six straight quarters where the cost of servicing a mortgage has risen on average for employee households: And if we compare the annual rise in mortgage repayments with the CPI\u2019s housing price measure of \u201cnew dwelling purchases by owner occupiers\u201d we can see why, unlike for the past five years, the cost of living for employee households is now rising faster than inflation: The inflation figures are always a bit of an exercise in trying to provide an average that in the end reflects no one. The cost of living indices try to better portray the reality for different households across Australia. But even here we can see that the average hides the true impact. Households with a mortgage are certainly seeing their cost of living rise faster than their income. But even so, the cost of living figures are just more evidence to go with the Hilda survey released earlier this week, the latest GDP figures and most people\u2019s lived experience, that households are continuing to see their standard of living go backwards, and until wages start rising faster, that is likely to continue. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "House of Fraser has been dealt a potentially fatal blow after confirming the collapse of a financial rescue deal from its Chinese white knight. C.banner, the Hong Kong-listed owner of Hamleys, said on Wednesday that a dive in its own share price meant plans to raise \u00a3150m to invest in the struggling department store group had been \u201crendered impracticable and inadvisable\u201d. The announcement marks the end of hopes that C.banner will step in to support House of Fraser, which is urgently seeking \u00a350m to avoid collapse. A fall into administration would put about 17,000 jobs at risk, affecting mostly people working for other brands\u2019 concessions within House of Fraser stores rather than directly for the retailer. House of Fraser said it was in discussions with alternative investors and \u201cexploring options to obtain the required investment on the same timetable\u201d. The troubled department store chain is talking to lenders and potential investors that include Sports Direct\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley. The retailer is struggling to meet its quarterly rent bill of nearly \u00a325m due late September and fund the purchase of millions of pounds of stock for the peak Christmas trading period. It also wants about \u00a310m to pay down an expensive short-term overdraft. The financial troubles have led it to be judged in technical default on millions of pounds worth of loans after securing a court-approved extension of repayment deadlines last week. Suppliers are already beginning contingency planning for House of Fraser\u2019s potential collapse. One source said remaining cover from credit insurers, whom suppliers use to protect themselves from the risk of not being paid, was likely to be withdrawn due to C.banner\u2019s exit. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious situation,\u201d said one supplier, who said their business would have to consider whether it was contractually obliged to continue providing goods to House of Fraser or whether it could demand payment upfront. \u201cWe are a company with a strong balance sheet but we are not in the business of playing poker.\u201d Talks with new backers were in train as C.banner had already warned its shareholders that the planned investment in House of Fraser, originally slated for this summer, could be delayed until late October. It blamed the delay on legal action by landlords against House of Fraser\u2019s planned restructure, which would involve the closure of 31 of its 59 stores. C.banner\u2019s investment deal was contingent on the restructure being finalised. C.banner had expected to raise net proceeds of HK$1.48bn (\u00a3140m) by placing shares at about HK$2.70 a share to fund plans to invest \u00a370m in House of Fraser. It also planned to invest a further \u00a370m in buying shares in the department store from the majority shareholder, Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate. C.banner\u2019s share price has fallen more than 70% to HK$0.71 since 1 June, when it announced the placing. On Wednesday, it issued a profit warning, telling investors it expected to make a RMB20m (\u00a32.24m) loss in the six months to the end of June, compared with a RMB 39m (\u00a34.36m) profit a year before; this was partly a result of an increase in finance costs. In a statement issued to the Hong Kong stock exchange about its planned share placing, C.banner said: \u201cIn view of the fact that the recent market prices of the shares as quoted on the stock exchange have significantly dropped to a level which is far below the placing price range of HK$2.40 to HK$3.00 per placing share, the company and the placing agent are of the opinion that the placing has been rendered impracticable and inadvisable, and therefore no longer intend to proceed with the placing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The French company Sanofi has become the latest drugs manufacturer to start stockpiling medicines amid mounting uncertainty over the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Supplies of thousands of medicines could be disrupted if Britain leaves the EU without a deal next March and border checks and lengthy transport delays arise. The rival pharmaceutical firms AstraZeneca and MSD (known as Merck &amp; Co in the US) have also announced stockpiling plans. Sanofi, a large producer of insulin and vaccines, is building up stocks of a wide range of medicines in British warehouses, creating a 14-week supply starting from April 2019. Most of its supplies arrive in the UK through the Channel tunnel; it normally held just 10-week supplies of drugs in case of disruption, it said. Hugo Fry, the managing director of Sanofi\u2019s UK operation, said: \u201cThe uncertainty in the Brexit negotiations means that Sanofi has been planning for a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario. Patient safety is our main priority and we have made arrangements for additional warehouse capacity in order to stockpile our products, where global supply allows, in the UK, and increase UK-based resources to prepare for any changes to customs or regulatory processes.\u201d He said this was in line with recommendations by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). \u201cIn the absence of any transition agreement, the European Medicines Agency will deem the UK to be a \u2018third country\u2019.\u201d The threat of a no-deal with the EU over Brexit is also forcing drug makers to prepare for duplicate product testing and authorisation to ensure their products stay on the market. According to the EFPIA, about 45m patient-packs go to the EU from the UK every month and 37m patient-packs travel in the other direction. The Anglo-Swedish drugs maker AstraZeneca has been boosting stockpiles of medicines by 20% in warehouses in the UK and at ports in the EU. Its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said last week that the company was raising inventories from three months\u2019 supply to four. He expressed concerns, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t even know how medicines will cross borders. Sometimes they cross several times during the manufacturing cycle.\u201d AstraZeneca, which makes the cholesterol pill Crestor, as well as the cutting-edge cancer treatments Tagrisso, Imfinzi and Lynparza, has begun parallel testing of drugs at its Swedish site in Gothenburg. The American pharmaceutical group MSD also has plans to build up medicine supplies, with stocks lasting up to six months. Last week, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said NHS England was preparing to stockpile medicines and blood in case the UK left the EU without a deal. He told the health select committee he had met medical industry leaders to accelerate preparations. Sir Mike Rawlins, chair of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, has warned that all insulin is imported to the UK and has to be temperature controlled. GlaxoSmithKline, Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company, which makes the asthma drug Advair, as well as HIV treatments and vaccines, said it always held additional supplies of medically critical drugs in case of disruption. GSK started implementing its contingency plans in January, focusing on supply chains. The drug maker estimated that Brexit-related costs would be up to \u00a370m over the next two to three years, with ongoing costs of \u00a350m a year, due to re-testing of medicines, transferring marketing authorisations in the UK to the EU, and altered manufacturing licences and other steps. A GSK spokesperson said: \u201cMaking sure that patients can access the medicines and vaccines they need is a priority for GSK, which is why we are continuing to implement our contingency plans to minimise the potential for disruption to supply of these products as a result of Brexit.\u201d",

The department store chain, which has issued three profits warnings this year, issued a statement to the stock exchange saying it \u201cremains profitable and cash-generative, and our banks are supportive\u201d after Moody\u2019s said it judged that Debenhams was more likely to default on its debts. Moody\u2019s said it was downgrading Debenhams\u2019 credit rating one notch to B2, indicating high risk, to reflect a highly competitive and promotional environment in the UK with \u201ca multitude of competitors, some of which are in financial difficulties and thus discounting aggressively\u201d. The move will make it harder for Debenhams to borrow money and adds to pressure on the company, which has also been hit by reduced cover for suppliers by credit insurers. A reduction in cover tends to mean that suppliers demand payment upfront, putting increased strain on a retailer\u2019s finances. \u201cDowngrading Debenhams to B2 reflects its weaker-than-expected profitability,\u201d said David Beadle, a Moody\u2019s credit officer and lead analyst for Debenhams. \u201cThe negative outlook factors in the possibility of a further drop in profits or weaker liquidity.\u201d The rating agency nevertheless expects cost-saving measures, including cancelling dividends to shareholders, will help profitability to stabilise next year. Debenhams said it had taken \u201cdecisive action to strengthen our financial position\u201d as it navigated tough conditions, including a review of non-core parts of its business and \u201ccontinuing constructive discussions with landlords\u201d. On Tuesday, the Guardian revealed that Debenhams has put a price tag of up to \u00a3250m on its Danish department store chain Magasin du Nord, as it looks to flush out potential buyers. Last year Debenhams\u2019 chief executive, Sergio Bucher, set out ambitious plans to turn stores into destinations with new restaurants, as well as nail and blow-dry bars and an updated Designers at Debenhams fashion range. But Bucher\u2019s plans have been waylaid by weak consumer spending coupled with heavy discounting, as its high-street rival House of Fraser fights for survival. All retailers are under pressure, with rising costs in a weak market, as well as shift by consumers towards online shopping.

    "webTitle": "Apple shares open 4.4% higher as its value heads towards $1tn - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A host of manufacturing surveys for July showed a disappointing outcome for the UK, while eurozone growth was also sluggish. Over in the US factory growth slipped in July, while a jobs report was better than expected although it came with a warning on the outlook. The latest UK housing market report from Nationwide showed a 2.5% annual rise in July ahead of an expected Bank of England interest rate rise on Thursday. Overall markets were subdued after reports of an escalation in the trade dispute between the US and China, with President Trump said to be considering raising the existing 10% tariff on $200bn of imports from China to 25%. And following its positive results on Tuesday, Apple shares opened up 4.4%, pushing the company\u2019s value close to a record $1tn. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. US factory growth dipped slightly in July, according to the latest manufacturing survey, partly due to falling exports and supply problems. The IHS Markit US manufacturing PMI came in at 55.3 last month, down from 55.4 and lower than the initial estimate of 55.5. Markit said: US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u2019 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u2019s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again. Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months. Apple\u2019s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher. Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u2019s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China. The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn. It would need to hit $203.25 to reach that level. Here\u2019s IG index on the expected opening for Wall Street: In pre-trading Apple shares are currently up around 4%, not quite enough so far to push it above a $1tn valuation. US private sector employers took on more workers than expected in July, according to a new report, partly due to this year\u2019s hefty tax cuts. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, ADP\u2019s employment report showed a 219,000 increase in private sector jobs last month, compared to expectations of a 185,000 rise. Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said: The labour market is on a roll with no signs of a slowdown in sight. Nearly every industry posted strong gains and small business hiring picked up. But there could be storm clouds ahead given President Trump\u2019s tariff plans and trade disputes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics which helped compile the report, said: The job market is booming, impacted by the deficit-financed tax cuts and increases in government spending. Tariffs have yet to materially impact jobs, but the multinational companies shed jobs last month, signalling the threat. It\u2019s not all good news for Apple despite its upbeat results and its approach towards a $1tn valuation. Samuel Gibbs reports: Huawei overtook Apple to become the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone seller behind Samsung in the second quarter, the first time in seven years that any contender has managed to split the top two. Multiple market analysts said that Huawei\u2019s rise came as the slowdown in China, the world\u2019s largest market for smartphones, eased, with growing market share in Europe. Huawei failed in its recent bid to launch in the US after government action against companies deemed a security threat. Despite Apple being historically weak in the second quarter, analysts described the rise of Huawei as significant. \u201cThe importance of Huawei overtaking Apple this quarter cannot be overstated,\u201d said Canalys analyst Ben Stanton. \u201cIt is the first time in seven years that Samsung and Apple have not held the top two positions.\u201d Our full report is here: The FTSE 100 has taken a turn for the worse in the course of the morning. Trade tensions are uppermost in investors\u2019 minds following reports that the US plans to raise the tariffs it plans of $200bn worth of imports from China from the original 10% to 25%. So commodity stocks are among the leading fallers on concerns that any slowdown in China\u2019s economy would hit the sector hard. Sharp falls in the likes of Next, Direct Line and Rio Tinto after their latest updates is also hitting the market, leaving the UK\u2019s leading index 1% or 77 points lower at 7671. So is this the day Apple\u2019s market value hits $1tn? All eyes will be on Wall Street\u2019s open to see how the better than expected results are received. Will investors push Apple higher or decide to take profits? Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u2019s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook. We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u2013 a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u2019re in FAANGs now I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call. Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers. The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter. But Apple\u2019s figures could give some badly needed support to the sector. The pound is not getting much help from the prospect of an interest rate rise on Thursday. Against the dollar it is down 0.05% at $1.3117, while against the euro is has edged up 0.05% to \u20ac1.1229. The survey is positive about exports but less so about domestic demand, says Helena Sans, head of manufacturing at Barclays: A disappointing result for the manufacturing sector in July with PMI at a three-month low, although still firmly in positive territory. Of more concern is the weakest business confidence score for 21 months, indicating that the industry is desperate for a degree of clarity and progress on the Brexit negotiations and a better understanding of what the final outcome will mean for manufacturers. It looks like a tale of two markets at the moment, with export growth accelerating but domestic demand struggling to keep pace. Aside from the encouraging news for exporters, the only other real bright spot was more job growth, with two full years of consecutive monthly employment increases no mean feat. Following the weaker than expected UK manufacturing report, things are unlikely to improve in the immediate future, says ING Bank economist James Smith. But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says: At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe. But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day. Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u2013 the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low. Having said all of that, today\u2019s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u2019s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u2013 particularly in the much larger service sector \u2013 has largely backed up the Bank\u2019s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter. For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March. After Thursday, we currently don\u2019t anticipate another hike before May 2019. The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless. If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy. The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector. But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow. Bumper orders for the major aircraft manufacturers will help the small- and medium-sized businesses in their supply chains and the launch of the new Tempest fighter jet has the potential to safeguard thousands of highly-skilled jobs. The weaker than expected figures could give the Bank of England second thoughts if it really is planning to raise UK interest rates on Thursday, suggests IHS Markit director Rob Dobson: The financial markets still seem to have an interest rate increase nailed on for August. However, if the combination of weaker growth and a softening of pipeline cost pressures at manufacturers is mirrored in the larger service sector, the Bank of England\u2019s decision will be far from unanimous and they may even yet find some cause for pause. The figure of 54 for July\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI is a three month low, albeit that any number over 50 shows the sector is expanding. Markit said: The softer growth patch of the UK manufacturing sector continued at the start of the third quarter. July saw slower rates of expansion in both output and new orders, as weaker growth of new work from domestic sources offset a stronger increase in new export orders. Price pressures also remained elevated as a strong increase in average input costs led to the steepest rise in selling prices since February... July saw the degree of positive sentiment dip to a 21-month low, amid reports of uncertainty regarding both Brexit and the exchange rate. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply which co-compiles the survey, said: There was a flatline feel to manufacturing this month, as the sector held its ground, but only just. Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance. Britain\u2019s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July. IHS Markit/CIPS\u2019s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected. This was lower than the June figure of 54.3, itself revised down from the initial estimate of 54.4. Here\u2019s Markit\u2019s country by country manufacturing PMIs for July: The overall eurozone manufacturing sector was subdued in July, according to IHS Markit, and there could be worse to come. The final purchasing managers index edged up from 54.9 in June to 55.1 as trade tensions and rising prices dented optimism. The final figure was unchanged from the initial estimate, and follows disappointing second quarter eurozone GDP figures released on Tuesday. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: A marginal uptick in the PMI provides little cause for cheer given it is the second weakest number for more than one-and-a-half years. The past two months have seen the most subdued spell of factory output growth since late-2016. Worse may be to come. Even this reduced rate of output growth continued to outpace order book growth, resulting in the smallest rise in order book backlogs for two years. The clear implication is that manufacturers may have to adjust production down in coming months unless demand revives. Clues to the current soft patch lie in the export growth trend, which has deteriorated dramatically since the start of the year across all member states to reach a near-two year low, with France and Austria seeing exports fall into decline in July. The survey responses indicate that the slowdown likely reflects worries about trade wars, tariffs and rising prices, as well as general uncertainty about the economic outlook. Optimism about the future remained at one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years. Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector recovered from June\u2019s 18 month low last month, albeit more slowly than initial estimates. IHS Markit\u2019s purchasing managers index rose from 55.9 in June to 56.9, lower than the initial reading of 57.3. IHS Markit\u2019s economist Sian Jones said: The beginning of the second half of the year brought a faster rise in manufacturing growth among German manufacturers. Following a dip in overall performance in June, the upturn in output and new orders strengthened. That said, the increase in production continued to outpace that of new orders as firms expanded their efforts to clear backlogs. Although slightly weaker than June, employment growth continued to grow sharply, with greater production requirements a key factor behind sustained job creation. Panellists also reported stronger optimism towards future output growth, the most robust since April. Concerns were raised however, with some respondents noting uncertainty surrounding tariffs and further marked rises in input costs as risks to future growth. In turn, pressure on supply chains remained significant as firms continued to comment on bottlenecks at suppliers. France\u2019s factories did better in July than analysts had been expecting. IHS/Markit\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers index climbed from 52.5 in June to 53.3, compared to an initial reading of 53.1. Output and new orders increased but exports fell back amid global trade tensions. IHS Markit economist Alex Gill said: July saw renewed growth momentum in the French manufacturing sector, with output and new orders rising at sharper rates, moving off their recent lows seen in June. Stronger client demand encouraged firms to take on additional staff, raise their purchasing activity and boosted hopes of further near-term growth. The only slight blip was a first fall in new export orders since September 2016, as global trade tensions hamper foreign demand. With trade tensions on the rise again, investors are in a cautious mood despite Apple\u2019s better than expected results. The FTSE 100 is down 0.44%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has edged up 0.21% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.35%. Among the companies reporting, Lloyds Banking Group is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.8% but Next is down nearly 6% despite a good second quarter as it expressed caution about the prospects for August sales. Among the mid-caps in the FTSE 250, BBA Aviation has slumped 15% after saying it expected \u201cmodest growth\u201d this year. Outsourcing group Capita is down 9.5% as it said its turnaround plan was on track after a collapse in profits but it would be a long road ahead. Commenting on the Nationwide house price index, Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: Two steps forward, one step back \u2013 Nationwide\u2019s annual rate of price growth has barely shifted from where it was a year ago. It\u2019s tempting to see such a meandering market as the fruit of a cautious consensus. Instead it\u2019s a byproduct of the collision of three conflicting forces; pent-up demand, low supply and patchy confidence. With activity levels slowly picking up, the rising tension is creating some big regional anomalies \u2013 making the national average as misleading as it is insipid. The future course of the market is balanced on a knife edge. With the Bank of England set to notch up interest rates tomorrow, the prospect of more expensive mortgages should jolt some previously hesitant buyers into action. Yet any extra impetus is likely to be immediate but ephemeral. By contrast, the forces holding back the market will get steadily stronger if the UK sleepwalks into a no-deal Brexit. If the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU continues its shift from long shot to likely, the top end of the market could slip into full retreat as investment buyers go into lockdown. For everyone else, softening prices and better affordability will create buying opportunities \u2013 particularly for the bold and strategic \u2013 in what will become an increasingly fractured market. Signs of strength in the UK housing market. The Press Association reports: Annual house price growth accelerated in July as the average property value hit a new record high of \u00a3217,010, according to an index. Across the UK, house prices were up by 2.5% annually in July, compared with a 2% annual increase in June, Nationwide Building Society said. House prices increased by 0.6% month on month in July - the second month of increases in a row following a 0.7% upturn in June. With speculation that the Bank of England base rate could edge up on Thursday from 0.5% to 0.75%, Nationwide said a 0.25 percentage point rise is likely to have only a modest immediate impact on borrowers, many of whom are locked into fixed-rate deals. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cProviding the economy does not weaken further, the impact of a further small rise in interest rates on UK households is likely to be modest. \u201cThis is partly because only a relatively small proportion of borrowers will be directly impacted by the change. \u201cMost lending on personal loans and credit cards is fixed or tends to be unaffected by movements in the bank rate. Similarly, in recent years, the vast majority of new mortgages have been extended on fixed interest rates.\u201d But, he continued: \u201cWhile the impact for most borrowers is likely to be modest, it\u2019s important to note that household budgets have been under pressure for some time because wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living. \u201cIndeed, in real terms (after adjusting for inflation) wage rates are still at levels prevailing in 2005.\u201d Mr Gardner said that, overall, Nationwide continues to expect house prices to increase by 1% over the course of 2018. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Will Apple become the first company in history to be valued at $1tn? The company reported better than expected results after the market closed on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of the higher-cost iPhone X profits jumped 32%, and its shares rose 4% in the after-market, putting it tantalisingly close to the magic $1tn figure. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Traders breathed a sigh of relief as Apple reported strong earnings after the close, putting a spark back into the Nasdaq... What was there not to like about these numbers? This was the news that the markets had been hoping for; there had been concerns going into this release that the iPhone X numbers just weren\u2019t going to stack up, but that wasn\u2019t the case and Apple has managed to pull it out of the bag again, proving why it should be the first trillion-dollar company. The final 7% lift in the share price required to hit that trillion-dollar level shouldn\u2019t be so tough achieve after a set of figures like that. Here is our report on the Apple numbers: Elsewhere it is another big day for company results, with Lloyds Banking Group reporting a 23% rise in pre-tax profit and Next defying the current retail blues with a 2.8% increase in second quarter full-price sales, helped by the warm weather boosting demand for summer outfits. We will also get the first snapshot of how the manufacturing sector has performed in July, with PMI figures from the UK, Europe and US. China has already reported, with its manufacturing sector growing at the slowest pace in eight months, with exports declining amid trade tensions. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell from 51 in June to 50.8 last month. The UK numbers are also expected to see a slight dip, from 54.4 to 54.2. But any figure above 50 shows expansion, and the decline is unlikely to deter the Bank of England if it really wants to raise interest rates on Thursday. As for Europe, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: It\u2019s also set to be another important day for economic data especially in light of yesterday\u2019s disappointing EU Q2 GDP numbers which came in unexpectedly lower than anticipated. For most of this year we\u2019ve been told that the slowdown that we saw in Q1 was going to be temporary, and likely weather related. The weak Q2 French GDP numbers and yesterday\u2019s weaker than expected EU numbers would appear to give the lie to that perception, and more worryingly inflation appears to be showing signs of picking up. This is likely to be a concern for the European Central Bank especially if we see no evidence that Q3 is gearing to pick up the slack, with today\u2019s July manufacturing PMI\u2019s taking on a much greater importance in terms of looking for a rebound in economic activity after the weaker readings we\u2019ve seen so far this year. Early indications aren\u2019t particularly encouraging if last week\u2019s flash numbers from Germany and France are any guide though Germany did show some improvement, which should be confirmed at 57.3. France slowed to 53.1, while Spain and Italy are also expected to do the same, coming in at 53.1 and 53 respectively, both lower than their June readings. Much later the US Federal Reserve will announce its latest rate decision, although no change is expected this month, with an increase more likely in September. Markets remain edgy, especially with the latest reports suggesting an escalation in the current trade tensions. The US is said to be considering increasing its 10% tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese imports to 25%.

While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u2019 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u2019s history.

Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u2019s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn.

Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u2019re in FAANGs now I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call.</p> <p> Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter.

But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe.</p> <p>But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day.</p> <p>Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u2013 the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low.</p> <p>Having said all of that, today\u2019s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u2019s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u2013 particularly in the much larger service sector \u2013 has largely backed up the Bank\u2019s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter.</p> <p>For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March.</p> <p>After Thursday, we currently don\u2019t anticipate another hike before May 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61725ee4b0353e1304fc95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:43:22.623Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless.</p> <p>If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy.</p> <p>The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector.</p> <p>But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow.

The Press Association reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Annual house price growth accelerated in July as the average property value hit a new record high of \u00a3217,010, according to an index.</p> <p>Across the UK, house prices were up by 2.5% annually in July, compared with a 2% annual increase in June, Nationwide Building Society said.</p> <p>House prices increased by 0.6% month on month in July - the second month of increases in a row following a 0.7% upturn in June.</p> <p>With speculation that the Bank of England base rate could edge up on Thursday from 0.5% to 0.75%, Nationwide said a 0.25 percentage point rise is likely to have only a modest immediate impact on borrowers, many of whom are locked into fixed-rate deals. </p> <p>Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cProviding the economy does not weaken further, the impact of a further small rise in interest rates on UK households is likely to be modest. \u201cThis is partly because only a relatively small proportion of borrowers will be directly impacted by the change.</p> <p>\u201cMost lending on personal loans and credit cards is fixed or tends to be unaffected by movements in the bank rate. Similarly, in recent years, the vast majority of new mortgages have been extended on fixed interest rates.\u201d</p> <p>But, he continued: \u201cWhile the impact for most borrowers is likely to be modest, it\u2019s important to note that household budgets have been under pressure for some time because wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living. </p> <p>\u201cIndeed, in real terms (after adjusting for inflation) wage rates are still at levels prevailing in 2005.\u201d</p> <p>Mr Gardner said that, overall, Nationwide continues to expect house prices to increase by 1% over the course of 2018. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bc64d1b061c419b8ab14fb24ed18250d82ab60c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bc64d1b061c419b8ab14fb24ed18250d82ab60c/0_170_5120_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For Sale Under Offer and Sold signs West Hampstead London UKANDXJE For Sale Under Offer and Sold signs West Hampstead London UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b6156aee4b0353e1304fbf1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T06:44:11.405Z\">7.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for European markets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/1024533634127093761\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTSE</a> 7740 -0.11%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DAX</a> 12815 +0.07%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CAC</a> 5509 -0.04%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIB</a> 22189 -0.12%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBEX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IBEX</a> 9855 -0.16%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/1024533634127093761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 1, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b614dafe4b0081aec3b9551\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T06:41:59.894Z\">7.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: July manufacturing and Apple in focus</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>Will Apple become the first company in history to be valued at $1tn? The company reported better than expected results after the market closed on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of the higher-cost iPhone X profits jumped 32%, and its shares rose 4% in the after-market, putting it tantalisingly close to the magic $1tn figure. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Traders breathed a sigh of relief as Apple reported strong earnings after the close, putting a spark back into the Nasdaq...</p> <p> What was there not to like about these numbers? This was the news that the markets had been hoping for; there had been concerns going into this release that the iPhone X numbers just weren\u2019t going to stack up, but that wasn\u2019t the case and Apple has managed to pull it out of the bag again, proving why it should be the first trillion-dollar company. The final 7% lift in the share price required to hit that trillion-dollar level shouldn\u2019t be so tough achieve after a set of figures like that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is our report on the Apple numbers:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/31/apple-q3-results-1-billion-threshold\">Apple reports new sales record for third quarter as it eases toward $1tn mark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere it is another big day for company results, with Lloyds Banking Group reporting a 23% rise in pre-tax profit and Next defying the current retail blues with a 2.8% increase in second quarter full-price sales, helped by the warm weather boosting demand for summer outfits.</p> <p>We will also get the first snapshot of how the manufacturing sector has performed in July, with PMI figures from the UK, Europe and US. China has already reported, with its manufacturing sector growing at the slowest pace in eight months, with exports declining amid trade tensions. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell from 51 in June to 50.8 last month.</p> <p>The UK numbers are also expected to see a slight dip, from 54.4 to 54.2. But any figure above 50 shows expansion, and the decline is unlikely to deter the Bank of England if it really wants to raise interest rates on Thursday. As for Europe, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s also set to be another important day for economic data especially in light of yesterday\u2019s disappointing EU Q2 GDP numbers which came in unexpectedly lower than anticipated. For most of this year we\u2019ve been told that the slowdown that we saw in Q1 was going to be temporary, and likely weather related. The weak Q2 French GDP numbers and yesterday\u2019s weaker than expected EU numbers would appear to give the lie to that perception, and more worryingly inflation appears to be showing signs of picking up.</p> <p>This is likely to be a concern for the European Central Bank especially if we see no evidence that Q3 is gearing to pick up the slack, with today\u2019s July manufacturing PMI\u2019s taking on a much greater importance in terms of looking for a rebound in economic activity after the weaker readings we\u2019ve seen so far this year. </p> <p>Early indications aren\u2019t particularly encouraging if last week\u2019s flash numbers from Germany and France are any guide though Germany did show some improvement, which should be confirmed at 57.3. France slowed to 53.1, while Spain and Italy are also expected to do the same, coming in at 53.1 and 53 respectively, both lower than their June readings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Much later the US Federal Reserve will announce its latest rate decision, although no change is expected this month, with an increase more likely in September.</p> <p>Markets remain edgy, especially with the latest reports suggesting an escalation in the current trade tensions. The US is said to be considering increasing its 10% tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese imports to 25%.</p> <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p> <p>8.50 BST French manufacturing PMI</p> <p>8.55 BST German manufacturing PMI</p> <p>9.00 BST Eurozone manufacturing PMI</p> <p>9.30 BST UK manufacturing PMI</p> <p>13.15 BST US employment figures from ADP</p> <p>14.45 BST US manufacturing PMI</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T07:20:06.401Z\">at 8.20am BST</time></p>  </div>",

With all the gravity of a Soviet commissar, Jean-Claude Juncker announced on Wednesday that he had ordered a fortnightly count of the number of US soya beans imported into the EU. The European commission president promised Donald Trump last week that beans would be bought in greater numbers if the US president held off on hitting the German car industry with punitive tariffs. The humble soya bean, a cheap source of protein used in chicken, pig and cattle feed, as well as for milk production, has become vital, it would seem, to the smooth running of the transatlantic alliance. Soya-bean farmers in the US midwest, a key Trump constituency under pressure from the administration\u2019s trade war with China, will begin harvesting in September and October, weeks before the midterm elections. It might cause some EU diplomats indigestion, but the commission is giving Trump a helping electoral hand. Juncker was able to offer a teaser too. In what has been billed as the \u201cfirst concrete follow-up to the EU-US joint statement\u201d made by the two leaders in the White House Rose Garden, impressive figures were unearthed. There had already been a year-on-year increase of 283% in imports, bringing the EU\u2019s total share of US soya bean exports to 37%, up from 9% a year ago, the commission said. \u201cThe European Union can import more soya beans from the US and this is happening as we speak,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cThis is a win-win situation for European and American citizens.\u201d Those of a sceptical nature might wonder quite how the EU was able to promise an increase in the purchase of soya beans, and then to produce such swift results, without going the full Soviet and buying them up. The reality, EU officials admit behind the scenes, is that soya bean imports were on the rise anyway, and are expected to continue to rise, validating Juncker\u2019s pledge. European farmers are buying up soya beans from the US simply because they are currently the most competitive on the market because of the US-China trade war. When Beijing imposed a 25% tariff on US soya bean imports, Brazil, the second-largest producer behind the US, moved in to sell to China. US exporters have turned to Europe, where less competition meant prices went up, making it an attractive destination. Farms in the EU import 30bn tonnes of soya beans a year, because the European climate is not suitable for mass production. The EU commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan, said: \u201cThe European Union and the United States have been longstanding partners and there is room to further strengthen our trade relationship. \u201cWe expressed our willingness to import more soya beans from the United States and this is already happening. European and American farmers have much to gain by working together.\u201d",

We believe that this overachievement in sales was due to the prolonged period of exceptionally warm weather, which greatly assisted the sales of summer weight product. \u201cIt is almost certain that some of these sales have been pulled forward from August, so we are maintaining our sales and profit guidance for the year to January 2019.\u201d Simon Wolfson, the chief executive, called on the government and landlords to reduce the burden for high street retailers as he said it was a battle to ensure shops remained profitable. \u201cIt is not about space, it\u2019s about rent. It is a simple equation on whether 550 locations are profitable or not. If [a store is] not profitable it will have to shut or get a rent reduction.\u201d Wolfson said Next was already negotiating average rent cuts of about 25% when leases came to an end and mitigating the costs of stores by bringing in concessions, from car showrooms to cafes and children\u2019s activity centres. He said concessions not only brought in additional income, mainly from spare space which had previously been used for stockrooms, but also gave shoppers another reason to visit. But he said that the business rates system was making things worse, particularly in weaker locations, because the tax is based on infrequent property valuations. The chancellor this year promised that revaluations would take place every three years, rather than every five but some believe that remains too infrequent. \u201cRates are slow to change,\u201d said Wolfson. \u201cEven the changes going through now are based on valuations from two years ago and a lot has changed in two years. The worse a location the more unfair the rates. There is a strong case for active revaluation.\u201d Shares fell 7.5% after the trading update was published, making Next the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. In the first half of the year overall, full price sales \u2013 excluding discounted items \u2013 rose by 4.5% compared with the same period a year ago. This was entirely driven by online sales, which rose 15.5%, while sales across its shops fell 5.3%. The figures are the latest evidence of the tough conditions on the high street, with household names such as House of Fraser fighting for survival. Hundreds of stores have been closed and thousands of jobs lost on Britain\u2019s high street in recent months. Next expects to make a profit before tax of \u00a3717m this year, down 1.3% from last year, which Wolfson described as the toughest year in the past 25 years. It would mark the third consecutive fall in annual profits. The retailer started its end-of-season sale a week earlier than last year and went into it with 20% less stock than last year. The sale has fared better than forecast and added \u00a34m to profits, although this has largely been offset by higher warehouse and distribution costs. Taking markdown sales together with full-price sales, total sales grew 3.9% in the first half.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Profits at Lloyds Banking Group jumped by almost a quarter in the first half of the year despite taking another hit of \u00a3550m to cover claims from mis-sold payment protection insurance. The high street lender said pre-tax profits rose 23% to \u00a33.1bn in the six months to 30 June, on higher interest income and lower costs. An additional \u00a3460m PPI provision in the second quarter took the half-year charge to \u00a3550m \u2013 which was hefty but less than the \u00a31bn Lloyds put aside at the same time last year. The firm\u2019s total PPI bill has climbed to \u00a319.2bn \u2013 the highest of all UK banks \u2013 and the rate of claims has picked up as the deadline approaches. Lloyds receives around 13,000 claims a week, more than the 11,000 a week it had expected, and said this was because of the final cut-off of 29 August 2019. It said that every 1,000 claims a week above that level would cost the bank another \u00a3150m. Lloyds has sold 16m PPI policies since 2000 and has dealt with claims on 53% of those policies, it said. Striking an upbeat note as the first-half results were announced, the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, said the UK economy continued to \u201cdemonstrate resilience\u201d, with unemployment low and the weaker pound boosting trade. He said there was a \u201cvery high probability\u201d that the UK would achieve a deal with the EU by 30 November, when the government is due to present a Brexit deal to MPs. Lloyds is firmly focused on the UK, with only two branches in mainland Europe, one in Berlin and one in Amsterdam. It is converting those branches into a subsidiary based in Berlin by the end of the year, with staff numbers unaffected at 300 in Berlin and 100 in Amsterdam. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said credit quality in the UK was stable and was unfazed by the prospect of rising interest rates. Lloyds assumes rates will go up by 0.25 points this year and in each of the next two years. The Bank of England is widely expected to lift borrowing costs from 0.5% to 0.75% when it announces its latest policy decision on Thursday. Horta-Os\u00f3rio noted that while household debts across the country had increased over the last three years, they were still 25% lower than before the financial crisis, excluding mortgages. He pledged to maintain the largest branch network in the UK, despite 49 branch closures announced in April. He said the closures reflected changes in customer behaviour, with Lloyds the biggest digital bank in the UK. It has nearly 14 million active digital users, including 10 million mobile banking users. The government sold its remaining stake in Lloyds last year, nine years after taxpayers bailed out the bank with \u00a320bn after its takeover of HBOS at the height of the financial crisis. However, Lloyds has come under pressure over how it handled fraud at its HBOS Reading unit. The bank stuck to its \u00a3100m provision for the fraud for which two former HBOS employees were jailed, and said it was in the process of paying compensation to the victims of the fraud, who include the TV presenter Noel Edmonds. The firm has made offers to 67 customers and 56 of them have accepted. Lloyds shares rose 1.6% after the results were announced and the interim dividend increased to 1.07p a share.",

Lloyds receives around 13,000 claims a week, more than the 11,000 a week it had expected, and said this was because of the final cut-off of 29 August 2019. It said that every 1,000 claims a week above that level would cost the bank another \u00a3150m. </p> <p>Lloyds has sold 16m PPI policies since 2000 and has dealt with claims on 53% of those policies, it said.</p> <p>Striking an upbeat note as the first-half results were announced, the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, said the UK economy continued to \u201cdemonstrate resilience\u201d, with unemployment low and the weaker pound boosting trade. He said there was a \u201cvery high probability\u201d that the UK would achieve a deal with the EU by 30 November, when the government is due to present a Brexit deal to MPs.</p> <p>Lloyds is firmly focused on the UK, with only two branches in mainland Europe, one in Berlin and one in Amsterdam. It is converting those branches into a subsidiary based in Berlin by the end of the year, with staff numbers unaffected at 300 in Berlin and 100 in Amsterdam.</p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio said credit quality in the UK was stable and was unfazed by the prospect of rising interest rates. Lloyds assumes rates will go up by 0.25 points this year and in each of the next two years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/21/bank-of-england-moves-closer-to-august-interest-rate-rise\">The Bank of England is widely expected to lift borrowing costs</a> from 0.5% to 0.75% when it announces its latest policy decision on Thursday.</p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio noted that while household debts across the country had increased over the last three years, they were still 25% lower than before the financial crisis, excluding mortgages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He pledged to maintain the largest branch network in the UK, despite 49 branch closures announced in April. He said the closures reflected changes in customer behaviour, with Lloyds the biggest digital bank in the UK. It has nearly 14 million active digital users, including 10 million mobile banking users.</p> <p>The government sold its remaining stake in Lloyds last year, nine years after taxpayers bailed out the bank with \u00a320bn after its takeover of HBOS at the height of the financial crisis.</p> <p>However, Lloyds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/24/lloyds-shareholders-reject-banks-executive-pay-report\">has come under pressure</a> over how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/19/lloyds-hbos-fraud-report-published-reading\">it handled fraud at its HBOS Reading unit</a>. The bank stuck to its \u00a3100m provision for the fraud for which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/02/hbos-manager-and-other-city-financiers-jailed-over-245m-loans-scam\">two former HBOS employees were jailed</a>, and said it was in the process of paying compensation to the victims of the fraud, who include the TV presenter Noel Edmonds. The firm has made offers to 67 customers and 56 of them have accepted.</p> <p>Lloyds shares rose 1.6% after the results were announced and the interim dividend increased to 1.07p a share.</p>",
