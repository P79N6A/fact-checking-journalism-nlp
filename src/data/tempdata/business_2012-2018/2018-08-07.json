      "bodyText": "Lord Rothschild\u2019s remarks on markets are always worth reading. First, he knows how to make money. RIT Capital Partners, the \u00a33.2bn investment trust he chairs, has returned an average of 12.6% a year since flotation in 1988, which is excellent going for a defensively managed fund. Second, a substantial chunk of his personal wealth is held in RIT. His 18% stake is worth a cool \u00a3575m. Third, he gets to the point. Rothschild has sounded progressively bearish since late 2015 but he took caution to new extremes in Tuesday\u2019s report to shareholders. \u201cThis is not an appropriate time to add to risk,\u201d he wrote, citing high stock market valuations, the length of the bull run (10 years, a record), and the end of the era of quantitative easing. Then he offered a list of familiar worries: the eurozone; trade wars; the effect of higher US interest rates on emerging markets, with the currencies of Turkey and Argentina being early casualties; and Brexit, North Korea, the Middle East and populism. His key point is that the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the 2008 financial crisis provoked a common approach from world powers, but it\u2019s hard to imagine the same response today. His conclusion was almost alarmist: \u201cThis puts at risk the post-war economic and security order.\u201d For its part, RIT is keeping a very low exposure to stock markets of just 47%. Warren Buffett, the most successful investor alive today, is similarly in risk-off mode as he sits on large sums of cash and grumbles about how everything is too expensive to buy. Take note of these octogenarians. They have seen a few market cycles. Merger looks a defensive move The integration of Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA) is proceeding splendidly, shareholders are told, and the rationale for combining two of Scotland\u2019s big fund managers is more compelling than it was 18 months ago. So the share price must be flying, right? Not exactly. It rose on Tuesday\u2019s half-year figures but has fallen 20% since the deal was unveiled in March last year. Martin Gilbert and Keith Skeoch, co-chief executives, offered excuses aplenty. Conditions for asset managers, at least those not called BlackRock or Vanguard, \u201ccontinue to be challenging\u201d. Money is still leaking towards passive funds and away from active managers like SLA. Stock market rewards, especially in the US, have been concentrated among 20-odd \u201cgrowth\u201d technology companies, which again is bad news if your specialism is picking \u201cvalue\u201d stocks. And the pressure on fees remains downwards. Those points are all true but they also suggest that a successful rewiring of SLA could be a long haul. At the half-year stage, pre-tax profits fell from \u00a3355m to \u00a3311m, ignoring the contribution from the insurance operations that are being sold. The benefit of the merger cost savings are still awaited and SLA is only about a third of the way through the process. More alarming, however, was another net outflow of funds, this time of \u00a316.6bn. That\u2019s only a shade over 2% of the \u00a3610bn of the funds under management, whistled Gilbert cheerfully. Well, yes, but most of the money seems to be fleeing from products that the two firms were independently famous for \u2013 the GARs multi-strategy fund on the Standard Life side, and emerging markets and global equities funds at the Aberdeen end. The better news is that the new money is arriving into investment products, which will help the attempt to reduce reliance on blockbuster funds. Meanwhile, the joint venture in India, HDFC, got off to a flyer on its local stock market debut this week \u2013 SLA\u2019s stake for all its Indian assets could be as much as \u00a34.5bn. Therein lies the case for patience: a strong balance sheet and the chance to reverse the outflows over time. But let\u2019s not pretend this was a merger from strength. It looks more defensive as the months pass and the share price refuses to re-rate. Directing the right retirement package When HSBC announced in June that Iain Mackay would soon be \u201cretiring\u201d, we assumed the finance director would be retiring from bean-counting for good. Who could blame him? Eight years tackling HSBC\u2019s complexities is probably enough for anyone. But now, even before Mackay has escaped HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has hired him as its new finance director from January. The personal package is roughly the same \u2013 \u00a33.5m-ish for an \u201con target\u201d year. But the cute part, from GSK\u2019s point of view, is that it doesn\u2019t have to buy Mackay out of his long-term incentives at HSBC. Since his retirement had been announced, and GSK only approached him afterwards, it\u2019s up to the bank to honour its contractual obligations. Good move.",

The move comes days after the Observer and the Guardian revealed that millions of mostly US Facebook users\u2019 data had been harvested for use in political advertising in the run up to Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election victory. Mustier said UniCredit \u201ctakes business ethics very seriously\u201d and had cut all ties with Facebook. His order to withdraw the bank from Facebook was in direct response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mustier said Facebook had guaranteed its 2.2 billion users that it would not exploit or share their data with others, but the Observer/Guardian investigation proved the social network had breached its promise. A UniCredit spokesman confirmed: \u201cAs of end of March, the Group decided to pause all advertising on Facebook until further notice.\u201d Facebook\u2019s billionaire founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was hauled before Congress to answer questions about the data breach scandal, in which information from 87 million user profiles was harvested for targeted political advertising. Facebook has also been under investigation by the FBI, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who blew the lid on \u201cblack ops\u201d at Cambridge Analytica, told the US Senate: \u201cIn addition to Facebook data being accessed in Russia, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that CA may have been an intelligence target of Russian security services ... [and] that Russian security service may have been notified of the existence of CA\u2019s Facebook data.\u201d More than $120bn (\u00a392.5bn) was wiped off Facebook\u2019s market value in one day last month after Zuckerberg told investors that the reputational damage caused by the Cambridge Analytica scandal had dramatically slowed user growth. More than 3 million users in Europe have abandoned the network since the scandal came to life. Other advertisers have threatened to pull back from Facebook, but few have stuck with a longterm boycott. Speaker maker Sonos said in March that it was \u201cconcerned by the recent revelations about Facebook and the exploitation of its platform\u201d and withdrew its advertising \u2013 but only for one week. A Facebook spokesperson said: \u201cAdvertisers care deeply about people and so do we. And while a handful of our advertisers have paused ads, many more have expressed their support for the steps we\u2019re taking to protect people\u2019s information. We take all of the feedback seriously \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re working with our partners to make Facebook even safer and more secure for people.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ITV has joined major Hollywood studios including Disney and Fox, two major Wall Street banks and the billionaire Walton family in a $1bn (\u00a3770m) investment to back an ambitious new video streaming service for mobile phones. NewTV, the temporary name for the new venture, aims to win over the smartphone generation in the same way that Netflix has transformed traditional TV viewing. It is being launched by Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks \u2013 the creator of film hits including Shrek \u2013 with the former Hewlett-Packard and eBay boss Meg Whitman as chief executive. NewTV has raised $1bn from a who\u2019s who of entertainment partners including Disney, 21st Century Fox, the Hunger Games maker Lionsgate, NBC Universal, Sony Pictures, Viacom, which owns Paramount Pictures, and Warner Media. The Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and the investment banks JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are also backing the venture, along with Madrone Capital, an investment fund run by Rob Walton, the son of the Walmart founder, Sam Walton. \u201cNewTV brings together the best of Silicon Valley and Hollywood to create the first entertainment platform built for easy, on-the-go mobile viewing,\u201d Katzenberg and Whitman said in a statement. The new service, planned for launch next year, will aim to tap the talent and intellectual property of its entertainment partners to create top quality shows that will cost about $15m a season. The venture is aiming for quality akin to a Netflix or HBO experience, not the traditional low budgets associated with mobile video entertainment. Content will be broken down into smartphone-digestible episodes of up to 15 minutes in length. \u201cWe are already seeing tremendous interest from Hollywood\u2019s top talent,\u201d said Katzenberg, who last year said he had already spoken to big names including the directors JJ Abramsand Ron Howard, and the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Whitman added: \u201cMore so than ever, people want easy access to the highest quality entertainment that fits perfectly into their busy, on-the-go lifestyles.\u201d NewTV aims to launch with two subscription tiers similar to the US streaming service Hulu \u2013 one with advertising and one without. ITV said it was joining the venture as part of the new chief executive Carolyn McCall\u2019s strategy for the broadcaster to be \u201cmore than TV\u201d and make more of its expansive studio production business. \u201cGlobal demand for high-quality entertainment continues to grow,\u201d said Julian Bellamy, managing director of ITV Studios. \u201cBeing part of the start of this exciting new mobile platform offers ITV\u2019s hugely talented and creative people around the world the opportunity to produce content in a way never seen before.\u201d NewTV is aiming to tap into the booming use of smartphones to watch video content. However, so far no venture focused solely on mobile has managed to make it work. Verizon recently shut down its go90 mobile streaming service after it failed to prove popular. The former Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar\u2019s Vessel similarly failed, while Facebook Watch originally focused on short-form content but has more recently changed tack towards longer-form TV shows. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it with sports and music that consumer viewing habits are continuing to change and mobile video consumption is where the growth is happening,\u201d said Gareth Capon, chief executive of the video production platform Grabyo. \u201cConsumers want content on multiple devices and want the flexibility to choose when, where and how they watch. Established publishers have tried to do this but haven\u2019t seen the success they probably would have liked, as many mobile-first offerings have lacked the qualities needed for mobile success.\u201d Disney and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox have invested ahead of their $71bn merger \u2013 as has Comcast, which is seeking to take over Sky \u2013 as media giants look to protect their businesses against the rapidly changing habits of modern viewers. The race to own the streaming space is becoming increasingly complicated as Disney, Fox and Comcast also each own 30% of Hulu. Disney will own 60% of Hulu following its takeover of Fox, while it has been speculated that Comcast may sell its 30% stake to Disney rather than hold a minority position it can do little with. If Comcast, which owns the makers of Downton Abbey and Made in Chelsea, succeeds in taking over Sky it will inherit the streaming platforms Now TV and Sky Go, which it could roll out internationally. In addition, Disney is planning its own entertainment streaming TV service, to be populated with content spanning the Marvel superhero films, the Star Wars franchise, Pixar titles including Toy Story and The Incredibles and traditional Disney fare such as Frozen and Beauty and the Beast \u2013 and has pulled its content from Netflix in the US. \u201cWe don\u2019t consider this competitive with Hulu, or HBO, or Netflix, or the networks,\u201d said Katzenberg. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different use case.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The pound has stabilised a little after this week\u2019s drop to an 11 month low on growing concerns about a no-deal Brexit. It has gained a little ground against the dollar - up 0.03% - but is still in negative territory against the euro - down 0.37%. Oil prices are on the rise after the US introduced a new series of sanctions against Iran, prompting concerns about crude supplies. Brent crude is currently 0.9% higher at $74.42 a barrel. Meanwhile analysts at S&amp;P have warned that the US-Chinese trade row could move from goods to services. On the economic front, UK house prices grew by 1.4% month on month in July, a better result than had been expected, while consumer spending remains strong, according to Barclays. But in Germany there were disappointing industrial output figures, a day after a fall in factory orders. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The rise in the oil price has lifted US energy stocks and pushed Wall Street higher at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.4% or 101 points while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.23% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.28% better. And here\u2019s our full story on the Halifax house price survey: Here\u2019s our latest story on the US sanctions on Iran: Donald Trump has warned America\u2019s trading partners that anyone who does business with Iran will not be doing business with the US, after his administration reimposed blanket sanctions. The US president described the new sanctions, which hit Iran\u2019s access to dollars, gold and precious metals, as \u201cthe most biting ever imposed\u201d. \u201cIn November they ratchet up to yet another level,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAnyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!\u201d Within hours of the sanctions taking effect, the German carmaker Daimler, which announced a joint venture in Iran last year, said it was halting its business activities in the country. The punitive measures came into force in the early hours of Tuesday, and follow Trump\u2019s decision in May to renege on the landmark 2015 deal to curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The sanctions also target a range of industries, including Iran\u2019s carmaking sector, and will be followed by a set of additional and even more stringent measures by 4 November, including an embargo on the import of Iranian oil and sanctions on its banking sector. Trump\u2019s latest comments appear aimed at the EU, which is attempting to protect European businesses from the sanctions and has vowed to safeguard firms. Companies have been instructed that they should not comply with demands from the White House for them to drop all business with Iran. Those who decide to pull out because of US sanctions will need to be granted authorisation from the European commission, without which they face the risk of being sued by EU member states. The full report is here: US markets are expected to open higher: The VIX index - a measure of the stock market\u2019s expectation of volatility - is heading lower. It is currently down 2% at 11.03 having earlier fallen to 10.9, the lowest level since January. The US-China trade battle could spill over from goods into services, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. The S&amp;P report ssays: This is because China is running out of room to retaliate on goods.. China\u2019s recent threat to impose tariffs of 5% to 25% on a further $60 billion worth of U.S. goods (5,207 product lines) means that, together with the $50 billion of goods already announced, about 85% of its American imports (totaling $130 billion in 2017) could be taxed. The threat is in response to the Trump administration last week announcing that it may increase its proposed tariff rate on Chinese imports valued at about $200 billion to 25% from 10%. Together with the previously-announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, the total amount of $250 billion represents about 50% of the value of China\u2019s annual exports to the U.S. in 2017. \u201cWith China running out of room to retaliate on goods (i.e., 85% versus 50% coverage), China could opt to pursue non-tariff actions affecting services and investments from the U.S.,\u201d said S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst David Tesher. The U.S. has a net services surplus with China. A retaliation that spilled over into services could hurt U.S. sectors that rely on China\u2019s expanding import market for growth. This step-up in tensions could also exacerbate investor worries about China, damaging business and consumer confidence and growth prospects. We note that the trade tension is already weighing on the Chinese currency and stock market sentiment. Oil prices are continuing to rise in the wake of Trump\u2019s new Iranian sanctions. Brent crude is now up 1.27% at $74.69 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has climbed 0.94% to $69.66. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, says: The US has reimposed sanctions against this morning, with an executive order signed by President Trump that targets financial transactions involving the US dollar, the purchase of commercial plans and metals including gold and the Iranian automotive sector coming into effect. From a financial markets point of view, the price of crude oil could be where these decisions are most keenly felt, with the increased animosity threatening to disrupt Tehran\u2019s significant output. This is unlikely to be reflected immediately, with Iranian production expected to remain at present levels for the time being, but should further more stringent sanctions come into play then we could well be set for a supply shock in the oil market which would trigger a sharp move higher. The complex nature of this situation means that it is not just the US and Iran that could be impacted, with the bulk of Iranian crude actually being sold to other countries. The issue lies in whether the US look to force allies to also shun oil from Iran, and if this occurs then there\u2019s a real chance that OPEC will struggle to make up the lost supply and this would drive the price of oil up. Back with the Iran sanctions, and President Trump has just tweeted: UK consumers are continuing to spend, boosted by the World Cup and the heatwave, according to the latest Barclays trend survey, although there are reasons to be cautious about the outlook. Spending grew by 5% year on year in July, the third consecutive month with spending growth around this level. Barclays said: [This] is the strongest consistent growth in our data history. UK domestic sectors have held up year to date and resilient spending should continue to support their near-term performance. It said the strength came from in-store spending, which grew by 2.9%, the strongest growth since April 2014. Online spending grew by 10.4%, which is weaker compared to the historical data. And Barclays warned: There are reasons to be cautious, as consumers remain negative about the general economy and appetite for large purchases remains muted. Outside influences, such as oil price inflation and FX, combine to push up spending on Petrol. Consumer confidence moved slightly lower in July, as negativity about the general economy persists. The appetite for major purchases remained muted, with consumers cautious about making significant spending commitments, evident in subdued spending on electronics, furniture, household appliances and vehicle sales. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, said: This summer\u2019s heat wave and World Cup fever boosted consumer spending in July, with people spending on picnics, BBQs and pubs. People are making the most of the sunshine as spending on food increased 6.7% in the month, while more families are also going on day trips and doing outdoor activities. The World Cup effect also continued to boost spending in the month, with money spent in pubs rising 73% on the day of England\u2019s semi-final, as people cheered on their team. Overall the amount shelled out in pubs increased by 17% in July \u2013 marking the biggest rise since April last year. However, the hangover is looming as people admit they are worried about the effect of last week\u2019s interest rate rise on their finances. The 0.25 percentage point hike last week will hit those who are in debt, including many who are already struggling to make ends meet. A third of those questioned said they were worried that the Bank of England\u2019s move would mean they have less money each month, while confidence in finances among those questioned dropped by 6 percentage points to 59%. This cautiousness is also shown in the fact that households are still putting off buying big ticket items. A reasonably strong performance from US markets on Monday is one of the reasons for a more positive mood in Asia (the Nikkei 225 was up 0.69%) and Europe. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: UK and European markets have rallied this morning, carrying the baton over from last night\u2019s better showing for US markets. Confidence has returned as the S&amp;P 500 moseys its way to towards the January record high, and it remains encouraging to see stock markets hold their ground despite a drumbeat of trade war headlines of late. Earnings season is shaping up very well indeed, which accounts for why US equities remain comfortably ahead of the likes of Europe, but a rising tide lifts all boats and will reinforce the impression that this economic recovery and its associated bull market has further to run. Reasons to be cautious still abound however, with the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s overnight view that China is seeing a modest slowdown in growth reminding us that all is not entirely rosy out there, and this morning\u2019s decline in German industrial production added to this impression, coming as it does after yesterday\u2019s grim factory orders data. The positive mood in stock markets is holding up as the morning progresses. With copper prices edging higher, mining shares are leading the FTSE 100 higher, with the leading UK index now up 0.69%. Oil is also giving support, with crude moving ahead on the prospect of curtailed supplies from Iran following the imposition of US sanctions on the country. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.95% while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.84%. There are a few notes of caution over UK house prices despite the stronger than expected Halifax data. Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender, Octane Capital, said: It would be premature to pop the champagne corks on the back of this seemingly robust data. The annual rate of growth may have shot up between June and July but weak supply rather than robust demand is the primary driver. The market might look punchy on the outside but it\u2019s pallid on the inside. Transaction levels overall are low and it\u2019s hard to see them picking up materially in the months ahead as Brexit uncertainty heightens. The impact of last week\u2019s interest rate rise remains to be seen. While it\u2019s not a massive hit in real terms, how it impacts sentiment is key. The jobs market is holding up but the direction of inflation and wage growth will be key as we enter the latter part of the year.\u201d Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, is also wary: Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: The market has seen far too many false dawns to allow itself to get carried away by these surprisingly strong numbers. Yet with the rate of annual price growth rising to its highest level so far this year, the progress is no flash in the pan. Rather it\u2019s the result of the tussle between pent-up demand and chronically low supply. That tussle continues, even if the last two months have seen increases in both the number of mortgage approvals and the number of homes coming onto the market. The modest momentum could also be given a short-term boost by last week\u2019s increase in interest rates, which, rather than cooling the market, may spur previously hesitant buyers into action during the typically busy \u2018back to school\u2019 season next month. Yet the future course of the market is delicately balanced. With even Cabinet ministers now warning that a no-deal Brexit is more likely than an orderly exit from the EU, investment buyers are dialling up their caution. For everyone else, softening prices and better affordability are creating some attractive buying opportunities, but the market remains deeply polarised, with pockets of value and activity pulling different regions in opposing directions. Markets are holding on to their opening gains, limited though they may be. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: After yesterday\u2019s trade war-fearing, Brexit-bitten session, the markets got off to a brighter start on Tuesday, without really any reason to do so. Though it still couldn\u2019t break out of its recent trading bracket, the FTSE at least pushed to the upper end of it after the bell, climbing 25 points to hit 7685. The index\u2019s main boost came from the commodity sector. With copper up 0.7% the likes of Rio Tinto and Anglo American rose anywhere between 1.3% and 2%, while BP and Shell jumped 0.8% and 0.5% respectively as Brent Crude crossed $74 per barrel following the resumption of the US sanctions on Iran. Meanwhile sterling is currently up 0.13% against the dollar at $1.2958 but has dipped 0.1% against the euro to \u20ac1.1192. Across the Atlantic, the futures market is pointing to a positive start on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to open around 70 points higher. Signs of life in the UK housing market with a better than expected report from mortgage lender Halifax. House prices rose 1.4% month on month in July, compared to expectations of a 0.2% increase, according to the Halifax. The 3.3% year on year increase was higher than the forecast 2.7% gain. But managing director Russell Galley said: Whilst the quarterly and annual rates of house price growth have improved, housing activity remains soft. Sterling is set for continued volatility in the run up to Brexit day next March, according to Thanos Vamvakidis, head of G-10 foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He told CNBC: If we don\u2019t get a deal, sterling can be weaker by about 10 percent, (or) even lower. If you get a deal, any deal, \u2026. (sterling) can be up by 10 percent. I don\u2019t think any other currency can have this kind of moves in the next few months. The comments echo those of Capital Economics on Monday, who said the pound could fall to $1.20 if no deal is agreed between the UK and EU. As expected, markets have got off to a slow start in Europe, but a mainly positive one. The FTSE 100 is up 0.28%, helped by a rise in commodity stocks following the stronger oil price, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.32% and Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.48%. One of the day\u2019s bigger UK fallers is Domino\u2019s Pizza, with analysts pointing to the cost of international expansion and some caution about the outlook. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: Domino\u2019s Pizza reported another firm set of half-year numbers this morning as the investment in digital, especially mobile, pays off in terms of driving top line sales. There\u2019s still plenty of evidence that shifting consumer habits are supportive and while the hot weather took the shine off the second quarter numbers a little, the World Cup offered some compensation. However, investment in its international expansion weighed on profit growth. Underlying profits rose 2.5% but on a statutory basis profits were down 10% due to a load of exceptional costs that seem to have mounted: \u00a31.9m from its Warrington supply chain centre, a \u00a32.1m hit from Norway as it transforms Dolly Dimples into Domino\u2019s, \u00a31.4m from joint venture store conversion in Germany and a further \u00a34.2m from tax, amortisation and German Market Access Fee increase charges recognised on the income statement as non-underlying items. Nevertheless the underlying picture remains positive. We note the company expects fewer stores to open this year, with management suggesting 60 new outlets in 2018 versus the 65-75 anticipated in April. This seems to reflect a more focused and disciplined approach to openings in what is undoubtedly a trickier market, but it might also signal some deeper worries about the UK market. Indeed, management struck a very cautious tone over the UK, saying that the trading environment \u2018continues to be uncertain\u2019. The June data for Germany so far has been uniformly weak, says Dr Andreas Rees, economist at UniCredit Bank: Industrial production declined 0.9% mom, while exports treaded water (yesterday\u2019s new orders: -4.0%). However, in all three cases, the decreases (or stagnation) came after strong rises in the previous month. Going forward, we expect a moderate acceleration in the industrial sector on average, driven by global trade and solid domestic demand. However, it could become a bumpy ride over the summer months. July, August and sometimes September months are notorious for even more volatility, given the start and end of the vacation period. The usual suspect is the car sector. In the last five years, auto production embarked on a wild rollercoaster four times. Auto companies ramp up their production before the summer holidays with a technical setback following suit one month later. This effect then plays havoc with the headline figures in the corresponding two months. ...Next week on 14 August, German GDP growth for the second quarter will be released. We expect a plus of 0.4% qoq (or about 1\u00bd% annualised) with the forecast risks skewed to the downside (for 2018 as a whole: +2.0%). The disappointing industrial figures from Germany do not necessarily mean the country\u2019s economy is heading for trouble, suggests ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski: German industrial production took a hit in June, dropping by 0.9% MoM, from 2.4% MoM in May. On the year, industrial production was still up by 2.5%. The drop in industrial activity was broadly-based. After three strong months, activity in the construction sector also weakened, declining by 3.2% MoM. At the same time, exports held up relatively well, despite the delayed impact from last year\u2019s euro strengthening and trade tensions, remaining flat in June after a 1.8% MoM increase in May. As imports increased by 1.2% MoM, the seasonally-adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.3bn euro, from 20.4bn euro in May. After yesterday\u2019s disappointing new orders data, speculations about an imminent downswing of the German economy have gained new momentum. Intuitively, weak June data can be associated with trade tensions. However, in our view, this intuition is not so straight-forward. The analysis of the German economy requires more nuances. Here is our take on the state of the economy. 1. Despite this week\u2019s disappointments, comparing economic activity data with first quarter data still points to solid growth in Q2. Construction, industrial output and consumption should all be growth drivers, not drags, in Q2. Therefore, next week\u2019s GDP data could easily outperform the Eurozone\u2019s 0.3% growth rate 2. Looking at bilateral trade data, German exports have gone through a slight structural shift since the start of the year. While the share of German exports to the US is currently lower than in 2017, the share of other Eurozone countries like the Netherlands, Italy or Spain has actually increased. 3. At least in the short run, weakening demand for German products as illustrated by yesterday\u2019s disappointing new orders data could actually bring some relief. Particularly the manufacturing sector has been suffering from severe supply-side constraints, with capacity utilisation at its highest level since early 2008, a high lack of qualified workers and equipment as a limiting factor. Orders books are still richly filled and it would take a while before a protracted decline in demand would show in activity data. 4. Trade tensions are weighing on sentiment, not on activity. Obviously, trade tensions are the biggest threat to the German economy at the current juncture. Not so much due to tariffs or the possibility of tariffs but simply due to the fact that a potential trade war brings uncertainty and uncertainty brings a delay in investment decisions. All of this means that reading and understanding the German economy has become more complex. The long series of one-offs explaining the monthly, often highly volatile, ups and downs of German macro data since the start of the year has further complicated things. Just think of the harsh winter weather, strikes, timing of Easter and long weekends. For now, the only thing that is for sure is that the economy has lost its stellar performance but this does not mean at all that it has become an underperformer. Complexity does not mean failure. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With growing concerns about a no-deal Brexit in the past couple of days - as warned by such diverse personalities as Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Sir Liam Fox - the pound hit an 11 month low on Monday. However there has been a bit of relief for sterling - and UK holidaymakers heading overseas - in early trading today. Against the dollar the pound has edged up 0.12% to $1.2956, while against the euro it is virtually flat at \u20ac1.1199. Markets have other things to worry about too, with the continuing trade tensions between the US and China, and now the resumption of US sanctions on Iran. The latest move by the Trump administration has helped push the oil price higher on concerns about curtailed supplies from Iran. Brent crude is currently 0.37% better at $74.02 a barrel. A rising oil price is expected to lift commodity companies, and along with the weaker pound, should help the FTSE 100 to edge higher. Other European markets are also expected to move ahead, albeit only slightly: There is not much on the agenda in terms of economic news, but the key figures from Germany are already out. German industrial output fell 0.9% in June compared to forecasts of a 0.5% decline, while the country\u2019s trade surplus has come in at \u20ac19.3bn, lower than the expected \u20ac20.3bn. In terms of company news US billionaire Stan Kroenke, the majority owner of Arsenal football club, has made an offer to buy the rest of the club he does not already own. He has secured the backing of minority stakeholder Alisher Usmanov for a deal which values the premier league club at \u00a31.8bn. Elsewhere car dealer Pendragon has reported a 41% drop in profits to \u00a328.4m, with car sales hit by the scandal over diesel vehicles and the consumer uncertainty caused by Brexit. But Domino\u2019s Pizza has boosted half year sales by 12.8%, boosted by consumers ordering takeaways during the world cup and a continuing rise in online orders.",

China\u2019s recent threat to impose tariffs of 5% to 25% on a further $60 billion worth of U.S. goods (5,207 product lines) means that, together with the $50 billion of goods already announced, about 85% of its American imports (totaling $130 billion in 2017) could be taxed.</p> <p>The threat is in response to the Trump administration last week announcing that it may increase its proposed tariff rate on Chinese imports valued at about $200 billion to 25% from 10%. Together with the previously-announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, the total amount of $250 billion represents about 50% of the value of China\u2019s annual exports to the U.S. in 2017.</p> <p>\u201cWith China running out of room to retaliate on goods (i.e., 85% versus 50% coverage), China could opt to pursue non-tariff actions affecting services and investments from the U.S.,\u201d said S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst David Tesher.</p> <p>The U.S. has a net services surplus with China. A retaliation that spilled over into services could hurt U.S. sectors that rely on China\u2019s expanding import market for growth. This step-up in tensions could also exacerbate investor worries about China, damaging business and consumer confidence and growth prospects.

David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US has reimposed sanctions against this morning, with an executive order signed by President Trump that targets financial transactions involving the US dollar, the purchase of commercial plans and metals including gold and the Iranian automotive sector coming into effect. From a financial markets point of view, the price of crude oil could be where these decisions are most keenly felt, with the increased animosity threatening to disrupt Tehran\u2019s significant output. This is unlikely to be reflected immediately, with Iranian production expected to remain at present levels for the time being, but should further more stringent sanctions come into play then we could well be set for a supply shock in the oil market which would trigger a sharp move higher.</p> <p>The complex nature of this situation means that it is not just the US and Iran that could be impacted, with the bulk of Iranian crude actually being sold to other countries. The issue lies in whether the US look to force allies to also shun oil from Iran, and if this occurs then there\u2019s a real chance that OPEC will struggle to make up the lost supply and this would drive the price of oil up. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b6969fee4b05f576d12d0b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:45:10.676Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Anyone trading with Iran won't be trading with US - Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the Iran sanctions, and President Trump has just tweeted:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1026762818773757955\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Iran sanctions have officially been cast.

Barclays said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[This] is the strongest consistent growth in our data history. UK domestic sectors have held up year to date and resilient spending should continue to support their near-term performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>It said the strength came from in-store spending, which grew by 2.9%, the strongest growth since April 2014. Online spending grew by 10.4%, which is weaker compared to the historical data. And Barclays warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are reasons to be cautious, as consumers remain negative about the general economy and appetite for large purchases remains muted. </p> <p>Outside influences, such as oil price inflation and FX, combine to push up spending on Petrol. Consumer confidence moved slightly lower in July, as negativity about the general economy persists. The appetite for major purchases remained muted, with consumers cautious about making significant spending commitments, evident in subdued spending on electronics, furniture, household appliances and vehicle sales.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This summer\u2019s heat wave and World Cup fever boosted consumer spending in July, with people spending on picnics, BBQs and pubs.</p> <p>People are making the most of the sunshine as spending on food increased 6.7% in the month, while more families are also going on day trips and doing outdoor activities. </p> <p>The World Cup effect also continued to boost spending in the month, with money spent in pubs rising 73% on the day of England\u2019s semi-final, as people cheered on their team. Overall the amount shelled out in pubs increased by 17% in July \u2013 marking the biggest rise since April last year.</p> <p>However, the hangover is looming as people admit they are worried about the effect of last week\u2019s interest rate rise on their finances. The 0.25 percentage point hike last week will hit those who are in debt, including many who are already struggling to make ends meet. </p> <p>A third of those questioned said they were worried that the Bank of England\u2019s move would mean they have less money each month, while confidence in finances among those questioned dropped by 6 percentage points to 59%.</p> <p>This cautiousness is also shown in the fact that households are still putting off buying big ticket items.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f479d26b2a1040c8ae0ca48695867d64c1b91b09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f479d26b2a1040c8ae0ca48695867d64c1b91b09/0_248_4173_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England supporters celebrate at the Lord Raglan Pub in London as England play Tunisia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England supporters celebrate at the Lord Raglan Pub in London as England play Tunisia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:41:02.372Z\">at 10.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b69616be4b05f576d12d077\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:23:35.267Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A reasonably strong performance from US markets on Monday is one of the reasons for a more positive mood in Asia (the Nikkei 225 was up 0.69%) and Europe.

Reasons to be cautious still abound however, with the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s overnight view that China is seeing a modest slowdown in growth reminding us that all is not entirely rosy out there, and this morning\u2019s decline in German industrial production added to this impression, coming as it does after yesterday\u2019s grim factory orders data.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b695e24e4b03096a5adfc1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:00:36.037Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The positive mood in stock markets is holding up as the morning progresses.</p> <p>With copper prices edging higher, mining shares are leading the FTSE 100 higher, with the leading UK index now up 0.69%.

The usual suspect is the car sector. In the last five years, auto production embarked on a wild rollercoaster four times. Auto companies ramp up their production before the summer holidays with a technical setback following suit one month later.

On the year, industrial production was still up by 2.5%. The drop in industrial activity was broadly-based. After three strong months, activity in the construction sector also weakened, declining by 3.2% MoM. At the same time, exports held up relatively well, despite the delayed impact from last year\u2019s euro strengthening and trade tensions, remaining flat in June after a 1.8% MoM increase in May. As imports increased by 1.2% MoM, the seasonally-adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.3bn euro, from 20.4bn euro in May.</p> <p>After yesterday\u2019s disappointing new orders data, speculations about an imminent downswing of the German economy have gained new momentum. Intuitively, weak June data can be associated with trade tensions. However, in our view, this intuition is not so straight-forward. The analysis of the German economy requires more nuances. Here is our take on the state of the economy.</p> <p>1. Despite this week\u2019s disappointments, comparing economic activity data with first quarter data still points to solid growth in Q2. Construction, industrial output and consumption should all be growth drivers, not drags, in Q2. Therefore, next week\u2019s GDP data could easily outperform the Eurozone\u2019s 0.3% growth rate</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac6622ce5b06b20d60d6445bdf071e8f9aff690\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac6622ce5b06b20d60d6445bdf071e8f9aff690/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volkswagen cars wait to be shipped at the harbour in Bremerhaven, nothern Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volkswagen cars wait to be shipped at the harbour in Bremerhaven, nothern Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrik Stollarz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>2. Looking at bilateral trade data, German exports have gone through a slight structural shift since the start of the year. While the share of German exports to the US is currently lower than in 2017, the share of other Eurozone countries like the Netherlands, Italy or Spain has actually increased.</p> <p>3. At least in the short run, weakening demand for German products as illustrated by yesterday\u2019s disappointing new orders data could actually bring some relief. Particularly the manufacturing sector has been suffering from severe supply-side constraints, with capacity utilisation at its highest level since early 2008, a high lack of qualified workers and equipment as a limiting factor. Orders books are still richly filled and it would take a while before a protracted decline in demand would show in activity data.</p> <p>4. Trade tensions are weighing on sentiment, not on activity. Obviously, trade tensions are the biggest threat to the German economy at the current juncture. Not so much due to tariffs or the possibility of tariffs but simply due to the fact that a potential trade war brings uncertainty and uncertainty brings a delay in investment decisions.</p> <p>All of this means that reading and understanding the German economy has become more complex. The long series of one-offs explaining the monthly, often highly volatile, ups and downs of German macro data since the start of the year has further complicated things. Just think of the harsh winter weather, strikes, timing of Easter and long weekends. For now, the only thing that is for sure is that the economy has lost its stellar performance but this does not mean at all that it has become an underperformer. Complexity does not mean failure.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b693a7ee4b03096a5adfb6d\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T06:45:41.020Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: Pound in focus, German industrial output disappoints</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>With growing concerns about a no-deal Brexit in the past couple of days - as warned by such diverse personalities as Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Sir Liam Fox - the pound hit an 11 month low on Monday.</p> <p>However there has been a bit of relief for sterling - and UK holidaymakers heading overseas - in early trading today.

      "bodyText": "Just when things were meant to be getting better for Wonga, it emerged at the weekend that the payday lender\u2019s investors had to rescue it with a \u00a310m capital injection. The emergency fundraising is the latest episode in Wonga\u2019s rapid rise and fall. Just six years after the company was touted for a flotation that would have valued it at more than $1bn (\u00a3770m), it is reported to be worth just $30m. It was 10 years ago last month that Wonga launched, promising instant decisions to online borrowers seeking short-term credit \u2013 at high prices. The company grew quickly, backed by private equity investors, and was feted as one of a new breed of digital innovators in the finance industry. It defended annual interest rates of more than 5,000% by saying loans were for days or weeks rather than a year. But political pressure started to build against payday lenders as stories emerged of vulnerable customers struggling to repay. Though Wonga claimed its customers were web-savvy people who chose not to use big banks, the Guardian found hard-pressed borrowers unable to gain credit elsewhere. Wonga\u2019s profit tripled in 2011 to \u00a345.8m on revenues of \u00a3185m as the company made 2.5m loans. But then, in 2013, came a regulatory clampdown as the Office for Fair Trading ordered payday lenders to clean up their businesses and the Financial Conduct Authority announced a cap on the total cost of a loan. Chief executive and co-founder Errol Damelin quit in November 2013 and left the company seven months later. Andy Haste, the former chief executive of FTSE 100 insurer RSA, joined as chair and pledged to improve business practices, while making Wonga smaller and less profitable. Haste drafted in a new management team, led by chief executive Tara Kneafsey, to rebuild the company. Wonga reported losses of \u00a380m in 2015 and \u00a366m in 2016 but was aiming to return to profit in 2017. With its accounts due to appear in the next couple of months, that goal now looks highly unlikely. Wonga has been hit by an unexpected surge in customer compensation claims linked to loans it made before 2014. That year, an FCA crackdown prompted Haste to write off \u00a3220m in debts and interest for 330,000 customers. But claims management firms that are targeting payday lenders have set off a renewed torrent of complaints. Figures from the Financial Ombudsman show complaints about Wonga leaping to 2,347 in the second half of 2017, from just 269 two years earlier. In April 2017, about 10% of claims against payday lenders were made through claims management companies, but a year later the figure was close to two-thirds. The ombudsman is also reportedly giving borrowers more time to bring cases, putting further pressure on Wonga. The result is a big enough jump in provisions for customer compensation to threaten the company\u2019s survival. James Daley, managing director of campaign group Fairer Finance, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that Wonga are in this position because they exploited a market that was loosely regulated. They were in the vanguard of giving people quick access to credit with high prices and high fees and they didn\u2019t treat their customers well.\u201d Claims management companies have targeted payday lenders as potential payouts from payment protection insurance start to dwindle. PPI customers have a year left to make complaints before the FCA\u2019s deadline. Wonga received almost 1,000 more claims in the second half of 2017 than in the first half. Balderton Capital, Accel Partners and 83 North, who stumped up cash in the emergency fundraising, were among the investors that backed it early on. Damelin has moved on to become one of the UK\u2019s leading investors in technology startups, including Purple Bricks, the online estate agent. \u201cAs I understand it, they\u2019ve done their best to clean their act up, but they are reaping what they sowed in those early years,\u201d said Daley. \u201cWhen Wonga was in the market they were making money and now they are handing it all back again.\u201d Wonga\u2019s maximum interest rate is now 1,509%, though that is for a 14-day loan, meaning a customer would pay \u00a316.80 to borrow \u00a3150. Campaigners say the industry has reformed since regulators intervened but that households under strain from austerity measures remain vulnerable. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cWe now see half the number of payday loan problems that we did in the dark days before the cap on interest and charges, so we know this type of regulation works. While many of these problems are from before 2015, people still come to us after being sold loans they cannot pay back because rules on affordability are simply not good enough.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Just when things were meant to be getting better for Wonga, it emerged at the weekend that the payday lender\u2019s investors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/04/wonga-investors-stump-up-10m-to-save-payday-lender-from-going-bust\">had to rescue it with a \u00a310m capital injection</a>.</p> <p>The emergency fundraising is the latest episode in Wonga\u2019s rapid rise and fall. Just six years after the company was touted for a flotation that would have valued it at more than $1bn (\u00a3770m), it is reported to be worth just $30m.<br></p> <p>It was 10 years ago last month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/21/wonga-timeline-from-good-start-to-bad-loans\">Wonga launched</a>, promising instant decisions to online borrowers seeking short-term credit \u2013 at high prices. The company grew quickly, backed by private equity investors, and was feted as one of a new breed of digital innovators in the finance industry. It defended annual interest rates of more than 5,000% by saying loans were for days or weeks rather than a year.<br></p> <p>But political pressure started to build against payday lenders as stories emerged of vulnerable customers struggling to repay. Though Wonga claimed its customers were web-savvy people who chose not to use big banks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/01/wonga-real-cost-payday-loan\">the Guardian found hard-pressed borrowers unable to gain credit elsewhere</a>.<br></p> <p>Wonga\u2019s profit tripled in 2011 to \u00a345.8m on revenues of \u00a3185m as the company made 2.5m loans. But then, in 2013, came a regulatory clampdown as the Office for Fair Trading ordered payday lenders to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/mar/06/payday-lenders-reform-ultimatum-oft\">clean up their businesses</a> and the Financial Conduct Authority announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/02/payday-loans-caps-fca\">cap on the total cost of a loan</a>.<br></p> <p>Chief executive and co-founder Errol Damelin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/13/wonga-founder-errol-damelin-quits-company-director\">quit in November 2013</a> and left the company seven months later. Andy Haste, the former chief executive of FTSE 100 insurer RSA, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/14/wonga-appoints-chairman-andy-haste\">joined as chair</a> and pledged to improve business practices, while making Wonga smaller and less profitable.<br></p> <p>Haste drafted in a new management team, led by chief executive Tara Kneafsey, to rebuild the company. Wonga reported losses of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/04/wonga-losses-more-than-double-payday-loans\">\u00a380m in 2015</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/28/wonga-65m-loss-annual-report-2016-newcastle-united-sponsorship\">\u00a366m in 2016</a> but was aiming to return to profit in 2017. With its accounts due to appear in the next couple of months, that goal now looks highly unlikely.<br></p> <p>Wonga has been hit by an unexpected surge in customer compensation claims linked to loans it made before 2014. That year, an FCA crackdown prompted Haste to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/oct/02/wonga-writes-off-customer-debt\">write off \u00a3220m in debts and interest for 330,000 customers</a>.</p> <p>But claims management firms that are targeting payday lenders have set off a renewed torrent of complaints. Figures from the Financial Ombudsman show complaints about Wonga leaping to 2,347 in the second half of 2017, from just 269 two years earlier.</p> <p>In April 2017, about 10% of claims against payday lenders were made through claims management companies, but a year later the figure was close to two-thirds.<br></p> <p>The ombudsman is also reportedly giving borrowers more time to bring cases, putting further pressure on Wonga. The result is a big enough jump in provisions for customer compensation to threaten the company\u2019s survival.<br></p> <p>James Daley, managing director of campaign group Fairer Finance, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that Wonga are in this position because they exploited a market that was loosely regulated. They were in the vanguard of giving people quick access to credit with high prices and high fees and they didn\u2019t treat their customers well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd055a748978f50609e1a0a7734e1e662497296a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd055a748978f50609e1a0a7734e1e662497296a/0_170_5106_3064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Sheen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor Michael Sheen launched a scheme to end high interest lenders like Wonga earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Claims management companies have targeted payday lenders as potential payouts from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/payment-protection-insurance\">payment protection insurance</a> start to dwindle. PPI customers have a year left to make complaints before the FCA\u2019s deadline. Wonga received almost 1,000 more claims in the second half of 2017 than in the first half.</p> <p>Balderton Capital, Accel Partners and 83 North, who stumped up cash in the emergency fundraising, were among the investors that backed it early on. Damelin has moved on to become one of the UK\u2019s leading investors in technology startups, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/18/when-it-comes-to-estate-agents-the-future-could-be-purple\">Purple Bricks</a>, the online estate agent.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs I understand it, they\u2019ve done their best to clean their act up, but they are reaping what they sowed in those early years,\u201d said Daley. \u201cWhen Wonga was in the market they were making money and now they are handing it all back again.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wonga\u2019s maximum interest rate is now 1,509%, though that is for a 14-day loan, meaning a customer would pay \u00a316.80 to borrow \u00a3150. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/20/michael-sheen-launches-campaign-against-high-cost-lenders\">Campaigners</a> say the industry has reformed since regulators intervened but that households under strain from austerity measures remain vulnerable.<br></p> <p>Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cWe now see half the number of payday loan problems that we did in the dark days before the cap on interest and charges, so we know this type of regulation works. While many of these problems are from before 2015, people still come to us after being sold loans they cannot pay back because rules on affordability are simply not good enough.\u201d</p>",
