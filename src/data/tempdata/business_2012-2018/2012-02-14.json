    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With every day of prevarication and grandstanding over the future of Greece, Europe's power-brokers are nudging the crisis-hit country closer to the emergency exit. If Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy and the Brussels elite were deliberately trying to prolong the agony for Greece's battle-scarred political class, they couldn't have done a better job. After Lucas Papademos finally delivered a deal on the latest package of savage austerity measures last week, following tortuous negotiations with his coalition partners, he might have hoped for a quick rubber stamp from the \"troika\" of the EU, IMF and European Central Bank. Instead, he was sent back to the drawing board to come up with another \u20ac300m-worth of cuts, against the backdrop of violent street protests. Not only that, but his opposition partners were warned that they too must sign up, binding future Greek governments of whatever colour to detailed plans laid down by Brussels and Berlin. After the cuts were voted through by the Greek parliament over the weekend, Papademos must have hoped eurozone finance ministers would use scheduled meeting on Wdenesday to show some solidarity with his collapsing country. Yet , he was forced to deny rumours swirling in financial markets that the meeting had been called off altogether, because the eurocrats had not yet finished the paperwork. Jean-Claude Juncker later announced that they would hold a tele-conference. Luxembourg became the latest of the eurozone's wealthy \"core\" countries on Monday to suggest that if Greece left the single currency, it wouldn't be the end of the world.

    "webTitle": "Credit downgrade alert leaves George Osborne in a political fix", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In normal circumstances it should have been a good day for George Osborne. There has not been an awful lot for the chancellor to cheer about lately but news that inflation came down with a thump last month to 3.6% provided hope that the intense squeeze on living standards will abate during 2012. The better news on inflation was, however, only scant comfort to the chancellor as he sought to explain away the decision by Moody's to put Britain's AAA credit on negative watch. This was no easy task. Back in 2010 Osborne said the decision by one of Moody's rivals, S&amp;P, to take the UK off negative watch was a vote of confidence in his handling of the economy. On Tuesday he sought to explain why being back on negative outlook was also a ringing endorsement of the coalition's deficit-reduction strategy. It was all a bit tendentious, frankly. More than that, it leaves the government in a political fix because by this stage \u2013 almost two years into the parliament \u2013 the plan was for the economy to be steaming ahead, unemployment to be falling, exports to be booming, and for a sharply lower budget deficit to be fuelling speculation about voter-friendly tax cuts in the pre-election budgets of 2014 and 2015. The chancellor woke up to the prospect of a grilling on the Today programme about the possibility that the credit rating agencies were now having second thoughts about the viability of the government's economic approach. There is, according to Moody's, a one in three chance that the UK will suffer a downgrade in the next 18 months. Osborne is discovering that trying to make Britain's debts more sustainable in a low-growth environment is an extremely difficult trick to pull off. Few doubt Britain has a potential debt problem: it is not just that the country has borrowed more since the middle of the past decade, in cash terms, than it has since the dawn of time. It is also that there are a whole host of liabilities \u2013 from the cost of the private finance initiative to the future cost of public sector pensions \u2013 lurking off the balance sheet. In itself, the level of the national debt does not matter. The key relationship is between the country's accumulated debts over the centuries and the current size of the economy: the so-called debt to GDP ratio. When the economy is growing strongly \u2013 as in the three decades after the second world war \u2013 the debt ratio comes down quickly. If the economy is not growing, the only way it can be reduced is through tax increases and public spending cuts. But that can lead to still weaker growth, extra borrowing and higher debts. Countries end up running faster just to stand still, as is currently the case in Greece. Osborne is not yet in the same predicament as policy-makers in Athens; there will be no tightening of the austerity screw in the budget on 21 March and, instead, the issue for the chancellor and his advisers will be what scope he has, if any, to cut taxes or increase spending in an attempt to boost activity. There are those who say that the Treasury should follow the advice of Maynard Keynes who, back in the 1930s, argued that if governments concentrated on getting growth rates up and unemployment rates down the budget would look after itself. Osborne, however, is not a Keynesian and, even if he were, would be wary of taking the great man's advice. Britain is a much more open economy than it was in the 1930s and is far more dependent on foreign investors to finance its debts. As a result, turning deficit reduction on its head in favour of a go-for-growth approach would risk alienating financial markets, potentially causing both a collapse in the pound and a run on government gilts. Having spent the past two years trying to build up his credibility in the markets, Osborne is not going to U-turn now. There are, however, three other strategies open to him. The first is to adopt the Mr Micawber approach and hope that something will turn up. This is not impossible: the most recent survey evidence has suggested that the economy hit rock bottom at the end of 2011 and has now started to recover slowly. There is optimism, perhaps misplaced, that there is an end in sight to the eurozone crisis. The American economy seems to be on the mend. Support for activity is being provided by the Bank of England, which has just announced a third tranche of quantitative easing (QE), the process whereby money is pumped into the banking system through the purchase of gilts. Over the course of this year the lagged effects of QE coupled with the impact of falling inflation on real incomes will start to feed through into stronger activity. At the other end of the (currently deemed politically feasible) spectrum would be the sort of fiscal boost suggested by the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls. This is a five-point plan that includes a temporary reversal of last year's VAT increase to 20%, a cut in national insurance contributions for firms taking on extra workers, a \u00a32bn bank bonus tax to create jobs and build homes, a VAT holiday on home improvements, and the bringing forward of infrastructure projects. Balls has not put a specific price tag on his package, but it would probably cost in the region of \u00a315bn-\u00a320bn. This would provide a growth fillip to the economy, but not an especially big one, given that gross domestic product is about \u00a31.5tn, and part of the boost would leak overseas. Osborne's fear is that a modest giveaway budget would be the worst of all possible worlds: not big enough to make a material difference to growth but big enough to give the financial markets the collywobbles. In the event that interest rates on UK government bonds rose, thereby pushing up the cost of long-term mortgages and overdrafts, that might negate the impact of the tax cuts and the spending increases. Even so, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the ultimate arbiter of what is and what isn't doable in the budget, has said it would be possible for Osborne to lighten up without causing a backlash in the markets. The government is likely to spend less in the current financial year than it planned, and the IFS suggests the savings of about \u00a33bn could be recycled into higher public investment in future years. This sort of approach \u2013 Mr Micawber-plus \u2013 may look attractive to Osborne. It will look prudent and will show that he cares about growth. But there will be no fireworks. And scant impact on the economy.",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King is likely to signal on Wednesday that he stands ready to unleash a fresh round of quantitative easing if the economy fails to bounce back, after news that inflation dropped sharply last month, to 3.6%. The office for national statistics said the consumer price index had declined from 4.2% in December, to 3.6%, its lowest level since November 2010, as the impact of the coalition's VAT rise dropped out of the annual comparison. \"The confirmation that inflation is falling is likely to encourage the MPC to continue to gradually expand QE in order to give more support to the economy,\" said Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citi. King has long predicted that inflation would start to fall back towards the Bank's 2% target once one-off effects such as the VAT rise and last year's spike in oil prices started to ease. But when he sets out his latest assessment of the prospects for the economy at quarterly inflation report briefing on Wednesday, the governor is likely to repeat the sobering message, spelled out in an open letter to the chancellor, that, \"although inflation is now falling broadly as expected, the process of rebalancing still has a long way to go. Growth remains weak and unemployment is high.\" Under the terms of the Bank's independence, laid down by Gordon Brown in 1997, the governor must write to the chancellor each time inflation remains more than 1 percentage point above or below the government's 2% target for more than three months. The missive was the eighth time King has written to Osborne since the coalition took power. \"The unwelcome contribution of sluggish growth and high inflation over the past two years is a reflection of the need for the economy to rebalance following the financial crisis and associated deep recession, together with rises in the costs of energy and imports,\" King wrote. The Bank's monetary policy committee expects inflation to fall rapidly throughout 2012. At its February policy meeting, it announced a \u00a350bn increase in its asset purchase programme, taking the total of electronic money it has spent on trying to boost the economy to \u00a3325bn. Howard Archer, of the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said there should be a fresh decline in February, because many shops delayed passing on last year's VAT increase until the end of the January sales. \"Consumer price inflation should fall appreciably further,\" he added. VAT was increased from 17.5% to 20% last year as part of George Osborne's deficit-reduction plan. However, Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, stressed that despite the decline in inflation, living standards are still falling for many in Britain. \"With prices still increasing twice as fast as wages, workers are still getting poorer month-by-month while high unemployment and wage stagnation persists,\" he said. With Osborne determined to stick to his policy of austerity after the decision by the Moody's rating agency to cut the UK's outlook to negative, the Treasury is relying heavily on the Bank to boost the economy with its \u00a3325bn of quantitative easing. But King also used his letter to warn the chancellor that \"there is a limit to what monetary policy can achieve.\" Osborne replied that monetary policy is \"the first line of defence in the face of economic shocks\", and insisted that the government's deficit reduction strategy had created the room for the Bank to act. Retailers have been forced into discounting amid tough trading conditions on the high street. Over the past two months, inflation has fallen by 1.2 percentage points. The ONS said that was a larger decline over two months than at any time since 2008, when Alistair Darling cut VAT as part of his emergency rescue package. On the wider retail price index measure, which includes housing costs, inflation fell to 3.9%, from 4.8% in December, the ONS said. High inflation, and the resulting belt-tightening by workers who have faced declining real incomes, was blamed for much of the shortfall in economic growth in 2011, with GDP expanding by just 0.9%. Aside from the VAT cut, the ONS said the price of fuels had fallen as had \"products bought in restaurants and cafes\", tobacco, and vehicle maintenance and repair.",

Growth remains weak and unemployment is high.\"</p> <p>Under the terms of the Bank's independence, laid down by Gordon Brown in 1997, the governor must write to the chancellor each time inflation remains more than 1 percentage point above or below the government's 2% target for more than three months.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/inflation.htm\" title=\"\">The missive</a> was the eighth time King has written to Osborne since the coalition took power.</p> <p>\"The unwelcome contribution of sluggish growth and high inflation over the past two years is a reflection of the need for the economy to rebalance following the financial crisis and associated deep recession, together with rises in the costs of energy and imports,\" King wrote.</p> <p>The Bank's monetary policy committee expects inflation to fall rapidly throughout 2012.

      "bodyText": "The financial crisis has claimed many scalps \u2013 governments, banks, fraudsters by the dozen \u2013 but it has given a surprise fillip to one of Britain's most controversial sectors, the tobacco industry. The stock prices of stalwarts such as British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco have hit record highs in the past 12 months \u2013 with BAT doubling to \u00a330 as investors fled bank and retail shares in search of safer havens. Never mind that cigarettes kill six million people a year and the industry faces an onslaught from health campaigners who want to extinguish its commercial viability. On global stock exchanges, tobacco firms have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the financial dislocation in the developed world. Cigarette manufacturers are viewed by brokers as defensive stocks. They offer the holy grail of a predictable dividend yield of about 4% or more, much higher than the interest you would get from the bank, as well as a steady growth in earnings that feeds through to rising stock prices, ensuring capital growth. Martin Deboo, analyst at Investec Securities, says: \"These stocks are about the closest you can get to a bond on the stock market in that they offer a relatively stable income stream, not easy to find in the equities space.\" You may think it puzzling the industry is so successful when sales volumes are falling about 2% a year (excluding China which is dominated by state-run monopolies), fewer people in the developed world are smoking and governments are forever slapping higher taxes on manufacturers. Analysts say companies have found a neat solution to the problem. Not only do they pass on tax rises to smokers, as one would expect, they also impose an additional price increase to offset the lost sales that are inevitable every time excise duties are raised. A bigger tax burden provides the tobacco multinationals with the cover to boost profits and revenue by pushing through what critics say are inflated price increases. Protests from smokers are given short shrift, as they are viewed as undeserving of public sympathy. The mathematics of the business explains how companies such as Imperial Tobacco, which has about 40% of the British market, has boosted operating margins over 15 years from 45% to 65%. Deboo says the margins are high by stock market standards and show no sign of abating. The tobacco companies have escaped the shadow of the 1990s when litigation in the US hung over the shares. An industry-wide settlement of claims in 1998 began to change sentiment. Michael Prideaux, director of corporate and regulatory affairs at BAT, admits \"life is good at the moment\" and trumpets the firm's unbroken record of rising profitability over recent years. Rather than dwell on BAT's stellar share price performance, he focuses on business fundamentals. \"A real positive has been the opening up of eastern and central Europe,\" he says, where BAT last year generated income of \u00a31.7bn and operating profits of \u00a3360m. He takes issue with campaigners who say the industry is only growing because of lax regulation in developing countries where the upwardly mobile, as well as the not so upwardly mobile, are consumers of the biggest BAT brands \u2013 such as Dunhill, Kent and Pall Mall. \"Regulation is pretty tight everywhere; you would be surprised how strict they are in a country like Djibouti,\" he says. \"It's a myth that emerging economies are a soft touch.\" That assertion is hotly disputed by anti-smoking groups such as Ash (Action on Smoking and Health). Prideaux admits BAT is focusing on developing regions, \"but only because in countries such as India, incomes are rising per capita and there is a burgeoning middle class \u2026 so the growth potential is superior to what is on offer in more mature markets.\" BAT's figures show the Asia Pacific as the biggest contributor to profits and revenue in 2010, at \u00a31.3bn and \u00a33.8bn respectively, ahead of western Europe and Africa/Middle East. How long can share prices remain this strong? The question intrigues City investors, so it was with some alarm that last year they read a note penned by Adam Spielman, analyst at Citigroup, entitled: \"What if the last smoker quits in 2050?\" Spielman does not envisage problems in the short term as pricing power remains strong. But in perhaps 20, 30 or 40 years time, who knows? \"There will come a time when the percentage decline in volumes is such that price increases can no longer ensure a stable top (revenue) line,\" he says. \"For example, if you assume the industry will not be able to price up enough to offset volume declines of say 6%-7% \u2026 then that implies the pricing mechanism will not be able to maintain the profit pool in cigarettes in the UK past 2020 (the percentage of the British adult population which smokes has fallen from 52% in 1960 to 20% in 2008). \"By extension, a similar pattern will hold in much of the rest of Europe, Canada and Australia.\" He argues there is evidence the rate of volume decline is increasing, so there is a real possibility \u2013 under one plausible scenario \u2013 that by 2050 \"there will be no smokers left in many developed countries.\" Then, Spielman drops another bombshell: \"Smoking trends and regulations in emerging markets are often only five to 10 years behind those in developed markets.\" That raises the prospect of an industry heading towards extinction. \"No-one can know how it ends,\" insists Spielman.

We think it is still too early to make that call. <br> Tesco now identifies problems going back to the recession of 2009. It pushed down on costs too hard for too long, and began to corrode productivity. It now intends to re-establish its 'virtuous circle' sales growth model that served it so well for 15 plus years. It targets a five point plan: 1) Investment in store operations; 2) Rebalance price and promotion; 3) Improve store ambience; 4) More new product innovation especially fresh, and; 5) Improve communication.  The timing and impact means 'bill now menu later', with minimal 2012/13 growth guided but few remedy details yet available. And investors are being asked to back three years of remedy in just one year - since the corrosive impact of prior under-investment was getting worse towards the end of 2011, the new chief executive was not prepared to wait. This potentially suggests greater and quicker recovery, but must also carry more execution risk. Profits can recover, but initially via like for like sales volume growth rather than margin recovery. And Tesco's 2014/15 return on capital employed target must now be in jeopardy even if there are some offsets to the likely lower UK profit.  The broader risk is that Tesco destabilises UK food retail in trying to achieve its goals - something it maybe does not intend, but its current promotions are very aggressive. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Brammer</strong>, the industrial services group, was 20p better at 309p after a 41% jump in full year profits to \u00a329m and a 27% increase in its final dividend.

Finally Yell, the debt-laden directories group, lost 1.03p to 4.87p or more than 17% after another set of disappointing results. The Yellow Pages publisher is struggling to make the transition from print to digital media, and its third quarter figures showed a worse than expected 15% fall in revenues to \u00a3382m.

Lyn Graham-Taylor, a strategist at Rabobank in London, warned that the effect of the LTRO could be shortlived. \"The glut of liquidity put in by the ECB is trumping fundamentals \u2026 which is why we believe that Spain and Italy are getting away these auctions at the levels they are. We believe it isn't sustainable and the effects of the LTROs will begin to wane.\"",

Dig deeper, and the pretensions of the Worldwide name are further exposed. More than 60% of its international revenues of \u00a3557m are accounted for by carriers.</p> <p>The work is much less profitable than direct business \u2013 margins of 30% rather than 50% or 60% from enterprise and government customers.</p> <p>The desirable direct contracts would seem to be largely UK based, with the work of serving multinationals largely left to larger competitors such as BT Group or AT&amp;T.</p> <p>In the UK, CWW has contracts with 70 of the 100 largest blue chip companies, according to Barclays Capital, as well as the BBC and government departments such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. But even here there are problems.</p> <p>Analysts worry that its domestic network is subscale compared with BT's. And now that Virgin Media has decided to grow its corporate client base, BT has a clear competitor other than CWW.</p> <p>CWW could find a niche, as its peer Colt has done within the banking sector. And there is room to improve morale and the way the company is run. Pluthero's forthright management style wasn't for everyone, and senior staff came and went at speed. A period of stability would be welcomed by clients.</p> <p>So would better integration of Thus and Energis, the two UK telecoms companies hoovered up by Cable &amp; Wireless. At the end of last year, some customers were still receiving three bills, despite the fact that the most recent of these acquisitions took place in late 2008.</p> <p>Whether Darby opts for an auction or a turnaround may ultimately depend on how much he is offered for the business. The reported \u00a3700m is a low ball offer. CWW was worth \u00a32.5bn in April 2010 after its demerger, around 4.8 times underlying forecast earnings for 2012. Estimates have been slashed since then, with Barlcays predicting \u00a3383m for 2012, implying a \u00a31.8bn valuation if a 4.8 multiple is used.</p> <p>That valuation now looks rose tinted. Broker Sanford Bernstein has put the upper potential offer price at \u00a3900m, implying a share price of 32p, a 60% premium to Friday's undisturbed price. The company could be worth more if broken up.</p> <p>Can Darby boost the shares by 60% or more through a more clever use of his dumb pipes? Should offers materialise, he will find it hard to convince long suffering shareholders they should turn down the money and wait.</p>",

The top teams at both companies were rewarded with \u00a388m in cash bonuses, but by November 2011 Pluthero had been forced to leave his post as chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide (CWW), the company having swung to a \u00a3433m pre-tax loss without the Caribbean profits to mask its troubles. Despite the confusion caused by its name, CWW operates the UK and not the overseas businesses, and derives a third of its annual revenues from the dumb pipe work of carrying the traffic for other telecoms companies rather than those of its own direct corporate clients. According to the 2011 annual report, \u00a3700m of its \u00a32.2bn in annual revenues comes from carriers. Dig deeper, and the pretensions of the Worldwide name are further exposed. More than 60% of its international revenues of \u00a3557m are accounted for by carriers. The work is much less profitable than direct business \u2013 margins of 30% rather than 50% or 60% from enterprise and government customers. The desirable direct contracts would seem to be largely UK based, with the work of serving multinationals largely left to larger competitors such as BT Group or AT&amp;T. In the UK, CWW has contracts with 70 of the 100 largest blue chip companies, according to Barclays Capital, as well as the BBC and government departments such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. But even here there are problems. Analysts worry that its domestic network is subscale compared with BT's. And now that Virgin Media has decided to grow its corporate client base, BT has a clear competitor other than CWW. CWW could find a niche, as its peer Colt has done within the banking sector. And there is room to improve morale and the way the company is run. Pluthero's forthright management style wasn't for everyone, and senior staff came and went at speed. A period of stability would be welcomed by clients. So would better integration of Thus and Energis, the two UK telecoms companies hoovered up by Cable &amp; Wireless. At the end of last year, some customers were still receiving three bills, despite the fact that the most recent of these acquisitions took place in late 2008. Whether Darby opts for an auction or a turnaround may ultimately depend on how much he is offered for the business. The reported \u00a3700m is a low ball offer. CWW was worth \u00a32.5bn in April 2010 after its demerger, around 4.8 times underlying forecast earnings for 2012. Estimates have been slashed since then, with Barlcays predicting \u00a3383m for 2012, implying a \u00a31.8bn valuation if a 4.8 multiple is used. That valuation now looks rose tinted. Broker Sanford Bernstein has put the upper potential offer price at \u00a3900m, implying a share price of 32p, a 60% premium to Friday's undisturbed price. The company could be worth more if broken up. Can Darby boost the shares by 60% or more through a more clever use of his dumb pipes? Should offers materialise, he will find it hard to convince long suffering shareholders they should turn down the money and wait.",

Moody's said that countries including the UK, France and Italy would be put on negative watch after citing \"uncertainty\" over Europe's handling of its ongoing debt crisis. The possible loss of the UK's much coveted triple-A status will be a bitter blow for the chancellor George Osborne who has staked his reputation on distancing Britain from the ailing eurozone. Riots and looting on the streets of Athens highlighted the confusion at the highest levels of the European political establishment over how to deal with the mounting debts faced by Greece. Brussels rejected handing over \u20ac130bn without further commitments from the Athens parliament and proposals for further cuts to be implemented this year. Osborne was expected to stick to his aim of reducing Britain's \"structural deficit\" by 2017 when he stands up in parliament next month to deliver his third budget since the coalition took power in 2010. But the verdict of Moody's will add to the pressure from opposition MPs and many economists on him to change course. Moody's said it was concerned that he would miss previous targets to cut the deficit by 2015. The AAA rating is the highest awarded to a country and allows it to borrow at the lowest interest rates. The rating agency said it was making the changes \"in order to reflect their susceptibility to the growing financial and macroeconomic risks emanating from the euro area crisis.\" The Bank of England and the Treasury's independent Office for Budget Responsibility have both lowered their expectations of economic growth for this year to below 1% from above 2.5% in last year's forecasts made last year. Osborne said that Moody's decision meant the government should stick to its course: \"This is proof that, in the current global situation, Britain cannot waver from dealing with its debts. \"Moody's are explicit that it is only the government's 'necessary fiscal consolidation' that is stopping an immediate downgrade, which would happen if there were any 'reduced political commitment to fiscal consolidation including discretionary loosening'.

    "webTitle": "'True' UK unemployment is 6.3m, says TUC", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The true state of British unemployment is more than double its current level at 6.3 million people, if alternative measures including adults stuck in part-time work are used, according to research published on Tuesday. The TUC, the umbrella body for UK trade unions, said the total is swelled beyond the official figure of 2.68 million if new categories such as underemployed adults are included. Britain bases its jobless data on a widely used formula that defines an adult as unemployed if they are out of work and have actively sought a new post over the past month. However, the TUC said incorporating six measures of joblessness that are common in the US would paint the UK job market in a much bleaker light. Those include unemployed people who want work but have not actively sought it for six weeks, who number more than 2.2 million in the UK, and \"underemployed\" adults who are in part-time work because they cannot find full-time work, who add a further 1.3 million to the unemployment total. Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, said tackling the wider unemployment problem should be the government's \"number one priority\". He said: \"Our jobs crisis is not confined to those out of work. Nearly two million people are being forced to take low-paid, insecure, short hours jobs because of the lack of proper full-time employment. This means people are taking home much less pay, which is putting a real strain on family budgets. When ministers say there are plenty of jobs out there, they are ignoring the sheer numbers of people looking for work, as well as the suitability and location of the jobs available.\" Figures for unemployment have proved controversial since the total passed the 1 million mark in 1972. During the 1980s the Thatcher government was accused of adopting youth training schemes to keep the total from soaring towards 4 million. Later, the Major government and its Labour successors allowed many long-term unemployed to switch to disability benefits. All countries have faced similar criticism. The US has kept its unemployment rate from straying much above the all important 10% level by excluding the long-term unemployed, while Germany's extensive youth training and apprenticeship schemes have come under increasing criticism for providing low levels of support to young people with poor school qualifications. According to the TUC analysis, the UK has experienced a significant rise in the underemployment phenomenon over the past two decades, with the total standing at 1.3 million compared with 802,000 in 1993. The TUC added that \"total\" unemployment in 1993 using the US measures was 6.1 million. Tax credits, which top up in-work incomes, have played a major role since they were launched in 2003 in the shift to part-time work, because they allow workers to maintain a large proportion of their full-time wage. Cuts in tax credits over the next two years are expected to push many middle-income groups on to the official unemployment queues, in order to qualify for housing and other out-of-work benefits. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions defended the underemployed total, saying that being in some form of employment was better than having no job at all. \"It is important that people are taking those first steps into employment through part-time work or jobs in different sectors as it provides vital experience and skills that employers will look for when the economy and labour market improve.\" The spokesperson added that jobs are available, with about 463,000 vacancies in the economy, though before the 2008 financial crash the number of vacancies was above 900,000. A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found British companies are preparing to lay off even more workers this year as they prepare for a bleak 2012, marred by recession and low consumer confidence. A huge shake-out from the public sector will add to the government's preferred International Labour Organisation measure of unemployment, pushing the total to almost 3m. Official data published this week is expected to show rising unemployment and a jump in the number of people signing on for jobless benefits. The institute said nervous employers were reluctant to hire against a backdrop of slack demand, obstacles to securing bank loans and worries about skills shortages. Some were cutting their workforces.",
