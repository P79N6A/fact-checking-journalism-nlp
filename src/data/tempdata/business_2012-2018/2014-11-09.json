It was while working in Zambia during the 1980s that Simon Berry first noticed he could buy a bottle of Coca-Cola wherever he went. So, some 25 years later, his charity ColaLife began sending out anti-diarrhoea drugs to isolated villages in the southern African country using the space in the crates. But eventually, it had to abandon the idea. \u201cWe won all these awards,\u201d says Berry. \u201cWe won product design of the year. We won packaging design of the year in the United States. \u201cWe have won health innovation awards and we had to walk away from all of that and do what the market was telling us \u2013 and the market was telling us that that idea of putting [medicines in] the crates was very cool but actually not relevant. The real finding was that it wasn\u2019t the space in the crates that was important, it was the space in the market.\u201d It turned out that because people wanted the health kits, the clever distribution didn\u2019t matter. The story of ColaLife illustrates how sometimes, despite the best-planned ideas, organisations can be surprised by what lies around the corner. People wanted to buy, so the crates were redundant. \u201cThe relevant thing was that people want it [the kits], it works, and retailers can make a profit.\u201d Sales continued to rise, and more than 51,000 kits have been sold since September 2012. \u201cIt was worrying initially. We thought, \u2018We got all this recognition and actually it is not important\u2019,\u201d says Berry. \u201cBut the main thing is saving children\u2019s lives \u2013 not being cool and winning awards. We had shown we can have this massive impact by creating a desirable product and getting it out into the shops \u2026 but we had the freedom to move away from the idea of fitting [medicines] in crates, because not everyone sells Coca-Cola.\u201d The need to take note of what the market really wants has also been a salutary lesson for the Irish packaging company JJ O\u2019Toole, which supplies bags to Selfridges, among other retailers. When a 15% (now 22%) levy on plastic bags was introduced in Ireland in 2002, the company lost 40% of its turnover overnight. \u201cNobody thought that it was going to have such an immediate impact,\u201d says the company\u2019s managing director, Vicki O\u2019Toole. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t imagine. Overnight [after the levy] people were putting their groceries into trolleys without the bags.\u201d The drop in revenues meant that some staff had to be laid off but JJ O\u2019Toole eventually went back to its roots, specialising once again in paper. Before the levy, 80% of its sales had been in plastic packaging and the rest in paper. Afterwards, those figures were reversed. \u201cIt came about because we had no choice. It was like reinventing ourselves all over again and quickly finding new sources, new suppliers, new manufacturers,\u201d she says.",

    "webTitle": "Sir Maurice Hodgson obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Maurice Hodgson, who has died aged 94, was a reforming chairman of ICI during the 1970s and 80s, despite a serious eye complaint that left him close to blindness. In 1981 he shocked the City by cutting the ICI dividend when the company was the flagship of British industry, but he laid the foundations for its renaissance later in the decade under his successors. Later he mounted a brief but unsuccessful attempt to revive Dunlop as an independent company, and was chairman of British Home Stores (now BHS) for five years. Hodgson became chairman in 1978, after a decade in which ICI had variously tried a \u201cdash for growth\u201d, expensive and ultimately futile downstream investments in the textile industry, and significant international expansion. His predecessor, Sir Rowland Wright, had been a stop-gap. But as general manager and then director responsible for planning, Hodgson had started to bring the rival investment demands of competing ICI baronies under better control. As chairman, as well as attacking costs determinedly and stressing return on capital, he started to review the areas in which ICI should be involved, from the then almost heretical viewpoint that it was too widely spread. A token of his new realism was the decision to abandon ICI\u2019s inefficient production of polyethylene (polythene) even though it had been one of the company\u2019s proudest inventions. Events buffeted him \u2013 the lorry drivers\u2019 strike and the winter of discontent \u2013 and in the first few years of Thatcherism, ICI saw a third of its UK customers vanish. The strong pound made things even worse. In 1981, with profits disappearing out of the door, Hodgson and his board decided to cut the dividend. It was unheard of, a dramatic warning signal of British industry\u2019s distress. The shock waves were not forgotten in the City for 20 years; the government was not pleased. In the midst of the storm, his colleagues admired Hodgson\u2019s courage, determination and unflappability. He continued to take the long view, forecasting in the Guardian in the dark days of 1981 a resurgence of interest in chemicals in the mid-80s, from which his successors duly benefited. Later chairmen acknowledged that it was Hodgson\u2019s rethinking that lay behind the big changes ICI soon made, and even contributed to the demerger of Zeneca in 1993. He accepted the shift of emphasis away from heavy chemicals towards the lighter end and pharmaceuticals, which vested interests on the ICI board had blocked in the 70s. The public kudos went to his successor, John Harvey-Jones, picked in 1982 as an agent of change after a board decision so tight that Hodgson, against previous ICI practice, had been called upon to take conclusive soundings. Harvey-Jones\u2019s flamboyant style, combined with an upturn in the business cycle, helped ICI to post the first billion-pound profit, but he always credited Hodgson : \u201cFor sheer calculated courage, I have never known his equal.\u201d His achievements were more remarkable considering his failing sight. Hodgson had been a possible candidate for the chairmanship in 1975, but ruled himself out because of eye problems. As that worsened, he had resorted to increasingly ingenious devices to compensate. His secretary read the endless board papers aloud, extra lights and projectors were brought in and he taught himself to listen to a tape at two and a half times speed. But surgery could not be avoided. The first operation left the eye blind; he was faced with a similar operation on his remaining good eye. A keen horse-racing man, he described the choice as \u201cdouble or quits\u201d. This time the operation succeeded. While chairman, he fulfilled an ambition and bought a share in a horse, Double Florin. At an annual consultative meeting he was asked by shop stewards about its chances in the afternoon race. His reply \u2013 \u201cIt might be worth a bob or two\u201d \u2013 brought a rush of union money, and undying respect when it came home at long odds. Hodgson was born in Bradford and took a well-trodden path into ICI by way of the local grammar school and first-class honours in chemistry at Merton College, Oxford. In 1942 he joined ICI\u2019s fertiliser and synthetic products group at Billingham on Teesside, one of the company\u2019s power centres. He progressed from research to plant management until, in 1955, his qualities of clear thinking were recognised by his selection for the company\u2019s small US subsidiary, ICI (New York) Ltd, then pondering expansion in the US after its pre-war global partnership with Dupont had been ruled as anti-trust. After two years as head of ICI\u2019s technical department, with the formative responsibility of scrutinising capital expenditure proposals, in 1960 Hodgson became a director of the heavy organics division, which ran the key petrochemicals business, becoming a deputy chairman in 1964. Two years later he was back at Millbank as the first general manager, company planning, a move reflecting both the increasing complexity of ICI and his analytical capabilities. In 1970 he joined the board as planning and commercial director, and two years later was a deputy chairman. Hodgson was knighted in 1979, but had less success after ICI. He joined British Home Stores as chairman in 1982 and also did the chief executive job for three difficult years until 1985. In 1984 he took over as chairman of the failing Dunlop company, but his attempt to revive it, bringing in Michael Edwardes, fresh from British Leyland, were swept away when it was rapidly taken over and dismembered by BTR. In spite of his partial blindness, Hodgson enjoyed swimming, fishing and his horse racing. He also pursued a range of business interests and showed a continuing interest in ICI, which for years included a pilgrimage to the annual Wilton smoking concert on Teesside \u2013 at which junior staff took off the company\u2019s management. His wife, Norma (nee Fawcett), whom he married in 1945, died in 2002. He is survived by a son and a daughter. \u2022 Maurice Arthur Eric Hodgson, industrialist, born 21 October 1919; died 1 October 2014",

      "body": "<p>During the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, Navid Khonsari was on the way to Canada with his family, escaping the Iranian Revolution. But it never stopped haunting him. </p> <p>Khonsari, the founder of Ink Stories in Brooklyn, is the picture of the successful American entrepreneur. Khonsari has worked on some of the world\u2019s most popular video games, including Grand Theft Auto, one of the most popular \u2013 and controversial \u2013 video games of all time. His corner desk overlooks the open Ink Stories office, a multimedia production company he co-founded with his wife Vassiliki Khonsari.

He sports the look of a lot of Brooklyn creatives: interesting eyeglasses, turquoise pants, a crisp oxford shirt and bulky headphones. <br></p> <p>But Khonsari can\u2019t get out of his mind what it would have been like to stay in Iran. His new video game, 1979 Revolution, is based on a protagonist named Reza who stayed behind in Iran long after Khonsari\u2019s own family left. <br></p> <p>Reza who lives in 1970s Tehran, as did Khonsari, is \u201cswept away by the passion that he sees in the streets.\u201d Khonsari recalls his own excitement as a kid to see tanks rolling down the street and a sea of protestors. Despite Khonsari\u2019s young age at the time, the power of the people was palpable. </p> <p>Their paths diverse there. The fictional Reza remains in Iran throughout the revolution and its aftermath.

      "bodyText": "During the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, Navid Khonsari was on the way to Canada with his family, escaping the Iranian Revolution. But it never stopped haunting him. Khonsari, the founder of Ink Stories in Brooklyn, is the picture of the successful American entrepreneur. Khonsari has worked on some of the world\u2019s most popular video games, including Grand Theft Auto, one of the most popular \u2013 and controversial \u2013 video games of all time. His corner desk overlooks the open Ink Stories office, a multimedia production company he co-founded with his wife Vassiliki Khonsari. Bits of gold and diamond glint on Khonsari\u2019s fingers, wrists and neck. He sports the look of a lot of Brooklyn creatives: interesting eyeglasses, turquoise pants, a crisp oxford shirt and bulky headphones. But Khonsari can\u2019t get out of his mind what it would have been like to stay in Iran. His new video game, 1979 Revolution, is based on a protagonist named Reza who stayed behind in Iran long after Khonsari\u2019s own family left. Reza who lives in 1970s Tehran, as did Khonsari, is \u201cswept away by the passion that he sees in the streets.\u201d Khonsari recalls his own excitement as a kid to see tanks rolling down the street and a sea of protestors. Despite Khonsari\u2019s young age at the time, the power of the people was palpable. Their paths diverse there. The fictional Reza remains in Iran throughout the revolution and its aftermath. His path is a complicated one. Khonsari describes Reza\u2019s trajectory from politically impartial observer, to revolutionary hero, to public enemy number one. Reza\u2019s life is being assembled and planned in a buzzing office in Brooklyn\u2019s Dumbo neighborhood \u2013 a once industrial area that is now filled with lofts commanding astonishing views of the Manhattan skyline and the pricey mortgages to match. A handful of young Ink Stories employees buzz around the office in service to the fictional Reza. They answer phones and prepare walls for future whiteboards and the Ink Stories logo, a boy with a hat that looks like a fez. A smattering of Persian rugs warm up the polished cement floor and a grid of storyboard illustrations are taped to a wall. 1979 Revolution is slated for release by spring 2015, playable on PCs, consoles and tablets. But can the complexities of the Iranian revolution and its vast diaspora, be captured in a video game? Khonsari has no doubts. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a good understanding of the entire eco-system of political philosophies.\u201d What makes it work is the player\u2019s viewpoint \u2013 1979 Revolution is not a traditional first-person shooter game like Grand Theft Auto.

The Khonsaris coined the term \u201cV\u00e9rit\u00e9 Games\u201d to describe 1979 Revolution and their future projects, which could potentially explode into a new gaming genre.

One of her films is about the Kamakia lovers in Greece \u2013 men who seduced female tourists \u2013 where she\u2019s spent summers with her extended Greek family. With these creative influences, experts say that 1979 Revolution defies categorization. \u201cThe way it positions history and experiential game play is pretty unique,\u201d says video game analyst Billy Pidgeon after looking at a 1979 Revolution sample clip. It delights Pidgeon that the game evades easy labels: it is visually sophisticated, edgy, and based on a framework of facts \u2013 yet not didactic. From afar 1979 Revolution might have a whiff of the educational, but Khonsari is adamant that the game is first and foremost entertainment. \u201cI think if you go about this heavy handed,\u201d says Khonsari, \u201cyou kind of have one foot in the grave.\u201d Pidgeon believes the misogyny that\u2019s been unleashed during the recent GamerGate movement, which he calls \u201crancid,\u201d is a symptom of the growing popularity of non-traditional video games, some of which are created by women. \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than first person shooters,\u201d Pidgeon says of the stereotypical GamerGate gamer, \u201cand they hate it.\u201d The Khonsari family moved to Canada on December 22, 1979.

      "bodyText": "Imagine that at the start of 2014 you were an investor who liked to dabble in the commodity markets. You could sniff something going seriously wrong in Ukraine and you were alarmed by early reports of groups of militants marauding across northern and western Iraq. With hopes that the global economy would continue to strengthen, the smart money would have been on oil prices continuing to climb. That\u2019s what geopolitical tension plus robust demand usually means. On this occasion, though, the smart money was wrong. After standing at well over $110 a barrel in the summer, the cost of crude has collapsed. Prices are down by a quarter in the past three months. More oil has been pumped at a time when the global recovery has faltered, with traders caught unawares by the slowdown in China and renewed stagnation in the eurozone. That, though, is not the whole story. The fourfold increase in oil prices triggered by the embargo on exports organised by Saudi Arabia in response to the Yom Kippur war in 1973 showed how crude could be used as a diplomatic and economic weapon. History is repeating itself. Think about how the Obama administration sees the state of the world. It wants Tehran to come to heel over its nuclear programme. It wants Vladimir Putin to back off in eastern Ukraine. But after recent experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, the White House has no desire to put American boots on the ground. Instead, with the help of its Saudi ally, Washington is trying to drive down the oil price by flooding an already weak market with crude. As the Russians and the Iranians are heavily dependent on oil exports, the assumption is that they will become easier to deal with. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, allegedly struck a deal with King Abdullah in September under which the Saudis would sell crude at below the prevailing market price. That would help explain why the price has been falling at a time when, given the turmoil in Iraq and Syria caused by Islamic State, it would normally have been rising. The Saudis did something similar in the mid-1980s. Then, the geopolitical motivation for a move that sent the oil price to below $10 a barrel was to destabilise Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. This time, according to Middle East specialists, the Saudis want to put pressure on Iran and to force Moscow to weaken its support for the Assad regime in Syria. Turning on the oil spigots comes at a cost. The Saudis, like all other producers, have become accustomed to oil above $100 a barrel. The Arab spring in Libya and Egypt raised fears that the political unrest would spread. Oil revenues financed higher public spending, so Saudi Arabia needs the price to be above $90 a barrel to balance the books. But a bit of pain is acceptable. The Saudis are gambling that they can live with a lower oil price for longer than the Russians and the Iranians can, and that therefore the operation will be relatively short-lived. There is no question that this new manifestation of cold war muscle is hurting Russia. Oil and gas account for 70% of Russia\u2019s exports and the budget doesn\u2019t add up unless the oil price is above $100 a barrel. Moscow has foreign exchange reserves, but these are not unlimited. The rouble fell by 10% last week. That adds to the debt servicing costs of Russian firms, and the central bank is under pressure to push up interest rates, which should help stabilise the currency, but only at the expense of a deeper recession. But thus far, Russia\u2019s foreign policy does not appear to have been affected. Support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria remains strong and there were reports at the end of last week of Russian troops entering eastern Ukraine. It remains to be seen how Iran will react. In the meantime, the Middle East looks as unstable as it has ever done. Provided it is sustained, a falling oil price will boost global growth. Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics estimates that if the cost of Brent crude settles at $85 a barrel, the upshot will be a transfer of income from producers of oil to consumers of oil amounting to 0.9% of global GDP. As consumers tend to spend a higher proportion of their income than producers, demand will increase. The big winners will be the big oil consumers: China, India and Europe. Simultaneously, inflation will fall. The drop in the oil price so far is enough to ensure that headline inflation is around half a percentage point lower in advanced countries next year. That would be enough to take inflation below 1% in the UK and below zero in the eurozone. Lower inflation should help to boost consumer and business spending because budgets will stretch further. For the US, the picture is more mixed. Washington\u2019s willingness to play the oil card stems from the belief that domestic supplies of energy from fracking make it possible for the US to become the world\u2019s biggest oil producer. In a speech last year, Tom Donilon, then Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, said the US was now less vulnerable to global oil shocks. The cushion provided by shale oil and gas \u201caffords us a stronger hand in pursuing and implementing our national security goals\u201d. Recent US production of crude has certainly been impressive, with a jump of almost 50% from 5.7m barrels a day in 2011 to 8.4m barrels a day in the second quarter of 2014. This increase in supply has meant that any reduction in supplies from Iran or Russia due to sanctions can be absorbed without disrupting the global economy. But the sharp drop in the oil price will make some shale fields unviable. That is especially true of planned new developments, where a high price is needed to cover start-up costs. But it is also true of some of the more mature fields, where the rapid depletion of reserves has forced companies to go deeper \u2013 at greater expense \u2013 in search of supplies. At the weekend, George Osborne announced that he supported the idea of putting revenues from shale production in the north of England into a sovereign wealth fund for the north. The idea would be to prevent the proceeds being squandered on day-to-day spending, which \u2013 sadly \u2013 is what happened to the revenues from the North Sea. Friends of the Earth said the chancellor\u2019s intervention was a cynical ploy designed to win over strong opposition to fracking. It was certainly ill-timed. One side-effect of the US-Saudi attempt to drive down the oil price will be to prick the shale bubble.",

      "body": "<p>Imagine that at the start of 2014 you were an investor who liked to dabble in the commodity markets. You could sniff something going seriously wrong in Ukraine and you were alarmed by early reports of groups of militants marauding across northern and western Iraq.</p> <p>With hopes that the global economy would continue to strengthen, the smart money would have been on oil prices continuing to climb. That\u2019s what geopolitical tension plus robust demand usually means.</p> <p>On this occasion, though, the smart money was wrong. After standing at well over $110 a barrel in the summer, the cost of crude has collapsed. Prices are down by a quarter in the past three months. More oil has been pumped at a time when the global recovery has faltered, with traders caught unawares by the slowdown in China and renewed stagnation in the eurozone.</p> <p>That, though, is not the whole story. The fourfold increase in oil prices triggered by the embargo on exports organised by Saudi Arabia in response to the Yom Kippur war in 1973 showed how crude could be used as a diplomatic and economic weapon. History is repeating itself.</p> <p>Think about how the Obama administration sees the state of the world. It wants Tehran to come to heel over its nuclear programme. It wants Vladimir Putin to back off in eastern Ukraine. But after recent experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, the White House has no desire to put American boots on the ground. Instead, with the help of its Saudi ally, Washington is trying to drive down the oil price by flooding an already weak market with crude. As the Russians and the Iranians are heavily dependent on oil exports, the assumption is that they will become easier to deal with.</p> <p>John Kerry, the US secretary of state, allegedly struck a deal with King Abdullah in September under which the Saudis would sell crude at below the prevailing market price. That would help explain why the price has been falling at a time when, given the turmoil in Iraq and Syria caused by Islamic State, it would normally have been rising.</p> <p>The Saudis did something similar in the mid-1980s. Then, the geopolitical motivation for a move that sent the oil price to below $10 a barrel was to destabilise Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. This time, according to Middle East specialists, the Saudis want to put pressure on Iran and to force Moscow to weaken its support for the Assad regime in Syria.</p> <p>Turning on the oil spigots comes at a cost. The Saudis, like all other producers, have become accustomed to oil above $100 a barrel. The Arab spring in Libya and Egypt raised fears that the political unrest would spread. Oil revenues financed higher public spending, so Saudi Arabia needs the price to be above $90 a barrel to balance the books.</p> <p>But a bit of pain is acceptable. The Saudis are gambling that they can live with a lower oil price for longer than the Russians and the Iranians can, and that therefore the operation will be relatively short-lived.</p> <p>There is no question that this new manifestation of cold war muscle is hurting Russia. Oil and gas account for 70% of Russia\u2019s exports and the budget doesn\u2019t add up unless the oil price is above $100 a barrel. Moscow has foreign exchange reserves, but these are not unlimited. The rouble fell by 10% last week. That adds to the debt servicing costs of Russian firms, and the central bank is under pressure to push up interest rates, which should help stabilise the currency, but only at the expense of a deeper recession.</p> <p>But thus far, Russia\u2019s foreign policy does not appear to have been affected. Support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria remains strong and there were reports at the end of last week of Russian troops entering eastern Ukraine. It remains to be seen how Iran will react. In the meantime, the Middle East looks as unstable as it has ever done.</p> <p>Provided it is sustained, a falling oil price will boost global growth. Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics estimates that if the cost of Brent crude settles at $85 a barrel, the upshot will be a transfer of income from producers of oil to consumers of oil amounting to 0.9% of global GDP. As consumers tend to spend a higher proportion of their income than producers, demand will increase. The big winners will be the big oil consumers: China, India and Europe.</p> <p>Simultaneously, inflation will fall. The drop in the oil price so far is enough to ensure that headline inflation is around half a percentage point lower in advanced countries next year. That would be enough to take inflation below 1% in the UK and below zero in the eurozone. Lower inflation should help to boost consumer and business spending because budgets will stretch further.

      "bodyText": "If ever a company needed a boost, it\u2019s Tesco. So all eyes will be on tonight\u2019s debut screening of its Christmas advert, to be shown during the finale of Downton Abbey on ITV. Can a seasonal advert stop the rot and arrest falling sales after one of the toughest years in the beleaguered supermarket\u2019s history? The advert marks the end of a weekend of television packed with Christmas spots from major retailers, including John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer, Argos and Asda. Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons are also revving up to launch their Christmas campaigns this week as the countdown to the most important retail season of the year begins in earnest. Discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are both gunning to steal even more middle-class shoppers from the major chains over the festive season, have already launched glossy TV adverts showcasing their most luxurious foods. The annual battle to win the hearts and wallets of Christmas shoppers will see UK companies spend more than \u00a31.5bn on advertising campaigns. The biggest winner will be TV, which will book well over \u00a3700m in ad space for big-budget campaigns throughout November and December, as companies target the millions of viewers drawn to hit shows such as The X Factor. Last year Tesco was the biggest spending supermarket splashing out \u00a325m, followed by Asda, Morrisons, upstart Aldi and Sainsbury\u2019s, according to unoffical figures from data research firm Nielsen. But Tesco\u2019s spending didn\u2019t prevent the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket from having to issue a profit warning a few weeks later after sales had fallen over what its then chief executive, Phil Clarke, called a \u201cdisappointing\u201d Christmas. Nielsen is predicting that retailers will spend slightly less on advertising in the final quarter of this year, down 2% on 2013 to \u00a3359m, partly as a result of a switch to PR-based social media activity. But industry insiders say the biggest battle will be among the supermarkets. \u201cThe supermarket chains are spending a lot \u2013 they always do \u2013 but be prepared to see a supermarket ad in every break in peak time between now and Christmas,\u201d said Phil Hall, joint head of investment at MediaCom, which represents clients including Coca-Cola and Iceland. Tesco, which is struggling to win back shoppers amid a grocery market price war and a major blow to its credibility from an accounting scandal, has pinned its hopes on an advert which shows scenes of staff helping shoppers prepare for the big day, building to the unlikely climax of a festive light extravaganza in Wigan. The light show, extending across 78 metres of screens erected in front of the town\u2019s Tesco store, was put on last month in front of 800 local residents with the help of the lighting designers for the 2012 Olympics. Reflecting this year\u2019s trend for social media-linked campaigns, the event was a response to a tweet last year by Wigan shopper Claire Hannah, who had expressed disappointment about her local Tesco\u2019s lacklustre festive decorations. Ray Shaughnessy, creative director at Wieden + Kennedy, the ad agency behind the campaign, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s campaign is an important step change for Tesco. They are doing all sorts of unexpected things to help people have a brilliant Christmas. It won\u2019t just be about them making sure you get the best turkey on the table; it will be about making sure that people feel Christmassy too.\u201d The idea resembles Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s #followthefairies campaign, which began last week with small unbranded events such as creating real snow outside a primary school in Cornwall, handing gifts to night-shift workers and creating fairies made of lights above Newcastle\u2019s Tyne Bridge. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, M&amp;S\u2019s executive director of marketing and international, is lavishing at least a quarter of his campaign budget on social media; he predicts the \u201cbiggest online Christmas ever in the UK and the most social Christmas\u201d, fuelled by shoppers increasing preference for using mobile phones and tablet computers to plan and buy their gifts. John Lewis, however, already appears to be winning the online battle; it more than 6.5m hits in two days on the YouTube video of its advert featuring a young boy and a CGI penguin. That is already nearly half the views achieved over the whole Christmas season last year for The Bear &amp; The Hare, its Disney-style animation. Both M&amp;S and John Lewis say they are spending about the same as last year on their campaigns \u2013 John Lewis\u2019s totals \u00a37m \u2013 but changing the way they are spending the money, with more emphasis on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

      "bodyText": "The business lobby group CBI is gearing up for its annual conference tomorrow under the banner \u201cGrowth for All\u201d. Britain\u2019s self-proclaimed voice of business will be hearing from Ed Miliband and Archbishop of York John Sentamu as its members discuss \u201cshared prosperity\u201d and \u201chigher living standards for all\u201d. What\u2019s going on, you may ask? Has big business suddenly grown a conscience? It has certainly grown an awareness: an awareness that when public trust hits rock-bottom, the bottom line suffers. Another string of banking scandals, headlines about tax avoidance and news of exorbitant pay packets for those at the top are making life hard for the CBI\u2019s director-general, John Cridland. Rewind 10 months and his New Year message was that 2014 would be the year of the pay rise. He also vowed to make it a year in which business cleans up its image. \u201cIf 2013 was the year that business trust took a hammering on a range of issues from corporate taxation to energy prices, then 2014 must be the year that business leaders take action to rebuild that trust,\u201d Cridland declared. Well let\u2019s not talk about the pay rise \u2013 not least because there hasn\u2019t been one to talk about. But on the second point, there is also scant progress to report: so little progress that Cridland told the Guardian in an interview last week that making the case for pro-business policies was an uphill struggle. \u201cIt will be hard to win those arguments unless we put our own house in order,\u201d he said. Businesses know it is not just their collective ability to influence policy that is suffering. What they will really care about is what a bad reputation means closer to home. Is it costing sales? Is it deterring investors? On the customer front there is evidence that people do care more about the behaviour of companies, and technology is giving them the power to show it. The polling group YouGov has been tracking the reputation of people in power, both public and private: so alongside politicians, it monitors business leaders too. YouGov president Peter Kellner recently warned the Institute of Directors conference that it is not just the image of politics that has suffered a decade of decline. All forms of power and authority are falling out of public favour and the reputation of business leaders as a group has declined roughly in line with that of politicians. Kellner points out that while some voters focus on policies, many also consider wider, emotional concepts. They ask things like: \u201cIs this party; is this leader, trustworthy? Are they up to the job? Do they understand people like me?\u201d Businesses, too, have to have good answers to those questions if they want to be successful. Consumers really do care about behaviour. They care about tales of zero-hours exploitation and big bonuses, in Kellner\u2019s experience. And if they do not like what they see, there are more ways than ever to vent and protest. There are review sites like TripAdvisor, while Twitter is awash with disgruntled customers. Or there is the more old-fashioned method of contacting a company directly. The airline Ryanair, for example, last week revealed it had received 80,000 complaints in the last year \u2013 40% fewer than the year before, when boss Michael O\u2019Leary took what he described as a strategic decision to stop \u201cunnecessarily pissing people off\u201d. Being nice, he said, was \u201cworking like a dream\u201d as he reported a jump in half-year profits. Investors, meanwhile, are putting more pressure on companies to clean up their image \u2013 not because they have suddenly started worrying about working conditions, low pay or the environment, but because they worry about reputational damage and its costs. Savvy campaigners for greener, fairer business know this and appeal directly to this bottom-line instinct. So when responsible-investment charity ShareAction last week briefed investors on why the companies they put their money in should pay the living wage, they put it in risk-reward terms. Using models of three FTSE 100 companies in the industrial, retail and service sectors, ShareAction found that moving to the living wage was likely to result in only a single-digit reduction in corporate earnings. That is, the charity argues, \u201crelatively modest in comparison with the potential risk of pay-related reputational damage, particularly for consumer-facing businesses\u201d. It predicts companies will increasingly face questions on pay policies from investors, who want to mitigate reputational risk and encourage socially sustainable practices. So with the growing push from customers, investors and within companies, perhaps 2015 can be the year business gets its house in order. That may even mean some real changes for the better if consumers and investors wield their rising power. But there is just as much chance it will be another year of business behaving badly. Hard-pressed consumers are more likely to complain about rising prices than pay policies; you only have to look at the booming sales of discount supermarkets and Primark to gauge the hunger for bargains. Investors will continue to think about reputation and not ethics. And as for businesses, make no mistake, the age-old practice of getting away with what they can will continue. Any change will be more about profit than principles.",

      "body": "<p>The business lobby group CBI is gearing up for its <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/events/cbi-annual-conference-2014/\" title=\"\">annual conference</a> tomorrow under the banner \u201cGrowth for All\u201d. Britain\u2019s self-proclaimed voice of business will be hearing from Ed Miliband and Archbishop of York John Sentamu as its members discuss \u201cshared prosperity\u201d and \u201chigher living standards for all\u201d.</p> <p>What\u2019s going on, you may ask? Has big business suddenly grown a conscience? It has certainly grown an awareness: an awareness that when public trust hits rock-bottom, the bottom line suffers.</p> <p>Another string of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/03/hsbc-warns-378m-potential-forex-rigging-fine\" title=\"\">banking scandals</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale\" title=\"\">headlines about tax avoidance</a> and news of exorbitant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/13/ftse-100-directors-pay-rises-share-awards\" title=\"\">pay packets for those at the top</a> are making life hard for the CBI\u2019s director-general, John Cridland. Rewind 10 months and his New Year message was that 2014 would be the year of the pay rise. He also vowed to make it a year in which business cleans up its image.</p> <p>\u201cIf 2013 was the year that business trust took a hammering on a range of issues from corporate taxation to energy prices, then 2014 must be the year that business leaders take action to rebuild that trust,\u201d Cridland declared.</p> <p>Well let\u2019s not talk about the pay rise \u2013 not least because there hasn\u2019t been one to talk about. But on the second point, there is also scant progress to report: so little progress that Cridland told the <em>Guardian </em>in an interview last week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/07/cbi-john-cridland-britain-europe-stonehenge-tunnel\" title=\"\">making the case for pro-business policies was an uphill struggle</a>. \u201cIt will be hard to win those arguments unless we put our own house in order,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Businesses know it is not just their collective ability to influence policy that is suffering. What they will really care about is what a bad reputation means closer to home. Is it costing sales? Is it deterring investors?</p> <p>On the customer front there is evidence that people do care more about the behaviour of companies, and technology is giving them the power to show it.</p> <p>The polling group YouGov has been tracking the reputation of people in power, both public and private: so alongside politicians, it monitors business leaders too. YouGov president Peter Kellner recently warned the Institute of Directors conference that it is not just the image of politics that has suffered a decade of decline. All forms of power and authority are falling out of public favour and the reputation of business leaders as a group has declined roughly in line with that of politicians.</p> <p>Kellner points out that while some voters focus on policies, many also consider wider, emotional concepts. They ask things like: \u201cIs this party; is this leader, trustworthy? Are they up to the job? Do they understand people like me?\u201d Businesses, too, have to have good answers to those questions if they want to be successful. Consumers really do care about behaviour. They care about tales of zero-hours exploitation and big bonuses, in Kellner\u2019s experience.</p> <p>And if they do not like what they see, there are more ways than ever to vent and protest. There are review sites like TripAdvisor, while Twitter is awash with disgruntled customers. Or there is the more old-fashioned method of contacting a company directly. The airline Ryanair, for example, last week revealed it had received 80,000 complaints in the last year \u2013 40% fewer than the year before, when boss Michael O\u2019Leary took what he described as a strategic decision to stop \u201cunnecessarily pissing people off\u201d.

      "standfirst": "Politicians at Dublin\u2019s Web Summit downplayed the impact of scrapping the controversial measure, despite criticism from a former Apple boss suggesting the country would lose its competitive edge", 
      "body": "<p>As 22,000 tech entrepreneurs, inventors and investors converged on Dublin for the city\u2019s Web Summit last week, one big question threatened to bring the whole digital bonanza down to earth.</p> <p>After the Ireland moved last month to close a lucrative tax loophole, former Apple chief executive John Sculley told the summit that the country risked losing the \u201cedge\u201d that has helped it become the European headquarters of US technology giants including Apple and Facebook. \u201cThere is a lot of talent in Ireland so I don\u2019t think it will be an insurmountable problem but it will take the edge off, if tax advantages do go away,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The \u201cdouble Irish\u201d scheme has allowed corporations to save billions by legally moving huge profits at their Irish bases to countries regarded as tax havens. It will be phased out following the 2015 budget \u2013 although Taoiseach Enda Kenny confirmed last week that firms already benefiting from the scheme could continue to operate it until 2020.</p> <p>At the summit \u2013 where speakers included Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, Dropbox founder Drew Houston and actor and angel investor Eva Longoria \u2013 bosses of the latest wave of hi-tech companies to come to Ireland were keen to play down the significance of Dublin\u2019s move to end the scheme. Eight software, telecoms and digital media firms announced that they would create 400 new jobs in the republic.</p> <p>The boss of one of them, New Zealander Dr Jock Percy, whose Perseus Telecom provides fibre optics to connect major banks with stock exchanges, said he was encouraged that the Dublin government had decided to maintain its 12.5% corporate tax rate and planned new tax breaks for inventions and innovations minted in Ireland, like the UK\u2019s \u201cpatent box\u201d scheme.</p> <p>\u201cLow corporation tax in Ireland is attractive but the double Irish was not even considered or planned for. Instead we were more interested in the fact that there are multilingual skilled workers in Ireland and a pro-business government,\u201d said Percy, whose company\u2019s main base is in Galway.</p> <p>\u201cFor us the introduction of a patent-box is much more valuable because our intellectual property, designs and software programmes all belong here in Ireland. So getting tax relief for that is fantastic and we are looking forward to that coming in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another firm, Atlanta-based N3 Results, has just set up in Dublin, creating 100 new jobs. Chief executive Jeffrey Laue stressed it chose to base itself in Ireland for expansion into the EU and beyond because of the people. Speaking in Dublin\u2019s RDS conference centre last week, Laue said: \u201cThere are very smart, educated and motivated people here in Ireland. This was our primary motive \u2013 the talent base, not the tax base.\u201d On the 12.5% corporation tax, Laue added: \u201cWhile that\u2019s always nice to have it\u2019s not the main reason why we established a base here. Because Ireland is in the EU, it allows us to have a beachhead into Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Udemy, one of the world\u2019s largest online learning and teaching sites, is also increasing its workforce by 50 people over the next three years at the Digital Media Hub in Dublin, which is next door to the vast Guinness brewery site.</p> <p>Eren Bali, Udemy\u2019s co-founder and chairman, said the hi-tech business culture in the Irish capital was \u201cvery similar to that of Silicon Valley and both had a strong, young, vibrant talent pool. Taxation policy or tax loopholes never came into our thinking really.\u201d</p> <p>Kristin Jellison, director of products and services of a Dublin-based communications company that trains many of the top executives in the Irish capital\u2019s so-called \u201cGoogle Quarter\u201d, said the end of double Irish would not change its plans to increase its workforce in the republic.</p> <p>Despite scrapping the double Irish loophole, Dublin has robustly defended its 12.5% corporation tax rate, which has also come under fire from EU partners such as France. The French have claimed that the low taxation rate gives the Irish an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment.</p> <p>Kenny told an audience at the summit that the country had \u201cnothing to fear\u201d from the end of the double Irish scheme. \u201cThe end of it will make our country even more attractive for foreign direct investment in the future and there is that transition period for companies already here up to 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Bruton, minister for jobs, enterprise and innovation also dismissed the concerns of Sculley, although he acknowledged the flak Ireland has taken over tax schemes in Brussels and Washington. \u201cClearly we understand that countries compete on a number of fronts and Ireland has always offered a competitive tax environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know companies expect that and we will continue to compete very strongly but on a fair basis. There has to be a worldwide consensus to make taxation policy fair across the board.\u201d</p> <p>The 12.5% corporate tax rate, Kenny and Bruton said, would be protected as a cornerstone of Irish fiscal policy.</p> <p>As Kenny and Bruton were speaking, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers signalled that the UK Treasury would decide within weeks if Northern Ireland could set its own corporation tax rate. She promised in a speech to Co-operation Ireland in Belfast that the administration would know soon whether London would hand over control.</p> <p>Political leaders in Stormont have looked on jealously as their southern neighbours continue to use low corporate taxes to attract foreign direct investment and want their own rate set at a level close to the republic\u2019s.</p> <p>Villiers said London was taking the calls to devolve tax powers \u201cvery seriously\u201d.

      "bodyText": "As 22,000 tech entrepreneurs, inventors and investors converged on Dublin for the city\u2019s Web Summit last week, one big question threatened to bring the whole digital bonanza down to earth. After the Ireland moved last month to close a lucrative tax loophole, former Apple chief executive John Sculley told the summit that the country risked losing the \u201cedge\u201d that has helped it become the European headquarters of US technology giants including Apple and Facebook. \u201cThere is a lot of talent in Ireland so I don\u2019t think it will be an insurmountable problem but it will take the edge off, if tax advantages do go away,\u201d he said. The \u201cdouble Irish\u201d scheme has allowed corporations to save billions by legally moving huge profits at their Irish bases to countries regarded as tax havens. It will be phased out following the 2015 budget \u2013 although Taoiseach Enda Kenny confirmed last week that firms already benefiting from the scheme could continue to operate it until 2020. At the summit \u2013 where speakers included Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, Dropbox founder Drew Houston and actor and angel investor Eva Longoria \u2013 bosses of the latest wave of hi-tech companies to come to Ireland were keen to play down the significance of Dublin\u2019s move to end the scheme. Eight software, telecoms and digital media firms announced that they would create 400 new jobs in the republic. The boss of one of them, New Zealander Dr Jock Percy, whose Perseus Telecom provides fibre optics to connect major banks with stock exchanges, said he was encouraged that the Dublin government had decided to maintain its 12.5% corporate tax rate and planned new tax breaks for inventions and innovations minted in Ireland, like the UK\u2019s \u201cpatent box\u201d scheme. \u201cLow corporation tax in Ireland is attractive but the double Irish was not even considered or planned for. Instead we were more interested in the fact that there are multilingual skilled workers in Ireland and a pro-business government,\u201d said Percy, whose company\u2019s main base is in Galway. \u201cFor us the introduction of a patent-box is much more valuable because our intellectual property, designs and software programmes all belong here in Ireland. So getting tax relief for that is fantastic and we are looking forward to that coming in,\u201d he said. Another firm, Atlanta-based N3 Results, has just set up in Dublin, creating 100 new jobs. Chief executive Jeffrey Laue stressed it chose to base itself in Ireland for expansion into the EU and beyond because of the people. Speaking in Dublin\u2019s RDS conference centre last week, Laue said: \u201cThere are very smart, educated and motivated people here in Ireland. This was our primary motive \u2013 the talent base, not the tax base.\u201d On the 12.5% corporation tax, Laue added: \u201cWhile that\u2019s always nice to have it\u2019s not the main reason why we established a base here. Because Ireland is in the EU, it allows us to have a beachhead into Europe.\u201d Udemy, one of the world\u2019s largest online learning and teaching sites, is also increasing its workforce by 50 people over the next three years at the Digital Media Hub in Dublin, which is next door to the vast Guinness brewery site. Eren Bali, Udemy\u2019s co-founder and chairman, said the hi-tech business culture in the Irish capital was \u201cvery similar to that of Silicon Valley and both had a strong, young, vibrant talent pool. Taxation policy or tax loopholes never came into our thinking really.\u201d Kristin Jellison, director of products and services of a Dublin-based communications company that trains many of the top executives in the Irish capital\u2019s so-called \u201cGoogle Quarter\u201d, said the end of double Irish would not change its plans to increase its workforce in the republic. Despite scrapping the double Irish loophole, Dublin has robustly defended its 12.5% corporation tax rate, which has also come under fire from EU partners such as France. The French have claimed that the low taxation rate gives the Irish an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment. Kenny told an audience at the summit that the country had \u201cnothing to fear\u201d from the end of the double Irish scheme. \u201cThe end of it will make our country even more attractive for foreign direct investment in the future and there is that transition period for companies already here up to 2020.\u201d Richard Bruton, minister for jobs, enterprise and innovation also dismissed the concerns of Sculley, although he acknowledged the flak Ireland has taken over tax schemes in Brussels and Washington. \u201cClearly we understand that countries compete on a number of fronts and Ireland has always offered a competitive tax environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know companies expect that and we will continue to compete very strongly but on a fair basis. There has to be a worldwide consensus to make taxation policy fair across the board.\u201d The 12.5% corporate tax rate, Kenny and Bruton said, would be protected as a cornerstone of Irish fiscal policy. As Kenny and Bruton were speaking, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers signalled that the UK Treasury would decide within weeks if Northern Ireland could set its own corporation tax rate. She promised in a speech to Co-operation Ireland in Belfast that the administration would know soon whether London would hand over control. Political leaders in Stormont have looked on jealously as their southern neighbours continue to use low corporate taxes to attract foreign direct investment and want their own rate set at a level close to the republic\u2019s. Villiers said London was taking the calls to devolve tax powers \u201cvery seriously\u201d. It could be a move the republic\u2019s Industrial Development Agency will have to take very seriously too. END OF A LOOPHOLE The \u201cdouble Irish\u201d that Dublin banned last month is said to be the main manoeuvre behind Apple\u2019s rock-bottom tax rate, which a US Senate report last year found to be an effective 2%, charged on billions of dollars of profits booked through its Irish affiliates. The strategy requires a US company to attribute profits to an Irish subsidiary. A second Irish subsidiary is then set up and managed from the British Virgin Islands (BVI) or another jurisdiction with no corporation tax. The Irish-based company makes royalty payments to the second company and claims those payments as tax deductions in Ireland. From January all new companies domiciled in Ireland will also have to be tax residents there, making the Double Irish impossible \u2013 although companies already operating the system will be allowed to continue until 2020. Apple\u2019s tax arrangements in Ireland were established under a deal that Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s late co-founder, struck with Dublin in the 1980s. Last year\u2019s Senate report did not say that Apple used the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d but it noted that Apple had a BVI-based company that owned a small share of the group\u2019s main Irish subsidiary. Apple\u2019s Irish offices are based near Knocknaheeny, an impoverished northern suburb of Cork. The company told the Senate inquiry that its business there was substantive and was not based on a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d that brought employment to Cork. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, told senators that the company did not rely on \u201ctax gimmicks\u201d and that it paid every dollar it owed. Sean Farrell",
