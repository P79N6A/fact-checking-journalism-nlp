      "bodyText": "The path back to surplus outlined in Tuesday\u2019s budget is driven mostly off the back of revenue growth. It does not come from increased or new taxes, but from a hope the economy and wages grow, and with it tax receipts from incomes and companies. It won\u2019t take many hiccups in the economy to disturb Hockey\u2019s strong revenue projections and with it the hopes for a smooth path back to surplus. The budget deficit is expected to fall by 0.4% of GDP \u2013calculated by budget projections to 2018-19 \u2013 from the current level of 3.1% to 2.7%. Over that period revenue is expected to rise to 2.4% of GDP, but spending is set to fall by just 0.4% of GDP. By 2018-19 government revenue will finally \u2013 after 11 years \u2013 return to the average during the time of the Howard government: However, by 2018-19 government expenditure has been predicted to be 25.3% of GDP \u2013 well above the Howard government average of 24.1% of GDP: It\u2019s amazing how much easier it is to achieve a surplus (or at least a balanced budget) when the level of revenue you raise is not in the toilet. Most discussions to increase revenue look at raising tax revenue \u2013 such as increasing or broadening the GST, or removing concessions for superannuation. The budget papers revealed that in 2018-19 around $50bn in revenue will be lost due to tax-free super earnings. Even though it\u2019s likely that the income from this measure would be less than $50bn if the concessions were removed, we\u2019re still talking a rather large amount of money \u2013 especially in the context of GST that is expected to raise $68.5bn in the same year. However, in this budget most of the improved revenue is not to come from increased or new taxes, but from growth in incomes, company profits and household consumption. The biggest growth in tax is to come from personal income taxes. Over the next four years income tax revenue is expected to increase by an average of 7.4% each year. That is a pretty sizeable increase \u2013 growing almost as strongly as during the mining boom: Some of this increase in government income over four years will come from removing the tax free threshold for short-term migrant workers \u2013 expected to raise $535m \u2013 and from changes to the \u201czone tax offset to exclude \u2018fly-in fly-out\u2019 and \u2018drive-in drive-out\u2019 workers\u201d that will raise $325m. Another $845m over four years will be collected from changes to the way work-related car expense deductions are calculated. But given total personal income tax revenue is $189bn, that\u2019s pretty small beer. The big driver of the increase in income tax revenue is \u201cbracket creep\u201d \u2013 where wage increases push you into a higher tax bracket. As no income tax cuts are budgeted till beyond the period of this budget, that means the government can count on increases in income tax revenue without needing a strong increase in employment growth. As I noted in my budget post, this is just as well \u2013 employment growth is expected to be pretty weak for at least another couple of years. The budget also expects company tax revenue to grow solidly from 2016-17 onwards. After five years of almost negligible growth in revenue, for three years from 2016-17 it is expected to grow on average by 8.1% each year \u2013 not quite peak mining boom levels, but certainly nothing to sneeze at. GST growth is expected to remain pretty much constant at around 5.6%-5.8%, but the budget still plans for a re-introduction of the indexation of the fuel excise expected to grow by a very strong 5.8% in 2018-19 . The calculations for tax growth are also based on some interesting economic projections, which don\u2019t totally align with the tax increases, or perhaps with reality. For example, the budget predicts solid increases in household consumption, but at the same time predicts very weak wages growth: As Fairfax\u2019s Michael Pascoe notes, improved households consumption with weak wages growth is an odd mix. Certainly the latest wages price index figures released on Wednesday do not show any signs of stronger wage growth. In the 12 months to March, wages grew by just 2.3% \u2013 the lowest on record: Hockey will hope wages growth improves, because lower growth means less bracket creep, which in turn means less income tax revenue. Perhaps we are expected to spend more because the value of our houses has gone up \u2013 the budget predicts strong growth in dwelling investment of 6.5% over the next two years. Again, the latest housing finance figures do little to challenge that assumption. The figures which came out on Tuesday showed annual growth in the value of housing finance (excluding refinancing) was 9.8%: But overall business investment is not expected to provide much succour to the budget. It is predicted to fall by 7% in 2015-16 and another 3.5% the following year. For the first time the budget papers have split the investment into mining and non-mining. Rather courageously it has non-mining investment rising by 4% this year and 7.5% in 2016-7. It would seem the government is placing a great deal of store in its $20,000 new tax break for small businesses. But that offer ends in July 2017, and the strong growth in company tax is expected after that date \u2013 no reason is given about why. It is not unusual for budget figures to be based on some economic projections that are either a bit ambitious or don\u2019t make a lot of sense. The numbers in the budget are not altogether rubbery. For example the data is based on an iron ore price of US $48 per tonne that is lower than the current price. But in 2017-18 and 2018-19 the budget expects the economy to grow above trend at 3.5%. Most of that growth seems to be predicated on households increasing their spending, strong export growth on the back of a low Australian dollar, and prices of exports not falling any further. As with most budgets a glass half-full outlook has massaged the figures so that in four years time things look better. But given the importance of revenue growth for charting the path back to surplus, and the high importance placed on strong income and company tax growth, it won\u2019t take many bumps in either the domestic or international economy to make that path rockier than Joe Hockey would like.",

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s embattled finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, stepped up his war of words with eurozone policymakers on Thursday, saying he wished his country still had the drachma, and would not sign up to any bailout plan that would send his country into a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d. With Greece facing a severe cash crisis as it struggles to secure a rescue deal from its creditors, Varoufakis \u2013 who has been officially sidelined from the debt negotiations \u2013 told a conference in Athens that he would reject any agreement in which \u201cthe numbers do not add up\u201d. Greek GDP figures, published on Wednesday, revealed that the economy has already returned to recession. \u201cI wish we had the drachma, I wish we had never entered this monetary union,\u201d Varoufakis said. \u201cAnd I think that deep down all member states with the eurozone would agree with that now. Because it was very badly constructed. But once you are in, you don\u2019t get out without a catastrophe\u201d. He also warned that a mooted proposal for a bond swap, to ease Athens\u2019 cash-crunch, was likely to be rejected, because it struck \u201cfear into the soul\u201d of European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. Despite his comments Greece on Thursday offered a concession to its international lenders by pushing ahead with the sale of its biggest port, Piraeus. Greece has asked three firms to submit bids for a majority stake in the port, a senior privatisation official told Reuters, unblocking a major sale of a public asset as creditors demand economic reforms from Athens. Draghi, who was in Washington on Thursday to deliver a lecture on monetary policy, pointedly failed to mention the ongoing Greek crisis. He received a rapturous welcome from Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, who introduced him as \u201cmaestro\u201d \u2013 the nickname once given to Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. \u201cThose who know you understand that you are a man of outstanding insight, fierce determination, and above all, courage. You can call a spade a spade without putting any of your cards on the table,\u201d she said. While skirting the thorny subject of Greece, which has repeatedly drawn on emergency funds from the ECB through its Emergency Liquidity Assistance scheme, Draghi issued a strong defence of the bank\u2019s quantitative easing policy. \u201cFaced with an environment of unprecedented complexity, the ECB has taken a series of unconventional measures to prevent a too prolonged period of low inflation and deliver its mandate. Those measures have proven so far to be potent, more so than many observers anticipated,\u201d he said. He also stressed that the ECB expects to continue the \u20ac60bn a month bond-buying programme for the forseeable future, despite the recent sell-off in the bond markets, which some analysts had suggested could prompt the ECB to stay its hand. \u201cAfter almost seven years of a debilitating sequence of crises, firms and households are very hesitant to take on economic risk. For this reason quite some time is needed before we can declare success, and our monetary policy stimulus will stay in place as long as needed for its objective to be fully achieved on a truly sustained basis.\u201d However, as Draghi was spelling out the benefits of his approach, the scale of the opposition he faces within the ECB was laid bare, as his fellow governing council member, Jens Weidmann, gave a strongly-worded interview condemning QE and questioning the support being offered to Greece. \u201cThe question remains whether the QE programme was really necessary given our primary aim of price stability and how we should assess the risks and side-effects that inevitably come with such a scheme,\u201d he said. Much of Draghi\u2019s speech was given over to dismissing the argument that QE creates risks. Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank, also hit out at the ECB\u2019s approach to Greece. The rules of the single currency prevent the central bank from directly bailing out member states, and many in Germany feel that by repeatedly increasing the ceiling for Emergency Liquidity Assistance to Athens, the ECB is breaking that rule. \u201cGiven the ban on monetary financing of states, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK that banks which don\u2019t have access to the markets are being granted loans which then finance the bonds of their government, which doesn\u2019t have access to the markets itself,\u201d he said, in an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt. The fact that Draghi and his colleagues are rehearsing their differences in public underlines the challenge facing the ECB president in forcing through his policies. Weidmann warned that the public should not be fooled into thinking the ECB was \u201comnipotent\u201d. With fraught talks continuing between Greek officials and the \u201cBrussels Group\u201d of creditors \u2013 the renamed \u201ctroika\u201d of ECB, European commission and IMF \u2013 Greece\u2019s hand may be strengthened by separate data showing that the government ran a primary budget surplus \u2013 excluding its debt repayments \u2013 in the first four months of the year. Lagarde warned that monetary policy would not be enough to prevent the emergence of \u201cthe new mediocre\u201d: a prolonged period of weak global growth. She called for structural reforms, continued fiscal consolidation, and a boost to women\u2019s employment levels, to help kickstart recovery.",

By becoming a financial whistleblower. </p> <p>Hoping to cut down on corporate fraud and increase compliance, US agencies like the US Securities Exchange Commission are using financial incentives to increase the number of corporate whistleblowers. These efforts haven\u2019t succeeded in creating just more whistleblowers, but also those who represent them: corporate whistleblower lawyers.</p> <p>Even as the Obama administration has cracked down on whistleblowers in its own ranks, in recent years the US government has expanded protections for corporate whistleblowers and agencies such as the IRS, SEC and Commodities Futures Trading Commission, rewarding those who provide valuable information with a \u201cwhistleblower bounty\u201d. <br></p> <p>Thanks to the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, enacted in 2010, if a corporate whistleblower\u2019s information results in more than $1m in penalties, then the whistleblower can collect between 10% to 30% of the money collected in the case.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/nov/19/whistleblowers-helped-government-secure-21-billion-dollars-fines-study\">Are financial whistleblowers worth it? Study says yes \u2013\u00a0to the tune of $21.27bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Corporate whistleblowers have been a boon to the US government. From January 2009 to September 2014, false claim cases brought in $22.75bn. Last year, the Department of Justice collected a record $5.69bn in settlements and judgments from such cases.</p> <p>\u201cThe number of <em>qui tam (</em>whistleblower) suits filed in fiscal year 2014 exceeded 700 for the second year in a row,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-recovers-nearly-6-billion-false-claims-act-cases-fiscal-year-2014\">according to a DoJ press release</a>. \u201cRecoveries in <em>qui tam</em> cases during fiscal year 2014 totaled nearly $3bn, with whistleblowers receiving $435m.\u201d</p> <p>A recent study on the economic effects of whistleblowers found that without the help of whistleblowers, US government would have collected quite a bit less in fines and settlements over the past 35 years. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/nov/19/whistleblowers-helped-government-secure-21-billion-dollars-fines-study\">The $21.27bn collected thanks to involvement of whistleblowers accounts for 30% of the $70.13bn collected from 1978 to 2012</a>.</p> <p>Kathleen Clark, who<a href=\"http://www.law.wustl.edu/Faculty/pages.aspx?id=222\"> teaches whistleblower law at Washington University Law School</a>, told the Guardian that she has noticed increased interest in whistleblower law at functions and conferences that she had attended and spoken at.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s, I would say, an expanding area of the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are not a lot of happy stories about the legal profession in the US these days, but whistleblower law is one of those growth areas. Particularly, because of the Dodd-Frank and the expansion of the availability of the SEC rewards.\u201d</p> <p>Being a whistleblower lawyer is not exactly a new profession. Thanks to the False Claims Act \u2013 a law that enables corporate workers to bring lawsuit against their company if it has defraud the US government \u2013 whistleblower lawyers have been around for close to 30 years.</p> <p>One of these veteran whistleblower law firms is <a href=\"http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/\">Phillips &amp; Cohen</a>, founded in 1988 by John Phillips. Phillips worked closely with Congress to pass the False Claims Act and brought the first whistleblower lawsuit after the law passed, against an eye clinic for submitting false Medicare claims. Currently the firm has 23 attorneys in Washington DC and San Francisco dedicated to whistleblower cases. That\u2019s up from eight lawyers 20 years ago, according to Claire Sylvia, a partner at the firm. Phillips currently serves as <a href=\"http://italy.usembassy.gov/ambassador.html\">the US ambassador to Italy</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/23/sec-award-30m-whistleblower-fraud-case\">SEC to award $30m to whistleblower who aided fraud case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Phillips &amp; Cohen is devoted exclusively to representing whistleblowers and government agencies, and their cases have recovered more than $11.6bn in settlements. Among their clients was the international whistleblower, who was awarded the more than <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370543011290\">$30m reward from the SEC last year</a>. So far, the SEC payouts to 17 whistleblowers covered under Dodd-Frank total over $50m.</p> <p>\u201cWe are one of just a few law firms that focus their practices solely on representing whistleblowers. The number of law firms that have added a whistleblower practice seems to have increased geometrically in recent years,\u201d Sylvia told the Guardian. </p> <p>One of the firms that has entered the space in the recent years is <a href=\"http://constantinecannon.com/\">Constantine Cannon</a>, which has <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/constantine-cannon-opens-san-francisco-office-with-three-new-lawyers-joining-the-firms-growing-whistleblower-practice-300052579.html\">just recently announced that it was adding three more whistleblower lawyers</a> to its practice and was opening an office in San Francisco. Its interest in whistleblower law was sparked about five years ago when the firm, which specializes in antitrust and litigation cases, had an antitrust case that became a false claim case.</p> <p>\u201cThat introduced us to the False Claims Act and it kind of opened our eyes to that area of the law. We pursued that case and by happenstance got another referral for a whistleblower matter,\u201d Gordon Schnell, who founded the firm\u2019s whistleblower practice, told the Guardian. \u201cAt the same time this was happening, Dodd-Frank was passed with all the whistleblower provisions there, and I really kind of was on the mission to really develop this practice and try to bring it up to the speed.\u201d </p> <p>The firm officially launched its whistleblower practice three years ago. Currently, the practice consists of eight lawyers with offices in New York, Washington and London, which could help the firm attract international whistleblower clients. When the SEC announced the $30m reward last year, it highlighted the fact that four of the whistleblowers covered under the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program had lived in a foreign country.</p> <p>\u201cWhistleblowers from all over the world should feel similarly incentivized to come forward with credible information about potential violations of the US securities laws,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370543011290\">urged Sean McKessy</a>, chief of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower\">SEC\u2019s office of the whistleblower</a>, at that time.</p> <p>Many, including Sylvia and Schnell, expect the whistleblower law to grow. Sylvia predicts that whistleblower protections and rewards might expand into other areas, beyond SEC, CFTC and the IRS.</p> <p>The number of lawsuits filed through the False Claims Act \u201cjust goes up and up and up every year\u201d, said Schnell.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a self-perpetuating cycle because the more cases there are out there, the more publicity they get, the more rewards that are given \u2013 it encourages more and more people to come forward,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think we are going to see more SEC awards coming down the pipe, and that\u2019s going to further increase the type of people that are participating in the SEC whistleblowers program.\u201d</p> <p>He added that there might be<a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/Whistleblower-Office-At-a-Glance\"> an increase in IRS whistleblowers</a> in the near future.</p> <p>\u201cIdeally, the cases would go down because [of] more people reporting, there is more compliance,\u201d said Sylvia. \u201cWe spent a long time talking about this \u2013 which is, the idea is you don\u2019t have to bring every case. If you bring a couple of cases about an issue, call attention to the problem and then hopefully companies see that and say: \u2018Oh wow, we need to get on top of that and comply.\u2019 And so in theory, cases should go down, but sometimes it takes a while.\u201d </p> <p>More rewards, and with them more publicity, could be coming. <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-backlog-delays-whistleblower-awards-1430693284\">According to recent data obtained by the Wall Street Journal</a>, 247 of 297 whistleblowers who applied for awards since 2011 have yet to receive decision from the SEC. A serious backlog, however, could have the opposite effect and dissuade whistleblowers from coming forward. <br></p> <p>While some companies are taking this opportunity to increase compliance, others are taking a different path trying to intimidate potential whistleblower. One of the ways they are doing this is by making their employees sign confidentiality agreements saying that they give up their right to a whistleblower \u201cbounty\u201d unless they have made their disclosure internally first, said Clark. These agreements, while unenforceable, achieve what the company is going for: discouraging potential whistleblowers from speaking up. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/23/whistleblower-bank-personal-cost-sec\">One whistleblower gets $30m in the bank, but others count the personal cost</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cJust because [these agreements] are unenforceable doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have an effect on the people who sign them and don\u2019t realize they are unenforceable,\u201d she added. Such practices are frowned upon by the regulators. <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-probes-companies-treatment-of-whistleblowers-1424916002\">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, earlier this year the SEC contacted number of companies and requested that they disclose \u201cyears of nondisclosure agreements, employment contracts and other documents\u201d.</p> <p>Additionally, in April the SEC announced its first award in a retaliation case. A whistleblower who faced workplace retaliation after reporting Paradigm Capital Management to the SEC will receive $600,000, <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-75.html\">the agency announced.</a> The Paradigm employee was stripped of supervisory responsibilities, removed from then current position and \u201cotherwise marginalized\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-75.html\">according to the SEC</a>.</p> <p>\u201cTraditionally, there has been a lot of the stigma attached with being a whistleblower, there still is,\u201d said Schnell. \u201cI think we all grow up with that kind of schoolyard mentality that nobody likes a snitch, and I think that it\u2019s still out there. People still feel that way to some extent, but it\u2019s lessening as government wraps its arms around this and as the result, show that whistleblowers are helping and as more and more whistleblowers stories are coming out.\u201d<br></p> <p>Most whistleblowers don\u2019t really care about the money, according to Schnell, who added that whistleblower rewards are an incentive not a driving force. \u201cThe driving force for most of them is trying to fix the wrongdoings,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e0179032-402c-4d38-b0b9-12de08ebbb90\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430332606001/9f3608fc-02c9-42d6-8012-5d76f5f9813f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Edward Snowden Photograph: Alex Healey\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Snowden</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph: Alex Healey for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn general, whistleblowing can be not just a job-ending device but a career-ending device,\u201d said Clark. She explained that these large rewards worth hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of dollars are \u201ccompensating a whistleblower for the loss of a career instead of just of a loss of a job\u201d. <br></p> <p>Sherron Watkins, the former vice-president of corporate development at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/enron\">Enron</a> who uncovered accounting irregularities in the company, said that even now, 14 years later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/nov/19/whistleblowers-helped-government-secure-21-billion-dollars-fines-study\">she still cannot get a job in corporate America</a>.</p> <p>While about 80 million US employees and a majority of all federal employees now have whistleblower protection, there is still one group that is excluded: national security whistleblowers including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>, who is living in exile in Russia after divulging secret US government collection of phone records, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-kiriakou\">John Kiriakou</a>, a former CIA analyst and whistleblower. </p> <p>\u201cDespite all the other pitched partisan battles over the last eight years engulfing Washington DC, Congress time and time again has united and unanimously passed most of the whistleblower protections that are now operational,\u201d Louis Clark, president of the <a href=\"http://whistleblower.org/\">Government Accountability Project</a>, told the Guardian. \u201cNational security protections is the lone exception.\u201d </p>",

Hoping to cut down on corporate fraud and increase compliance, US agencies like the US Securities Exchange Commission are using financial incentives to increase the number of corporate whistleblowers. These efforts haven\u2019t succeeded in creating just more whistleblowers, but also those who represent them: corporate whistleblower lawyers. Even as the Obama administration has cracked down on whistleblowers in its own ranks, in recent years the US government has expanded protections for corporate whistleblowers and agencies such as the IRS, SEC and Commodities Futures Trading Commission, rewarding those who provide valuable information with a \u201cwhistleblower bounty\u201d. Thanks to the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, enacted in 2010, if a corporate whistleblower\u2019s information results in more than $1m in penalties, then the whistleblower can collect between 10% to 30% of the money collected in the case. Corporate whistleblowers have been a boon to the US government. From January 2009 to September 2014, false claim cases brought in $22.75bn. Last year, the Department of Justice collected a record $5.69bn in settlements and judgments from such cases. \u201cThe number of qui tam (whistleblower) suits filed in fiscal year 2014 exceeded 700 for the second year in a row,\u201d according to a DoJ press release. \u201cRecoveries in qui tam cases during fiscal year 2014 totaled nearly $3bn, with whistleblowers receiving $435m.\u201d A recent study on the economic effects of whistleblowers found that without the help of whistleblowers, US government would have collected quite a bit less in fines and settlements over the past 35 years. The $21.27bn collected thanks to involvement of whistleblowers accounts for 30% of the $70.13bn collected from 1978 to 2012. Kathleen Clark, who teaches whistleblower law at Washington University Law School, told the Guardian that she has noticed increased interest in whistleblower law at functions and conferences that she had attended and spoken at. \u201cIt\u2019s, I would say, an expanding area of the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are not a lot of happy stories about the legal profession in the US these days, but whistleblower law is one of those growth areas. Particularly, because of the Dodd-Frank and the expansion of the availability of the SEC rewards.\u201d Being a whistleblower lawyer is not exactly a new profession. Thanks to the False Claims Act \u2013 a law that enables corporate workers to bring lawsuit against their company if it has defraud the US government \u2013 whistleblower lawyers have been around for close to 30 years. One of these veteran whistleblower law firms is Phillips &amp; Cohen, founded in 1988 by John Phillips. Phillips worked closely with Congress to pass the False Claims Act and brought the first whistleblower lawsuit after the law passed, against an eye clinic for submitting false Medicare claims. Currently the firm has 23 attorneys in Washington DC and San Francisco dedicated to whistleblower cases. That\u2019s up from eight lawyers 20 years ago, according to Claire Sylvia, a partner at the firm. Phillips currently serves as the US ambassador to Italy. Phillips &amp; Cohen is devoted exclusively to representing whistleblowers and government agencies, and their cases have recovered more than $11.6bn in settlements. Among their clients was the international whistleblower, who was awarded the more than $30m reward from the SEC last year. So far, the SEC payouts to 17 whistleblowers covered under Dodd-Frank total over $50m. \u201cWe are one of just a few law firms that focus their practices solely on representing whistleblowers. The number of law firms that have added a whistleblower practice seems to have increased geometrically in recent years,\u201d Sylvia told the Guardian. One of the firms that has entered the space in the recent years is Constantine Cannon, which has just recently announced that it was adding three more whistleblower lawyers to its practice and was opening an office in San Francisco. Its interest in whistleblower law was sparked about five years ago when the firm, which specializes in antitrust and litigation cases, had an antitrust case that became a false claim case. \u201cThat introduced us to the False Claims Act and it kind of opened our eyes to that area of the law. We pursued that case and by happenstance got another referral for a whistleblower matter,\u201d Gordon Schnell, who founded the firm\u2019s whistleblower practice, told the Guardian. \u201cAt the same time this was happening, Dodd-Frank was passed with all the whistleblower provisions there, and I really kind of was on the mission to really develop this practice and try to bring it up to the speed.\u201d The firm officially launched its whistleblower practice three years ago. Currently, the practice consists of eight lawyers with offices in New York, Washington and London, which could help the firm attract international whistleblower clients. When the SEC announced the $30m reward last year, it highlighted the fact that four of the whistleblowers covered under the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program had lived in a foreign country. \u201cWhistleblowers from all over the world should feel similarly incentivized to come forward with credible information about potential violations of the US securities laws,\u201d urged Sean McKessy, chief of the SEC\u2019s office of the whistleblower, at that time. Many, including Sylvia and Schnell, expect the whistleblower law to grow. Sylvia predicts that whistleblower protections and rewards might expand into other areas, beyond SEC, CFTC and the IRS. The number of lawsuits filed through the False Claims Act \u201cjust goes up and up and up every year\u201d, said Schnell. \u201cIt\u2019s a self-perpetuating cycle because the more cases there are out there, the more publicity they get, the more rewards that are given \u2013 it encourages more and more people to come forward,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think we are going to see more SEC awards coming down the pipe, and that\u2019s going to further increase the type of people that are participating in the SEC whistleblowers program.\u201d He added that there might be an increase in IRS whistleblowers in the near future. \u201cIdeally, the cases would go down because [of] more people reporting, there is more compliance,\u201d said Sylvia. \u201cWe spent a long time talking about this \u2013 which is, the idea is you don\u2019t have to bring every case. If you bring a couple of cases about an issue, call attention to the problem and then hopefully companies see that and say: \u2018Oh wow, we need to get on top of that and comply.\u2019 And so in theory, cases should go down, but sometimes it takes a while.\u201d More rewards, and with them more publicity, could be coming. According to recent data obtained by the Wall Street Journal, 247 of 297 whistleblowers who applied for awards since 2011 have yet to receive decision from the SEC. A serious backlog, however, could have the opposite effect and dissuade whistleblowers from coming forward. While some companies are taking this opportunity to increase compliance, others are taking a different path trying to intimidate potential whistleblower. One of the ways they are doing this is by making their employees sign confidentiality agreements saying that they give up their right to a whistleblower \u201cbounty\u201d unless they have made their disclosure internally first, said Clark. These agreements, while unenforceable, achieve what the company is going for: discouraging potential whistleblowers from speaking up. \u201cJust because [these agreements] are unenforceable doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have an effect on the people who sign them and don\u2019t realize they are unenforceable,\u201d she added. Such practices are frowned upon by the regulators. According to the Wall Street Journal, earlier this year the SEC contacted number of companies and requested that they disclose \u201cyears of nondisclosure agreements, employment contracts and other documents\u201d. Additionally, in April the SEC announced its first award in a retaliation case. A whistleblower who faced workplace retaliation after reporting Paradigm Capital Management to the SEC will receive $600,000, the agency announced. The Paradigm employee was stripped of supervisory responsibilities, removed from then current position and \u201cotherwise marginalized\u201d, according to the SEC. \u201cTraditionally, there has been a lot of the stigma attached with being a whistleblower, there still is,\u201d said Schnell. \u201cI think we all grow up with that kind of schoolyard mentality that nobody likes a snitch, and I think that it\u2019s still out there. People still feel that way to some extent, but it\u2019s lessening as government wraps its arms around this and as the result, show that whistleblowers are helping and as more and more whistleblowers stories are coming out.\u201d Most whistleblowers don\u2019t really care about the money, according to Schnell, who added that whistleblower rewards are an incentive not a driving force. \u201cThe driving force for most of them is trying to fix the wrongdoings,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, whistleblowing can be not just a job-ending device but a career-ending device,\u201d said Clark. She explained that these large rewards worth hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of dollars are \u201ccompensating a whistleblower for the loss of a career instead of just of a loss of a job\u201d. Sherron Watkins, the former vice-president of corporate development at Enron who uncovered accounting irregularities in the company, said that even now, 14 years later, she still cannot get a job in corporate America. While about 80 million US employees and a majority of all federal employees now have whistleblower protection, there is still one group that is excluded: national security whistleblowers including Edward Snowden, who is living in exile in Russia after divulging secret US government collection of phone records, and John Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst and whistleblower. \u201cDespite all the other pitched partisan battles over the last eight years engulfing Washington DC, Congress time and time again has united and unanimously passed most of the whistleblower protections that are now operational,\u201d Louis Clark, president of the Government Accountability Project, told the Guardian. \u201cNational security protections is the lone exception.\u201d",

Fewer than 3% of investors voted against the cash-and-shares deal for Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, which, when announced in February, prompted the TUC to ask why the government had not done more to \u201chold back this excess\u201d. Pirc, the shareholder advisory body, had recommended voting against. After the vote, the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe Trade Union Shares Owners group was one of the few to vote against Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s bumper package. It is a shame that the government didn\u2019t use its voting block to do the same. If we don\u2019t embrace sensible policies, like putting workers on remuneration committees, the pay gap between CEOs and ordinary workers will continue to widen.\u201d The government stake in Lloyds dipped below 20% this week, down from 43% following the 2008 bailout, and UK Financial Investments, which manages the taxpayers\u2019 stake, said it had voted in favour of the remuneration report. \u201cFollowing a process of thorough engagement with the Lloyds remuneration committee, UKFI believes the committee has exercised reasonable judgement in relation to their approach to directors\u2019 remuneration, particularly in the context of performance over the year,\u201d it said. Lord Blackwell, the bank\u2019s chairman, was reportedly asked if the government would be able to sell of the rest of its stake next year. \u201cIt\u2019s possible and would be very desirable. Whether the government can achieve that depends on the market conditions,\u201d Reuters reported him saying. At the three-hour meeting in the Edinburgh international conference centre, Blackwell said the bank believed in pay for performance. The \u00a311.5m for Horta-Os\u00f3rio included a \u00a37.5m share award handed to him three years ago and came in a year when the bank was fined \u00a3226m for rigging Libor and as the cost of the long-running payment protection insurance scandal reached \u00a312bn. Blackwell was asked by one shareholder how much bigger the dividend payments might have been without the fines imposed on the bank. The chairman said just over \u00a3250m had been paid out in fines since 2008, while the first dividend in six years cost \u00a3535m. It was not so much about the financial cost, Blackwell said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s more the damage it does to the trust in the organisation.\u201d Asked by another investor about the PPI scandal, he said: \u201cThat is \u00a312bn we\u2019d have liked to have been available for shareholders.\u201d He said another \u00a32.4bn had been spent on carving out TSB \u2013 a requirement imposed by the EU after its bailout. TSB is in the process of being sold to Sabadell of Spain. The dividend was a symbolic gesture, he said, and the bank intended to announce a dividend alongside its half-year and full-year results this year. The longest intervention at the AGM was by Keith Elliott, owner of Premier Motor Auctions, a bank customer who is taking legal action over the way he was treated. He urged the board to \u201cdig out the cancer\u201d of poor customer treatment. Blackwell denied his allegations and said there was no room for misconduct at the bank.",

      "bodyText": "And finally... Europe\u2019s stock markets shrugged off their early weakness, to finish the day with gains across the board: The Athens exchange also rose, finishing the day 0.5% higher. Although there were some jitters in the bond market, it ended the day calmly too. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, reckons markets are in limbo until they know when the Federal Reserve starts to raise borrowing costs: The reality is that rate hikes are inevitable, but with so much concern that the Fed will jump too soon, the market is understandably skittish. The problem is that any overreaction here could initiate a sell-off that would be nothing short of panicked. And that\u2019s all for today. Thanks, and goodnight. GW A sign that Greece is compromising? Economy Minister George Stathakis told Bloomberg earlier today that the government is cracking on with the privatisation of privatize the country\u2019s largest port, at Piraeus, and regional airports. Missed this earlier, sorry, but the latest budget figures for Greece were released earlier today - showing that Athens has now squirrelled together \u20ac2.5bn in funds this year. It\u2019s achieved this primary surplus deficit by cutting its spending to the bone - expenditure is almost \u20ac2bn less than expected. It\u2019s not exactly the Syriza dream of no more austerity; but it does show that the government could last for longer than some commentators have claimed. And that\u2019s the end of the conversation. Some interesting insights into Draghi\u2019s view of the world; a shame that Christine Lagarde didn\u2019t seek his views on the Greek bailout talks. Still, she\u2019s not auditioning for Newsnight. Draghi and Lagarde are now heading off for talks about the situation in Europe -- Greece will surely be on the top of the agenda.... What will the ECB\u2019s policy response be like in 2020, asks Olivier Blanchard (he gets a question as a special treat to mark his retirement) Not an easy question, Draghi replies. He explains that the ECB has created a range of new tools since the financial crisis started. In five years time, we will be closer to what central banks are like in \u201cordinary places\u201d -- but still with a broader set of tools than before. Draghi explains that when people questioned recent policy measures, he would explain that the ECB needed more firepower to address its particular challenges. We still have the same mandate as before...but in a very different situation, handling different economies in different countries. Lagarde turns to the role of macro-prudential tools -- are they the first line of defence? Monetary policy has one objective - price stability. And that\u2019s a pre-requisite for financial stability, says Draghi. So macro-prudential tools have to be used. However, the toolbox isn\u2019t finished yet. [macro-prudential tools are, for example, rules telling banks how much capital they have to hold]. Tackling the fragmented mortgage market across Europe would help enhance the power of monetary policy, says Draghi. Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde are now enjoying a conversation about monetary policy issues. It\u2019s not exactly Frost/Nixon, based on the opening gambit: What other policy reforms would complement your \u201ccouragous\u201d actions, Mario? One of the lessons of the crisis is that our monetary policy transmission was impaired because many banks held too many bad loans, says Draghi. That, and the fragmentation of the banking sector, made it harder to get credit flowing again. So when the ECB pumped almost \u20ac1trn into the banking sector through its Long Term Refinancing Operations in 2011 and 2012, the banks used the cash to buy government bonds rather than lending to the real economy. So the lesson is that two sets of reforms are needed: 1) a supervisory mechanism that ensures bank balances sheets are healthy, and can ensure closer harmony between banks across Europe. 2) Reforms to expand the capital market, to make it easier for capital to flow across borders. Draghi has also tried to sink the suggestion that the ECB might wind up its QE scheme early: After almost 7 years of a debilitating sequence of crises, firms and households are very hesitant to take on economic risk. For this reason quite some time is needed before we can declare success, and our monetary policy stimulus will stay in place as long as needed for its objective to be fully achieved on a truly sustained basis. Towards the end of his lecture, Mario Draghi does admit that the unprecedented stimulus launched by the ECB could have negative consequences: That being said, we have to be mindful that too prolonged a period of very low real rates can have undesirable consequences in the context of ageing societies, where many households save not just to smooth consumption over the cycle, but to smooth consumption over their lifetime. For pensioners, and for those saving ahead of retirement, low interest rates may not be an inducement to bring consumption forward. They may on the contrary become an inducement to save more, to compensate for a slower rate of accumulation of pension assets. However, he argues that those savers wouldn\u2019t benefit if the central bank simply gave up on its mandate: On the contrary, the interest of long-term savers is that output be raised to potential without undue delay. This is because their financial assets are always, in the final analysis, a claim on the wealth generated by the productive part of the economy. So it is in their interest that output growth remains on a robust path as this maximises the likelihood that their claims are honoured in full. At the same time, the more monetary policy is able to encourage investment, the faster interest rates will return into more normal territory. Central banks are often criticised for boosting the wealth of the richest though their asset purchase schemes. Mario Draghi, though, is arguing that younger Europeans would have suffered disproportionately if the eurozone had been left to fallen into protracted deflation Mario Draghi is now giving the Michel Camdessus lecture. His theme is \u201cThe ECB\u2019s Recent Monetary Policy Measures: Effectiveness and Challenges\u201d. He\u2019s outlining how the ECB has responded to the crisis, particularly since the start of 2014 -- by cutting interest rates to record lows, imposing negative yields on deposits, offering cheap loans to banks, and eventually launching its on QE asset purchase scheme. Helpfully, the speech is online, complete with charts, so I suggest you read it here: The ECB\u2019s Recent Monetary Policy Measures: Effectiveness and Challenges Or you could digest Draghi\u2019s conclusion: Faced with an environment of unprecedented complexity, the ECB has taken a series of unconventional measures to prevent a too prolonged period of low inflation and deliver its mandate. Those measures have proven so far to be potent, more so than many observers anticipated. But their potency is also because they have interacted with other policies that have put the economy and the financial sector in a better position to respond to our monetary impulses. This includes the Comprehensive Assessment of euro area banks. And it includes structural reforms where they have been implemented. By the same token, structural reforms that increase confidence in economic prospects and encourage entrepreneurs to capitalise on today\u2019s extremely accommodative financing conditions will make our policy commensurately more powerful. Policymakers in the euro area are independent, but the effects of their policies are interdependent. This is why it is ultimately only a combination of policies, that are complementary and mutually consistent, that will allow our policy to reap its full effects \u2013 and to bring about a lasting return of both prosperity and stability for the whole euro area. Christine Lagarde also pays tribute to Mario Draghi, and the leadership he has shown. Mario\u2014and I cannot emphasize this enough\u2014your job is one of the most difficult. It is in part because it is a very influential one, and you have used that influence to move the euro area in the right direction. Those who know you understand that you are a man of outstanding insight, fierce determination, and above all, courage. So far so good.... You can call a spade a spade without putting any of your cards on the table. We have no idea what that means. Christine Lagarde is speaking in Washington now, and warning that the task of fixing the world economy is not complete. The IMF chief says: I am myself very concerned that slow job growth and rising inequality will come back to haunt us. We need ambitious and decisive policies to boost today\u2019s growth and tomorrow\u2019s growth potential, and to build resilience to existing and emerging challenges. I am reminded of a saying by Michelangelo: \u201cThe greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\u201d She also offers her \u201cfull support\u201d to the actions taken by the European Central Bank, particularly its QE programme. Notably, the significant further easing of monetary policy in January of this year has done much to stave off the threat of deflation and support weak demand. Monetary policy and price stability are essential for strong, sustainable, and inclusive growth. Reminder: there\u2019s a live feed here. The IMF are live-streaming Mario Draghi\u2019s lecture, which starts in around 10 minutes time at 4pm BST or 11am East Coast. It\u2019s followed by a \u2018conversation\u2019 between Draghi and Christine Lagarde. Here\u2019s the livestream: 2015 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture The International Monetary Fund hasn\u2019t given up hope that Greece can complete its bailout programme, despite the months of turmoil and slow progress towards a deal with creditors. Gerry Rice, the IMF\u2019s chief spokesman, is briefing reporters in Washington DC now. He says that the Fund will stand by Athens, so long as it is meeting its bailout programme \u201cWe are flexible. We are open to look at all options. But we must insist on reaching the objectives of the program.\u201d Rice also confirmed that Christine Lagarde and Mario Draghi will talks about \u2018developments\u2019 in Europe today, after Draghi has given his speech in Washington later today. Germany\u2019s top central banker, Jens Weidmann, has weighed in on the Greek crisis. The head of the Bundesbank criticised the emergency support which the European Central Bank is giving to Greece. He also raised concerns over the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme, which is mopping up tens of billions of euros of government bonds each month. Weidmann, of course, is one of the most powerful policymakers at the ECB (not as powerful as Mario Draghi, though!) OK, time to recap. The governor of the Bank of England has downplayed suggestions that foreign workers should be blamed for the UK\u2019s poor productivity growth, and weak pay rises. Mark Carney also told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that a referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union should take place \u2018as soon as necessary\u2019, before uncertainty over the result hits the economy. He said: \u201cI think it\u2019s in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision.\u201d Negotiations between Greece and her creditors has resumed in Brussels today, in an attempt to accelerate progress. Athens says: The instructions given to the negotiating team were to move in such a way to speed up the process.\u201d But Greece is sticking to its \u2018red lines\u2019; with finance minister Yanis Varoufakis insisting that he couldn\u2019t sign a deal that pushed Greece back into a death spiral. Varoufakis has floated the possibility that Europe\u2019s main bailout fund could step in to cover looming repayments due to the ECB. But he\u2019s certainly not proposing that Greece should refuse to pay up. Varoufakis has also claimed that Mario Draghi is afraid of upsetting Germany, saying: \u201cThe idea of a swap between the Greek government and the ECB fills Mr. Draghi\u2019s soul with fear. Because you know that Mr. Draghi is in a big struggle against the Bundesbank, which is fighting against QE. Mr. Weidmann in particular is opposing it.\u201d Another Greek minister has suggested that Greece could yet hold a referendum on its bailout programme, despite time and money running very short. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has highlighted the dangers Greece faces; a major recession could be inevitable if a deal isn\u2019t reached in time. And it\u2019s trebles all round for Jim O\u2019Neill as he joins the government, and Thomas Piketty as he takes up a role at the London School of Economics. It\u2019s a real musical chairs day in the word of economics. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF\u2019s top economist, is retiring at the end of September, the Fund just announced. He\u2019s going to become C. Fred Bergsten Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Blanchard is probably most famous in the UK for warning that George Osborne was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d with his economic plans. Britain went on to record the fastest growth in the advanced world; and also ran a rather chunkier deficit too... And here\u2019s a photo of the chancellor announcing his devolution plans: Congratulations to Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs chief economist who coined the idea of the BRICS economies. He\u2019s just been appointed as Commercial Secretary at the Treasury, with responsibilities for devolving powers to the UK\u2019s regions and building a new Northern Powerhouse. He\u2019s also lined up for a peerage -- arise Lord O\u2019Neill! Of BRICS? Or perhaps Old Trafford, given his love of Manchester United. Here\u2019s the announcement. Look who\u2019s coming to London: Piketty\u2019s book Capital in the Twenty-First Century has reportedly sold more than 1.5 million copies in its combined French and English translations; the resulting royalties mean the French economist might actually be able to afford a house in the capital. Hell hath no fury like a finance minister misquoted. Yanis Varoufakis has now issued a statement, insisting that he did not propose a delay to repaying the ECB back (as covered earlier), and blasting those who believed he did. Cutting through the acronyms, Yanis is talking about Europe\u2019s main bailout vehicle (the ESM) providing assets for Greece to use to repay Greek government bonds held by the ECB (starting with the \u20ac6.7bn which mature in July and August). This would remove the danger of default. But it\u2019s also effectively another bailout, and the rest of the eurozone isn\u2019t prepared to start talking about that until the existing programme is completed. And as the ESM\u2019s shareholders are the 19 members of the eurozone, this idea can\u2019t get off the ground -- as Peter Spiegel of the FT tweeted this morning: Greek readers might appreciate this too: The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development has also warned that Greece would be plunged into a major recession if it defaulted on its debts, hurting economies across Eastern Europe. The baseline assumption in today\u2019s EBRD report is that an agreement will be reached between Greece and the lending institutions,. That would helping confidence and stability and could pave the way for a return to modest growth in the second half of the year, pulling Greece out of recession. Growth could then rise to 2% in 2016, as improved confidence and the ECB\u2019s QE programme kick in. However... these forecasts would be rendered completely invalid in a negative scenario of missed sovereign debt payments, capital controls, limits on deposit withdrawals and the possible introduction of IOUs (\u201cpseudo euros\u201d) or equivalent instruments to pay domestic obligations. In this case, Greece would likely fall back to a major recession, the size and duration of which are difficult to quantify now. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has worrying news for Russia and Ukraine today. In its new Regional Economic Prospects report, the EBRD warned that Russia\u2019s downturn is hurting neighbouring countries, undermining the benefit of the stronger eurozone. The Bank sees little immediate improvement either: Russia itself is expected to suffer a significant recession with the economy shrinking by 4.5% percent in 2015 and by close to two per cent in 2016. The country may face a protracted period of slow growth or stagnation. Low oil prices and sanctions have taken their toll on an already weak economy with deep-seated structural problems. Ukraine is expected to suffer an extremely deep recession this year, of around 7.5%: The economic disruption in the east of the country, the negative impact of the depreciation of the hryvnia, tight economic policies, energy tariffs hikes and a continued contraction of credit are expected to maintain pressures on the economy this year. Here\u2019s the report: EBRD economies split between eurozone boost and harsh wind of Russian recession Now here\u2019s a funny thing. Shares in a Canadian banknote printing firm have soared this month, amid rumours that it has a deal with Greece to produce a new currency if it left the eurozone. Shares in Vancouver-based Fortress Paper jumped from 2.30 Canadian dollars to over C$4 this week, before dipping back to C$3.75 last night. Bloomberg has been chasing the story: Fortress said Tuesday it doesn\u2019t know why its shares are climbing, and chief executive officer Chadwick Wasilenk declined to comment when a Bloomberg reporter cornered him. Under stock market rules, Fortress couldn\u2019t keep quiet if it had actually won a major contract, especially once its shares started motoring. So there may be precisely nothing in it. I can\u2019t immediately find another reason for the rally, though. Fortress did report results week, showing it racked up an EBITDA loss of $2.5 million for the first quarter. One to watch, though... Elsewhere in Greece today, the deputy defence minister has reignited speculation that a referendum could be held. Kostas Isychos insisted that Greece will not oblige foreign lenders by simply crossing its \u201cred lines,\u201d . Helena Smith reports: Speaking to Star TV, Isychos said: \u201cIt [the referendum] is something that is still on the table. Leftists have to decide what kind of Europe they want.\u201d Isychos, a leading member of the governing radical left Syriza party who was raised in Canada, also defended the government\u2019s decision to play what has been described as a highly provocative video, depicting Nazi war atrocities, to passengers on the Athens subway. At a time when World War II anniversaries had been coming in thick and fast, Isychos said it was very important that young Greeks were reminded of what had happened during the Third Reich\u2019s occupation of the country. \u201cWe want and, we we will, find ways to heal wounds of the past with the German people,\u201d said Isychos who is leading Greece\u2019s campaign to win war reparations from Berlin. I must confess I\u2019m a little confused about exactly what Yanis Varoufakis is proposing about Greece\u2019s bond repayments. So in an attempt to nail down precisely what\u2019s happening, here\u2019s Reuters latest story from Athens: Greece\u2019s Varoufakis says debt swap fills Draghi\u2019s \u201csoul with fear\u201d Repayment of what Greece owes to the European Central Bank should be pushed into the future, but it is not an option because it fills ECB chief Mario Draghi\u2019s \u201csoul with fear\u201d, Greece\u2019s finance minister said on Thursday. Yanis Varoufakis said Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, cannot risk irritating Germany with such a debt swap because of Berlin\u2019s objection to his bond-buying programme. Varoufakis first raised the idea of swapping Greek debt for growth-linked or perpetual bonds when his leftist government came to power earlier this year, But Athens has since dropped the proposal after it got a cool reception from euro zone partners. The outspoken minister, who has been sidelined in talks with European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders, brought it up again on Thursday, saying \u20ac27bn of bonds owed to the ECB after \u20ac6.7bn worth are repaid in July and August should be pushed back. \u201cWhat must be done (is that) these 27 billion of bonds that are still held by the ECB should be taken from there and sent overnight to the distant future,\u201d he told parliament. \u201cHow could this be done? Through a swap. The idea of a swap between the Greek government and the ECB fills Mr. Draghi\u2019s soul with fear. Because you know that Mr. Draghi is in a big struggle against the Bundesbank, which is fighting against QE. Mr. Weidmann in particular is opposing it.\u201d Varoufakis was referring to the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing (QE) or bond-buying plan and Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann\u2019s unabashed criticism of it. Varoufakis said the bond-buying plan is \u201ceverything for Mr. Draghi\u201d but that \u201callowing such a swap of our own new bonds with these bonds ... would feed Mr. Weidmann with excuses to create problems with the ECB\u2019s QE.\u201d Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government stormed to power in January promising it would end austerity and demand a debt writeoff from lenders to make the country\u2019s debt manageable. It has spoken little about debt relief in recent months as it tries to focus on reaching a deal with lenders on a cash-for-reforms deal, which has proved difficult amid a deadlock on pension and labour issues. Yanis Varoufakis has just turned to Twitter to insists he\u2019s not refusing to repay the European Central Bank: A good example of the dangers of speaking at Economist conferences during vital debt negotiations, I\u2019d humbly suggest. But in the interests of fighting propaganda, let\u2019s remind ourselves what Varoufakis said [from 9.38am], according to Reuters. Over July-August the finance ministry will have to borrow \u20ac6.7bn from our partners in one way or the other to repay bonds from the SMP programme. \u201cAbout \u20ac27bn of those bonds are still left, which should be repaid in the next months or years. These bonds should be pushed back to the distant future. This is clear.\u201d The pound has hit a new near-six-month high this morning, hitting $1.58 against the dollar for the first time since November. Greece\u2019s prime minister appears to have rolled out his best summer suit to welcome a group of visitors from the US. AHEPA, or the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, was set up more than 90 years ago to help Greek immigrants integrate into US society. Over to the markets. After a weak start, the FTSE 100 is now flat this morning as traders take a breather. Other European markets are up, welcoming the fact that bond markets are calm after some wild days recently. Credit Agricole\u2019s Fred Ducrozet reckons that Greece has no hope of persuading the ECB to let it delay repaying \u20ac6.7bn of maturing debt. Delaying Greece\u2019s ECB repayments would effectively be a debt restructuring, points out ING economist Carsten Brzeski: Mario Draghi will get the chance to respond to Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s comments this afternoon, when he gives the Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture in Washington. Yanis Varoufakis has also argued that Greece shouldn\u2019t meet the \u20ac6.7bn of debt repayments it owes the European Central Bank this summer. He told the Economist conference that Greece\u2019s debts aren\u2019t viable, and that those ECB repayments should be kicked into the long grass. Reuters has the details: \u201cOver July-August the finance ministry will have to borrow 6.7 billion euros from our partners in one way or the other to repay bonds from the SMP programme,\u201d Yanis Varoufakis told a conference in Athens, referring to bonds bought by the ECB under the Securities Market Programme over 2010-2011. \u201cAbout \u20ac27bn of those bonds are still left, which should be repaid in the next months or years. These bonds should be pushed back to the distant future. This is clear.\u201d Unless Greece get an agreement with its creditors soon, it will enter July with no bailout funds. The ECB repayment bill is the biggest hurdle facing Greece in the next few months, as this chart shows: (T-bills are short-term debt that can usually be rolled over.) Yanis Varoufakis, the embattled Greek finance minister, has just sparked fresh speculation over his future. He told the Economist conference in Athens that he will \u201cnever put my signature\u201d to an agreement where Greece is once again plunged into an economic death spiral. Analysts are saying this might well foreshadow his departure - either he gets the deal he wants or he leaves, explains our correspondent Helena Smith. As we covered earlier, negotiations between the Greek government and its creditors are resuming in Brussels today as the clock ticks down. On Monday night, Varoufakis warned that Greece\u2019s liquidity crisis was now extremely urgent, and could come to a head within two weeks. Greece must pay wage and pensions at the end of this month, and then faces repayments to the IMF in June. Over in Athens, Greece\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is addressing a conference organised by the Economist. Helena Smith reports: In a speech that is likely to be dominated by a Q &amp; A session, the Greek finance minister started out saying that \u201cif Greece doesn\u2019t reform it will sink\u201d after explaining why the ongoing negotiations were \u201cso marathon.\u201d \u201cWe all agree that Greece should not suffer the indignity of [excessive primary surpluses].\u201d Last night emerging from the finance ministry Varoufakis told protesting tax office employees gathered outside that negotiations between Greece and its creditors were now at \u201cthe most difficult \u2026 precarious point.\u201d The minister took the protestors aback saying the negotiations had reached a point where the government had come under pressure to \u201ctake all existing wages above \u20ac700 and bring them below \u20ac700.\u201d And here\u2019s exactly what Mark Carney said about the risks that uncertainty over the EU referendum poses, via ITV News. We talk to a lot of bosses and there has been an awareness of some of this political uncertainty - whether because of the election or because of the referendum. What they\u2019ve been telling us, and we see it in the statistics, is they have not yet acted on that uncertainty - or to put it another way, they are continuing to invest, they are continuing to hire. Mark Carney has done his best to take the string out of today\u2019s Daily Mail front page splash, saying he blamed foreign workers for \u201cdragging down wages\u201d As he explained, at some length, to John Humphrys, net migration is only one factor in the complicated puzzle of why UK productivity has been so weak. The wider expansion of the labour market (older workers, and part-timers working more hours) has also made it easier for companies to take on more staff rather than paying existing workers more - or investing in expensive machinery. And if they have the right skills, foreign workers can be a key driver of higher productivity (and thus higher wages), as they become established in the UK. On interest rates, Carney was rather vague, saying it was \u2018possible\u2019 that rates would be higher in a year. Such a change from his early days in the UK, when he laid out clear \u2018\u2019forward guidance\u2019 of the conditions that could prompt a rise in borrowing costs. And his comments on the EU referendum were interesting. Governors aren\u2019t allowed to cross into politics*, but Carney did indicate that it would be good to get the uncertainty out of the way before business confidence and investment is hit. Here\u2019s the key quote (from Reuters): \u201cIt\u2019s in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision... The government has made it clear that it is a priority. I am sure the government will act with appropriate speed in developing the negotiations.\u201d * - although it wouldn\u2019t be a big surprise if Mr Carney switched to Canadian politics when his work at the Bank of England is over. Mark Carney also cautions against assuming that the UK economy recovery will be smooth and simple. We face a weak global economy, the impact of fiscal consolidation [George Osborne\u2019s deficit reduction plans], and the challenge of completing the repair of the financial system. Economic growth will also be \u201cdampened\u201d by the strong pound, he adds [it hit a five-month high against the dollar yesterday]. The next interest move will probably be up, Carney adds, and it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d that rates will be higher in a year\u2019s time. Onto general economic issue, and Carney says that interest rates will rise in a gradual manner, when the time comes.... Is the Bank of England worried that a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU will cause uncertainty and hit business confidence? The Bank doesn\u2019t believe that businesses have yet acted on the uncertainty. It\u2019s in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision, governor Carney replies. And the speed? I wouldn\u2019t put a timetable on it, Carney says Humphrys presses him - Would you like it to be completed earlier than the end of 2017? It should take place \u201cas soon as necessary\u201d, Carney concludes. As businesses run out of labour, productivity should go up, says Carney. But you\u2019ve been predicting a rise in productivity for years... Yes, and it should start to move up soon, Carney replies But there are 4.8m foreign workers in the economy, isn\u2019t that pushing down wages and productivity, asks Humphrys. Mark Carney explains that foreign workers usually enter the labour market in jobs which are below their skill set. Over time, they rise up through the workforce, take on more high-skilled jobs and contribute to rising productivity. The bottom line is that British people want to work more, and they have been able to do so (unemployment has fallen to 5.5%). Humphrys asks if foreign workers are to blame for Britain\u2019s poor productivity growth. \u201cI\u2019d really dampen that down\u201d, Mark Carney replies. There are 300,000 more older workers who wouldn\u2019t normally still be in the labour market. And there are 200,00 to 300,00 more people who wanted to work more hours. That\u2019s around 500,000 people. Compare that to net migration - it\u2019s up by 50,000 in the last two years. Carney concludes: The real story is that British people want to work more. John Humphrys asks if it\u2019s true that households would be \u00a35000 per year, after tax, if productivity had grown at the pre-crisis rate. Wages would be higher in the \u201chigh teens\u201d, Carney agrees. Governor Carney is on the Today Programme now.... John Humphrys asks why productivity is so weak. Carney says the Bank has been repeatedly disappointed by UK productivity. It is the key determinant for wages and living standards in the UK. You can listen to the Mark Carney interview live, here. Mark Carney is likely to be quizzed about migration when he is interviewed on the Today programme in a few minutes. Yesterday\u2019s Bank of England Inflation Report identified net migration as one factor that has pushed down wage growth; the comment made the front page of the Daily Mail: So what did Carney actually say? In recent years labour supply has expanded significantly owing to higher participation rates among older workers, a greater willingness to work longer hours and strong population growth, partly driven by higher net migration. These positive labour supply shocks have contained wage growth in the face of robust employment growth. Wages have grown by around 2% in the past year \u2013 less than half the average rate before the global financial crisis \u2013 and a key risk is that these subdued growth rates continue. Here\u2019s Mark Carney\u2019s full statement. Last night\u2019s Greek cabinet meeting focused on changes to the tax system, and possible privatisations, ahead of today\u2019s talks with creditors today. The Kathimerini newspaper adds: Officials also discussed the possible timing for drafting some of these changes into legislation in a bid to show good will and convince the European Central Bank to relax liquidity restrictions on Greece. Greece\u2019s government has instructed its negotiating team to speed up the talks with its lenders, in an attempt to bridge the gaps before it runs out of funds. The Athens government issued the instructions after a late-night cabinet meeting, which was overshadowed by the news that Greece was back in recession. However, Greece has not caved in, yet, on issues such as pension reform and workers\u2019 rights. Reuters has the details: Greece\u2019s negotiating team will continue talks with the country\u2019s international creditors to reach a cash-for-reforms deal, a government official said after a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. \u201cThe cabinet authorised the negotiating team at the Brussels Group to continue talks starting on Thursday, aiming at a mutually beneficial agreement,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe instructions given to the negotiating team were to move in such a way to speed up the process.\u201d However, the leftist government\u2019s red lines have not changed, the official added. The cabinet also discussed a planned VAT tax reform in order to be ready to legislate, depending on the progress of the negotiations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ll be tracking two of the world\u2019s most powerful central bankers today. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is due on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme his morning, at 8.10am. He\u2019ll be discussing the state of the UK economy, a day after the BOE cut its growth forecasts and warned that productivity remains disappointingly weak. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, is in Washington today to give the Camdessus Central Banking Lecture. That starts at 11am East Coast time or 4pm BST. Draghi will then hold talks with the International Monetary Fund; the Greek debt crisis will be high on the agenda. In the City, shares are expected to dip this morning as the recent turbulence in the bond market hits confidence. Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam explains: \u201cThe bond market moves are making investors quite anxious. I think everyone expected yields to rise once we started to see a bounce in oil prices as, naturally, this would change people\u2019s inflation outlook... \u201cThe pace at which they\u2019ve risen has been quite surprising, which is probably a consequence of a lack of liquidity in the market at the moment. A small change in attitude can have a much greater impact.\u201d I\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day.",

For pensioners, and for those saving ahead of retirement, low interest rates may not be an inducement to bring consumption forward. They may on the contrary become an inducement to save <em>more</em>, to compensate for a slower rate of accumulation of pension assets.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>However, he argues that those savers wouldn\u2019t benefit if the central bank simply gave up on its mandate:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the contrary, the interest of long-term savers is that output be raised to potential without undue delay. This is because their financial assets are always, in the final analysis, a claim on the wealth generated by the productive part of the economy. So it is in their interest that output growth remains on a robust path as this maximises the likelihood that their claims are honoured in full.

Those measures have proven so far to be potent, more so than many observers anticipated. But their potency is also because they have interacted with other policies that have put the economy and the financial sector in a better position to respond to our monetary impulses.</p> <p>This includes the Comprehensive Assessment of euro area banks. And it includes structural reforms where they have been implemented. By the same token, structural reforms that increase confidence in economic prospects and encourage entrepreneurs to capitalise on today\u2019s extremely accommodative financing conditions will make our policy commensurately more powerful.</p> <p>Policymakers in the euro area are independent, but the effects of their policies are interdependent. This is why it is ultimately only a combination of policies, that are complementary and mutually consistent, that will allow our policy to reap its full effects \u2013 and to bring about a lasting return of both prosperity and stability for the whole euro area.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5554b9b6e4b04c8ce78b6977\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-14T15:05:28.989Z\">4.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/statuses/598866553757630466\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Draghi has screwed up his Between Two Ferns appearance. <a href=\"http://t.co/RscaWIIgy5\">pic.twitter.com/RscaWIIgy5</a></p>&mdash; Mike Bird (@Birdyword) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/598866553757630466\">May 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5554b959e4b06c082628bb94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-14T15:04:59.524Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Christine Lagarde also pays tribute to Mario Draghi, and the leadership he has shown.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mario\u2014and I cannot emphasize this enough\u2014your job is one of the most difficult.

Sir John Sawers, who was head of the Secret Intelligence Service between 2009 and 2014, has joined the oil company\u2019s board as a non-executive member. BP\u2019s chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, said the former spy chief \u201cbrings extensive experience of international affairs and geopolitics\u201d. Sawers\u2019 five-year tenure as boss of MI6 spanned two prime ministers, Gordon Brown and David Cameron. He has 36 years of experience working for the UK government in international affairs and security. He has served as ambassador to the UN, as well as political director of the Foreign Office and Britain\u2019s special representative in Iraq. He is chairman and partner of Macro Advisory Partners, which advises governments and companies on geopolitics and global markets. BP\u2019s appointment of Sawers, who will be paid \u00a390,000 for his role, highlights the relevance of geopolitics to a company that is operational in about 80 countries, including some of those with challenging political backdrops such as Russia and Iraq. Last month, Standard Chartered appointed the former head of GCHQ Sir Iain Lobban to advise the bank\u2019s board on financial crime. Standard Chartered created its risk committee after a $670m (\u00a3424m) fine in 2012 for breaching US sanctions on Iran, for which the bank remains under scrutiny by regulators. Alongside Sawers\u2019 appointment, BP announced that it had also appointed Paula Rosput Reynolds as a non-executive director. Reynolds has more than 25 years\u2019 experience in the energy sector, including as president and chief executive of the US gas distributor AGL Resources. The appointments come at a key time for BP\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley, who is attempting to restore the company to full health following the devastating Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. BP was forced to cut its dividend following the spill, but last month sought to reassure investors that the company was sound business-wise despite low oil prices when it announced first-quarter results. BP announced a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share, unchanged from the previous quarter. First-quarter profits beat City forecasts because BP benefited from a one-off gain from UK government\u2019s changes to the taxation of North Sea oil operations. The oil company said profit excluding non-operating items and accounting effects for the first three months of 2015 fell by 20% to $2.6bn (\u00a31.6bn). It was the first quarter to reflect the full impact of the sharp fall in oil prices, but the profit was still double the $1.3bn expected by City analysts.",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has intervened in the EU referendum debate, saying an in/out poll should take place \u201cas soon as necessary\u201d. Mark Carney said the prospect of a referendum was stoking business uncertainty, which could hurt the economy if companies start putting off investment plans. Asked whether he believed the referendum should be held sooner rather than later, Carney replied: \u201cThe government has made it clear that it is a priority. I am sure the government will act with appropriate speed in developing the negotiations ... as soon as necessary.\u201d Carney said that companies were already expressing concerns over David Cameron\u2019s promised referendum and a potential UK exit from the EU. \u201cIt\u2019s in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201c[The EU] is the largest economy in the world. It\u2019s our largest investment destination. It\u2019s the largest investor in the United Kingdom.\u201d The Bank\u2019s top policymaker said that while businesses had already flagged up concerns over the poll, they were yet to act on them by delaying or cancelling spending plans. The prime minister has promised a vote on EU membership by the end of 2017. Carney also played down the idea that cheap foreign labour was to blame for poor UK productivity and weak wage growth. The governor said he wanted to \u201creally dampen down\u201d that view, arguing that a better explanation of weak wage growth was the increase in the number of British people willing to work. He highlighted a jump in the number of older people wanting to work, as well as a rise in the number of people wanting to work more hours. He said: \u201cThe facts of this recovery have been there has been a huge growth in employment, one of the strongest job markets in the world, and we have seen a big increase in the willingness of the British people, British nationals, to work. \u201cIn the course of the last two years, the number of older workers \u2013 people in their 50s and 60s \u2013 who stayed in the labour market has been 300,000 more than we would have seen in previous times. In addition, people want to work more hours. That\u2019s another 200,000 to 300,000 more workers, effectively more workers.\u201d \u201cCompare that to the increase in net migration \u2013 the increase in the number of people coming to these shores \u2013 the first two numbers I just gave you total up to more than 500,000, the increase in net migration over that same period in the last two years is 50,000. \u201cSo the real story here is that British people have wanted to work more and what\u2019s happened with the economy.\u201d Carney said productivity should pick up because spare capacity is being used up. He added that migrants tend to contribute to improved productivity over time, starting in jobs for which they are over-qualified before securing jobs more suited to their skills. He said: \u201cThey contribute to that increase in productivity. That is something we see across the economy.\u201d Asked whether he might be talking about a rise in interest rates this time next year, Carney replied: \u201cIt is possible but it depends on the evolution of the economy. What we are not going to do is put up rates too soon or too fast.\u201d Interest rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009. Carney added that UK inflation \u2013 currently at zero \u2013 would probably turn negative when the figures for April are published on 19 May. He said, however, that inflation should start to pick up again by the end of the year.",
