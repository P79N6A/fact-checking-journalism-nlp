      "bodyText": "Coming as it did the day after the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, told an audience of economists that average earnings for Australian workers were growing at the lowest level since the 1960s, the win by the AMWU against the company behind Streets ice-creams this week was a good advertisement for being a member of a union. In his speech, Lowe noted that one of the reasons behind the 50-year-low wages growth was that there had been \u201can increase in the proportion of new employees hired on lower salaries than their predecessors\u201d. What is also happening is that companies are using (previously) exceptional bargaining tactics to try to get current workers on lower salaries. However, in an age of social media, when the dispute involves companies where brand management is vital, unions are able to fight back. In August, when Unilever sought to terminate its enterprise bargaining agreement at the Streets ice-cream factory in Sydney, the AMWU quickly moved into action to organise a boycott. Coming off the back of its recent successful boycott of CUB products, after 55 workers were sacked at its Abbotsford plant last year, it shows that unions certainly have learned how to use social media to their advantage. The problem with organising a boycott of a company mostly involves alerting people of the boycott and then encouraging action. Whereas once this would have required expensive national media advertisements, now with Facebook and Twitter unions are able to get their message in front of people and in a way that encourages action. The AWMU social media team has been particularly adept. When, for example the member for Mackeller, Jason Falinski, posted a gif of himself eating a Streets ice-cream to show support for the company, the AMWU twitter account absolutely roasted him and his rather inept method of eating it. Of course the standard line is that Twitter activism is weak and good for getting likes and retweets but not so much for action. Similarly, the suggestion is that Facebook campaigns are great for getting people to share a video or picture but not for taking action. But while this certainly does occur, and you should never fall into the trap of assuming what you observe on your social media is a true reflection of voters or national opinion, where it is effective in campaigns is against the very thing that companies so love about social media. The reason Facebook is one of the world\u2019s biggest companies is not because we all like sharing pics of our cats but that companies love using it for advertising while we share our cat pics. But while social media can be good for getting people to buy products, it is likewise very good for getting people not to buy them as well. The AWMU team, for example, used its Facebook page to disrupt the social media launch of the Streets Gaytime Sanga \u2013 and that resulted in the launch video being removed after people inundated it with negative comments. In the end the boycott clearly was having an impact \u2013 and it probably is not a coincidence that Unilever agreed to a deal that saw the end of the boycott the day before the first Ashes Test began. The last thing any ice-cream company needs is people avoiding eating its products during summer. But while this boycott worked, and is a good example of the power of a union, the broader problem is that the tactics employed by Unilever are becoming more common and will not always be used by companies with such consumer-driven businesses. As is the case with social media campaigns in the US supporting or boycotting companies for their political positions, or the actions taken by companies in light of recent accusations of sexual harassment \u2013 which would once have involved much sweeping under the rug \u2013 the voice of social media is loud and forces companies to act. But it is easier to organise a boycott of a product people buy at the supermarket than it is when that item might be just part of a production chain, or is a university \u2013 such as Murdoch University which earlier this year successfully applied to the Fair Work Commission for the right to cancel the EBA with its staff. And the issue is that cancelling enterprise bargaining agreements, in effect blackmailing workers into accepting a new agreement, is becoming a more common option. The old ways of renegotiating, using the expiring agreement as the starting point, is being replaced by this so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d . The Department of Employment, in its submission to the Senate committee inquiry into Corporate Avoidance of the Fair Work Act, noted that of the 847 EBAs that had been terminated from 2014 though to September 2016, nearly 60% had occurred in the last 12 months of that three-year period. In the past 12 months there were as few private sector EBAs approved as occurred in 1997 \u2013 a time when there were nearly three million fewer people employed than now. Employers are doing what they can to get their workers off EBAs and their generally better union-negotiated conditions and wage rises. The ALP-led Senate committee recommended that the Fair Work Act be amended such that the Fair Work Commission would be prevented from \u201cterminating an agreement where workers would be worse off as a result of the termination\u201d \u2013 and this remains the ALP\u2019s policy. The victory for workers in the Streets case is a prime example of how unions can achieve results. But it is also a visible insight into wage negotiation tactics. And while the boycott might make other more retail-dependent companies wary of going the nuclear option, while the law allows it, many more companies under the radar will continue to do so.",

      "bodyText": "Britain outside the European Union will enjoy much cheaper imports. That\u2019s one of the threads running through arguments for Brexit. Outside the high walls of the EU\u2019s economic fortress, we can scour the Earth for the cheapest stuff on offer, buy it and and bring it home to consume, saving ourselves billions of pounds. This policy fits well with a country that is coming to terms with low productivity growth and with it, only stumbling increases in average wages. Low productivity and low wage rises are with us until at least 2023, according to the Treasury\u2019s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), in a report accompanying the budget. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, in its role as chief budget watchdog, warned that the OBR analysis showed that average wages would still be well below their 2008 level in the middle of the next decade, when adjusted for inflation. What better solution is there, when earnings are flat, than to ditch the EU\u2019s punitive tariffs and make the monthly salary go further? Trade secretary Liam Fox has talked about the benefits of tariff-free meat from South Africa, wine from New Zealand and chicken from the US. It would cut the price of the weekly shop and mean that wages stretch further. Fox, who has stayed out of the limelight since he was ridiculed for launching a new board of trade with only himself as an official member (though he did emerge this month to defend the benefits post-Brexit of chlorinated chicken imports from the US), believes that Britain\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit has been strangled by the EU and its protectionist tariffs. A lower exchange rate is the spur for growth, but has the knock-on effect of increasing inflation. And that is killing growth at the moment. However, the effects can be mitigated by taking away the tariffs and allowing globally-sourced cheap stuff onto supermarket shelves. Of course, this presumes that British businesses remain strong enough to benefit from their newfound freedom to trade with whoever they want. If Fox had listened to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane, he would know about the UK\u2019s reliance on a small proportion of highly productive companies and the long tail of largely unproductive \u201czombie\u201d ones that tick along without making much money or paying their workers much in salary, pension or other benefits. He would have looked at official figures last week showing that Britain has seen a stupendous growth in the number of graduates \u2013 from 24% of 21 to 64-year-olds (not in education) in 2002, to 42% in September. Yet, more than one in three (37%) of those who graduated more than five years ago are languishing in non-graduate jobs. Almost half of those who graduated in the last five years are in non-graduate level jobs. This is not only a waste of talent, skill, and potential, it means that Britain is far from ready to compete. And the problem is not just confined to those who succeeded academically. Teenagers looking for a route into the jobs market via apprenticeships have been turned away in their droves since the government brought in its new levy system. The levy acts like a tax on employers who get the money back when they take on an apprentice. But employers report that they simply don\u2019t understand the way the levy works and all the paperwork that goes with it. A 59% fall in those taking up trainee posts since the scheme was launched should shame Greg Clark, the business minister who will on Monday outline his plans for a new industrial strategy. It\u2019s a racing certainty that he will ignore this fact as he lays out his meagre plans for a railway line here and a widened road there. Education is a key element of the UK\u2019s infrastructure. So when just 48,000 people started an apprenticeship in the final three months of the educational year to July 2017, compared with 117,800 in the same period a year before, it is easy to see that he has a mountain to climb. Fox will no doubt argue that his drive for trade deals would increase the demand for skilled staff and that fact \u2013 almost on its own \u2013 would create the demand and the training needed to generate a skilled labour force. The trouble with this argument is that there are huge time lags between winning new business and being able to meet the customer\u2019s requirements with better trained and managed staff. And as long as the zombie companies have poorly trained managers and under-skilled staff, is it any wonder that the banks are reluctant to lend them more money? Much better to lend it on property. Which brings us back to the budget. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, made sure that property continued to give a better return than investing in the real economy after he cut stamp duty on homes worth less than \u00a3300,000 for first-time buyers and promised to support some extra building. The share prices of all the major developers and the big estate agents jumped. Was there any cash to help apprentices earn more than \u00a3100 a week or to help employers deal with an apprentice system in crisis? No. But don\u2019t worry. The UK\u2019s economy is like a coiled spring, ready to go.",

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s race to quit coal has hit a speed bump as energy companies face local political resistance to the closure of power stations burning the polluting fuel. ScottishPower owner Iberdrola said this month that it was closing its last two coal power stations in Spain as part of its plan to cut carbon emissions and switch to cleaner power generation. But days later the Spanish government reacted by blocking the shutdowns, starting the process for a royal decree that would give ministers the final say on any power station closure if it was deemed to affect energy security. Despite the company\u2019s protestations, \u00c1lvaro Nadal, the country\u2019s energy minister, told Iberdrola last week that Madrid\u2019s opposition was firm. To an extent, the impasse is a problem peculiar to Spain: despite most of the coal burned by the country\u2019s power plants being imported, its vocal mining lobby still carries political clout. But it is not the only example in Europe of political concerns rubbing up against the EU\u2019s climate change goals and energy companies trying to transform themselves from coal-burning polluters into green energy firms: Enel, the world\u2019s biggest utility by customer numbers, has faced similar hiccups in Italy. The cases also raise questions about whether the UK\u2019s progressive and self-imposed coal phase-out, due to conclude by 2025, will be as painless as it has been so far, if energy supply concerns bite. Although Madrid argues its policy is about security of supply, energy experts point out the country has too much power capacity, not too little. Chris Littlecott at the thinktank E3G said: \u201cSpain could comfortably switch off all of its coal power plants and use its other existing capacity. The debate in Spain is much more driven by domestic politics, and regional organised opposition, particularly by unions, that is playing back into national politics.\u201d Environment group WWF Spain branded the intervention a \u201cdesperate move\u201d to block the transition to a \u201c100% renewable and fossil-free future\u201d. Iberdrola has pointed out the two plants account for just 0.87% of the country\u2019s electricity generation capacity; that it also operates several idle gas power stations that could be fired up if needed; and that none of the 170 employees affected will lose their jobs. Keith Anderson, chief corporate officer for ScottishPower, said the Spanish closures were a natural extension of the company\u2019s years-long shift away from coal, which resulted in it closing Scotland\u2019s last coal plant last year. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is saying: let\u2019s keep pushing down that journey, let\u2019s look at shutting down those coal plants,\u201d he said. \u201cEconomically we don\u2019t perceive this as being a big concern and the upside is we get more investment in renewables \u2026 We would urge the Spanish government to look at the opportunity here.\u201d Francesco Starace, chief executive of Italy-based Enel, thinks it is inevitable that the Spanish situation will be repeated in other European countries. \u201cI think yes, it\u2019s logical. Because typically coal plants \u2013 that nobody loves but everybody clings to \u2013 are plants that have been around for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cSo every time you say \u2018I want to shut down this unit\u2019, there\u2019s always the question \u2018OK, and how about the people working there?\u2019 Provided you give an answer about that, then it\u2019s \u2018OK, what is the balance of energy supply and demand?\u2019\u201d In 2015 the company committed to phasing out 23 of its coal and gas power stations, as it shifts its investments to solar and wind power. But it has run into roadblocks similar to Iberdrola\u2019s. When Enel said it was shutting two small coal stations at Genoa and Bastardo \u2013 \u201cwe are talking about really the smallest of them all\u201d, said Starace \u2013 ministers raised concerns over supply and ordered them to stay open. The firm is still awaiting permits from the Italian government to close the plants. Starace, who will decide on the fate of four more plants by the end of the year, said he understood the concerns. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fair debate that needs to happen: you cannot just say \u2018we\u2019re shutting down and that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d he said. But he added that the Spanish situation showed the importance of Brussels\u2019s overarching targets to cut emissions and generate more power from renewables. \u201cHow do we want to decarbonise? Do we really want to decarbonise? Or is this something that goes back and forth, country by country by country? That is a reason we have a European commission and European directives,\u201d he said. In the UK, the swift phasing-out of coal has been relatively painless, but will it suffer Spain and Italy\u2019s problems when the country\u2019s last eight coal stations have to close by the 2025 deadline? Anderson believes the milestone \u201cshould be no issue in the UK\u201d, because mechanisms are in place to bring forward investment in new, cleaner power by then. And Littlecott agrees that the UK is a different case: \u201cThe last pockets of coal mining in countries like Spain and Poland still exert localised political pressure. The UK\u2019s situation is very different, with the challenge here now being to capitalise on the industrial opportunities and jobs growth from clean technologies.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor may have been keen to talk about the autonomous future in his budget, but the money that talked loudest last week came from Uber\u2019s billion-pound deal with Swedish carmaker Volvo. The scale of the order suggests driverless cars could indeed be just around the corner: 24,000 Volvos are to be kitted out with the ride-hailing company\u2019s self-driving technology between 2019 and 2021. Assuming a robot driver can do three times as many shifts as a human, those cars alone could replace, for example, every non-Uber taxi or minicab in London. How Uber deploys its new driverless SUVs remains to be seen: but the news underlines how the technology could rapidly change the face of transport, manufacturing and work. So who will win and lose in the driverless future? Winners Technology companies The race has been led by Google\u2019s self-driving division, now spun off as Waymo, which has just started trials of a driverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. Even before its first lift has been hailed by a member of the public \u2013 and without having made a car of its own, as it currently buys in Chrysler minivans \u2013 Waymo has been valued at $70bn (\u00a352bn) by Morgan Stanley. Mobileye, an Israeli maker of chips and cameras for self-driving vehicles with revenues of only $300m a year, was bought by Intel for $15.3bn in March. Uber is rushing to develop its own robo-taxi tech to scale up profits on its enormous global customer base. Richard Cuerden, academy director at the British transport research centre TRL, says of the future: \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we will buy cars as we do now for personal ownership. Firms will make money through things like data sharing and advertising.\u201d Passengers The utopian vision of a driverless future is that just about everyone would benefit from shorter, safer and more productive journeys. If driverlessness means shared ownership, as many hope and believe, as well as more efficient use of road space through intelligent and connected vehicles, there is the scope to massively reduce congestion. If the model also reduces the costs of door-to-door transport, cars could go a long way to ensuring more independent mobility for the elderly and disabled. Online media and retailers Fewer young people are buying cars, and not just because they are strapped for cash: smartphones and tablets mean journeys by bus or train are more enjoyable. Today\u2019s stressed driver can hope for a similar future, Cuerden says: \u201cYou needn\u2019t face forward any more, you\u2019ll be doing a million different things. The holy grail is to free up that time.\u201d Watching Netflix, Instagramming the motorway, internet shopping: a whole new segment of the population will be online and available. Logistics firms The unveiling by Elon Musk of Tesla\u2019s Semi electric truck, with its autopilot features, will have caught the attention of haulage firms. Around one-third of costs in the $7bn US trucking industry is drivers\u2019 wages. In the UK, salaries have risen due to a lack of drivers: the Freight Transport Association last year said there was a shortfall of almost 35,000 drivers compared with available HGVs. Firms whose delivery routes and schedules are minutely plotted to save time, fuel and money, will probably hope that trials of \u201cplatooned\u201d lorries \u2013 linked vehicles travelling in convoy with perhaps just one driver in the lead cab \u2013 are just the first step to a driverless future. Lithium miners As chancellor Philip Hammond said while announcing a \u00a3400m fund for charging networks, the road to autonomy starts with electric cars. And those batteries need minerals: the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to more than double in value in the next seven years to around $75bn, according to Transparency Market Research, as electric car sales grow. Elements such as cobalt will be in increasing demand, and mining firms such as Glencore have already struck deals with carmakers who want to lock in supplies. Losers Traditional car manufacturers Many expect the number of vehicles in private household ownership to fall. Car manufacturers have been hiring directors from software and tech firms as the market has tilted \u2013 witness Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing Ford and GM\u2019s this year. Partnerships between Ford and Uber\u2019s rival Lyft, as well as Volvo\u2019s Uber deal, could point to how sales evolve. Philippa Oldham, head of transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, says: \u201cTraditional sales have already been going down year-on-year as people go to a leasing model. \u201cFord and BMW have car-share businesses, while BMW is diversifying into repurposing batteries as energy storage solutions in homes. The challenge is where they develop their business models.\u201d Insurance firms The majority of car accidents involve some element of human error, and predictions in studies of the potential drop in fatalities from self-driving cars have ranged from 80 to 95%. KPMG found insurance premiums could be expected to drop by 50% in a decade. On the other hand, some expect an increase in crashes \u2013 and more wrangles for insurers\u2019 legal departments \u2013 during the transition period while humans and machines share the roads. Other issues remain, as Martyn Thomas, professor of IT at Gresham College, warns: \u201cHow they will price the risk of hacking is a complete mystery: a cybersecurity vulnerability that could be exploited by criminals could affect thousands of cars in a single day and put insurers out of business.\u201d But, says Nick Reed, head of mobility research at component maker Bosch, motor insurance has to survive, even if it is passed to manufacturers and fleets once owner-drivers become passengers: \u201cThe business model will change. But consumers always need to have the confidence that, in the event of an incident, there is compensation.\u201d Service stations and hotels Goodbye, Moto? The appeal of a picnic on the M6 may diminish substantially when humans are no longer prompted by driver fatigue to pull in, and are instead engrossed in season 54 of The Simpsons. Electric charging networks may well not operate like petrol stations, where a vehicle has to pull in to refuel. However, should full autonomy allow all occupants to drink en route, more frequent stops could become a human necessity. While few UK journeys might require an overnight commute, a vehicle comfortable enough to sleep in could make hotels a less necessary option for business travellers \u2013 while longer US trips might be continued without the need for a roadside motel. Professional drivers Around a million people in the UK who drive for a living could have to retrain, the chancellor said, acknowledging that \u201cfor some people, this will be very challenging\u201d. Cuerden is not convinced that so many jobs would be lost: \u201cWe\u2019re leading the HGV platooning trials, which see trucks operating more effectively \u2013 but all would need drivers for now. Long term, they might have time on their hands, but perform new tasks.\u201d By 2030, he believes, the bulk of journeys will be covered autonomously, but a human backup could remain. Meanwhile, many taxi firms still value \u201cthe customer interface, the human touch,\u201d Cuerden says. \u201cSo drivers might become stewards.\u201d Government coffers The \u00a346bn that the UK government claims to have forsaken by freezing fuel duty may be only a warm-up for the gaping hole that an all-electric fleet would mean. Tens of millions in revenue for traffic offences could also be jeopardised by law-abiding robots. British councils also made a \u00a3750m profit on parking in 2016. Some have predicted that the UK parking industry, worth \u00a31.5bn in 2015, would effectively disappear in a world of fewer cars. However, the British Parking Association remains defiantly upbeat: \u201cThe number of cars entering, exiting and navigating a parking facility will likely be very much the same as it is now. Just without people.\u201d Visions of the future? Five self-driving cars Westfield POD The most futuristic way to get around Greenwich \u2013 at least down the towpath from the O2 Arena. The electric pods, which are built in the Midlands and souped up with driverless gadgetry from Oxbotica, are currently in public trials in south London to test how the public interacts with the technology. Navya Autonom Cab The French manufacturer\u2019s latest vehicle looks more or less like a sleek, people-carrier-style taxi. It just has no driver\u2019s seat, steering wheel, or pedals: its six passenger seats all face inwards. The Autonom Cab should be in production next year, capable of speeds of 55mph \u2013 although, as it is designed for city centres, it probably will not be seen anywhere where it is allowed to go that fast. Starts at around \u00a3230,000. Uber\u2019s Volvo XC90 London\u2019s transport authorities will be praying that Uber doesn\u2019t want to traverse its narrow streets with these chunky Volvo XC90 SUVs. The ride-hailing app ordered 24,000 of the \u00a350,000 vehicles last week, for which Uber will provide the yet-to-be-built self-driving system. The cars are already available with semi-autonomous capabilities, including some automatic braking \u2013 but Uber\u2019s self-driving version isn\u2019t expected until 2021. Tesla Model 3 This is the most affordable of Elon Musk\u2019s electric dream cars \u2013 at $35,000 in the US, it is around half the price of any other model \u2013 although pimping up its self-driving capability will cost at least $7k-$8k more, and UK buyers will have to wait at least two years if they order now. Tesla\u2019s Enhanced Autopilot can be topped up with up to eight cameras as well as sensors and an onboard computer to enable what the company claims will be full self-driving in almost all circumstances \u2013 at least, as soon as the world allows it. Audi A8 According to some early reviews, worthy of its claim to be the most advanced self-driving car available for general purchase now (or early 2018, for \u00a370k). It has so-called Level 3 Autonomy, where many driving functions can be done without human intervention \u2013 although there must still be a driver behind the wheel until the law changes. Show-offs can use their phone to make it head off and (accurately) park in the garage.",

So who will win and lose in the driverless future?</p> <h2><strong>Winners</strong></h2> <p><strong>Technology companies</strong><br>The race has been led by Google\u2019s self-driving division, now spun off as Waymo, which has just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/07/google-waymo-announces-fully-autonomous-ride-hailing-service-uber-alphabet\" title=\"\">started trials of a driverless taxi service</a> in Phoenix, Arizona. Even before its first lift has been hailed by a member of the public \u2013 and without having made a car of its own, as it currently buys in Chrysler minivans \u2013 Waymo has been valued at $70bn (\u00a352bn) by Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Mobileye, an Israeli maker of chips and cameras for self-driving vehicles with revenues of only $300m a year, was bought by Intel for $15.3bn in March. Uber is rushing to develop its own robo-taxi tech to scale up profits on its enormous global customer base.</p> <p>Richard Cuerden, academy director at the British transport research centre TRL, says of the future: \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we will buy cars as we do now for personal ownership. Firms will make money through things like data sharing and advertising.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Passengers</strong><br>The utopian vision of a driverless future is that just about everyone would benefit from shorter, safer and more productive journeys. If driverlessness means shared ownership, as many hope and believe, as well as more efficient use of road space through intelligent and connected vehicles, there is the scope to massively reduce congestion. If the model also reduces the costs of door-to-door transport, cars could go a long way to ensuring more independent mobility for the elderly and disabled.</p> <p><strong>Online media and retailers</strong><br>Fewer young people are buying cars, and not just because they are strapped for cash: smartphones and tablets mean journeys by bus or train are more enjoyable. Today\u2019s stressed driver can hope for a similar future, Cuerden says: \u201cYou needn\u2019t face forward any more, you\u2019ll be doing a million different things. The holy grail is to free up that time.\u201d Watching Netflix, Instagramming the motorway, internet shopping: a whole new segment of the population will be online and available.</p> <p><strong>Logistics firms</strong><br>The unveiling by Elon Musk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/nov/17/elon-musk-unveils-new-tesla-semi-electric-truck-video\" title=\"\">Tesla\u2019s Semi</a> electric truck, with its autopilot features, will have caught the attention of haulage firms. Around one-third of costs in the $7bn US trucking industry is drivers\u2019 wages.</p> <p>In the UK, salaries have risen due to a lack of drivers: the Freight Transport Association last year said there was a shortfall of almost 35,000 drivers compared with available HGVs. Firms whose delivery routes and schedules are minutely plotted to save time, fuel and money, will probably hope that trials of \u201cplatooned\u201d lorries \u2013 linked vehicles travelling in convoy with perhaps just one driver in the lead cab \u2013 are just the first step to a driverless future.</p> <p><strong>Lithium miners</strong><br>As chancellor Philip Hammond said while announcing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/treasury-backs-electric-cars-but-makes-limited-moves-on-diesel\" title=\"\">\u00a3400m fund for charging networks</a>, the road to autonomy starts with electric cars. And those batteries need minerals: the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/29/electric-cars-battery-manufacturing-cobalt-mining\" title=\"\">lithium-ion battery market</a> is expected to more than double in value in the next seven years to around $75bn, according to Transparency Market Research, as electric car sales grow. Elements such as cobalt will be in increasing demand, and mining firms such as Glencore have already struck deals with carmakers who want to lock in supplies.</p> <h2><strong>Losers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Traditional car manufacturers</strong><br>Many expect the number of vehicles in private household ownership to fall. Car manufacturers have been hiring directors from software and tech firms as the market has tilted \u2013 witness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/04/tesla-charges-ahead-to-overtake-ford-in-market-value\" title=\"\">Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing Ford</a> and GM\u2019s this year.</p> <p>Partnerships between Ford and Uber\u2019s rival Lyft, as well as Volvo\u2019s Uber deal, could point to how sales evolve. Philippa Oldham, head of transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, says: \u201cTraditional sales have already been going down year-on-year as people go to a leasing model.</p> <p>\u201cFord and BMW have car-share businesses, while BMW is diversifying into repurposing batteries as energy storage solutions in homes. The challenge is where they develop their business models.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Insurance firms</strong><br>The majority of car accidents involve some element of human error, and predictions in studies of the potential drop in fatalities from self-driving cars have ranged from 80 to 95%. KPMG found insurance premiums could be expected to drop by 50% in a decade.</p> <p>On the other hand, some expect an increase in crashes \u2013 and more wrangles for insurers\u2019 legal departments \u2013 during the transition period while humans and machines share the roads.</p> <p>Other issues remain, as Martyn Thomas, professor of IT at Gresham College, warns: \u201cHow they will price the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/21/uber-data-hack-cyber-attack\" title=\"\">risk of hacking</a> is a complete mystery: a cybersecurity vulnerability that could be exploited by criminals could affect thousands of cars in a single day and put insurers out of business.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/19/self-driving-cars-in-uk-by-2021-hammond-budget-announcement\">Budget 2017: UK to launch self-driving cars on British roads by 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, says Nick Reed, head of mobility research at component maker Bosch, motor insurance has to survive, even if it is passed to manufacturers and fleets once owner-drivers become passengers: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/06/government-urged-to-plug-insurance-black-hole-over-self-driving-cars\" title=\"\">business model will change</a>. But consumers always need to have the confidence that, in the event of an incident, there is compensation.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Service stations and hotels</strong><br>Goodbye, Moto? The appeal of a picnic on the M6 may diminish substantially when humans are no longer prompted by driver fatigue to pull in, and are instead engrossed in season 54 of <em>The Simpsons</em>. Electric charging networks may well not operate like petrol stations, where a vehicle has to pull in to refuel. However, should full autonomy allow all occupants to drink en route, more frequent stops could become a human necessity.</p> <p>While few UK journeys might require an overnight commute, a vehicle comfortable enough to sleep in could make hotels a less necessary option for business travellers \u2013 while longer US trips might be continued without the need for a roadside motel.</p> <p><strong>Professional drivers</strong><br>Around a million people in the UK who drive for a living <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/23/philip-hammond-pledges-driverless-cars-by-2021-and-warns-people-to-retrain\" title=\"\">could have to retrain</a>, the chancellor said, acknowledging that \u201cfor some people, this will be very challenging\u201d.</p> <p>Cuerden is not convinced that so many jobs would be lost: \u201cWe\u2019re leading the HGV platooning trials, which see trucks operating more effectively \u2013 but all would need drivers for now. Long term, they might have time on their hands, but perform new tasks.\u201d</p> <p>By 2030, he believes, the bulk of journeys will be covered autonomously, but a human backup could remain. Meanwhile, many taxi firms still value \u201cthe customer interface, the human touch,\u201d Cuerden says. \u201cSo drivers might become stewards.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Government coffers</strong><br>The \u00a346bn that the UK government claims to have forsaken by freezing fuel duty may be only a warm-up for the gaping hole that an all-electric fleet would mean. Tens of millions in revenue for traffic offences could also be jeopardised by law-abiding&#xa0;robots.</p> <p>British councils also made a \u00a3750m profit on parking in 2016. Some have predicted that the UK parking industry, worth \u00a31.5bn in 2015, would effectively disappear in a world of fewer cars.</p> <p>However, the British Parking Association remains defiantly upbeat: \u201cThe number of cars entering, exiting and navigating a parking facility will likely be very much the same as it is now. Just without people.\u201d</p> <h2>Visions of the future?
