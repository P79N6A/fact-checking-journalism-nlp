      "bodyText": "The government is to trial a register of empty shops in England as part of a \u00a31.5bn high street regeneration plan that could also see strict planning laws relaxed so shuttered stores can be turned into homes. A dedicated high street task force was also announced as the chancellor, Philip Hammond, conceded that high streets were under pressure \u201cas never before\u201d as Britons embraced online shopping. This year\u2019s high street crisis has seen the highest number of store closures since Woolworths collapsed a decade ago, with 1,500 shops and 38,000 jobs affected by the failures of chains including Maplin and Toys R Us. The Treasury had already signalled \u00a3900m in business rates relief for small retailers alongside a \u00a3675m fund to pay for local projects, such as improving high street transport links and refurbishing historic local buildings. The fund will support the creation of a taskforce of experts able to develop local officials develop \u201cinnovative strategies to help high streets evolve\u201d. A register of empty commercial properties would make it easier for prospective retailers to find stores, the government said, and help councils tackle fragmented ownership on their high streets when they were trying to push through revitalisation plans. A register was one of the planks of the \u201cemergency five-point plan\u201d announced by Labour at its party conference. The government will also consult on loosening planning rules so some of Britain\u2019s 50,000 empty shops can be put to new uses as gyms, libraries and houses. Another area of focus is whether unused space above shops could be colonised for housing. \u201cWe propose a new permitted development right to extend certain existing buildings upwards to provide additional, well designed, new homes to meet local housing need,\u201d said the planning reform consultation document. \u201cNational planning policy is clear \u2026 we should make effective use of previously developed land and buildings, including the airspace above existing buildings, to create new homes.\u201d Business rates, which are calculated as a proportion of a commercial property\u2019s value, have become a burning issue for the struggling retail sector after last year\u2019s revaluation hit chains with stores in areas where there have been property booms. And with the sector\u2019s bill due to go up by another \u00a3180m in April, hopes were high among retailers that the chancellor would make a decisive move. But in the end retail experts were left disappointed by a relief package focused on independent shopkeepers, pubs and other small high street businesses. The chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson, described the budget as a missed opportunity and argued wholesale reform of business rates was required. \u201cWhile we welcome measures to assist smaller retailers, the majority of the UK\u2019s 3.1m retail workers are employed in businesses that will not benefit from today\u2019s business rates announcement,\u201d said Dickinson. \u201cRather than tinkering around the edges, struggling high streets require wholesale reform of business rates in order to thrive. The issue remains that the business rates burden is simply too high.\u201d The chancellor said the relief package would cut business rates by a third for almost half a million high street shops, a group identified as paying less than \u00a351,000 a year in annual rent. But although just a 10th of stores in England pay rent above this level, they pay nearly 70% of the sector\u2019s \u00a37.8bn annual business rates bill. \u201cThe chancellor\u2019s headline giveaway still does nothing to help those larger retailers who are reducing their store portfolios and headcounts, often citing high rates as a contributory factor,\u201d said Alex Probyn of the property consultancy Altus.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in carmakers were boosted on Monday by a report that China is considering cutting vehicle sales tax to boost demand, helping European stock markets rebound after last week\u2019s mauling. Financial stocks also contributed to the rally, thanks to strong results from Europe\u2019s biggest bank, HSBC, as well as the decision by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s not to downgrade the Italian government\u2019s credit rating. The STOXX 600 index, which tracks the share prices of companies across 17 European countries, ended the day 0.9% higher. Despite the bounce, the STOXX 600 remained on track for its worst monthly performance since August 2015, following the stock market turbulence through most of October. London\u2019s FTSE 100 closed up 1.4%, led by HSBC, which closed up 4.8%. The FTSE 100 posted its best daily performance in five weeks, recovering some of the ground lost last week after a heavy sell-off hurt shares around the world. The gains in Europe followed a sluggish performance in Asia, where worries about China\u2019s slowing economy weighed. Wall Street started in positive territory before slipping back. \u201cEuropean markets enjoyed a stronger start to the week, despite a sell-off in China as investors digested the impact of a trade war with the US on industrial earnings,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Car manufacturers were the strongest performing business sector across European stock markets, up 3%. They rose sharply after a Bloomberg report said that China was considering halving its car purchase tax to 5% to support its struggling auto industry, which has been hit hard by the ongoing China-US trade war. Investors seized on a potential good news story for a sector buffeted in recent months by falling sales, particularly of diesel models in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, and concerns about the impact of a trade war and the impending switch from combustion to electric engines. The Chinese tax cut report lifted shares in VW, up 4% and the biggest riser among the European car makers. Daimler, BMW, Fiat, Renault and Peugeot Vauxhall\u2019s parent PSA also enjoyed a share price boost, along with car parts suppliers including Michelin, Pirelli and Continental. Shares of General Motors, the No1 US automaker by sales, were up about 2% by mid afternoon in New York, while those of rival Ford were up by 4%. Shares of the two companies have fallen more than 20% this year. The gains by carmakers helped offset worries over the political outlook in Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she would not seek re-election as party chairwoman at a conference in early December and that her current term as chancellor would be her last. However, analysts warned that the positive mood among European investors was unlikely to last. \u201cEquity markets bounced back today as traders swopped in to snap up relatively cheap stocks. The German market has rallied thanks to a jump in car manufactures,\u201d said David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK. \u201cChina is keen to keep the economy motoring along and Beijing is considering cutting the tax levied on car purchases by half \u2026 China\u2019s economy is cooling, and the policy would be aimed at boosting demand. \u201cThe bullish mood has spread across Europe, but seeing as the geopolitical and economic risks still persist, the upward move might not last long.\u201d The European banking sector rose 1.9% to a one-week high. Italian banks shone after the rating agency S&amp;P\u2019s kept its credit rating two notches above non-investment grade for Italian sovereign bonds, even though it lowered its outlook to negative, saying that the new government\u2019s policy plans were weighing on the country\u2019s growth and debt prospects. Banco BPM shares rose 5%, UBI Banca 4% and UniCredit 4.3%.",

      "bodyText": "It has been a good day for stock markets. In the eurozone, the Dax closed up 1.2% while France\u2019s CAC was up 0.4% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB gained 1.9%. The FTSE 100 index pared some of the gains made before the budget speech when it was up more than 120 points, and closed down 86.76 points at 7026.32, a 1.25% gain. Despite growth upgrades, sterling was little moved by the chancellor\u2019s speech (the growth outlook is still poor by historical standards). The pound slipped a bit more against the dollar, by 0.26% to $1.28, while it remained flat against the euro. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: We got a confident, jocular chancellor and a fair bit of extra cash being splashed around for various departments \u2013 defence, potholes, schools etc. Nothing earth-shatteringly major however. This was a political budget aimed at tackling the Corbyn threat \u2013 end of PFI and a kind of pseudo Google tax. And the elephant in the room was Brexit \u2013 it could all change if there is no deal, the odds of which are shortening by the day. We are closing the blog for the day \u2013 we will be back tomorrow. Good night. You can read more reaction and analysis on our budget live blog: And here are the key points at a glance: One of the main budget announcements was a new digital services tax, on tech giants such as Google (but not start-ups). It will come into effect in April 2020 and will raise \u00a3400m a year, the chancellor said. Digital tech giants will be taxed 2% on the money they make from UK users. Stella Amiss, head of tax policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: The chancellor\u2019s strong words of recent months were no bluff. At home, the confirmation of a new digital services tax was trailed as a step towards levelling the playing field between online retailers and the high street. But it is much more than that. Working out who is taxed and who isn\u2019t in the digital economy is no mean feat when all businesses operate in an increasing technological world. It\u2019s no surprise then that the chancellor has approached this with caution - a narrowly targeted regime, a 2% rate, and an effective implementation date pushed back to 2020. This new tax is well and truly aimed at the tech giants and not the online retailers so will do little to address the woes of bricks and mortar retailers and could well be perceived across the pond as an anti-American measure that could come back to bite us as the UK looks to move to trade talks after the Brexit deadline. Duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen for a year \u2013 while wine wasn\u2019t spared, with duty going up in line with inflation. The Wine and Spirit Trade Association was quick to respond. Its chief executive Miles Beale welcomed the government\u2019s decision to freeze duty on spirits, but deplored the increase in wine duty. The decision by the chancellor to increase wine rates significantly is a hammer blow to this great British industry. It actively undermines a sector that has been hardest hit since the Brexit Referendum and will be thoroughly unwelcome for the 33 million consumers of the nation\u2019s most popular alcoholic drink. This inflationary rise is grossly unfair, unjustified and counter-productive. The UK is the world\u2019s biggest wine trading nation and, as such, deserves government\u2019s support, not punishment. The wine industry is, unfortunately, no stranger to harsh treatment from chancellors. Since 2012 wine overtook beer as the largest contributor to the public purse through duty payments, and no alcoholic drink has paid more to the Treasury since then. The chancellor has pledged a \u00a3675m high street fund and business rates to be cut by a third to help embattled high street retailers. Paul Clement, head of place shaping at property group Savills, says: We are very pleased that the chancellor has recognised the need to extend an essential lifeline to the British high street. Business rate relief alongside a new fund for local authorities to redevelop and transform town centres are just some of the key recommendations made by Savills as part of the evidence submitted to the Housing Communities and Local Government Committee\u2019s (HCLGC) latest government inquiry. Creating places where people want, rather than need to be, can only be achieved through this kind of systemic change. Earlier, Hammond said we are at a \u201cpivotal moment\u201d in the Brexit talks. If we get it right, there will be a \u201cdouble Brexit dividend\u201d. More investment, currently on hold, will come on stream, and the Treasury will no longer have to hold back money. But the chancellor also said he was increasing the amount of spending for no deal planning to \u00a32bn. Markets shrugged off the comments... As to whether the budget commitments are funded whether there is a Brexit deal or not, as No. 10 said today, the chancellor suggested the opposite yesterday. The new UK growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, announced by Philip Hammond in his budget speech a few minutes ago, are higher than in March but still dismal. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, tweeted: The speech has had little impact on markets so far. The FTSE 100 index is about 105 points ahead at 7045.42, a 1.5% gain. The pound still 0.2% lower against the dollar at $1.2805, and flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1242. In other news, easyJet now expects to be flying electric plans by 2030, pushing back its forecast from 2027, but expressed confidence about a technology that is expected to cut the energy costs of a plane by 30%. The low-cost carrier\u2019s chief executive Johan Lundgren told Reuters: We can definitely see a way forward in how we will get this aircraft into the fleet. EasyJet has a partnership with US start-up Wright Electric, which is working on an electric engine for a nine-seater plane that will fly next year, following success with a two-seater, and will also start working on a 50-seater version. The goal is to build battery-propelled aircraft for flights of less than two hours. More importantly, the chancellor has echoed Theresa May\u2019s comments that \u201cthe era of austerity is finally coming to an end\u201d. You can follow the budget speech more closely at our budget live blog: Hammond says the last time a UK budget was presented on a Monday was in 1962, when he was six. He recalls that his parents turned to him and said: \u201cPhilip, one day that could be you.\u201d And we are off. Philip Hammond has started his budget speech. With the UK budget just a couple of minutes away, let\u2019s take a quick look at the markets. All the major indices are in the green. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones rose as much as 300 points and is now trading 175 points higher, or 0.7%, at 24,867.62 \u2013 compared with the 27,000 all-time highs at the beginning of the month. The eurozone has shrugged off Angela Merkel\u2019s decision not to seek re-election as CDU party leader. Markets took comfort from her intention to stay on as chancellor until the next German federal election in 2021. Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.8% ahead at 11,405.95. Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has rocketed 2.4% as S&amp;P kept Italy\u2019s credit rating unchanged, while the country\u2019s battle with the EU over its budget continues. Rome was last week given three weeks to rewrite its draft budget. As for the FTSE, it is trading over 100 points higher at 7051.32, a 1.6% gain. The pound is feeling the pressure of the budget, slipping back under $1.281 against the dollar, down 0.2%. John Flint, the chief executive of HSBC, Europe\u2019s biggest bank, reckons that the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is unlikely to hurt Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to attract foreign investors. Flint said this morning: I understand the emotion around the story but it is very difficult to think about disengaging from Saudi Arabia, given its importance to global energy markets. Flint was one of several banking chief executives who pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh last week, along with Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. However, Samir Assaf, the head of HSBC\u2019s global banking and markets, attended the event. While most western business leaders shunned it, the kingdom managed to get $50bn of deals signed at the investment conference. Flint said: My decision [to pull out] was not an easy decision but I felt it was the right thing to do under the circumstances. But he defended the bank\u2019s decision to send a less high-profile figure to the conference: We are the biggest foreign bank in Saudi Arabia, so we own 40% of the Saudi British Bank, we have 4,000 employees in the kingdom and we have many customers in the kingdom as well so we have a responsibility to them. Flint hinted at future investment in the Middle East, saying: We are a significant part of the banking system in many parts of the region \u2026 We will build our businesses as the opportunities arise. Here is our full story on the HSBC results, out earlier today. Poland\u2019s foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz said today that Merkel plays an important role in stabilising the European Union, and expressed support for her to stay on as chancellor. Merkel\u2019s decision not to seek re-election as CDU party chairwoman which means her fourth term as chancellor will be her last heralds the end of an era in which she has dominated European politics. She became Germany\u2019s chancellor in 2005. The race for a successor to Merkel at the top of the CDU has already started. This morning, three candidates announced their ambitions: Party secretary-general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer Health minister Jens Spahn Former parliamentary leader when Merkel started as party chair, Friedrich Merz Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, says the key question is will the new CDU leader move to the political right again or continue Merkel\u2019s strategy of capturing the political centre. Merkel\u2019s announcement remains less of a risk for the German government than the SPD\u2019s losses in the last elections. The CDU has no interest in Merkel stepping down as chancellor or a snap election before any successor has been able to build up a profile. The SPD, however, remains in an existential crisis which could easily lead to the decision to leave the coalition next year. As historic as today\u2019s announcement is, the approaching end of an era also holds the potential for positive developments. Not so much because new is always better but rather because it could give Merkel the freedom and the tailwind - freed from party ties - to put a final stamp on her legacy, possibly with bolder steps to reform the German economy and the monetary union. Three years of a lame duck government would clearly be harmful, not only for Europe but also for Germany. Somehow, the announced end is typical for the entire era Merkel: unpretentiously pulling the strings. Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, notes that after the initial shock caused by Merkel\u2019s announcement, the market reaction has been relatively muted as she also said she would like to see her term through to 2021. The CDU is suffering heavy losses in state elections and the opinion polls indicate there is no improvement in sight. It will now be increasingly difficult for her to stay on as Chancellor, and having shown signs of weakness, the wolves may come for her sooner rather than later. Germany has been a cradle of political stability over the last decade, but this now looks to be over. Ms Merkel has been a driving force in Europe, leading the response to major political and economic upheaval like the Eurozone debt crisis. What now remains to be seen is whether her CDU successor has the political will and gravitas on the European stage to hold it together in these testing times. With Brexit imminent and growing controversy around the Italian government\u2019s spending plans, there couldn\u2019t be a worse time for Germany\u2019s steady ship to hit choppy waters. This implies more financial market volatility going forward and is another reason to remain bearish about the euro. More on Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to step down as CDU party chair but stay on as Germany\u2019s chancellor until the next national election in 2021. She has argued against splitting the two roles in the past... Her move comes after disastrous regional elections in Hesse and Bavaria for her Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU. Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank, says Her first step towards the exit adds to the risk that her coalition partner SPD will walk out of the Berlin coalition in late 2019 upon a mid-term review of the government\u2019s agenda. If Merkel were to lose her position as chancellor, the most likely outcome would be a CDU/CSU-Green-FDP coalition in Berlin led by somebody else from the CDU or - as a slightly less likely alternative - new elections. Here are the main contenders for the CDU leadership: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the CDU general secretary, appears to be Merkel\u2018s preferred choice Armin Laschet, prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, whose experience would make him well suited to lead a \u201cJamaica\u201c coalition with the Greens and the FDP Jens Spahn, the more conservative minister for health Friedrich Merz, a conservative who once was Merkel\u2019s rival and is reportedly ready to re-enter frontline politics. Other candidates with fewer chances are: Peter Altmaier, the economy minister, Daniel G\u00fcnther, the state prime minister of Schleswig Holstein and Julia Kl\u00f6ckner, the minister of agriculture. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones climbed about 200 points at the open to 24,922.34, a gain of almost 1%. Wall Street is also expected to rally when trading begins shortly..... European stock markets are pushing higher, as traders try to put the nightmare of October behind then. The FTSE 100 is now up 126 points, or 1.8%, as it bounces back from last week\u2019s seven-month low. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: Strong earnings from banks and positive company news boosted European markets helping them to shrug of the gloom emanating from Asia. HSBC\u2019s strong results this morning certainly seem to have cheered the City; its shares are now up almost 6%. Markets are up across Europe - bringing some relief to investors, after hitting their lowest levels since December 2016 last week. Germany\u2019s DAX index has jumped by over 2%, led by those car companies. Traders are clearly more excited by Chinese tax cuts than Angela Merkel\u2019s political future.... In Milan, there\u2019s mild jubilation that S&amp;P didn\u2019t downgrade Italy on Friday night. Dean Popplewell of trading firm OANDA explains: Italy\u2019s 10-year BTP bond yield has fallen to a one-week low this morning, narrowing the gap to the German Bund, on relief that ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s left the country\u2019s credit rating unchanged. Shares in European carmakers are surging, thanks to a report that China is considering halving the sales tax on most vehicles. The move would help Beijing spur auto sales, as it tries to protect its economy from the chill winds of the US trade war. Bloomberg has more details: The country\u2019s top economic planning body submitted a plan to key policymakers to lower the purchase tax to 5 percent for passenger vehicles with engines no bigger than 1.6 liters, according to people familiar with the matter. No decision has been made on implementation, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. European car shares have jumped by over 4%, including by Volkswagen (+5.6%), Daimler (+4.6%) and BMW (+4.1%). Elsewhere in the eurozone, Italy\u2019s stock market is flying after S&amp;P left the country\u2019s credit rating unchanged on Friday night. The FTSE MIB has leapt by 2.5%, and Italian government bonds are also rallying. BREAKING: In a major development, Angela Merkel has decided not to stand for re-election as the chair of her CDU party in December. Merkel took her decision after an election drubbing over the weekend, which saw voters in Hesse abandon the CDU in favour of the Green party and the anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD). This could trigger a battle to succeed Merkel as Germany\u2019s chancellor, a job she\u2019s held since 2005 (and isn\u2019t giving up yet...) Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019s take: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told leaders of her Christian Democrats (CDU) that she will not seek re-election as party chairwoman at a conference in early December, a senior party source said. Merkel has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and giving up the role would start a race within the party to succeed her as chancellor. The euro has promptly fallen by 0.4% to \u20ac1.138. Support for the CDU in Hesse fell by 10 percentage points since the last election in 2013 - a major snub by voters. Germany\u2019s left-wing SPD party, who are in coalition with the CDU, also performed badly in Hesse, fuelling speculation that the coalition could collapse. More here: European stock markets are all showing gains this morning. Bank stocks are up, following HSBC\u2019s strong results, along with healthcare groups and industrial companies. Banking giant HSBC is pulling the London stock market higher, after growing its profits sharply. HSBC shares have leapt by 4% in early trading, after beating City expectations this morning. The bank posted a 16% year-on-year rise in adjusted pre-tax profits to $6.19bn, ahead of its previous forecasts. Revenues rose 8.8% to $13.8bn, as its investment banking and wealth management divisions enjoyed a strong quarter. Three-quarters of HSBC\u2019s profits came from Asia. This has lifted the FTSE 100 up to 7002 points, up 62 points. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cHSBC may be the second biggest company on the UK stock market, but its profits are predominantly emanating from its historic home in the far east. Three quarters of the bank\u2019s profits so far this year have come from its Asian operations, leaving the European business trailing in its wake. Profit growth has been broad-based across HSBC\u2019s main banking activities, and what\u2019s positive is that\u2019s coming from a rising top line rather than simply cost-cutting, which can only deliver results for so long. Indeed adjusted operating costs have actually ticked up, though that\u2019s to support investment in growth opportunities, notably in the bank\u2019s digital proposition. As an international retail and commercial bank, HSBC is clearly plugged into the global economy, and in particular the fortunes of China and the surrounding area. While in the long term this looks like an ace in the sleeve, investors should expect a bumpy journey, particularly if Trump\u2019s trade war dents growth in the region.\u2019 Last week the US stock markets fell into correction territory, after several heavyweight companies posted disappointing results: David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says last week was grim: Global stock markets had a terrible time last week as investor sentiment continued to sour. Concerns about higher interest rates in the US, along with political uncertainty in Italy as well as geopolitical concerns played on investors\u2019 minds. Last week, Amazon and Alphabet both released quarterly figures and the revenue components missed market estimates and that added to the decline. The major US indices enjoyed a positive run over the summer, and there was a sense that valuations were lofty, particularly for the tech sector. The S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory, which means it had fallen more than 10% from the recent peak, and this underlines how large the correction has been. The Shanghai Composite lost over 2% overnight after China confirmed that industrial profit fell for the fifth straight month. Financial blogger Jeroen Blokland says a range of factors have hurt the markets this month. However, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re facing a repeat of the 2008 crisis. He writes: This chart by Bloomberg shows that global equities have lost almost USD 8 trillion in market cap in October, the worst sell-off since 2008. However, the absolute numbers can be deceptive as the total market capitalization has increased by roughly 50% since start of the financial crisis. But more importantly, while there are definitely a number of factors that are negatively impacting markets (China-US trade war, rising geopolitical risk, Italy\u2019s massive debt pile \u2013 to name just a few), current economic circumstances make it less likely that a crisis like the one in in 2008 will happen now. Of course, things could change quickly, especially if market sentiment remains as depressed as it is now, but this might be a good moment to take a step back and refocus on the fundamentals. Today\u2019s losses in China suggest markets have further to fall, warns Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at foreign exchange broker FXTM: The steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets suggests October could be the worst month since the global financial crisis of 2008. Seven trillion dollars have already been wiped from the global market cap, and still there are no signs of bulls returning. Chinese stocks fell today with the CSI 300 declining more than 3% while the Yuan remained trading near a decade low. The Nikkei 225 gave up gains of more than 1% to trade in negative territory. Moving against the trend were stocks in Australia, with the ASX 200 gaining more than 1% supported by the healthcare and telecom sectors. The bears seem well in control of the market and there\u2019re many reasons to justify their actions. Whether it\u2019s weakening global economic growth, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, monetary policy tightening, fears of a hard Brexit, Italy\u2019s budget woes\u2026 and the list goes on. What is more interesting is that investors are even punishing companies that have reported positive earnings surprises. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. October has been a pretty brutal month for the markets. Over the last four weeks, trillions of dollars of value have been wiped off bonds and shares, as nervous investors have sold up. Bloomberg estimates that $8 trillion has been \u2018lost\u2019, amid fears over US interest rate hikes, the US-China trade war, Italy\u2019s budget row and Brexit. That would make October the worst month in a decade, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. They say: Equities globally have lost almost $8 trillion of value this month, set for the biggest wipeout since the height of the financial crisis a decade ago on concerns ranging from the peak being past for earnings growth to the U.S.-China trade war to the end of central bank quantitative easing. Traders are paring wagers on Fed rate hikes for next year, with markets now expecting fewer than two quarter-point increases in 2019, compared with three that policy makers project. \u201cThere\u2019s room for a bit of a downside to go, because I do see this as being largely a structural shift in markets,\u201d Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at IG Group in Melbourne, said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cSentiment is still to the downside, is still quite bearish and there will be a little while for this correction to play out.\u201d The new week has begun badly in China, where the Shanghai stock market has fallen over 2% today. However, it\u2019s a brighter picture in Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 had jumped by 36 points, or 0.5%, after hitting a seven-month low on Friday night. Perhaps the extra hour\u2019s sleep has cheered traders up a bit. Also coming up today. It\u2019s Budget Day in the UK. Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to announce that the public finances aren\u2019t as bad as previously thought, clearing the way for more spending on the NHS, help for UK high streets, money to build roads and fix potholes, He could also tighten pension relief limits (taking money from higher earners) and raise income tax personal allowances (handing money back to them).

It will come into effect in April 2020 and will raise \u00a3400m a year, the chancellor said. Digital tech giants will be taxed 2% on the money they make from UK users.</p> <p>Stella Amiss, head of tax policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor\u2019s strong words of recent months were no bluff. At home, the confirmation of a new digital services tax was trailed as a step towards levelling the playing field between online retailers and the high street. But it is much more than that. Working out who is taxed and who isn\u2019t in the digital economy is no mean feat when all businesses operate in an increasing technological world.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise then that the chancellor has approached this with caution - a narrowly targeted regime, a 2% rate, and an effective implementation date pushed back to 2020. This new tax is well and truly aimed at the tech giants and not the online retailers so will do little to address the woes of bricks and mortar retailers and could well be perceived across the pond as an anti-American measure that could come back to bite us as the UK looks to move to trade talks after the Brexit deadline.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bd737e8e4b0bda4dc41b9d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-29T16:46:29.408Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen for a year \u2013 while wine wasn\u2019t spared, with duty going up in line with inflation. </p> <p>The Wine and Spirit Trade Association was quick to respond.

      "bodyText": "The release last week of further research from the productivity commission\u2019s inquiry into the superannuation system, coupled with the evidence provided to the royal commission into the financial sector, has made it abundantly clear that despite all attempts from the government to pretend otherwise, industry super funds continue to outshine the retail sector. Rather than revealing the not-for-profit super funds as being terrible \u201cunion run\u201d organisations, both the royal commission and the productivity commission\u2019s inquiry have become de facto government-paid advertisements displaying how the industry funds are better run and better performing. The productivity commission\u2019s supplementary papers to the draft report that came out in May was done to provide more detail and an extra year\u2019s worth of data on the performance of funds, which will feed into the final report. And as with the draft report, this latest research offers bugger-all good news for retail super funds. The report has found that among MySuper products, 14 out of 16 retail funds underperformed their benchmarks, compared to 7 of the 33 industry funds surveyed: And importantly, while the underperforming retail funds encompassed the largest of their type, the underperforming industry super funds were among the smallest. The supplementary paper confirms the draft report findings that if you are in a dud super fund, it is most likely a retail fund, and if you are in a retail fund, it is most likely a dud. Little wonder, as Gareth Hutchens found recently, people are switching in droves to industry funds. Since the paper\u2019s release last week there has been some push back from the retail sector \u2013 led by the Financial Review, which suggested that \u201cIndustry funds not really \u2018geniuses\u2019\u201d. They argue that the productivity commission is too hard on the retail firms and that it lacks understanding of the nature of the industry. The AFR quoted Chris Brycki, a former UBS portfolio manager, who said that industry super funds only performed better because their portfolios contained riskier assets, saying \u201cthese guys put themselves on a pedestal as geniuses at picking assets but it\u2019s just because their portfolios are crammed with more risk\u201d. They also cited Ian Fryer, the head of research for ratings house Chant West, who suggested industry funds had an advantage because they could \u201cinvest in these illiquid assets as they have stronger cash flows due to industrial awards and enterprise agreements, and their members are less like to take out their money\u201d. He also suggested that \u201cthis means they can invest in long-term assets knowing that they won\u2019t need access to that money for a long time.\u201d Aside from the fact that those facts alone make industry funds better places to provide long-term returns (the whole point of superannuation funds), the reality is the productivity commission is well aware of this difference in \u201casset allocation\u201d. In its draft report it suggested that due to differences in assets the break even annual performance for retail funds was 5.8% compared to 6.6% for industry funds. And yet even with this lower bar, it found that the average retail fund was unable to clear it. Instead it found that the average return for retail funds from 2005-2016 was just 4.9%. And while industry funds had a higher benchmark to clear, the commission found that the average return for industry funds was 6.8%. So even when in effect handicapping the retail funds to give them an easier chance to meet their benchmark, they failed. In the supplementary report the commission looked closer at why the industry funds out-performed the retails funds. Clearly fees play a role. The commission found that on average retail funds charged nearly three times more in fees than the not-for-profit sector: The commission also found the management costs for different asset types were lower for not-for-profit funds compared to retail funds: And it also found that across the different assets not-for-profit funds provided better returns at an absolute level (ie not accounting for the proportion of assets held by funds). Although here the commission does sound a note of caution, as retail funds were not particularly forthcoming with data. It noted for example that \u201conly a handful of retail funds provided data for unlisted property returns\u201d. Thus the suspicion is that these figures (which still show retail funds performing worse than industry funds) suffer from selection bias wherein funds have withheld data that shows them performing badly: But fees are not the only reason for the better performance. Overall the commission found a 200 basis point gap in the relative outperformance of the not-for-profit and retail segments that could not be explained by fees or different levels of tax paid. The commission found that had customers over the 13 years from 2005-2013 just passively invested in indexes of equal amounts of shares, cash, bonds and property, they could have expected annual returns of 8.3%, and yet on average they have only achieved 6.4%. Part of this is due to fees, but a bigger part is due to investment decisions. The commission found that due to its more conservative asset allocation the benchmark return for retail funds from 2005-2017 was 7.9% compared to the not-for-profit sector of 8.1%, and yet the average net return over that period for retail firms was just 5.1% compared to 7.3% for not-for-profit funds: The commission noted that the major difference was neither fees nor difference in asset types but a \u201cresidual\u201d factor which was \u201cpredominantly asset selection\u201d \u2013 ie investment decisions. In effect the commission has found that the retail fund managers are just nowhere near as good at their job than their not-for-profit counterparts. As with the draft report, which found that a 21-year-old full-time worker with a salary of $50,000 who is in the median underperforming MySuper product would retire with a balance $375,000 lower than if they were in the median top-10 product, the cost of this poor performance revealed in the supplementary paper matter greatly to workers. The more evidence that is gathered on the super industry, whether in the royal commission or in the productivity commission\u2019s inquiry, the clearer it becomes that retail funds have failed abysmally. And it is well past time for the government and the bank-friendly media to acknowledge this is the case. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

    "webTitle": "Flights could be disrupted after Brexit, Chris Grayling admits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Flights could be disrupted after Brexit, the transport secretary has admitted, but he said the European commission would be to blame for not starting talks on a deal to keep planes in the air. Chris Grayling told an aviation conference that disruption was \u201cunlikely\u201d but that talks to secure an aviation agreement had not yet started with only five months to the date of Britain\u2019s departure. He added: \u201cThat process is not in our hands.\u201d Grayling said there was \u201cno way that flights will stop\u201d between the UK and the EU, but there appeared to be a marked change in tone from previous speeches in which he had described planes being grounded after Brexit as inconceivable. Speaking at the Airport Operators Association annual conference in London, Grayling said: \u201cIt is theoretically possible that EASA [the European Aviation Safety Agency] could refuse or delay the certification of UK-certified planes. I think it is highly unlikely.\u201d The legal basis for continuing flights between the UK and the EU is unclear without a new deal. Grayling said the UK could fall back on bilateral agreements with individual EU member states but was hoping for a \u201cbarebones\u201d aviation agreement with the whole bloc, saying he had not met \u201cone single person\u201d in the commission or a member state who believed there would be an interruption to aviation. \u201cI\u2019ve offered the commission to prepare a barebones deal if there is no broader agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not yet ready to begin but the commission has said very clearly it expects there to be an agreement.\u201d Asked if he would take responsibility for any disruption to aviation, having earlier dismissed industry warnings, the transport secretary said: \u201cIt\u2019s not me that is not opening talks.\u201d Grayling said the Ryanair chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, who has repeatedly claimed flights could be grounded, was \u201cselling tickets for next summer and expanding the number of routes between the UK and the European Union\u201d. But airport bosses said they were preparing for the worst, including queues of lorries potentially jamming Britain\u2019s main road artery, the M1, because of new customs requirements. Karen Smart, the managing director of East Midlands airport, which handles large amounts of freight, said Brexit could cause tailbacks on the motorway if longer checks on goods lorries were needed. She said the airport hoped pre-Brexit fears would be \u201clike the Millennium bug\u201d and prove unfounded but that it was working closely with local authorities to make contingency plans. Referring to Operation Stack, the government plan for holding thousands of lorries on motorways leading to Channel ports, Smart said: \u201cMy biggest risk is an Operation Stack on the M1 because vehicles can\u2019t get to the airport because the processes have been slowed down. We have thousands of vehicles that are processed through the airport.\u201d Derek Provan, the chief executive of AGS Airports, which owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, said it needed certainty that there would be no disruption, adding: \u201cUnlikely is not much good.\u201d He said the airports were spending a lot of time and money on post-Brexit contingency planning. Ed Anderson, the chairman of the Airport Operators Association, said a framework agreement was needed swiftly to give passengers the confidence to book flights for next summer. \u201cWe are concerned at the lack of progress in this aspect of the Brexit negotiations,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "British consumers have reined in their borrowing on car finance deals amid falling vehicle sales triggered by new emissions tests. Figures from the Bank of England showed annual growth in consumer credit \u2013 on personal loans, credit cards and car finance deals \u2013 dropped to 7.7% in September to the lowest level since June 2015. The latest snapshot revealed the growth in personal borrowing continued to fall from an annual rate of 8.2% in August, having steadily declined from a peak of 10.9% in November 2016. Threadneedle Street said consumer credit increased by about \u00a3800m last month \u2013 less than the amount recorded in August \u2013 as new borrowing for car finance fell sharply. It said this was \u201cconsistent with very weak car registration numbers in September\u201d. The British motor industry has come under increasing pressure in recent months from several quarters. Weaker consumer confidence and waning appetite for diesel cars has had an impact, while manufacturers worry about the consequences of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal next March. UK sales of new cars \u2013 which can be seen as a bellwether for the overall health of the British economy \u2013 plunged by a fifth in September, in a month that is traditionally a bumper one for sales as consumers rush to buy cars with new number plates. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders blamed more rigorous emissions testing rules for creating supply problems, resulting in a backlog of deliveries as car manufacturers suffered delays in getting their cars approved. Despite the slowdown in consumer credit growth, the Bank said the overall figure had been dragged down by the drop-off in car sales, adding that other borrowing, such as personal loans and overdrafts, had remained robust. Net credit card borrowing was about \u00a3500m in September, unchanged on the month before and broadly in line with the average of the previous six months. Although the overall growth rate dropped to 7.7%, this still remains more than double the rate of growth in average earnings. Official figures this year showed British households spent about \u00a3900 more on average than they received in income last year, pushing their finances into deficit for the first time since the credit boom of the 1980s. The latest figures come after the government announced it would explore the idea of zero-interest loans to help people trapped by problem debt from high-cost providers, such as payday loans and credit cards. The Treasury believes such a scheme could tackle the issue of problem debt for the 3 million or so Britons who borrow from firms that impose fees and charges above the usual rates of interest. However, the measure raised eyebrows among some observers because the Treasury has cut benefits for millions of working families, while rolling out universal credit, in a move that many charities believe has pushed more people into debt. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, said households had also become more cautious as the Bank raises interest rates, after it increased the base rate for personal loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing to 0.75% in August. \u201cEven allowing for the impact of weakened car sales, due to special factors, September\u2019s data reinforces the impression that consumers are currently relatively cautious in their borrowing,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The owner of the W7 makeup brand has blamed a slump in Christmas orders from British retailers for a profit warning that has wiped more than 40% off the value of the company. Warpaint London, which listed on the junior stock market two years ago, supplies high street chains including Primark, Boots and Superdrug with its low-priced lipstick, eyeshadow and nail polish, as well as cosmetics gift sets. The firm was founded by Sam Bazini and Eoin Macleod, entrepreneurs who started out selling cosmetics from market stalls. The setback means Warpaint London, which also makes cosmetics under the Technic and Man\u2019Stuff brands, now expects annual profits to be between \u00a38.5m and \u00a310m. Before the alert, analysts had pencilled in \u00a312m. The disappointment weighed heavily on the company\u2019s shares, which by lunchtime on Monday were down 45% to 112p, wiping out nearly all the gains made since listing at 97p in November 2016. The Buckinghamshire-based group, which last updated investors six weeks ago, said it had experienced a further softening in demand, with retailers reducing stock levels and Christmas orders. Strong sales growth in the US and mainland Europe did not make up for the shortfall in its important domestic market, the company said. Last week Debenhams said that after several years of growth the UK beauty market had slowed this year. The struggling department store chain blamed sluggish demand and rivals cutting prices for the 0.8% decline in its beauty hall sales in the year to 1 September. Retailers are suffering as little real-wage growth, coupled with inflation, puts pressure on household budgets \u2013 leading potential customers to stay away from shops. The BRC-Springboard footfall tracker showed numbers dropping by 1.7% in September. For many retailers, the weeks to Christmas are the most lucrative. But this year store bosses are nervous after last month\u2019s GfK consumer confidence index sank further into negative territory as the uncertainty around Brexit hits sentiment. \u201cWhile the current UK market conditions are challenging, we are seeing strong growth in our overseas sales,\u201d said Bazini and Macleod. \u201cWe remain well-positioned to take advantage of any improvement in UK market conditions and will continue our strategy of growing and diversifying our international sales.

      "bodyText": "The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is unlikely to have much impact on trade and foreign investment in Saudi Arabia, according to John Flint, the chief executive of HSBC, Europe\u2019s biggest bank. \u201cI understand the emotion around the story but it is very difficult to think about disengaging from Saudi Arabia, given its importance to global energy markets,\u201d Flint said. Flint was one of several banking chief executives who pulled out of an investment conference in Riyadh last week, along with Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. However, Samir Assaf, the head of HSBC\u2019s global banking and markets, attended the event. Flint said: \u201cMy decision [to pull out] was not an easy decision but I felt it was the right thing to do under the circumstances.\u201d He defended the bank\u2019s decision to send Assaf to the conference, saying it had a responsibility to its 4,000 employees and many customers in Saudi Arabia, where HSBC is the biggest foreign bank through its 40% holding in Saudi British Bank. Flint hinted at future investment in the Middle East, saying: \u201cWe are a significant part of the banking system in many parts of the region \u2026 We will build our businesses as the opportunities arise.\u201d The conference was shunned by most western business leaders amid an international outcry over the Saudi regime\u2019s involvement in the dissident journalist\u2019s death \u2013 but it concluded with $50bn (\u00a338.9bn) of deals signed. Saudi Aramco signed 15 deals worth $34bn with the French oil firm Total and the US oil services firms Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, as well as companies from Japan, China, India and the United Arab Emirates. Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, vanished on 2 October after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi officials have admitted he was killed by a team of agents sent from Riyadh. Flint\u2019s comments came as the bank surprised analysts with better-than-expected third-quarter results. Pre-tax profits rose 28% to $5.9bn in the three months to September, with revenues up 6.3% to $13.8bn, while costs fell nearly 7% to $7.97bn. Flint lauded strong profit growth, particularly in Asia and Europe, the latter because of a good performance in the UK from retail banking and wealth management. HSBC said last week\u2019s high court ruling for Lloyds to equalise pension payments for men and women would affect many other defined-benefit plans across the UK. It will increase the liabilities of the HSBC pension scheme and reduce the plan\u2019s \u00a36.2bn surplus. The bank is in the process of evaluating the impact with its actuaries and will record a charge in the fourth quarter. Flint, the bank\u2019s former global head of retail banking and wealth management, succeeded Stuart Gulliver as CEO in February. Flint unveiled a plan for returning the bank to growth in June, which, like the strategy of his predecessor, focuses on expanding the business in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta in southern China. Helal Miah, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: \u201cThe new senior management team are trying to steer the bank to growth once again and their comments so far are fairly positive. \u201cHSBC will focus on driving further revenue growth from Asia while also expanding its wealth management and insurance business. While there was good news on cost controls this quarter, this is something HSBC have generally struggled with lately and such will remain a key strategic focus.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Scottish salmon industry accused of welfare failures", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Environmental campaigners have accused Scotland\u2019s salmon farming industry of repeatedly breaching limits on sea lice infestation, escapes and fish mortalities and putting profit before welfare, following the recent release of graphic images of farmed salmon left with ugly open wounds by sea lice parasites and disease. They want a temporary ban on all new fish farms until far stricter controls are in place, a stance backed by the Scottish Green party. The industry, however, buoyed by record exports worth \u00a3600m last year, wants to more than double production by up to 400,000 tonnes by 2030. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa), the country\u2019s pollution and water quality watchdog, will soon publish proposals for its strictest regulatory regime yet. It said earlier this month that compliance by Scotland\u2019s fish farms with existing standards covering seabed pollution, waste, chemical use and water quality had fallen from 86% to 81%. \u201cSepa is clear that compliance with environmental laws is non-negotiable,\u201d said John Kenny, its acting head of compliance. The new regulations would \u201cinclude more powerful modelling using the best available science, enhanced environmental monitoring, a new approach to sustainable siting of farms, and new approach for controlling the use of medicines\u201d. The Scottish parliament\u2019s rural economy committee is expected to issue a critical report in the coming days. It may stop short of backing calls for a moratorium but will urge ministers in Edinburgh to overhaul regulations. In March, Holyrood\u2019s environment committee warned the industry\u2019s expansion goal \u201cwill be unsustainable and may cause irrecoverable damage to the environment\u201d unless standards improved markedly. \u201cThe status quo is not an option,\u201d it said. At a salmon farm at Loch a\u2019 Ch\u00e0irn Bh\u00e0in, near Kylesku in the far north-west of Scotland, executives shepherding a group of fish merchants from Brixham were weary of the intense criticism their industry faces. Alban Denton, the managing director of Loch Duart, argued it already operated under the toughest regulatory regime of any livestock industry. Even so, Denton and his colleague Andy Bing, who founded the firm 40 years ago, suggested there were better, more sustainable techniques the industry could follow. It puts fewer fish in its cages than most, running a stocking density of 1.5% fish against an industry norm of 2% \u201cbiomass\u201d per cage. It promotes \u201cnon-medicinal farming\u201d where wrasse, a small fish that eats marine parasites, act as cleaner fish to peck off any sea lice on the salmon. The wrasse are harvested from the wild sustainably, the firm says, living in artificial reefs made from sliced up black plastic in a corner of each salmon cage. Yet wrasses\u2019 role as a highly sought after solution to sea lice infestation has pushed its price as high as \u00a350,000 a tonne \u2013 the most expensive by weight in Europe. Loch Duart suspended one supplier in south-west England earlier this month for allegedly fishing in a no-catch zone. Rather than treated with the copper-based antifoulants standard in the industry, its cages are air-dried to remove algae. They occasionally use hydrogen peroxide or fresh water baths to treat amoebic gill disease, which has at times plagued some farms. Its farms lie empty, or fallow, for five months rather than an industry norm of five weeks, to allow the seabed to recover and suppress sea lice numbers. They say that combination of tactics works: on the eight cages on Loch a\u2019 Ch\u00e0irn Bh\u00e0in, six have been entirely sea lice free this year, and two had negligible numbers. It has had serious issues with sea lice in the past, and has shot seals too, under licences that conservationists believe are too lax. \u201cOne of our first tests of sustainability when I started this company was whether we would be doing this in 100 or 200 years\u2019 time,\u201d Bing said. \u201cIf we had unsustainable fish food, we would run out; if our stocking policy damaged the seabed we would have our licence revoked.\u201d Yet Loch Duart sells into the elite end of the market. Its fish commands prices 20-25% higher than their competitors. Largely exported, none of its produce ends up in cut-price salmon sandwiches for Tesco or Costa, or smoked and sliced for Marks and Spencer\u2019s Lochmuir. Instead, its whole fish are mostly exported to Michelin-starred restaurants in France, where they have won the coveted Label Rouge quality marque, or exclusive sushi restaurants in San Francisco and Manhattan. The challenge for the multinationals that collectively own most of Scotland\u2019s salmon farms, for regulators such as Sepa, and ministers, is to decide where the balance lies, said Andrew Graham-Stewart, of Salmon and Trout Conservation Scotland. It campaigns to protect wild salmon and trout stocks, which are threatened by escapes of farmed fish and the sea lice they attract. Do they want to promote cheap supermarket salmon or properly protect the environment, and the fish being farmed? \u201cThe industry is at a crossroads. Scottish ministers need to decide whether they\u2019re going to continue to allow the industry to expand without all the major issues associated with it being properly addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they fail to address these issues then the natural environment in the west Highlands and islands will continue to be effectively and systematically destroyed.\u201d Ian Roberts, a spokesman for Norwegian-owned Marine Harvest, which produced nearly a third of Scotland\u2019s record salmon yield of 190,000 tonnes last year, said the firm would embrace tighter regulations. His firm had made mistakes in the past, but fish farming was here to stay, he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to feed a growing population expecting healthy food we will be farming in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want regulations that are going to secure our business and properly manage our business, because we want to be here in the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The tobacco industry is \u201creverting to tricks and stunts\u201d in a bid to attract young smokers, the head of the Public Health Association of Australia has said, after analysis revealed cigarettes with flavour-changing capsules were the fastest growing segment of the combustible tobacco market. Adjunct Professor Terry Slevin described the modification of tobacco products to make them more appetising as \u201can extraordinary assault on public health\u201d. \u201cAny modification to tobacco products which clearly aim to increase rates of smoking and target young smokers should be ruthlessly resisted,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia has the lowest rates of smoking in the world among young people, and we now have a situation where more then 97% of children under 18 are never-smokers. The tobacco industry is clearly seeking to reverse that success and is reverting to tricks and stunts which should not be tolerated.\u201d An analysis published in the British Medical Journal\u2019s Tobacco Control on Monday found the market for cigarettes with flavour-changing capsules in the filter had \u201cgrown exponentially since being introduced in 2007\u201d. The capsules, fruit and mint flavours, are also growing in popularity for roll-your-own cigarettes. The market share for the products increased between 2014 and 2017 in 52 of the 67 countries where they are sold and monitored by tobacco analyst Euromonitor. \u201cDespite the success of this product innovation, there remains a dearth of research on capsule cigarettes,\u201d the analysis, led by the University of Stirling in the UK, found. \u201cNevertheless, existing research with adult smokers in the UK, USA and Australia consistently shows a preference for capsules among young adults, and more than half of past-month smokers aged 12\u201317 years in Australia reported having tried a capsule cigarette. Taste, choice of flavours, enjoyment from clicking the capsule, stylishness and lower perceived harm appear key reasons for using capsule cigarettes.\u201d Slevin said an urgent national strategy was needed to respond to the growing market, in addition to the tobacco control acts in each state and territory. Research published this month from New Zealand\u2019s Otago University found young non-smokers and former smokers saw flavour capsules as more appealing, and were more likely to experiment with these than with unflavoured cigarettes. Quit Victoria policy manager Kylie Lindorff urged the state government to take immediate action to ban the sale of tobacco products with squeezable capsules of flavour. The products were designed to make smoking seem more fun for young people and non-smokers, and to taste better, she said. \u201cTobacco control organisations have been fighting for decades to reach the point we are at \u2013 where young Australians are less interested than previous generations in trying or taking up smoking ,\u201d Lindorff said. \u201cBut the tobacco industry is working incredibly hard to change this by targeting young people with \u2018fun\u2019 and \u2018cool\u2019 products such as flavour capsule cigarettes which, when the filter is squeezed, release a flavour that makes tobacco smoke more palatable.\u201d Flavoured cigarettes are now widely available in Australia, with almost all major brands including at least one product with flavour squeeze balls in their range. \u201cThe product range and popularity of flavour capsule cigarettes will only continue to grow unless governments take serious action to ban these products,\u201d Lindorff said. To date, only Canada, Ethiopia, Senegal and Uganda have banned flavoured tobacco products. They will be banned in Brazil by March 2020 and across much of Europe by May 2020.",
