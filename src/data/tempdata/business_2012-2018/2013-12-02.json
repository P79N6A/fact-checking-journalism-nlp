      "bodyText": "Solihull If the chancellor is looking for signs of progress in Britain's attempt to regain its industrial might, he could do worse than to drive up to Birmingham and take a tour of Lander Automotive. The 136-year-old company makes pipes for cars including most of Jaguar Land Rover's models. Sales are growing, Lander is investing millions in new machinery and it is hiring from apprentice level up to engineers. According to managing director Roger Whitehouse, there has never been a better time to be in manufacturing. \"There ain't any place for arrogance. It's not easy to win the work but the work is there for companies that are efficient,\" he says. Whitehouse believes business and government are getting behind the car industry, with Lander receiving support from manufacturers' organisation EEF as well as state grants. \"I happen to think the government is doing a pretty good job. They are supporting research and development and investment,\" he says. A short drive away at JLR's Solihull plant, business is going from strength to strength, says operations director Alan Volkaerts. The downturn brought pay freezes and saw the plant stop hiring as the car industry around the world suffered from a slump in demand. But the Solihull boss believes longer-term planning during the downturn laid the ground for a quick turnaround. \"We knew the day we started to come out of recession we needed new models. We did a lot of painful things but kept design and development and retained our skill base,\" says Volkaerts. His plant produced more than 120,000 cars in the first 10 months of this year and the pick-up has rippled out around the region. Official statistics show the local population enjoys high employment, higher wages and a higher proportion of managerial jobs than the national average. Solihull has long had an air of prosperity, a place where successful business owners set up home and office. Its streets and carparks are cluttered with Land Rovers driven by entrepreneurs and managers. Rich professionals from Birmingham move out for Solihull's schools, grand detached houses and the town's 10 surrounding golf courses. For JLR the attractiveness of the region means good access to nearby suppliers. \"It feels great to be in Solihull and have local suppliers around us,\" says Volkaerts. But the big challenge now is getting skilled workers to support the industry's growth, he adds. The plant had 20,000 applicants for 1,100 jobs on the shop floor last year but nowhere near the same interest in more skilled jobs. \"From an electrical and mechanical craftsman point of view, we were looking for about 300 people and we still haven't filled them all,\" says Volkaerts. \"Like it or not, the UK is not providing the engineers we need to drive the manufacturing growth we want to see.\" In huge hangar-like buildings on the nearby Woodlands campus of Solihull College, courses are seeking to address some of the skills shortage that employers like JLR and Lander complain about. The site, set up in the more deprived northern Solihull as part of a regeneration drive, has just unveiled a new \u00a38.5m vehicle and construction centre. In the Donnington Park workshop, students are working on six different makes of car. In the construction wing, teenagers practise brick-laying, joinery and rendering. \"There's not the opportunity for the young people to go into these jobs at the moment,\" says Mark King, head of the construction school. \"What people in industry are looking for is someone who will come in and be useful to them. That's what we are doing.\" The numbers on job creation for the region are encouraging. JLR's recent announcement of 1,700 more jobs in Solihull echoes a wider pick-up for the area, which has benefited not just from car-making but other sectors such as life sciences, banking and technology. Private sector firms in Greater Birmingham and Solihull created nearly 40,000 jobs in 2010-2012, more than any local enterprise partnership area outside London. But local industry experts see a number of bumps on the road ahead. David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston Business School, highlights problems for growing firms in accessing both finance and skilled workers as well as transport challenges. \"In terms of rebalancing the economy we are doing it and I'd like to see the government supporting it more,\" he said. Katie Allen Munich Every now and then, BMW's \"four cylinders\" headquarters in Munich shakes as if there has been a very distant earthquake. There hasn't been. The shaking is caused by 10,000-tonne presses making chassis for the BMW 3 series in the 97-year-old company's first factory, which sits next door. \"Not many companies have their headquarters right next to the factory,\" says Ralf Rodepeter, director of the BMW Museum, which sits on the same site near the city centre. \"But it creates a special relationship between the blue and white-collar workers.\" The shaking rarely stops for long, but it did during the financial crisis. \"During the crisis we didn't feel the earth shake from side to side for days.\" Like the rest of the industry, BMW suffered in the financial crisis as new cars fell off consumers' shopping lists. Across the industry, global car sales dropped 9% in 2009 \u2013 the biggest decline in more than a decade. BMW's pre-tax profits collapsed from \u20ac3.9bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2007 to less than \u20ac500m in 2008 and 2009, and the company cut thousands of jobs. But the carmaker bounced back quicker than most of its rivals, reporting a \u20ac4.8bn profit in 2010, and \u20ac7.8bn last year, when it sold a record 1.8m cars. It is on track to break that record again this year. The recovery of BMW, which stands for Bayerische (Bavarian) Motoren Werke, is important for Munich and the whole of Bavaria. Car manufacturing \u2013 mostly made up of BMW and Audi 80km to the north in Ingolstadt \u2013 is Bavaria's biggest industry, accounting for nearly a third of the state's GDP. More than 280,000 people are employed by car companies, with the number rising to more than 500,000 when associated industries are included. Robert Obermeier, head economist at the Bavarian chamber of commerce, says Munich is not nicknamed \"car town\" for nothing. \"Bavaria's industry \u2013 cars, mechanics and electronics \u2013 is helping our state to be the best performing in Germany,\" he says. Bavaria's GDP grew 18.1% between 2002 and 2012 \u2013 the biggest increase of all of Germany's 16 states and 6 percentage points above the national average. The Bavarian unemployment rate is 3.7% \u2013 the lowest in all the German states and significantly below the national average of 6.8%. In the UK unemployment stands at 7.6%. Bavaria's youth unemployment is even lower at 3%, compared with 21% in the UK and more than 50% in Greece and Spain. Munich's success has not gone unnoticed. Net migration into Bavaria from other German states stood at 326,000 last year \u2013 a national high. Immigration from abroad \u2013 mostly from Romania and Hungary but with a growing number from Greece, Spain and Italy \u2013 stood at 70,000 in 2012 and is expected to be higher in 2013. There are no dole queues at Munich's job centres. While the Gucci, Jimmy Choo, Herm\u00e8s and Louis Vuitton stores on Maximilianstra\u00dfe are thronged with customers, a nearby unemployment office is deserted except for staff. Rupert Neate Turin A quarter of a century ago, Nina Leone, a young migrant from the south of Italy, was taken on by Fiat to work on the assembly line for the Lancia Delta 16v Integrale. Mirafiori, the carmaker's biggest and oldest factory, has been her place of work ever since \u2013 except that, since June last year, that work has been strictly notional. Leone, like more than 5,000 of her colleagues at the Turin plant, is on a period of cassa integrazione \u2013 temporary leave \u2013 due to run until September. As Fiat attempts to withstand the European market decline without closing any more Italian sites, Leone is trying to get by on a reduced salary of around \u20ac900 (\u00a3745) a month. And while forecasts from Rome and Brussels are predicting an imminent end to Italy's longest postwar recession, Leone can't quite believe it. To her, the longed-for recovery feels even further away than the snow-capped Alps visible from Mirafiori. \"If there is an air of change,\" she says, \"it's not being breathed. We are not feeling it.\" Turin, the elegant Piedmontese city that for decades was known primarily as Italy's car-making capital, has been hit hard by the crippling recession which, in the eurozone's third-largest economy, has been going on for nine straight quarters and is only forecast to end in the last part of this year. Certainly, unemployment in Turin's surrounding province \u2013 below 5% in 2007 and expected to hit 11% this year \u2013 is not at the dizzying heights of areas further south. And the economic diversification that occurred before 2008 has allowed Turin \u2013 no longer a one-industry town, with involvement in aerospace, IT and food \u2013 to reduce its vulnerability to a Detroit-style implosion. But the city is hurting nonetheless. If the strategy of Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne succeeds, Mirafiori will, in years to come, be part of that growth. Fiat's Italian-Canadian chief executive announced in September that, rather than shutting up shop, he would be retooling the site to prepare it for production of new models. From the Torinese point of view, keeping Mirafiori on life support is of course preferable to letting it die. The effects of Fiat's difficulties, however, go beyond those it directly employs. The province of Turin is home to nearly 900 businesses involved in the automotive and car parts sector and for them the crisis has come as a rude awakening. Alessandro Barberis, president of Turin's chamber of commerce and an ex-CEO of Fiat, has led a drive to market the local brand abroad and boost exports for the city's small and medium-sized enterprises. He says the effort has proved particularly important for automotive companies which have been helped to \"reduce their dependency\" on Fiat. Barberis says Italy still has a strong brand abroad, even if its politics don't help matters. \"I am very positive about Turin, about its future. Certainly if we were also able to put on a better national image it would be better.\" There are plenty of other reasons for the Torinese to feel optimistic about their future. Their city long ago stopped being just about cars, with other local sectors including aerospace, information technology, food, design and tourism. The chamber of commerce is trying to combat its lingering image as a purely industrial hub with the marketing slogan: \"Grey Turin? The only thing that's grey about us is our grey matter.\" But, from Cristina Romagnoli's office in Turin's biggest job centre, the picture remains bleak. In the first half of this year, more than 30,000 people in the surrounding province signed on to look for work. In 2008, the equivalent figure was just over 20,000. As is the case all over Italy, young people in the area have been particularly affected by the contraction of the job market. Unemployment among 15-24 year-olds stands at 34% and, like young Italians up and down the country \u2013 where the average is 41.2% \u2013 many of them are simply leaving. From January, every Monday afternoon at all Turin's job centres will be devoted to young people looking for work, says Romagnoli. She feels frustrated, she says, \"because we could do so much better, if only we had slightly more resources\". So is she optimistic about the recovery that is supposedly on its way? \"No. Because I don't see a political coherence. I do not see a serious strategic plan to get this area out of the crisis. And above all I see little investment in development,\" she says. Running through the numbers of jobseekers in Turin, she adds: \"These are very high numbers, but I tell you the truth: I do not think they will decrease. Not around here. Not at this time.\" Lizzy Davies",

We are not feeling it.\"</p> <p>Turin, the elegant Piedmontese city that for decades was known primarily as Italy's car-making capital, has been hit hard by the crippling recession which, in the eurozone's third-largest economy, has been going on for nine straight quarters and is only forecast to end in the last part of this year.</p> <p>Certainly, unemployment in Turin's surrounding province \u2013 below 5% in 2007 and expected to hit 11% this year \u2013 is not at the dizzying heights of areas further south.</p> <p>And the economic diversification that occurred before 2008 has allowed Turin \u2013 no longer a one-industry town, with involvement in aerospace, IT and food \u2013 to reduce its vulnerability to a Detroit-style implosion.</p> <p>But the city is hurting nonetheless. If the strategy of Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne succeeds, Mirafiori will, in years to come, be part of that growth. Fiat's Italian-Canadian chief executive announced in September that, rather than shutting up shop, he would be retooling the site to prepare it for production of new models.</p> <p>From the Torinese point of view, keeping Mirafiori on life support is of course preferable to letting it die. The effects of Fiat's difficulties, however, go beyond those it directly employs.</p> <p>The province of Turin is home to nearly 900 businesses involved in the automotive and car parts sector and for them the crisis has come as a rude awakening.</p> <p>Alessandro Barberis, president of Turin's chamber of commerce and an ex-CEO of Fiat, has led a drive to market the local brand abroad and boost exports for the city's small and medium-sized enterprises.</p> <p>He says the effort has proved particularly important for automotive companies which have been helped to \"reduce their dependency\" on Fiat.</p> <p>Barberis says Italy still has a strong brand abroad, even if its politics don't help matters.</p> <p>\"I am very positive about Turin, about its future. Certainly if we were also able to put on a better national image it would be better.\"</p> <p>There are plenty of other reasons for the Torinese to feel optimistic about their future. Their city long ago stopped being just about cars, with other local sectors including aerospace, information technology, food, design and tourism. The chamber of commerce is trying to combat its lingering image as a purely industrial hub with the marketing slogan: \"Grey Turin? The only thing that's grey about us is our grey matter.\"</p> <p>But, from Cristina Romagnoli's office in Turin's biggest job centre, the picture remains bleak. In the first half of this year, more than 30,000 people in the surrounding province signed on to look for work. In 2008, the equivalent figure was just over 20,000.</p> <p>As is the case all over Italy, young people in the area have been particularly affected by the contraction of the job market. Unemployment among 15-24 year-olds stands at 34% and, like young Italians up and down the country \u2013 where the average is 41.2% \u2013 many of them are simply leaving.</p> <p>From January, every Monday afternoon at all Turin's job centres will be devoted to young people looking for work, says Romagnoli. She feels frustrated, she says, \"because we could do so much better, if only we had slightly more resources\".</p> <p>So is she optimistic about the recovery that is supposedly on its way? \"No. Because I don't see a political coherence. I do not see a serious strategic plan to get this area out of the crisis. And above all I see little investment in development,\" she says. Running through the numbers of jobseekers in Turin, she adds: \"These are very high numbers, but I tell you the truth: I do not think they will decrease. Not around here. Not at this time.\"</p> <p><strong>Lizzy Davies</strong></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is coming under pressure from energy firms to make a second stage of cuts to green levies or face gas and electricity price rises in the months before the 2015 election. Ministers agreed to scale back the Energy Company Obligation (Eco) scheme that cuts the fuel usage of poor households, while funding another subsidy out of taxation, reducing average energy bills by \u00a350. The big six energy firms all said they would pass on the \u00a350 cut to consumers, and most suggested they would be able to hold off from raising prices for the whole of 2014 without further rises in wholesale or network costs. But industry sources say the companies are still in negotiations with officials on further possible ways of bringing down gas and electricity bills, with one executive in a big six firm saying the \u00a350 cut is \"very much seen as a first step\". Among various targets for companies are further cuts to Eco, another look at the \u00a311bn smart metering scheme and scrapping the carbon floor price \u2013 a tax on emissions that makes the cost of nuclear and renewable energy comparatively cheaper. Tory MP Tim Yeo, chairman of the Commons energy committee, warned of the danger of having \"opened the door\" to cutting environmental programmes, arguing the government is looking in the wrong place in its drive to cut bills. He said green and social levies only make up 9% of the bill and ministers should instead consider the role of the monopoly network firms, such as National Grid, whose charges now make up 20% of the total. Yeo also backed Labour's call for the energy companies, which currently both generate energy and supply it to homes and businesses, to be split up as the only way to banish the suspicion that firms are profiteering. \"I don't think we'll ever rebuild trust in this industry until we have separation of these functions,\" he said. \"[The government] may be not be persuaded because of the resistance of the industry and because it is a policy the Labour party are starting to look at. But I take the view this is a very long-term industry and if we think something is right, we should do it anyway.\" Speaking during his trade mission to China, David Cameron said a pledge by energy companies to pass on the reduction in costs to household bills is \"good news for British families, good news for the cost of living\". Labour said the government has let the energy companies off pain-free, whereas Ed Miliband would freeze prices completely for 18 months if he came to power in 2015. \"There was not a single measure that will cost the energy companies a single penny,\" said Caroline Flint, the party's shadow energy secretary. Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, an insulation industry group, last night accused the big six of using \"bully boy tactics\" to persuade the government to cut energy efficiency programmes in order to maximise their own profits. \"It is absolutely disgraceful that the big energy companies have orchestrated this unscrupulous campaign, that appears to be succeeding in blackmailing the UK government into cutting by half its established policy to require energy companies to help customers stop wasting money by wasting fuel,\" he said. \"There has been no increase whatsoever in the levels of social and energy saving obligations placed upon the big six this year. This concerted attack on Eco is predominantly a distraction technique, designed to draw attention from the price gouging they are practising.\" He said the cuts, due to be announced in more detail during Thursday's autumn statement, would give the energy firms a \"taste for blood\". Ed Davey, the energy secretary, told ITV News that energy firms wanted to slash more government charges, but ministers had stood their ground and refused. Greg Barker, the energy minister, also insisted that there would be no more cuts to green subsidies, pointing out the government had not touched those aimed at encouraging renewable energy to be built. \"People were scaremongering that feed-in tariffs was under threat, the renewable obligation was under threat, and others were completely wide of the mark. We're absolutely committed to energy efficiency and renewable energy.\" Asked whether this meant an end to cutting green levies, he said: \"Exactly. We've now got the certainty and clarity that investors need.\" The Department of Energy and Climate Change also said the 40% of Eco spent on insulating the homes of the poorest had been protected. But despite this reassurance, Whitehall sources said talks between officials and energy companies over ways to cut bills are ongoing, including policy costs. The government's lead advisors on energy efficiency and fuel poverty also both condemned the cuts to energy efficiency measures as short-sighted. \"What is disappointing is that the UK is not yet fully grasping the quadruple prize of energy efficiency,\" said Peter Boyd, Expert Chair of the energy department's Energy Efficiency Deployment Office. \"We have policies that are among the best in the world, which we are unfortunately watering down.\" Derek Lickorish, chairman of the government's advisory panel on fuel poverty, also criticised all the political parties for not taking energy efficiency seriously. \"This is a sticking plaster. What we need is a cross-party unity to deliver permanent reductions to bills through energy efficiency.\" He said: \"The \u00a350 saving [promised by ministers], as welcome as it is, could be gobbled up by a small rise in the wholesale price on the global markets.\" The biggest cut to energy efficiency in the government's plan is a cut in installing solid wall insulation through the Eco scheme, with installations dropping from 80,000 homes a year to 25,000. Lickorish said solid wall insulation can deliver a 40% saving on energy bills. \"Most solid wall insulations deliver life-saving amounts of reduction.\" Last week, official data showed excess winter deaths in the UK rose year by almost a third. Consumer Futures, the UK's official consumer watchdog, also criticised the government's announcement. \"The review to cut bills has failed consumers by cutting the only levy, ECO, that directly helps them,\" said director Adam Scorer. \"Consumers need long term solutions to energy affordability. The most sustainable way to do that is through the provision of energy efficiency measures.\" British Gas said the average bill would rise by \u00a370, rather than \u00a3123, because the government had committed to making changes to the environmental and social charges. Npower also said it could now hold off increasing bills until 2015 and would reduce prices soon, with Paul Massara, its chief executive, said: \"As a result of this announcement we will reduce our prices. We are currently calculating how large this reduction will be, and can assure our customers that it will fully reflect the reduction in the costs to our business.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government's deal to underwrite the \u00a316bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station plan faces delay and possible rejection after the European commission said it was ready to launch an in-depth inquiry into the agreement. The EU competition commissioner said Brussels was likely to investigate the deal, which guarantees a minimum power price for 35 years, to make sure it conformed with state aid rules. The commission frowns on national governments offering deals to companies that stifle competition and distort the market. Joaqu\u00edn Almunia said: \"We are starting to analyse what is in the British proposal. Probably we will open a formal investigation because many people are asking the same question [whether the UK's agreement was too long].\" Energy secretary Ed Davey gave the go-ahead in October for a consortium led by France's EDF Energy to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset.

Davey agreed a minimum price of \u00a392.50 for every megawatt hour (MWh) of energy that Hinkley Point generates \u2013 almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. The deal with EDF was unprecedented and made the UK the first European country to offer a set price over 35 years for a new nuclear project.

The government has said it is confident the deal will stand up to EU scrutiny but a formal probe could take years and cast prolonged doubt over the plan. The government has said the new plant is vital to make Britain more self-sufficient and to cut use of fossil fuels. The UK notified the commission about the deal at the end of October. A decision on whether to investigate would normally be expected within two months but that time period could be extended. Almunia gave no indication of how long an investigation might take but the commission sees the government's deal with EDF, Areva and China's General Nuclear Power as complex and highly novel.

Michael Fallon, the energy minister, said: \"I have no reason to believe the commission will block it.\" An investigation would look at whether the government's decision was proportionate and whether there were alternatives to offering guarantees to EDF. An inquiry is also likely to seek the views of other interested parties. Reports in the French press said the government in Paris was monitoring the machinations around the deal closely and was worried that delays could threaten France's nuclear industry. The government's proposals were always likely to receive attention from the commission but Almunia's comments suggest they will be subjected to intense scrutiny. The UK wants the EU to accept that nuclear power should be given special status like renewable energy but Germany and Austria oppose such a move and Hinkley Point is likely to be considered like any other state aid case. Moves by the commission to block or radically alter the nuclear deal could spark a major dispute between London and Brussels. Many Conservative MPs and constituency parties are virulently opposed to Europe's influence over UK policy and David Cameron has pledged a referendum on UK membership of the EU if the Tories win the 2015 election. The commission is revising its guidelines on state aid and aims to finalise them next year to run for the rest of this decade. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"We have always been clear that EDF will only be offered an investment contract if it is fair, affordable, value for money and consistent with state aid rules. \"The UK government continues to work closely with the commission on state aid. It would not be appropriate for the UK government to comment on an ongoing process or on the timescales for approval.\" The government's case was dealt a blow a month ago when analysts at Liberum Capital argued that the guarantees offered to EDF could prove to be \"economically insane\".

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pawnbroker Albemarle &amp; Bond has put itself up for sale just days after it revealed it had begun melting down its gold reserves to raise emergency cash. The sale announcement after markets closed on Monday capped a torrid day for the UK's second largest pawnbroker when five non-executive directors resigned with immediate effect, leaving chairman Greville Nicholls as the only non-executive standing. In a statement the company said a sale was \"in the best interests of shareholders\", although it warned there was no certainty any offers would be made. Rivals in the pawnbroking industry are understood to be interested in bidding for Albemarle &amp; Bond, which as well as pawnbroking, also offers short-term loans to customers looking for emergency funds. The pawnbroker, which has seen its shares shed 90% of their value over the past year, ended the day with its shares down 2.5% at 19p, valuing the company at \u00a310m. The shares dropped on news of the departure of non-executive director Geoff Brady, which came late in the afternoon, without any of the customary thanks from the chair. His exit followed the morning's news that non-executives Robin Ashton, Tracey Graham, Sterling Brinkley and Tom Roberts would be standing down. Nicholls thanked the quartet for their \"significant and much-appreciated contribution\". Ashton was chair of the audit committee and Graham chaired the remuneration committee. Albemarle &amp; Bond has been hit by the plunging price of gold and announced last week that it had started melting down its inventory of jewellery and other gold items that were not likely to sell before Christmas, providing an immediate release of cash to stay within its lending limits. The firm, founded in 1983 with a single shop, expanded rapidly during the downturn as people cashed in their gold items to take advantage of soaring prices. In 2011 it declared \"the age of the pawnbroker\" and launched \"pop-up\" shops specialising in gold. But a recovery in the global economy \u2013 making gold less attractive against resurgent stock markets \u2013 has seen gold prices fall by more than a quarter this year. Albemarle &amp; Bond issued a profit warning in September and brought in Chris Gillespie from doorstep lender Provident Financial to serve as chief executive. The stockbroker Canaccord Genuity is advising on the sale, which will proceed with special dispensation from disclosure rules, meaning any bids can be made in secret. The company, due to publish results on 9 December, last week announced that market expectations were \"significantly more optimistic than its own\", causing its share price to tumble. Albemarle &amp; Bond has taken measures to slash costs, which include closing the 33 pop-up stores in its 230-store estate. It has also warned that it sees no signs of recovery in the market, while its \"pledge book\" of customer items secured against loans has fallen 12%, hit by the falling gold price and growing competition. At the height of its growth A&amp;B, and its bigger rival H&amp;T Pawnbrokers, opened new shops focused heavily on gold, saddling them with fixed costs that gave them little scope to scale back when the post-crash gold rush ended. The firm's woes have been exacerbated by a bill for its failed attempt to secure a \u00a335m cash injection from its biggest shareholder Ezcorp last month, when talks on a deeply discounted rights issue were aborted.",

But a recovery in the global economy \u2013 making gold less attractive against resurgent stock markets \u2013 has seen gold prices fall by more than a quarter this year.</p> <p>Albemarle &amp; Bond issued a profit warning in September and brought in Chris Gillespie from doorstep lender Provident Financial to serve as chief executive.</p> <p>The stockbroker Canaccord Genuity is advising on the sale, which will proceed with special dispensation from disclosure rules, meaning any bids can be made in secret.</p> <p>The company, due to publish results on 9 December, last week announced that market expectations were \"significantly more optimistic than its own\", causing its share price to tumble. Albemarle &amp; Bond has taken measures to slash costs, which include closing the 33 pop-up stores in its 230-store estate.</p> <p>It has also warned that it sees no signs of recovery in the market, while its \"pledge book\" of customer items secured against loans has fallen 12%, hit by the falling gold price and growing competition. At the height of its growth A&amp;B, and its bigger rival H&amp;T Pawnbrokers, opened new shops focused heavily on gold, saddling them with fixed costs that gave them little scope to scale back when the post-crash gold rush ended.</p> <p>The firm's woes have been exacerbated by a bill for its failed attempt to secure a \u00a335m cash injection from its biggest shareholder Ezcorp last month, when talks on a deeply discounted rights issue were aborted.</p>",

A week after Threadneedle Street said the FLS would refocus from mortgages on to business lending, the latest quarterly update showed the Bank had channelled \u00a35.5bn to lenders in the three months to the end of September. This takes the total drawn down by banks and building societies since the scheme was introduced in summer 2012 to \u00a323bn, although net lending \u2013 the difference between money lent and loans repaid \u2013 has reached \u00a33.6bn. Paul Fisher, executive director for markets at the Bank of England, said: \"An economic recovery has taken hold. These data show that a significant improvement in credit conditions, aided by the FLS, is now feeding through to lending. But credit supply to businesses remains relatively subdued, especially to [small and medium sized enterprises]. The refocus of the FLS is designed to continue to support the recovery, where it is needed.\" Over the period since the FLS began in August 2012 Nationwide has pumped \u00a39.7bn into the economy through the scheme \u2013 more than any other lender \u2013 while Santander has sucked out \u00a312.5bn. Lloyds and rival bailed-out bank Royal Bank of Scotland have also lent less than has been repaid over the lifetime of the scheme, with negative net lending of \u00a32.2bn and \u00a36.5bn respectively. Lending specifically to small businesses contracted, prompting the employers' body the CBI to call for new ways of funding small businesses, while the manufacturers' body the EEF demanded more competition in banking. Some economists questioned what the impact of refocusing the FLS away from mortgages would be. Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics, said: \"We think the direct effect of that action will be rather small. After all, as of the third quarter of 2013 banks had access to over \u00a378bn of undrawn FLS funds, and no lender is close to their allowance limit. If any are worried about their access to the scheme being cut off next year, they could just load up on funds before the end of January.\" Net lending by all lenders, not just those involved in the FLS, was \u00a38.7bn in the third quarter, which prompted Allan Monks of JP Morgan to conclude mortgage lending would have improved without the Bank's FLS. Santander said its negative net lending figure of \u00a312.5bn since the FLS began was the result of a decision to scale back mortgages in favour of small business lending. Barclays said its lending had been negative in the third quarter by \u00a3800m, because multinational corporate clients had repaid a large amount of debt.",

Fitch expects negotiations with the Troika (EU-IMF-ECB) on the fifth review of the Economic Adjustment Programme (EAP) to reach a satisfactory conclusion by year-end. Near term, Greece is fully funded until February 2014.</p> <p>Fitch acknowledges that there are programme funding shortfalls of \u20ac11bn in 2014-15, but believes various options should be available to address these.</p> </blockquote> <p>On GDP the agency said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Greek economy's ability to adjust and recover is crucial to the restoration of sovereign creditworthiness. To date, adjustment has taken place chiefly through recession and unemployment. Recovery still hangs in the balance. However, the rate of contraction of real GDP has slowed to 3% in the third quarter from 5.6% year on year in quarter one, while unemployment appears to be levelling out, albeit at a record high of 27%. Fitch has revised its real GDP forecast for 2013 to negative 4% from negative 4.3%, leaving 2014 unchanged at 0.5%.</p> <p>Greece recorded its first ever current account surplus in the first to third quarters of 2013. This was mostly due to severe import compression and debt relief. However, it also reflects a modest recovery of merchandise exports, buoyant tourism receipts and a significant step up in net EU transfers. Surpluses are not sustainable over the long term. However, the stage is set for an upturn in receipts from merchandise exports and shipping on the back of appreciable gains in external competitiveness, incipient recovery in the eurozone and stronger world trade.</p> <p>Sustaining economic recovery will depend upon the success of structural reforms. Greece has pushed ahead with labour market reform. Progress has also been made restoring financial sector stability, with all four core banks now fully recapitalised. However, other aspects of structural reform have encountered significant resistance from vested interests, holding back productivity gains and forestalling stronger FDI flows.</p> <p>Political risk remains significant. The current administration has displayed much greater ownership of the EAP, but reform fatigue is taking its toll and defections have reduced its majority in parliament to just four MPs. An early general election, while not Fitch's base case, could produce an anti-austerity, anti-EU administration. However, Fitch notes that Syriza, the main opposition party, has stepped back from its extreme policy stance of euro exit.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=810160\">Fitch Affirms Greece at 'B-'; Outlook Stable</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-02T17:03:19.291Z\">at 5.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-529ca90ae4b083b815ae5490\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-02T16:34:57.374Z\">4.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Portuguese bond yields have risen ahead of a debt exchange due tomorrow.</strong></p> <p>The country's debt agency will launch a long awaited bond exchange involving a swap of 2014 and 2015 issues for those maturing in 2017 and 2018.

This is the best level since April 2011, with growth accelerating after the US government shutdown which hit activity in October. Earlier a separate report from Markit showed manufacturing rising to a 10 month high in November. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [ISM] outcome is at odds with the development of both the New York Fed and Philadelphia Fed regional manufacturing surveys that showed their respective indexes pulling back in November. Other surveys were more upbeat over the month and the ISM seems to have converged with the levels of the Chicago PMI that runs in its 60s.</p> <p>The breakdown of the report shows a solid increase in both production and new orders that are both up by around 3 points to 62.8 and 63.6 respectively. Inventories declined 2 points as demand seems to have accelerated. Exports rose 2 points to 59.5 and imports were a touch down to 55.

If it is followed by robust construction and, especially services, surveys, it will look very likely that GDP growth in the fourth quarter could at least match the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter expansion seen in the third quarter.</p> <p>Much will depend on how well consumer spending performs in the fourth quarter, as there have been some signs that consumers have taken a breather after spending at a robust pace in the third quarter. If consumer spending gains appreciable momentum as Christmas gets ever nearer, fourth quarter growth prospects for the economy will be looking very bright.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>David Tinsley </strong>at<strong> BNP Paribas:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking at the breakdown, the detail all looks positive. As in previous months, a disproportionate part of this strength is being driven by domestic factors. New export orders are rising strong, but here the index, at 54.8, is more modest. The output index also rose above 60, suggesting manufacturing production should make a significant contribution to GDP growth in Q4.Stock levels of finished goods are also reported as having fallen sharply, which suggests continued production in the months ahead.</p> <p>The strength in the recovery in activity is clearly being seen in higher employment growth, with the index here rising to a two and a half year high. But the rise in employment continues to lag the size of increase in activity, suggesting rising productivity. These developments are therefore loosely consistent with the sort of response the Bank of England is looking for under its forward guidance regime. There remains some signs that output price inflation in manufacturing is picking up, but not at rates that are particularly concerning for now.</p> <p>Overall the performance of the manufacturing sector is very impressive. One is accustomed to the UK economy being led by the service sector. So to see manufacturing keeping pace with services is very encouraging.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>James Knightley </strong>at <strong>ING</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The November UK manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index has come in at 58.4, well above the 56.0 consensus and is the strongest reading since February 2011. The employment component was particularly strong, rising to 54.5 from 51.9, leaving the index at a two and a half year high. This suggests that unemployment will continue to fall and supports our view that the unemployment rate will drop below 7% late 2014/early 2015.</p> <p>Furthermore, a robust production number means that the economy is likely to have accelerated in 4Q13 from 3Q13 and with new order rising to a 19 year high this suggests that that output will be robust in early 2014 too. Interestingly, orders from the eurozone are performing strongly. Taking it all together it implies that the UK economy is looking in good shape with interest rate rises looking increasingly probable from early 2015.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Rob Wood</strong> at <strong>Berenberg</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Domestic demand was the key pillar of new orders, but export orders also increased solidly, with inflows from Asia, the US and the eurozone. Employment increased at its fastest rate for two and a half years and inventories fell at one of the sharpest rates for three-and-a-half years. Further growth in output is likely.</p> <p>The PMI\u2019s have on the whole overstated UK growth recently, so we would not take this latest figure totally at face value. But it undoubtedly points to above trend growth in manufacturing, which bodes well for Q4 growth. We expect GDP to rise 0.8% quarter on quarter.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s recovery is mostly domestic, driven by very loose monetary policy and declining uncertainty. The UK domestic economy is likely to outpace most of its competitors over the next couple of years so dramatic reductions in the trade deficit seem unlikely.</p> <p>Still, there are positive signs on exports in the surveys. Now the UK\u2019s main export markets are starting to recover \u2013 the eurozone and the US \u2013 trade flows should improve too, which should help stimulate investment even if it does not lead to a lower trade deficit.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-02T11:31:10.388Z\">at 11.31am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-529c4febe4b083b815ae543f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-02T09:52:54.890Z\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK manufacturing orders rise to higest level in almost 20 years</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the UK, Britain's manufacturing sector appears to be booming as it continues to emerge from a deep and prolonged recession.</p> <p>The headline <strong>PMI</strong> index rose to 58.4 in November, from an upwardly revised 56.5 in October.

On that note, we're closing up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. In the wake of Moody's decision to upgrade Greece's credit rating by two notches to Caa3 because of its reforms progress, rival agency Fitch has kept its rating at B- but raised its GDP expectations. Fitch has kept its outlook stable, saying: Greece is on course to eliminate longstanding macroeconomic imbalances and there has been no repetition of the protracted delays in EU-IMF disbursements that marred previous years. Fitch expects negotiations with the Troika (EU-IMF-ECB) on the fifth review of the Economic Adjustment Programme (EAP) to reach a satisfactory conclusion by year-end. Near term, Greece is fully funded until February 2014. Fitch acknowledges that there are programme funding shortfalls of \u20ac11bn in 2014-15, but believes various options should be available to address these. On GDP the agency said: The Greek economy's ability to adjust and recover is crucial to the restoration of sovereign creditworthiness. To date, adjustment has taken place chiefly through recession and unemployment. Recovery still hangs in the balance. However, the rate of contraction of real GDP has slowed to 3% in the third quarter from 5.6% year on year in quarter one, while unemployment appears to be levelling out, albeit at a record high of 27%. Fitch has revised its real GDP forecast for 2013 to negative 4% from negative 4.3%, leaving 2014 unchanged at 0.5%. Greece recorded its first ever current account surplus in the first to third quarters of 2013. This was mostly due to severe import compression and debt relief. However, it also reflects a modest recovery of merchandise exports, buoyant tourism receipts and a significant step up in net EU transfers. Surpluses are not sustainable over the long term. However, the stage is set for an upturn in receipts from merchandise exports and shipping on the back of appreciable gains in external competitiveness, incipient recovery in the eurozone and stronger world trade. Sustaining economic recovery will depend upon the success of structural reforms. Greece has pushed ahead with labour market reform. Progress has also been made restoring financial sector stability, with all four core banks now fully recapitalised. However, other aspects of structural reform have encountered significant resistance from vested interests, holding back productivity gains and forestalling stronger FDI flows. Political risk remains significant. The current administration has displayed much greater ownership of the EAP, but reform fatigue is taking its toll and defections have reduced its majority in parliament to just four MPs. An early general election, while not Fitch's base case, could produce an anti-austerity, anti-EU administration. However, Fitch notes that Syriza, the main opposition party, has stepped back from its extreme policy stance of euro exit. The full report is here: Fitch Affirms Greece at 'B-'; Outlook Stable Portuguese bond yields have risen ahead of a debt exchange due tomorrow. The country's debt agency will launch a long awaited bond exchange involving a swap of 2014 and 2015 issues for those maturing in 2017 and 2018. The move is designed to help ease its refinancing burden ahead of a bailout exit next year. The news has helped push up ten year yields by nearly 10 basis points to just over 6%, while five year yields rose 19 basis points to 5.11%. More on the US manufacturing survey, this time from Rob Carnell at ING: Today\u2019s manufacturing-ISM index is the first of many releases this week that will shape market expectations in advance of Friday\u2019s labour market report. And expectations got off to an ebullient start, with the ISM headline rising to 57.3 from 56.4 in October, despite some softer regional surveys, and the employment index of the survey rising strongly from 53.2 to 56.5. Wednesday\u2019s non-manufacturing ISM employment index, together with the ADP survey remain the key releases in advance of payrolls, and other labour data. But with the backdrop for labour demand looking robust, according to ongoing declines in initial claims, Friday may re-encourage thoughts of a December / January taper amongst market participants. Whether it does the same to Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and the rest of the FOMC is another question, however. At the moment, markets do not seem unduly worries by the idea of the Federal Reserve beginning to curb its $85bn a month bond buying programme, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average improving slightly since the ISM data. It is now down 0.18%. Adding to the day's snapshots of global manufacturing, the US figure has come in sharply ahead of expectations. The US manufacturing ISM index rose from 56.4 in October to 57.3 in November, much better than the decline to around 55 which analysts had been expecting. This is the best level since April 2011, with growth accelerating after the US government shutdown which hit activity in October. Earlier a separate report from Markit showed manufacturing rising to a 10 month high in November. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The [ISM] outcome is at odds with the development of both the New York Fed and Philadelphia Fed regional manufacturing surveys that showed their respective indexes pulling back in November. Other surveys were more upbeat over the month and the ISM seems to have converged with the levels of the Chicago PMI that runs in its 60s. The breakdown of the report shows a solid increase in both production and new orders that are both up by around 3 points to 62.8 and 63.6 respectively. Inventories declined 2 points as demand seems to have accelerated. Exports rose 2 points to 59.5 and imports were a touch down to 55. The employment index suggests some improvement in the labour market over the month, with the index up more than 3 points to 56.5. All in all, today's report is quite encouraging as it suggests that the factory sector has gained some momentum Over in the US the Dow Jones is 0.25% lower at 16,046.53, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.08% at 1,807.20. In Europe all the major indices are down, with Germany's Dax the exception. FTSE 100: -0.74% at 6,601.54 CAC 40: -0.25% at 4,284.57 DAX 30: +0.09% at 9,414.22 IBEX: -0.82% at 9,756.5 FTSE MIB: -1.42% at 18,752.32 And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. As the debate over the rising cost of living promises to become one of the major battle grounds in the run up to the 2015 election, the Office for National Statistics has published data showing British wage-earners have suffered a \u00a35,000 pay cut over the past five years. Patrick Wintour, the Guardian's political editor, writes: The figures published by the Office for National Statistics show wages and salaries for the middle fifth of non-retired households fell from \u00a333,100 in 2007-08 to \u00a328,300 in 2011-12. Over the same period original income, which is the income households get from employment and investments, fell from \u00a337,900 to \u00a332,600, while cash benefits rose from \u00a33,100 to \u00a34,600. The figures will fuel the debate about living standards before the general election, and about whether the government has done enough to protect the typical wage-earner. The figures confirm that the earnings squeeze pre-dates the 2007 recession, appearing to endorse Ed Miliband's claim that the link between wages and growth has been broken, one of his chief justifications for his willingness to intervene in the market. The report says: \"While GDP per person continued to grow at similar rates between 2004-5 and 2007-8, growth of median household income slowed to a fifth of its previous rate in the years immediately before the start of the economic downturn. The Treasury will be fervently hoping that it will be able to show the link has been restored in 2014, either because economic growth is so strong or because it has taken steps to make work pay with its welfare reforms. But the figures also show that despite the big rise in personal allowances due to budget decisions by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, median household income for the overall population has fallen by 3.8%, after adjusting for inflation, since the start of the downturn. Over in Greece, tensions are mounting between the government and the troika of international lenders - the International Monetary Fund, European Union, and European Central Bank. A planned visit by the lenders that was scheduled to start today was delayed after the parties clashed over a number of structural reforms. Helena Smith, the Guardian's reporter in Athens, reports on the latest developments: Highlighting the mounting concerns in European capitals over Greece, the German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble and the EU monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn held talks late last night with Athens\u2019 deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos. Venizelos, who will meet at pm today with the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras, has made it clear that his socialist Pasok party will not accept the latest demand put forward by the country\u2019s troika of creditors: that Athens forcibly seize the homes of those who cannot afford to keep up with bank mortgages of \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3165,000). Leaks suggest the troika has made home foreclosures a priority, telling government ministers that they should prepare for the social effects of mass evictions. \u201cNo way will we accept to do this when we have record levels of poverty and unemployment,\u201d said one senior insider. Venizelos has said \u201cat all costs the vulnerable have to be protected.\" The row, rumbling over the weekend, took the shine off Moody's decision to upgrade Greece's credit rating by two notches to Caa3 from C because of its reforms progress. Robert Shiller, a winner of the 2013 Nobel prize for economics, has warned about a potential bubble in US stock markets: He told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine: I'm not sounding the alarm yet. But in many countries the stock price levels are high, and in many real estate markets prices have risen sharply...that could end badly. I find the boom in the US stock market most concerning. The world is still very vulnerable to bubbles. He said the US was of particular concern because the world's largest economy remained \"weak and vulnerable\". Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, gave this commentary on US markets earlier today: An eighth successive week of gains and another record high on Friday for the S&amp;P500 ... there appears to be no stopping US markets, as they continue their relentless advance, in the process posting yet another monthly gain. So far in 2013 this particular US benchmark index has only posted two negative months, which on the law of averages would seem to suggest that we should be due a negative one. The only problem is looking for the catalyst that could precipitate a sell-off given the markets apparent indifference to any form of negative news over the last few weeks. As the cost of living row rumbles on in the UK, four of Britain's biggest energy companies have said bills will rise by around \u00a350 less than expected this winter following David Cameron's decision to \"roll back\" green levies. Rowena Mason, the Guardian's political correspondent, reports: British Gas said the average bill would rise by \u00a370, rather than \u00a3123, after the government scaled back a programme to help poor households cut their energy usage and said it would pay for another subsidy out of general taxation. Npower said it could now hold off increasing bills until 2015, as predicted on Sunday night by the Guardian. The third supplier to act was SSE, which said it would reduce its tariffs before April \u2013 still potentially allowing it to benefit from higher prices over the winter months. Over the weekend, EDF said it could hold off increasing bills until 2015, having raised its prices less than other firms in anticipation of government action to cut levies. However, the companies' statements also contained caveats that their price freezes were contingent on no new rises in wholesale prices, network costs or policy costs \u2013 the three reasons typically used to justify price rises. Scottish Power has not yet made an announcement, while E.ON has not raised its prices in the latest round of increases. The coalition came under pressure to act on energy bills after Labour said it would freeze bills for 18 months after the election if it won power, as it went on the attack over the rising cost of living. December is here so the official countdown to Christmas begins. The season got off to a strong start over the weekend as UK retailers adopted American style \"Black Friday\" promotions to encourage shoppers into a festive mood. Hot on Black Friday's tracks is \"Cyber Monday\" (or \"Mega Monday\"), so-called because the first Monday in December is apparently the busiest day of the year for online sales, as shoppers order early to make sure gifts arrive in good time for Christmas avoiding any last minute dash to the nearest petrol station. As Rebecca Smithers and Sarah Butler report: Nearly half a billion pounds is expected to be spent online on Monday \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a3312,500 every minute \u2013 as more than 7m transactions take place. It is likely to be the busiest day ever for online shopping in the UK, with more than 113m visits to virtual stores as shoppers use their last pay cheque before the big day. Online retailers expect to have raked in more than \u00a31bn between Saturday and Monday night. Total Christmas sales are expected to be a staggering \u00a372.2bn \u2013 or \u00a3351 per person \u2013 an increase of more than 2% on last year, according to the Centre for Retail Research. Of that, one third will be spent online. Read the full story here. Net lending by those banks participating in the Funding for Lending scheme (FLS) rose to \u00a35.8bn in the three months to the end of September from \u00a31.6bn in the second quarter. Banks have taken a total of \u00a323.1bn from the scheme, which offers cheap loans to banks in exchange for lending. But the figures also showed that lending to small and medium-sized enterprises was negative. The report follows the surprise intervention by the Bank of England which last week moved to cool the UK housing market by announcing the FLS would no longer be applicable to mortgage loans from 2014. Instead, the scheme will be focused on increasing lending to businesses. The move came amid fears in some quarters that government schemes including FLS and Help to Buy would create another housing bubble. There have also been plenty of suggestions that the Bank has failed to offer sufficient support to smaller businesses during the crisis. The government says the latest FLS data are a further sign its economic plan is working. No doubt this will be the resounding message from George Osborne when he announces his Autumn Statement on Thursday. The Chancellor is likely to find himself in the comfortable position of presenting his thoughts alongside an improved set of forecasts on growth and the public finances from the Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain's official forecaster. This from a Treasury spokesperson on FLS: Today\u2019s data release is further evidence that the governments long-term economic plan is working to deliver a responsible recovery. The Funding for Lending Scheme has succeeded in improving credit conditions and has helped the housing market to recover. Last week, with the Bank of England, the Government took action to make sure that next phase of the scheme refocuses on lending to small businesses, which are the lifeblood of our economy. Meanwhile Steve Radley, policy director at manufacturers' trade body EEF, says the change in focus of the FLS is not enough and more action is needed to help businesses: Today\u2019s data shows net lending to SMEs fell again and shows that last week\u2019s move to focus FLS on business lending was the right one. But, with lending still weak, we shouldn\u2019t see this as the silver bullet and we need action in all fronts to get credit flowing, including increasing competition in business banking and, improving the relationship between business and banks. The EEF's view was echoed by the CBI's Matthew Fell: Despite overall FLS lending substantially increasing, Bank of England data shows that net lending to SMEs continues to fall so the recent move recalibrating the scheme towards business lending is welcome. But FLS isn\u2019t the only tool to help plug the finance gap for smaller firms. We want the government to kick-start a market in securitisation of SME loans. Here is some of the reaction to the news that the UK manufacturing PMI rose to 58.4 in November from 56.5 in October. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: This is a very strong kick off to the set of purchasing managers surveys for November. If it is followed by robust construction and, especially services, surveys, it will look very likely that GDP growth in the fourth quarter could at least match the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter expansion seen in the third quarter. Much will depend on how well consumer spending performs in the fourth quarter, as there have been some signs that consumers have taken a breather after spending at a robust pace in the third quarter. If consumer spending gains appreciable momentum as Christmas gets ever nearer, fourth quarter growth prospects for the economy will be looking very bright. David Tinsley at BNP Paribas: Looking at the breakdown, the detail all looks positive. As in previous months, a disproportionate part of this strength is being driven by domestic factors. New export orders are rising strong, but here the index, at 54.8, is more modest. The output index also rose above 60, suggesting manufacturing production should make a significant contribution to GDP growth in Q4.Stock levels of finished goods are also reported as having fallen sharply, which suggests continued production in the months ahead. The strength in the recovery in activity is clearly being seen in higher employment growth, with the index here rising to a two and a half year high. But the rise in employment continues to lag the size of increase in activity, suggesting rising productivity. These developments are therefore loosely consistent with the sort of response the Bank of England is looking for under its forward guidance regime. There remains some signs that output price inflation in manufacturing is picking up, but not at rates that are particularly concerning for now. Overall the performance of the manufacturing sector is very impressive. One is accustomed to the UK economy being led by the service sector. So to see manufacturing keeping pace with services is very encouraging. James Knightley at ING: The November UK manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index has come in at 58.4, well above the 56.0 consensus and is the strongest reading since February 2011. The employment component was particularly strong, rising to 54.5 from 51.9, leaving the index at a two and a half year high. This suggests that unemployment will continue to fall and supports our view that the unemployment rate will drop below 7% late 2014/early 2015. Furthermore, a robust production number means that the economy is likely to have accelerated in 4Q13 from 3Q13 and with new order rising to a 19 year high this suggests that that output will be robust in early 2014 too. Interestingly, orders from the eurozone are performing strongly. Taking it all together it implies that the UK economy is looking in good shape with interest rate rises looking increasingly probable from early 2015. Rob Wood at Berenberg: Domestic demand was the key pillar of new orders, but export orders also increased solidly, with inflows from Asia, the US and the eurozone. Employment increased at its fastest rate for two and a half years and inventories fell at one of the sharpest rates for three-and-a-half years. Further growth in output is likely. The PMI\u2019s have on the whole overstated UK growth recently, so we would not take this latest figure totally at face value. But it undoubtedly points to above trend growth in manufacturing, which bodes well for Q4 growth. We expect GDP to rise 0.8% quarter on quarter. The UK\u2019s recovery is mostly domestic, driven by very loose monetary policy and declining uncertainty. The UK domestic economy is likely to outpace most of its competitors over the next couple of years so dramatic reductions in the trade deficit seem unlikely. Still, there are positive signs on exports in the surveys. Now the UK\u2019s main export markets are starting to recover \u2013 the eurozone and the US \u2013 trade flows should improve too, which should help stimulate investment even if it does not lead to a lower trade deficit. Back in the UK, Britain's manufacturing sector appears to be booming as it continues to emerge from a deep and prolonged recession. The headline PMI index rose to 58.4 in November, from an upwardly revised 56.5 in October. It was the highest since February 2011. A breakdown of the survey showed new orders jumped to 64.6 - the highest in almost 20 years - from 61.3 in October. Output and employment also jumped sharply. Markit said the strong data suggested growth in British manufacturing will accelerate in the fourth quarter, with output in the sector rising at a faster pace than the 0.9% increase in the third quarter. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit: It also looks as if the strong recovery in the sector is translating into meaningful job creation. Manufacturing employment rose at the fastest pace since May 2011, signalling that companies are currently creating around five thousand jobs per month. My colleague Katie Allen reports in full here. Better news from Italy, where the manufacturing sector was at its strongest in two and a half years in November. The headline PMI from Markit rose to 51.4 from 50.7 in October. Growth in output, orders, and the first rise in employment in two and a half years all contributed to an improved picture. Phil Smith, Markit economist: Latest PMI data showed continued, albeit unspectacular, growth in Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector. Production levels again rose solidly but the trend in new orders remained one of only weak growth, which the data suggested was down to anaemic domestic demand \u2013 new export business rose far more rapidly than overall order inflows. The long-awaited return of job creation in the sector can go some way to addressing this. On a separate note, there was evidence from November\u2019s survey of a scarcity of raw materials leading to supply-chain pressures. More gloomy news from France, which is already on the verge of slipping back into recession. The French manufacturing sector shrank for the 21st successive month in November according to Markit's PMI. Specifically, the index fell to 48.4 from 49.1 in October, the lowest since June. Production and new orders were down, with weak demand both domestically and overseas, and job cuts accelerated in the sector. Overall in the eurozone, the manufacturing PMI edged up to 51.6 in November from 51.3 in October, the highest since June 2011, as stronger performances in countries including Germany and the Netherlands offset a shrinking sector in Greece, Spain and France. Markit begins its raft of manufacturing PMI surveys today with the news that the sector in Spain shrank in November for the first time since July. The PMI fell to 48.6 from 50.9 in October, where anything below 50 signals contraction. Manufacturing was held back by lower orders and output, adding to expectations that Spain's recovery will be slow and weak. One of the worst effected countries by the eurozone crisis, Spain emerged from recession in the third quarter after a long slump which has left more than half of its young people out of work. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, had this to say: The latest PMI survey highlights the current fragility of the Spanish manufacturing sector, with the domestic market the key source of weakness. The only real positive from the November data is a further rise in new export business, but on this occasion export growth was not sufficient to support an increase in total new orders. There was little sign of any inflationary pressure returning and firms lowered their output prices following a marginal increase in October. European investors are not feeling particularly chirpy this morning, with all major indices lower.

Creamy mushroom soup Chinese-style beef steak Bamboo fungus with green vegetables Boiled sea bass Pumpkin cream with sago Pastries Fruits Chinese wine David Cameron is on a three-day trade mission to China, leading a host of British businesses in a bid to improve business ties with the world's second largest economy. Representatives from sectors including engineering and manufacturing, architecture, education, cultural and creative, energy, food and drink, retail, telecoms, and financial services are joining the Prime Minister on the trip, which pushed back the Chancellor's Autumn Statement by a day to Thursday this week. See the full list here. It is a reminder of just how crucial the British government views a strong relationship with China for the future of the UK economy, underlined in Cameron's choice of words during a speech in Beijing on Monday: China's transformation is one of the defining facts of our lifetime. The pace and scale of economic development and urbanisation dwarfs the British industrial revolution of two centuries ago. I see China's rise as an opportunity not just for the people of this country but for Britain and for the world. Britain wants China to realise its dream and I believe we can help each other succeed in the global race. Some in Europe and elsewhere see the world changing and want to shut China off behind a bamboo curtain of trade barriers. Britain wants to tear those trade barriers down. Read our full story here. The Prime Minister's trip follows a similar mission to China by the Chancellor George Osborne in October. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The latest manufacturing data out of China have come in slightly ahead of expectations. The official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index from the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing hit 51.4 in November, where anything above 50 indicates growth. It was unchanged from October's 18-month high, and better than the 51.1 expected. Meanwhile the HSBC/Markit version of the survey came in at 50.8 in November. It was a touch below October's 50.9, but an improvement on an earlier estimate of 50.4 and also better than economists were expecting. Asian markets were fairly undewhelmed by the data.

Plus, of course, there is the Westminster know-how that comes with stints in Downing Street's policy unit during the Thatcher and Major years.</p> <p>As for a public unveiling of the new chairman, what would there be to talk about? Lloyds' management team is stable under the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, whose hiring was Bischoff's best move. And the 79p share price, up from 40p in 2009 via 25p in 2011, reflects investors' confidence that Lloyds can't fail to make good money in a recovering UK economy. The bank, notwithstanding the imminent loss of TSB, remains the biggest player in a UK industry that has not undergone a major post-crisis shake-up to boost competition.</p> <p>Indeed, the biggest open question about Lloyds is one that lies outside the chairman's remit: when will the government choose to sell more of the&#xa0;state's shares? Very soon, one suspects, and it will be no surprise if Chancellor George Osborne says so on Thursday.</p> <h2>Energy prices<br></h2> <p>In a very limited sense, the energy companies can count it a success that the government has fiddled with its green schemes and found a way for average bills to go up by \u00a370 rather than \u00a3120. The \u00a350 difference tends to support what the companies have been saying all along: that their original price rises reflected, to a large degree, the costs of implementing government policies.</p> <p>Yet you won't find any celebration in the share prices of the two UK-listed members of the big six.

      "bodyText": "The last time Lloyds Banking Group appointed a chairman a full round of press interviews was required in which the new arrival (Sir Win Bischoff) was obliged to make ritualistic noises in support of his chief executive (Eric Daniels) that nobody believed anyway. No similar excitements this time. Lord Blackwell's appointment to succeed Bischoff is the stuff of downpage news. The new chairman already sits on Lloyds' board as a non-executive director and could hardly be a less controversial choice. Blackwell's CV may be thin on actual frontline banking experience \u2013 four years as group development director at NatWest from 1997-2000, with 15 years as a management consultant at McKinsey \u2013 but he also served for a decade on the board of Standard Life, mostly when it owned a bank. Plus, of course, there is the Westminster know-how that comes with stints in Downing Street's policy unit during the Thatcher and Major years. As for a public unveiling of the new chairman, what would there be to talk about? Lloyds' management team is stable under the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, whose hiring was Bischoff's best move. And the 79p share price, up from 40p in 2009 via 25p in 2011, reflects investors' confidence that Lloyds can't fail to make good money in a recovering UK economy. The bank, notwithstanding the imminent loss of TSB, remains the biggest player in a UK industry that has not undergone a major post-crisis shake-up to boost competition. Indeed, the biggest open question about Lloyds is one that lies outside the chairman's remit: when will the government choose to sell more of the state's shares? Very soon, one suspects, and it will be no surprise if Chancellor George Osborne says so on Thursday. Energy prices In a very limited sense, the energy companies can count it a success that the government has fiddled with its green schemes and found a way for average bills to go up by \u00a370 rather than \u00a3120. The \u00a350 difference tends to support what the companies have been saying all along: that their original price rises reflected, to a large degree, the costs of implementing government policies. Yet you won't find any celebration in the share prices of the two UK-listed members of the big six. Investors know that political battles over energy are here to stay. Centrica and SSE are down about 15% since Labour committed to a 20-month price freeze if it wins the election in 2015. In a rational world, the competition commission would be summoned to determine, once and for all, whether the big six are a rapacious bunch extracting excessive rents, or whether their profits represent the fair return they need to attract capital and fund investment to keep the lights on. In the real world, we will be treated to the government's competition \"test\", which will almost certainly be too brief to settle the argument. So, if wholesale prices rise, the next scrap over bills won't be far away. Amid the fury, joined-up energy policies are equally hard to spot.",

      "bodyText": "Manufacturers enjoyed a jump in demand that pushed growth to its fastest rate for more than two years and saw the sector take on thousands of new staff last month. New orders were the strongest for almost 20 years and job creation accelerated, according to the Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI survey. Encouragingly for the government's push to rebalance the economy, export orders also picked up. The closely watched report comes as a timely boost to Chancellor George Osborne as he prepares to present his autumn statement plans for growth, spending and taxes on Thursday. The headline activity index rose to 58.4 in November from an upwardly revised 56.5 in October. That was its eighth month above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and was well ahead of the consensus forecast for 56 in a Reuters poll of economists. The news sent the pound to a five-year high against a basket of other major currencies as traders bet an accelerating UK recovery would see interest rates rising sooner than the central bank has been suggesting. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit commented: \"UK manufacturing continued to hit the high notes in November. The Manufacturing PMI struck a fresh two-and-a-half year peak as production and new orders rose at, or close to, 19-year record rates. The sector is on course to beat the 0.9% increase in output seen in the third quarter. \"Sustaining the recovery remains the key and the news here is also positive. The manufacturing expansion remains broad-based by sector, demand from the domestic market continues to surge higher and new export orders are rising at a clip close to October's 32-month high.\" As activity and orders picked up, firms took on new staff at the fastest pace for more than two years. Markit said manufacturers were creating around 5,000 jobs a month across all parts of the sector and all sizes of firms. James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets said the job creation pointed to unemployment falling faster than the Bank of England is predicting. That could see interest rates rising sooner than the central bank has suggested, he said. Policymakers are waiting for unemployment to drop to 7% before they will consider raising borrowing costs from their current record low. Kinghtley said the job creation suggested in manufacturing report \"supports our view that the unemployment rate will drop below 7% late 2014/early 2015\". He also highlighted a robust production reading and strong orders from the eurozone. \"Taking it all together it implies that the UK economy is looking in good shape with interest rate rises looking increasingly probable from early 2015,\" he added. The survey follows forecasts from manufacturers' organisation EEF that the sector will grow faster than the wider economy next year. The group thinks the sector probably contracted by 0.1% this year but will grow 2.7% next year while UK GDP rises 2.4%. The EEF's latest survey suggested firms are more confident about investing and hiring staff over the next year but they feel the export outlook is still uncertain thanks to problems in some emerging markets and sluggish growth in the key market, the eurozone. Economists said the manufacturing report marked a strong start to the monthly trio of PMI surveys from the three main sectors. Tuesday sees the release of the construction report while the closely watched survey from Britain's dominant services sector on Wednesday is expected to show that strong growth continued in November. \"If [the manufacturing PMI] is followed by robust construction and, especially services, surveys, it will look very likely that GDP growth in the fourth quarter could at least match the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter expansion seen in the third quarter,\" said Howard Archer, at IHS Global Insight. \"Much will depend on how well consumer spending performs in the fourth quarter, as there have been some signs that consumers have taken a breather after spending at a robust pace in the third quarter.\"",

      "bodyText": "Manufacturing will grow faster than the overall UK economy next year but much-needed business from overseas markets is looking shakier, according to an industry report published on Monday. The buoyant forecast from UK manufacturers' organisation EEF marks a turnaround for a sector the government has repeatedly championed as an engine for growth, but which has struggled to emerge from recession. News that orders and output are now rising and that UK factories plan to ramp up hiring and investment will be welcomed by George Osborne as he prepares to outline his latest plans to boost the recovery in his autumn statement this week. But EEF's latest survey with accountants BDO showed exports were weaker than expected in recent months on the back of slower growth from some emerging markets and sluggishness in the eurozone, the UK's most important market. EEF chief economist Lee Hopley said: \"Over the course of the year we have seen a definite turnaround in prospects for manufacturing and this looks set to continue into next year. This increased confidence is evident in companies looking to increase their headcount and, most importantly for balanced growth, step up their investment. \"However, uncertainties in the global economy remain and a sustained recovery is not secure. As a result, growth must remain a priority for government over the remainder of this parliament, starting with the autumn statement this week.\" The group, which has 6,000 member companies, says the risk comes from an uncertain export outlook. But it still thinks the sector will grow by 2.7% in 2014 compared with 2.4% for the economy overall. EEF thinks that this year the manufacturing sector will have contracted 0.1% while the wider economy grows 1.4%. While that still puts that manufacturing sector in recession this year, the prediction marks a significant upgrade from the last estimate of a 0.5% decline. The group said that reflected a run of improving news. Its own quarterly survey showed a majority of firms reporting growth in both output and orders, though these measures slipped back from highs seen over the summer. Within the sector, the strongest results came from motor vehicle and electronics companies. A separate report on Monday echoes recent optimism about new jobs being created by the private sector. Business lobby group the CBI says medium-sized businesses are helping to drive the recovery but that the government must do more to help them access finance, find skilled workers and get support to export. Despite accounting for less than 2% of the private sector, medium-sized businesses have created jobs at twice the pace of large companies, the CBI said. They added 185,000 jobs between March 2010 and March 2013, a rise of 4.1%, and now employ 16% of the UK's total workforce. Medium-sized firms, classed as having 50-499 staff and a turnover of \u00a310m-\u00a3100m, have also grown their turnover by 7% \u2013 more than double that of smaller firms and large companies. They now contribute more than \u00a3300bn to the economy, but the lobby group says government support could boost that significantly. \"This hugely positive picture is reflected up and down the country where medium-sized businesses are major local employers, in many cases helping to offset public sector job losses during the downturn,\" said CBI director general John Cridland. \"With better access to a range of growth finance options, improved training and research support, and help to break into new export markets \u2013 these firms could be worth an extra \u00a320bn to our economy by 2020.\"",

      "body": "<p>Manufacturing will grow faster than the overall UK economy next year but much-needed business from overseas markets is looking shakier, according to an industry report published on Monday.</p> <p>The buoyant forecast from UK manufacturers' organisation EEF marks a turnaround for a sector the government has repeatedly championed as an engine for growth, but which has struggled to emerge from recession.</p> <p>News that orders and output are now rising and that UK factories plan to ramp up hiring and investment will be welcomed by George Osborne as he prepares to outline his latest plans to boost the recovery in his autumn statement this week.</p> <p>But EEF's latest survey with accountants BDO showed exports were weaker than expected in recent months on the back of slower growth from some emerging markets and sluggishness in the eurozone, the UK's most important market.</p> <p>EEF chief economist Lee Hopley said: \"Over the course of the year we have seen a definite turnaround in prospects for manufacturing and this looks set to continue into next year. This increased confidence is evident in companies looking to increase their headcount and, most importantly for balanced growth, step up their investment.</p> <p>\"However, uncertainties in the global economy remain and a sustained recovery is not secure. As a result, growth must remain a priority for government over the remainder of this parliament, starting with the autumn statement this week.\"</p> <p>The group, which has 6,000 member companies, says the risk comes from an uncertain export outlook. But it still thinks the sector will grow by 2.7% in 2014 compared with 2.4% for the economy overall. EEF thinks that this year the manufacturing sector will have contracted 0.1% while the wider economy grows 1.4%.</p> <p>While that still puts that manufacturing sector in recession this year, the prediction marks a significant upgrade from the last estimate of a 0.5% decline. The group said that reflected a run of improving news. Its own quarterly survey showed a majority of firms reporting growth in both output and orders, though these measures slipped back from highs seen over the summer. Within the sector, the strongest results came from motor vehicle and electronics companies.</p> <p>A separate report on Monday echoes recent optimism about new jobs being created by the private sector. Business lobby group the CBI says medium-sized businesses are helping to drive the recovery but that the government must do more to help them access finance, find skilled workers and get support to export.</p> <p>Despite accounting for less than 2% of the private sector, medium-sized businesses have created jobs at twice the pace of large companies, the <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">CBI</a> said. They added 185,000 jobs between March 2010 and March 2013, a rise of 4.1%, and now employ 16% of the UK's total workforce.</p> <p>Medium-sized firms, classed as having 50-499 staff and a turnover of \u00a310m-\u00a3100m, have also grown their turnover by 7% \u2013 more than double that of smaller firms and large companies. They now contribute more than \u00a3300bn to the economy, but the lobby group says government support could boost that significantly.</p> <p>\"This hugely positive picture is reflected up and down the country where medium-sized businesses are major local employers, in many cases helping to offset public sector job losses during the downturn,\" said CBI director general John Cridland.</p> <p>\"With better access to a range of growth finance options, improved training and research support, and help to break into new export markets \u2013 these firms could be worth an extra \u00a320bn to our economy by 2020.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Christmas shopping season got off to a bumper start over the weekend, with record takings recorded as a result of last week's American-style \"Black Friday\" promotions, and a further \u00a3450m expected to go through the online tills today, which has been dubbed \"Mega Monday\". John Lewis said its online sales on Friday smashed its previous record for a single day's internet trading by more than 100%, with thousands of orders coming in the middle of the night from customers who preferred shopping to sleeping. The figures suggest that Black Friday, a US retailing gimmick where stores offer big discounts to kickstart the shopping season, could now become a permanent fixture on the UK shopping calendar. Today, the buying frenzy is expected to move up another notch. The first Monday of December, which in recent years has become known as Cyber Monday, or Mega Monday, is the busiest day of the year for online sales, as shoppers order early to ensure pre-Christmas delivery. Nearly half a billion pounds is expected to be spent online on Monday \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a3312,500 every minute \u2013 as more than 7m transactions take place. It is likely to be the busiest day ever for online shopping in the UK, with more than 113m visits to virtual stores as shoppers use their last pay cheque before the big day. Online retailers expect to have raked in more than \u00a31bn between Saturday and Monday night. Jeremy Nicholds, Visa Europe's director of commercial development, said: \"UK consumers' love affair with online shopping will reach its peak on Mega Monday, when we predict that we will process 7.7m transactions \u2013 a 16% rise on last year.\" Total Christmas sales are expected to be a staggering \u00a372.2bn \u2013 or \u00a3351 per person \u2013 an increase of more than 2% on last year, according to the Centre for Retail Research. Of that, one third will be spent online. Catalogue and internet retailer Argos is braced for its busiest online shopping day of the year, and is expecting 3m hits on its website. It is prepared to dispatch 2m packages a day in the runup to Christmas from its 11 regional distribution centres. Last week's Black Friday promotions \u2013 established in the US on the day after Thanksgiving, but new to the UK \u2013 have led to an exceptionally strong start to Christmas spending. John Lewis, the only retailer to give a detailed trading update, said that last week's Black Friday event conclusively signalled the start of Christmas trading. It recorded sales of \u00a3147m for the whole week, up 18.4% on last year and up 31.4% week-on-week. Online trade was up 35.7% on the year and ended 19.4% higher than its previous biggest week. Mark Lewis, online director of John Lewis, said: \"Any doubt over whether UK consumers are interested in Black Friday has been cast aside as record sales were notched up online and via mobile devices for John Lewis. Looking ahead to this week, we predict that today [Sunday] will see customers go online to continue their Christmas shopping.\" Sales from mobile phones rose significantly compared with last year. On Friday mobile orders climbed to more than three times the record for a single day, with huge demand from consumers shopping in the early hours. Between midnight and 8am, sales from mobile devices were up more than fourfold on a normal Friday in November, and breakfast-time buyers \u2013 placing orders between 7am and 8am \u2013 were up 1,340% . Many were buying iPads, televisions and PS4s, with one selling every four seconds in the early hours of Friday morning. In unprecedented scenes, shoppers desperate for bargains caused chaos in Asda stores on Friday as the supermarket \u2013 owned by US group Walmart \u2013 brought the Black Friday experience to Britain. Customers scrambled to snatch cut-price electrical goods after queueing for several hours outside Asda stores around the country. Asda said it had sold out of virtually everything: \"Black Friday exceeded our expectations and was hugely successful. We sold over 11,000 tablets and 12,000 TVs in the first hour.\" But traditional shops and retail centres will not necessarily lose out to the boom in mobile shopping. The rise in the popularity of click-and-collect will see footfall to high streets, retail parks and shopping centres boosted by double digits on Mega Monday, retail expert Springboard has predicted. It expects to see week-on-week footfall increase by 15% across all retail locations on 2 December, and by 2.6% year on year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has been urged to be more honest about the levels of subsidies given to oil and gas producers and the companies who will build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. A parliamentary watchdog argued on Monday that ministers should admit they are already providing \u00a312bn of annual subsidies to fossil fuel operations and windfarms while lining up more support for shale gas and nuclear. The environmental audit committee (EAC) said subsidies to oil and other carbon fuels should be scaled back because of the impact on global warming, and also urged ministers to restate a previous commitment to ending fuel poverty. A report on energy subsidies just published by the committee says the chancellor's autumn statement later this week is an ideal chance to provide a \"clear and comprehensive analysis of energy subsidies in the UK\". The report says such a move would bring much needed transparency and provide a basis for an overdue debate on the rationale and justifications for providing public money to support the energy sector. \"At the Rio+20 [climate change] summit and the G20, the government committed itself to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions,\" said MP Joan Walley, chair of the EAC. \"The government must set a target to reduce subsidies to harmful fossil fuels.\" The lower rate of VAT on domestic and business fuel bills \u2013 5% as opposed to the standard 20% \u2013 is also effectively a hidden subsidy, as are field allowances for North Sea oil and gas despite government claims to the contrary, said the EAC. The committee also believes the public commitment to capacity payments to encourage energy companies to build new gas-fired power stations are a subsidy. But its biggest criticism is over ministers' insistence that the deal agreed by the Treasury and EDF to fund the construction of a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset is not a subsidy. \"New nuclear is being subsidised and the coalition should come clean and admit it,\" said Walley. \"The government cannot escape that clear fact by talking about 'support mechanisms' and 'insurance policies' instead of 'subsidies'.\" The EAC report was informed by a detailed paper on energy subsidies in the UK commissioned by the committee from William Blyth of Oxford Energy Associates, an independent consultancy. Last week Lord Browne, the former BP chief executive and a government adviser, called the Hinkley deal \"very, very expensive\". He said giving more state subsidies to oil and gas than to renewable energy was \"like running both the heating and the air conditioning at the same time\". The EAC is also wary about government moves to switch the ECO energy efficiency scheme from household bills to general taxation and particularly its switch in method for counting those in fuel poverty. Walley said: \"The government is shifting the goalposts on fuel poverty so that official statistics record far fewer households as fuel-poor. The changes to the fuel poverty definition and target, in part being made through amendments to the energy bill, should be stopped unless the government is prepared to make a public commitment to end fuel poverty altogether.\" She added: \"A short-term bid to cut bills must not throw energy and climate change policy off course. \"In the longer term green levies could actually keep bills down if they drive energy efficiency improvements that cut the cost of heating our homes. \"Insulating homes and supporting green technologies is vital to help the fuel-poor and cut the emissions causing climate change.\" Friends of the Earth agreed with the committee's findings. \"MPs are spot on. The only way to tackle the scandal of fuel poverty and rocketing energy bills is through a well-funded programme of insulation and not handouts for oil barons and fracking firms, under a veil of green-bashing,\" said David Powell, FoE's economics campaigner. \"It's astonishing that the chancellor is preparing to slash funding to insulate the homes of the poorest in society, while throwing billions of pounds of tax breaks at oil and gas firms to keep the nation hooked on increasingly costly fossil fuels. \"There are good subsidies, and extremely bad ones \u2013 government funding should be targeted at energy efficiency and renewables and building a low-carbon power system we can all afford.\"",
