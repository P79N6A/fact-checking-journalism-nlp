      "body": "<p>The head of the European Central Bank has warned that the eurozone crisis is far from over, as unemployment in the currency bloc hit a new high in October.</p> <p>\"We have not yet emerged from the crisis,\" Mario Draghi said, predicting that the recovery for most of the eurozone would not begin until the second half of 2013. He urged governments to tighten budgets and implement a banking union to leave behind a \"fairy world\" that led to the financial meltdown three years ago.</p> <p>\"The crisis has shown that we were living in a fairy world,\" he said, citing the unsustainable debts, weak banks and poor policy co-ordination of the past. Speaking at a conference in Paris, Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, echoed his call for reform, saying: \"Banking union seems to us to be the first priority.\"</p> <p>The euro strengthened against the dollar after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/30/eurozone-crisis-german-mps-back-loans-for-greece\" title=\"\">German parliament approved the latest \u20ac44bn (\u00a336bn) bailout for Greece by a large majority</a>, despite growing unease about the cost to taxpayers. It is thought the vote will strengthen Chancellor Angela Merkel, less than a year ahead of federal elections. Despite the criticism of the plan, only 12 members of her conservative-led coalition rejected the package \u2013 less than had been feared by party officials.</p> <p>France's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, hailed the Greek aid deal as a breakthrough. \"It's a turning point for Greece. It's also a turning point for the eurozone because it helps recreate stability and confidence. Greece's fate will no longer be a daily issue.\"</p> <p>But investors said the celebrations should not be overdone. Jason Conibear, trading director of Cambridge Mercantile, said: \"Certainly the Greek bailout is back on track, and the immediate prospect of Eurogeddon has receded. But even if the single currency is not about to come apart at the seams, the eurozone is still stuck in a deep economic funk.\"</p> <p>Another 173,000 people joined the jobless queues in the eurozone in October, pushing the unemployment rate to a record high of 11.7%. There were stark differences between northern and southern European countries, with Austria seeing unemployment of just 4.3% compared with Spain's eye-watering rate of 26.2%. Across the 27 member states of the EU, unemployment also rose, although to a lower 10.7%.</p> <p>Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \"This is extremely bad news \u2013 it is clear that the instability in the eurozone is not going away, which will impact negatively on the UK.\"</p> <p>Young people, in particular, struggled to find work and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/nov/07/euro-debt-crisis-data\" title=\"\">youth unemployment in the eurozone</a> hit 23.9%, up from 21.2% in October last year. There are now 3.6 million people under the age of 25 out of work in the region.

      "bodyText": "The head of the European Central Bank has warned that the eurozone crisis is far from over, as unemployment in the currency bloc hit a new high in October. \"We have not yet emerged from the crisis,\" Mario Draghi said, predicting that the recovery for most of the eurozone would not begin until the second half of 2013. He urged governments to tighten budgets and implement a banking union to leave behind a \"fairy world\" that led to the financial meltdown three years ago. \"The crisis has shown that we were living in a fairy world,\" he said, citing the unsustainable debts, weak banks and poor policy co-ordination of the past. Speaking at a conference in Paris, Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, echoed his call for reform, saying: \"Banking union seems to us to be the first priority.\" The euro strengthened against the dollar after the German parliament approved the latest \u20ac44bn (\u00a336bn) bailout for Greece by a large majority, despite growing unease about the cost to taxpayers. It is thought the vote will strengthen Chancellor Angela Merkel, less than a year ahead of federal elections. Despite the criticism of the plan, only 12 members of her conservative-led coalition rejected the package \u2013 less than had been feared by party officials. France's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, hailed the Greek aid deal as a breakthrough. \"It's a turning point for Greece. It's also a turning point for the eurozone because it helps recreate stability and confidence. Greece's fate will no longer be a daily issue.\" But investors said the celebrations should not be overdone. Jason Conibear, trading director of Cambridge Mercantile, said: \"Certainly the Greek bailout is back on track, and the immediate prospect of Eurogeddon has receded. But even if the single currency is not about to come apart at the seams, the eurozone is still stuck in a deep economic funk.\" Another 173,000 people joined the jobless queues in the eurozone in October, pushing the unemployment rate to a record high of 11.7%. There were stark differences between northern and southern European countries, with Austria seeing unemployment of just 4.3% compared with Spain's eye-watering rate of 26.2%. Across the 27 member states of the EU, unemployment also rose, although to a lower 10.7%. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \"This is extremely bad news \u2013 it is clear that the instability in the eurozone is not going away, which will impact negatively on the UK.\" Young people, in particular, struggled to find work and youth unemployment in the eurozone hit 23.9%, up from 21.2% in October last year. There are now 3.6 million people under the age of 25 out of work in the region. Spain was among the worst hit, with 56% of its young people out of work. Spanish pensioners were also punished on Friday, with news that Madrid has cancelled an inflation-linked rise in pensions this year. This was the last remaining campaign pledge by prime minister Mariano Rajoy yet to be broken.

      "body": "<p>Leading shares recorded their best monthly performance since June despite a last minute wobble, helped by optimism over the eurozone crisis and America's current budget discussions.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 3.48 points lower at 5866.82, but that still made a 1.45% gain for November, its biggest rise since the 4.7% increase six months ago. Investor hopes have been raised by this week's Greek debt deal, although some obstacles still remain, not least the details of a proposed Greek bond repurchasing scheme. Spain's banks saw a \u20ac37bn restructuring package approved by the European Commission, while across the Atlantic there were signs of progress in discussions over the US fiscal cliff, the tax rises and spending cuts due to come into force early next year. A series of positive economic figures, including UK and US GDP figures and an upbeat Chicago purchasing manager's survey, also helped sentiment.</p> <p>Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> It's been a roller coaster ride of a month but in the end the bulls have won hands down by pushing the index to one of its best monthly gains of the year. Buyers have once again pushed us higher as investors rush into equities ahead of December, historically a bullish month for stocks and one that has seen 23 rises out of the past 28 years for the month of December. Investors have rushed into equities in the past few days in the fear that they might miss out on the usual Christmas rally, but it isn't just early festive cheer that's attracting the buyers as the fundamentals have improved too. <br> Things in the eurozone have quietened down since the new debt deal on Greece was agreed and today the German parliament formally approved their aid package. Since then the borrowing costs for some of the more worrisome countries, namely Spain and Italy, have declined and remain well below their recent highs. This has done a great deal to sentiment and allowed indices to gradually continue their rally throughout the week.  There is also ongoing optimism regarding the other elephant in the room, namely the US fiscal cliff, which is expected to be thrashed out and addressed by US politicians before too long, but there's certainly a good proportion of people who'd like to see the discussions concluded sooner rather than later. </blockquote> <p><strong>BP</strong> was in focus ahead of an investor day on Monday. But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/28/epa-suspends-bp-oil-spill?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Wednesday's news that the company had been blocked from seeking new US government contracts because of its \"lack of business integrity\" during the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster</a> was not the ideal backdrop. The ban is only temporary but it is unclear how long it will remain in force. Earlier in November BP agreed with the US government to pay $4.5bn in penalties relating to the 2010 spillage, but this still needs to be finalised by a court.</p> <p>BP's shares edged up 0.55p to 431.6p, and Credit Suisse analysts issued an outperform rating despite cutting their earnings forecasts by 6% to reflect asset sales such as BP's proposed sale of its Russian joint venture stake to Rosneft. The company announced it had completed the $5.5bn sale of a number of fields in the Gulf of Mexico to Texas-based Plains Exploration. Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote> This will be the opportunity for BP to present a long-term outlook in its upstream business for the first time \u2013 current targets only extend to 2014. Since 2010, BP's operational performance has been somewhat overshadowed by the Macondo litigation overhang and turmoil in Russia. BP is making good progress on resolving its strategic uncertainties with the Rosneft agreement announced in October and the Department of Justice settlement on criminal liabilities in November. The \"return to normal\" on the Eastern and Western fronts should allow the market to focus its attention back to BP's upstream strategy. The key for BP will be to convince investors on improving momentum after three years of under-earning in upstream, and on the quality of its [projects] and growth opportunities. </blockquote> <p>Among the retailers, <strong>Kingfisher</strong> closed 1p lower at 278p in the wake of Thursday's disappointing update. It reported a 6% drop in third quarter profits, and warned the outlook was uncertain in both its key markets, with consumer confidence in France hit by uncertainty over the government's budget proposals.</p> <p>A number of analysts cut their recommendations following the figures, with UBS moving from buy to neutral.</p> <p>But <strong>Dixons Retail</strong> jumped 1.73p to 27.49p following news its UK and Ireland businesses were back in profit, although this was offset by continuing problems in Europe. The company said it expected to benefit from the demise of rival Comet.</p> <p>With little corporate news, a number of brokers' notes had a real influence. <strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> jumped 11p to \u00a323.99 and <strong>Croda</strong> climbed 30p to \u00a323.81 as Credit Suisse upgraded both companies, saying:</p> <blockquote> Following third quarter results, we have upgraded Croda from underperform to neutral and Johnson Matthey from neutral to outperform. Both stocks had disappointing guidance and strongly negative share price reactions.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares recorded their best monthly performance since June despite a last minute wobble, helped by optimism over the eurozone crisis and America's current budget discussions. The FTSE 100 finished 3.48 points lower at 5866.82, but that still made a 1.45% gain for November, its biggest rise since the 4.7% increase six months ago. Investor hopes have been raised by this week's Greek debt deal, although some obstacles still remain, not least the details of a proposed Greek bond repurchasing scheme. Spain's banks saw a \u20ac37bn restructuring package approved by the European Commission, while across the Atlantic there were signs of progress in discussions over the US fiscal cliff, the tax rises and spending cuts due to come into force early next year. A series of positive economic figures, including UK and US GDP figures and an upbeat Chicago purchasing manager's survey, also helped sentiment. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: It's been a roller coaster ride of a month but in the end the bulls have won hands down by pushing the index to one of its best monthly gains of the year. Buyers have once again pushed us higher as investors rush into equities ahead of December, historically a bullish month for stocks and one that has seen 23 rises out of the past 28 years for the month of December. Investors have rushed into equities in the past few days in the fear that they might miss out on the usual Christmas rally, but it isn't just early festive cheer that's attracting the buyers as the fundamentals have improved too. Things in the eurozone have quietened down since the new debt deal on Greece was agreed and today the German parliament formally approved their aid package. Since then the borrowing costs for some of the more worrisome countries, namely Spain and Italy, have declined and remain well below their recent highs. This has done a great deal to sentiment and allowed indices to gradually continue their rally throughout the week. There is also ongoing optimism regarding the other elephant in the room, namely the US fiscal cliff, which is expected to be thrashed out and addressed by US politicians before too long, but there's certainly a good proportion of people who'd like to see the discussions concluded sooner rather than later. BP was in focus ahead of an investor day on Monday. But Wednesday's news that the company had been blocked from seeking new US government contracts because of its \"lack of business integrity\" during the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster was not the ideal backdrop. The ban is only temporary but it is unclear how long it will remain in force. Earlier in November BP agreed with the US government to pay $4.5bn in penalties relating to the 2010 spillage, but this still needs to be finalised by a court. BP's shares edged up 0.55p to 431.6p, and Credit Suisse analysts issued an outperform rating despite cutting their earnings forecasts by 6% to reflect asset sales such as BP's proposed sale of its Russian joint venture stake to Rosneft. The company announced it had completed the $5.5bn sale of a number of fields in the Gulf of Mexico to Texas-based Plains Exploration. Credit Suisse said: This will be the opportunity for BP to present a long-term outlook in its upstream business for the first time \u2013 current targets only extend to 2014. Since 2010, BP's operational performance has been somewhat overshadowed by the Macondo litigation overhang and turmoil in Russia. BP is making good progress on resolving its strategic uncertainties with the Rosneft agreement announced in October and the Department of Justice settlement on criminal liabilities in November. The \"return to normal\" on the Eastern and Western fronts should allow the market to focus its attention back to BP's upstream strategy. The key for BP will be to convince investors on improving momentum after three years of under-earning in upstream, and on the quality of its [projects] and growth opportunities. Among the retailers, Kingfisher closed 1p lower at 278p in the wake of Thursday's disappointing update. It reported a 6% drop in third quarter profits, and warned the outlook was uncertain in both its key markets, with consumer confidence in France hit by uncertainty over the government's budget proposals. A number of analysts cut their recommendations following the figures, with UBS moving from buy to neutral. But Dixons Retail jumped 1.73p to 27.49p following news its UK and Ireland businesses were back in profit, although this was offset by continuing problems in Europe. The company said it expected to benefit from the demise of rival Comet. With little corporate news, a number of brokers' notes had a real influence. Johnson Matthey jumped 11p to \u00a323.99 and Croda climbed 30p to \u00a323.81 as Credit Suisse upgraded both companies, saying: Following third quarter results, we have upgraded Croda from underperform to neutral and Johnson Matthey from neutral to outperform. Both stocks had disappointing guidance and strongly negative share price reactions. We felt negative short-term fundamentals were thus fairly reflected in the share price. Intertek, the testing company, added 31p to \u00a330.90 as Berenberg moved from hold to buy. Elsewhere Wood Group slipped 3p to 777p following this week's sale of a 4.4% stake in the energy services business by the Wood family trust. Royal Bank of Scotland lost ground after the collapse of a deal to sell its Indian operations to HSBC. RBS agreed to dispose of its retail and commercial business in the country - which is profitable with 400,000 customers and assets of \u00a3190m - in 2010. But the two sides failed to reach agreement by a Friday deadline. HSBC said: The long stop date of 30 November has been reached without all conditions required to close the transaction being satisfied. HSBC remains committed to pursuing growth in India, a key strategic market for the group, through its existing operations. On the future of the RBS business in India, the bank said: Consistent with the strategy to reduce or exit non-core assets and businesses, [RBS] will begin to wind down its retail and commercial banking business in India, whilst meeting all customer obligations. RBS fell 3.8p to 295.2p while HSBC was 6.1p higher at 637.7p.

It paves the way for Greece to receive \u20ac44bn (\u00a335.6bn) in critical rescue loans, without which the country would face bankruptcy and a possible exit from the single currency zone. The package, which aims to cut the Greek debt load to 124% of national output by 2020, has fuelled speculation among German lawmakers and media that eurozone governments will eventually have to write off much of the Greek debt they hold. German government, as the biggest contributor, acknowledged for the first time this week that the bailout will mean lost federal revenues, starting with a \u20ac730m shortfall next year. During the debate, finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble defended the aid package and said that speculation about a possible writedown could undermine the Greek government's reform drive. \"If we say the debts will be written off (Greece's) willingness to make savings is correspondingly weakened. Such false speculation does not solve the problems,\" he said. \"A Greek bankruptcy could lead to the break-up of the eurozone.\" Frank-Walter Steinmeier, SPD parliamentary leader and their candidate for chancellor, said the deal on the table \"is not a sustainable solution for Greece\" and argued that the government had merely \"bought time\" above all to avoid addressing \"unpleasant truths.\" However, he said his party would back the deal because \"we cannot leave the Greeks in the lurch.\" Finland and the Netherlands are two other eurozone countries which must give parliamentary consent before the funds for Greece are released. According to think tank Open Europe the French parliament will also need to approve the deal but this is likely to be done along with the 2013 budget vote, this means it is very likely to pass. There are also reports that Slovenia will need to accept the deal by 13 December.",

Buyers have once again pushed us higher as investors rush into equities ahead of December, historically a bullish month for stocks and one that has seen 23 rises out of the past 28 years for the month of December. Investors have rushed into equities in the past few days in the fear that they might miss out on the usual Christmas rally, but it isn\u2019t just early festive cheer that\u2019s attracting the buyers as the fundamentals have improved too.</p> <p>Things in the eurozone have quietened down since the new debt deal on Greece was agreed and&#xa0;today&#xa0;the German parliament formally approved their aid package. Since then the borrowing costs for some of the more worrisome countries, namely Spain and Italy, have declined and remain well below their recent highs. This has done a great deal to sentiment and allowed indices to gradually continue their rally throughout the week.</p> <p>There is also ongoing optimism regarding the other elephant in the room, namely the US fiscal cliff, which is expected to be thrashed out and addressed by US politicians before too long, but there\u2019s certainly a good proportion of people who\u2019d like to see the discussions concluded sooner rather than later.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50b8d927b57953a96fb90a03\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-30T16:04:55.301Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spain cancels inflation-linked pensions rise</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Spain's normal move to raise pensions in line with inflation in November will not take place this year.</p> <p>The problem is that inflation at 2.9% is so high that doing so would jeopardise the country's deficit targets.

      "bodyText": "European markets are now closed and, after the excitement earlier in the week as the Greek debt deal was agreed, it's been a comparatively calm day. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has dipped 3.48 points but still recorded its best monthly performance since June \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.06% \u2022 France's Cac has slipped 0.33% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is off 0.5% \u2022 Spain's Ibex has lost 0.49% \u2022 The Athens market is down 0.86% In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 15 points or so, as investors remain edgy about the fiscal cliff discussions (see 17.30 below). And on that note, it's time to close up for the weekend. Thanks for all the comments (even the complaints) and we'll be back next week to follow all the developments as they happen. For those interested in the latest developments in the US budget talks and the fiscal cliff, our colleagues are live blogging here including a speech by President Obama. And we will have a Q&amp;A session on the fiscal cliff here. Markets continue to edge higher despite any lingering uncertainties, withe the FTSE 100 for one set for its best monthly rise since June. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: It\u2019s been a roller coaster ride of a month but in the end the bulls have won hands down by pushing the index to one of its best monthly gains of the year. Buyers have once again pushed us higher as investors rush into equities ahead of December, historically a bullish month for stocks and one that has seen 23 rises out of the past 28 years for the month of December. Investors have rushed into equities in the past few days in the fear that they might miss out on the usual Christmas rally, but it isn\u2019t just early festive cheer that\u2019s attracting the buyers as the fundamentals have improved too. Things in the eurozone have quietened down since the new debt deal on Greece was agreed and today the German parliament formally approved their aid package. Since then the borrowing costs for some of the more worrisome countries, namely Spain and Italy, have declined and remain well below their recent highs. This has done a great deal to sentiment and allowed indices to gradually continue their rally throughout the week. There is also ongoing optimism regarding the other elephant in the room, namely the US fiscal cliff, which is expected to be thrashed out and addressed by US politicians before too long, but there\u2019s certainly a good proportion of people who\u2019d like to see the discussions concluded sooner rather than later. Spain's normal move to raise pensions in line with inflation in November will not take place this year. The problem is that inflation at 2.9% is so high that doing so would jeopardise the country's deficit targets. Instead pensions will be lifted by 1% to 2%, saving around \u20ac3.8bn according to Reuters. This was the last remaining campaign pledge by prime minister Mariano Rajoy yet to be broken, and now it's gone. Labour minister Fatima Banez said: It was a difficult, painful decision because it was the last thing we wanted to do, but we had no other choice. Friday afternoons often offer an unsubstantiated rumour or two, usually involving one of the credit rating agencies. Sure enough, there is some talk that Moody's might be preparing to downgrade the ESM and EFSF eurozone bailout funds. As a caveat, these rumours more likely than not amount to nothing. However Moody's recent downgrade of France's credit rating could well have an impact on the bailout funds, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week: The downgrade of France by Moody's Investors Service will affect the ratings of the euro zone's bailout facilities, although it isn't possible to say immediately what the impact will be, Moody's lead analyst for France said Tuesday. \"France is a key member of the EFSF and the ESM so in that regard [the sovereign downgrade] will affect the ratings of those entities, but I'm unable to speculate on the impact on the rating of those entities,\" [Dietmar] Hornung said. Over in the US, the Chicago purchasing managers index rose from 49.9 to 50.4 in November. Anything over 50 means an expansion of activity, and the November figure is the first time the index has been in positive territory since August. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The outcome is in line with expectations and it shows that activity is slowing regaining some momentum in the fourth quarter. The Chicago survey doesn't show any effect of the disruption of the Hurricane Sandy, unlike the NY Empire and Philly Fed surveys out last week. As for the labour market, the employment index rose almost 5 points to 55.2 in November. The November employment report will be released next Friday. The outcome is very uncertain as job creation could have been heavily affected by the Hurricane Sandy that led to the shut down of some plants in the affected areas. At the time of writing, our best guess is for non-farm payrolls to have increased by 80,000 in November. With the fiscal cliff talks still hanging over investors, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has taken some small comfort from the latest data, adding around 23 points at the moment. Cyprus has agreed on the terms of a bailout package, according to an ECB member. Governing council member Panicos Demetriades said, as reported by Bloomberg: The memorandum has been agreed and the only thing missing is the exact amount which will be discussed at a eurogroup meeting. The main thing is that there is an agreement. That would presumably be Monday's eurogroup meeting. Cyprus was the fourth country after Greece, Ireland and Portugal to request a bailout. There has been some confusion as to when a deal would be reached, but the comments by Demetriades echo what was said yesterday by Cyprus finance minister Vassos Shiarly and reported in this blog. And for those who like pictures of demonstrators, here's a protest yesterday by Cypriot public sector workers. Greece has extended the deadline - again - for its banks to report their delayed financial results. According to the taxheaven.gr website (as reported by Reuters) the government has postponed the results - already delayed from 31 October and then the end of November - to 21 December. This is pending the banks' recapitalisation by the European Union and the IMF, which can only happen on completeion of a buyback of Greek government bonds due by 13 December. The Bundestag isn't the only national parliament which must give its approval before Greece's long-awaited aid tranche is released. My colleague Nadine Schimroszik explains: Finland and the Netherlands are two other euro zone countries who must give parliamentary consent before is needed to unfreeze the funds for Greece. According to think tank Open Europe the French parliament will also need to approve the deal but this is likely to be done in addition to the 2013 budget vote, meaning it is very likely to pass. There are also reports that Slovenia will need to accept the deal by December 13. And on that note I've got to scarper, so Nick Fletcher will take over. Thanks all, and have great weekends. In Athens, unions have held demonstrations today in protest at looming austerity-driven job cuts. Here's a few photos: These two graphs show how eurozone unemployment has been climbing steadily since the financial crisis began: Missed this earlier, but thanks to Reuters.... The parliamentary floor leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats, Michael Grosse-Broemer, said he was happy with the result of the vote, adding: \"Greece must now continue its efforts to reduce its debts and carry out structural reforms.\" And here's a couple more photos from the Bundestag: France's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, has hailed this week's Greek debt deal as a 'turning point'. Speaking at a conference in Paris, Moscovici (perhaps optimistically) reckoned that Greece's problems will no longer be a daily concern for the euro zone, Moscovici declared: It's a turning point for Greece...It's also a turning point for the euro zone because it helps recreate stability and confidence. Greece's fate will no longer be a daily issue. Here's a couple more photos from the conference, at which Christine Lagarde urged action on eurozone banking union (see 9.48am) and Mario Draghi warned that Europe was living in a 'fairy world' regarding imbalances within the region (see 9.20am): Open Europe has the details of the Bundestag vote, confirming that Merkel didn't hold her coalition together. A dozen members of the CDU/CSU alliance (Merkel's party) opposed the Greek plan, along with nine members of the Free Democrats (the junior coalition partners). Reports from the Bundestag that Angela Merkel has missed getting the Chancellor's Majority, meaning the Greek agreement was only approved because opposition MPs voted with the coalition. News agency DPA reported that Merkel was 14 votes shy of the majority, indicating that the support of the SPD and Green Party was crucial. Economists say today's rise in European unemployment shows that the region is mired in a deep downturn. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the eurozone's 11.7% jobless rate was dismal, and might prompt the ECB to cut interest rates next month (especially as inflation has fallen this month (see 11.27am) ). Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics said the data showed that labour market conditions across the eurozone were \"clearly deteriorating\". And Jason Conibear, trading director of Cambridge Mercantile, warned that the weakness of the eurozone economy was being \"swept under the carpet\" amid the focus on whether the single currency will survive: Certainly the Greek bailout is back on track, and the immediate prospect of Eurogeddon has receded. But even if the single currency is not about to come apart at the seams, the Eurozone is still stuck in a deep economic funk. Another gobbet of economic news from this morning \u2013 eurozone inflation has fallen to 2.2%, from 2.5% in October. The fall was driven by lower energy price rises, and also showed that firms are struggling to pass high prices onto cash-strapped consumers. A new opinion poll suggests that the German people are rather unenthusiastic about the Greek aid package (which their elected representatives just approved). A survey conducted for public-service TV station ZDF found that just 43% of people approved of the deal hammered out by eurozone finance ministers on Monday night, while 46% reckoned it would have been better if Greece had been left to default (and 11% weren't sure). The survey also found that 40% of Germans believe a further Greek debt restructuring will be required in future. More details here (with a Google translation into English here) So the deal is approved -- but it's not clear yet whether Angela Merkel secured the Chancellor's Majority. In other words, would the government have won if opposition MPs (such as the SPD and the Greens) had opposed the motion. That won't be clear for a few minutes... The results are in -- and the German parliament has APPROVED the Greek aid package. A total of 584 MPs voted -- 473 voted in favour, and 100 voted against. Eleven MPs abstained. (with thanks to my colleague Nadine Schimroszik) While we wait for the results of the Bundestag vote, here's further evidence that Greece's economy is still contracting \u2013 Greek retail sales tumbled by 12.1% in September, compared with the previous year. That follows a 9.3% decline in August, showing that the slump actually picked up pace. Back in Berlin, voting is underway on the Greek aid deal.... Young people across Europe continue to suffer the brunt of the crisis, with today's data (see 10am onwards) showing the youth jobless rate climbed again. In October 2012, the youth unemployment rate in the eurozone hit 23.9%, up from 21.9% a year ago (and 23.3% last month). There are now 5.678m people under the age of 25 out of work across the EU, with 3.609m in the euro area. Again, the differences between North and South are remarkable (although not surprising) The lowest rates were recorded in Germany (8.1%), Austria (8.5%) and the Netherlands (9.8%)/ The higher were in Greece (57.0% for August 2012) and Spain (55.9%). As ever, the eurozone date unemployment data shows the stark differences across the region; The lowest rates were recorded in Austria (4.3%), Luxembourg (5.1%), Germany (5.4%) and the Netherlands (5.5%), The highest was recorded in Spain (26.2%), followed by Greece (25.4% - although that relates to August 2012). This graph, from the eurostat release, shows more: This latest rise in the eurozone unemployment rate in October, to 11.7%, was caused by another 173,000 people joining the ranks of the jobless last month. That nudged the rate up from September's 11.6% The rate across the wider European Union has also risen, from 10.6% to 10.7%. You can see the full details here (pdf). Just in - the Eurozone unemployment rate has hit a new record high of 11.7% . More to follow. An update on Rainer Br\u00fcderle's speech at the Bundestag (see also 9.30am) -- he appeared to disagree with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's argument that a Greek exit from the eurozone would be a calamity. As Br\u00fcderle put it, Athens is an \"extreme case\" not a precedent. Over in Paris, Christine Lagarde has been discussing the euro crisis at a conference, and declared that full banking union must be the top priority for eurozone leaders. Reuters' Paris bureau has the details: Implementing a banking union with powers to supervise all banks in the euro zone should be the currency bloc's top priority followed by closer budgetary coordination, International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said on Friday. \"Banking union seems to us to be the first priority,\" Lagarde said during a meeting with top financial officials in Paris. The economic situation in the euro zone remained fragile and governments should maintain a \"reasonable\" pace of budgetary consolidation to avoid crimping growth, she added. The eurogroup is due to discuss banking union at its next meeting, next Monday and Tuesday. However, Sweden's finance minister has indicated that there may be little progress: Back to the Bundestag, where Rainer Br\u00fcderle of the right-wing Free Democrats (junior partners in Merkel's coalition) has been speaking. Br\u00fcderle told MPs that Greece was enduring 'absolutely necessary' reforms, adding that the country should be \"a warning to others\" who persevere with a large government and a small private sector. Another quote from Mario Draghi just hit the wires, and it's quite a classic: UPDATE: This snap from the Reuters terminal throws a little more light on it: \u2022 ECB'S DRAGHI - CRISIS HAS SHOWN WE WERE LIVING IN A FAIRY WORLD IN TERMS OF UNDERESTIMATING IMBALANCES Alarming news from Italy - its unemployment rate jumped to 11.1% in October, up from 10.8% the previous month. That's the highest level since January 2004. We get the overall eurozone unemployment data in under an hour's time.... Despite hie criticism (see 8.59am), Frank-Walter Steinmeier confirms that the SPD will vote in favour of the new deal for Greece. He tells the Bundestag that it is an issue of European solidarity. We cannot abandon the Greeks. SPD parliamentary leader Frank-Walter Steinmeier is now speaking in the Bundestag, and criticising the governmnent's handling of the crisis. Steinmeier won applause from his own MPs when he argued that Angela Merkel's administration should have been more explicit about Greece's problems earlier this year. He accuses the government of playing down the crisis for domestic political reasons, adding that it is clear that saving the Greeks will cost much money, including \"our\" money. You can watch the session live on the Bundestag website, by the way - here (it's on Kanal 1). Finally, Sch\u00e4uble warns that Bundestag that a Grexit could not be handled easily, telling MPs that A Greek bankruptcy would lead to the break-up of the eurozone. The long term goal, he argues, is for Greece to pay its own debts again. Sch\u00e4uble's speech got a pretty decent reception, with his CDU party applauding politely on several occasions. Sch\u00e4uble acknowledges that the European Union has been a very good thing for the German people, saying: No country is gaining more from being part of the European Union than Germany. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is also telling the Bundestag that Greece is not being given a free ride \u2013 it will only continue to receive aid if it keeps meeting its commitments. He's also playing down the idea of another haircut on Greek debt in the future --saying the speculation over a Greek debt cut risks fuelling instability in the eurozone. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble* is addressing the Bundestag now. Sch\u00e4uble begins by telling MPs that failure to approve Greece's revised aid package would be a major blow to Europe, and also for the global economy. Often a fierce critic of Greece, Sch\u00e4uble is paying credit to the country's efforts, saying Athens has achieved \"the largest fiscal adjustment in the history of the European Union\" * - earlier than I expected  Silvia Wadhwa, CNBC's eurocrisis expert, reports that German MPs will vote at around 11am local time (10am GMT), with the result due around 30 minutes later. The debate is now underway.... The Bundestag is certain to hear some German MPs warn that their taxpayers will ultimately pay the price of getting Greece out of its debt hole. The SPD, for example, has already concluded that the deal agreed for Greece this week is not robust enough, and simply puts off a future debt restructuring. Carsten Schneider, the SPD's parliamentary budget speaker, warned yesterday that: It is only a matter of time. Already today it is clear that Greece will not be able to pay back its debt. That's via EUObserver, which also reports that 15 members of Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU parliamentary group have already said they will vote No. Just in -- European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has declared that the eurozone will start to recover in the second half of next year, if governments press on with reforming their domestic economies and the eurozone. Speaking to Europe 1 radio, Draghis also reiterated that the ECB will do whatever it takes to protect the euro (a familiar refrain...) Reuters has the details: European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Friday that budgetary consolidation in the euro zone would entail a short-term economic impact but the currency bloc was on track for a recovery in the second half of 2013. Draghi told Europe 1 radio that euro zone governments must push ahead with implementing a banking union which should apply to all banks to avoid fragmenting the sector. Governments must pursue structural reforms to reduce labour market rigidity, notably in France and Italy, he added. Draghi added that France's loss of its AAA rating last week was a \"signal to governments\" to press on with economic reforms, and should be taken seriously. The key to today's Bundestag vote is the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) party. Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the SPD candidate for chancellor in next autumn's elections, has just confirmed that the party will support the adjustments to the Greek aid plan and the decision to hand Athens \u20ac44bn of loans. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. We're watching the Bundestag this morning, where German MPs will be debating and voting on the revised Greek aid package hammered out by the eurozone on Monday night. While the package is likely to be approved, the session will show whether concern over the eurocrisis is bubbling up within the German political system. In particular, will any of Angela Merkel's coalition defect? it should be an interesting debate \u2013 Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is due to speak at 9am GMT (10am Berlin time) 8am GMT, (9am Berlin time) according to my schedule. The other major event this morning is the latest eurozone unemployment data, due at 10am GMT. We're braced for another rise, which would take the jobless rate across the eurozone to a fresh record high. And Greek unions have called a short strike today, starting at 11.30am (9.30am GMT) local time, and a rally outside the Athens parliament. As usual, we'll be tracking all the action through the day.",
