      "bodyText": "Too scared to ask for a pay rise? You\u2019re not alone. There are millions of people who would prefer to walk over hot coals than ask their manager to reward good work with extra cash. Last week a report found that millennials not only failed to claim a larger slice of the wages pie in their current workplace, they also moved job with less frequency, denying themselves the opportunity to negotiate a boost with a new employer. The combined effect is to make millenials much worse off than the previous generation. Across the rest of the working population, the picture is disturbingly similar. The last six or seven years were supposed to be different. There was going to be a quick bounce back from the crash of 2008 offering bumper pay rises all round, quickly pushing up the average wage to new highs. It was this rosy view that encouraged the Bank of England to forecast in every year since 2010 a rise in wages of such force that it said higher interest rates would be needed within two years to calm things down. It never happened. Not even the British \u201cjobs miracle\u201d of the last two years, which has seen the employment rate reach record levels, was able to bring about the expected jump in wages to 4%. Last week MPs asked four Bank policymakers how they could be so wrong year after year. They asked the question after the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee revised down the natural level of unemployment from 5% to 4.5% It is easy to see why they would be perplexed. The level was 7% in 2013 when the current governor Mark Carney arrived and declared that he would need to consider raising interest rates once unemployment dropped to 7%. The thinking behind the policy was that once unemployment hits its natural rate, the labour market will be so tight that workers can almost walk into a job and in their newly confident state, start to bid up their wages. Today unemployment stands at 4.8%, which according to the 5% rule means wages should be starting to soar, but under the revised 4.5% target, it is reasonable to expect wages to inch forward at best. MPs on the treasury select committee were more concerned with who among the Bank\u2019s policymakers had voted to downgrade the target than why it had happened. This was a huge let-off for an institution that has persistently mis-read one of the most fundamental aspects of the economy. Yet it would be churlish not to recognise that it has become a difficult nut to crack. The pace of change in the labour market has proved as alarming to those who want to measure it as those who must cope with its effects. If one thing is clear, it is that large groups of people are breaking the old rules. A report that underscores how much the \u201cget a career and push your way up the ladder until retirement\u201d style of work has lost its allure can be found in a report by the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research (NIESR) and the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation into the state of the health service. The report\u2019s authors wanted to know what drove nurses and doctors to join agencies, presuming it was simply a case of higher pay. But the researchers found that agency workers in the NHS had similar pay. What they found interesting was that agency workers felt better off because they had escaped the internal politics, the bureaucracy and the stricture of rotas that rarely matched the demands of home. As agency workers they believed they had more control over their lives and put up with less bullying from their employer. This search for a better work life balance is not new, but now seems to have profound effects on the job market. For instance, the Conservative Party MP Maria Miller warned last week that men also suffer from a lack of family support, as she unveiled an analysis by the parliamentary women and equalities committee of the government\u2019s stance on closing the gender pay gap. She said men were increasingly likely to follow women into low paid part-time work and jobs well below their qualifications in order to spend more time with their children. She warned this would be bad for families and the nation, as people retreated from workplaces that failed to recognise that workers had broader concerns. Going back to the millenials, it is not difficult to see they fit into several camps rather than one avaricious mass of people in search of higher pay at all costs. Alongside the office worker who hopes to be a manager someday, there are the gig economy workers developing apps, possibly earning very little in the hope of a stellar payout in the future. There are the Deliveroo and Uber drivers and the care workers stuck on the minimum wage. James Hick, a senior director at the recruitment agency Manpower, says the millennials\u2019 predecessors \u2013 generations X and Y \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t look at life as previous generations did\u201d and are more likely to choose a greater degree of control over more pay. Some people can afford to opt for a better lifestyle because they live in a cheaper part of the country or benefit from family wealth that has paid for all or some of their home. Equally, they could be weighed down by student debts and feel insecure about their prospects, especially if they lack skills that are in demand, says Kevin Green, the head of the Recuitment &amp; Employment Confederation. The rise of self employment is another trend that proves the workforce is fractured into several camps and is as much about workers driving down their tax bill to make up for lost wage rises as it suggests a wave of entrepreneurialism. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, told MPs he had come to realise his analysis would need to change in order to better map the ebb and flow of an increasingly splintered working population. Haldane has always erred on the side of caution when predicting strong wages growth, unlike his colleagues who appear to believe it will come back simply because it always has. Yet still the Bank\u2019s collective view is that wage rises will return to 3.5% in the next 18 months. Maybe an exodus of foreign workers will prove positive for wages. In the year to September 2016 the UK created 500,000 jobs and almost half went to foreign born workers. Manpower\u2019s Hick is in no doubt this has influenced wages at the bottom end of the pay scale. The latest migration figures show many are returning to their home countries. Maybe skill shortages will get worse and pay will rise. Yet that seems unlikely when so many employers appear to prefer keeping a job unfilled than train someone and pay them a decent wage. The use of cheap foreign workers is a habit they will find it hard to shake off.",

    "webTitle": "Windfarms aren\u2019t the real reason energy bills are rising. Blame the free market", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last week, photographs of wind turbines were once again juxtaposed with headlines about rising energy prices. The cause on this occasion was no less pre-eminent a body than a Lords committee, comprising former chancellor Norman Lamont and other heavyweight peers. \u201cTo reduce carbon emissions, governments have subsidised renewables, passing on the cost to consumers in their electricity bills. The average domestic electricity bill was 58% higher in 2016 than it was in 2003,\u201d the economic affairs committee said in its report on energy policy. Anyone reading it would have been forgiven for directing their anger at windfarms when increases in their energy bills land, as half of the big six energy suppliers are planning. Yet the peers\u2019 report admits that \u201crising international prices for fossil fuels\u201d were the main driver for energy bills going up over the period. Renewable energy subsidies on bills \u2013 the \u201cgreen crap\u201d, as former PM David Cameron reportedly called them \u2013 do add a cost. But it\u2019s small, at 10% of an average dual-fuel bill, as the peers themselves note. The blame for the latest round of price rises announced by energy suppliers, big and small, does not lie primarily with wind turbines and solar panels. Energy regulator Ofgem was clear about that in front of MPs last week and in its analysis last month. Even First Utility, one of the so-called challenger suppliers meant to be bringing down prices, said on Friday it was raising annual bills by \u00a3105.60 for 117,000 of its 900,000 customers from 1 April. Wholesale electricity and gas prices were up 42% year on year, it said, while the cost of renewable subsidies was up 25%. Yet there is no sign ministers want to get involved in the messy business of capping prices, which some are calling for. Theresa May and business secretary Greg Clark have both expressed concern for billpayers. But as Iain Conn, the chief executive of British Gas\u2019s parent company, Centrica, said last week when his company reported a 4% rise in profits: \u201cThe government aren\u2019t sure they need to intervene.\u201d So where does that leave efforts to protect householders and industry from rising energy bills? Policies to improve energy efficiency \u2013 the boring but important business of installing wall insulation and fitting new boilers to bring down bills \u2013 have been axed or left on a dusty shelf in Whitehall. The government has no power to manage wholesale electricity and gas prices, inside or out of the EU. We are, as one energy industry chief said recently, \u201coverexposed to global markets over which we have no control\u201d. Which leaves us with nuclear power and renewables as tools to insulate Britain from the whims of wholesale fossil fuel prices. Nuclear is good at providing a lot of power; Hinkley Point C and Moorside in Cumbria, two of the hoped-for arrivals in a fleet of new atomic plants, would alone provide some 14% of the UK\u2019s electricity. But new nuclear is not cheap and it is not guaranteed to happen. \u201cMost of our witnesses disagreed that the [Hinkley] project provided value for money,\u201d said the Lords economic affairs committee. Its chair, Lord Hollick, believes that the economic justifications for Moorside and Hinkley are hanging in the balance. So we come back to the \u201cgreen crap\u201d. At some point the political narrative and public discourse needs to turn 180 degrees: from blaming renewables for rising energy prices to viewing renewables as our saviour from them. The cost of solar power has dropped 80% in the last five years, according to the leading energy authority, the International Energy Agency. Even offshore wind, the priciest renewable source, has come down by a third in the past three years. Yes, these things add costs to managing the power grid. But as an authoritative report found last week, they\u2019ll be modest even if use of renewables such as wind and solar doubles from 15% today to 30%. Hopefully, by that point, the headline next to the windfarm photo will tell a different story. Rightmove\u2019s hold on internet house adverts looks rock solid Everyone appears to be winning from the housing market apart from the people actually buying or renting a property. Bovis Homes last week announced that it was having to pay out \u00a37m to customers who had moved into shoddy homes, but it still managed to increase revenues by 11% to more than \u00a31bn. However, it was Rightmove\u2019s numbers that really caught the eye. The online property portal reported 2016 revenues up 15% to \u00a3220m \u2013 and pre-tax profits up nearly a fifth to \u00a3162m. That is a margin of 74%. By contrast, Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, made the same pre-tax profit last year \u2013 on sales of more than \u00a348bn. Extraordinarily, Britons spent nearly one billion minutes every month looking at property on the website last year. That is some 15 minutes per person, including large swaths of the population who are just dreaming \u2013 with no plan to buy or rent a house. Rightmove has built a hugely dominant position in the housing market. One million residential properties are now advertised on the site \u2013 a third more than any rival. Its profit margin is unsurprising given what Rightmove actually does \u2013 it just runs a website used by estate agents to advertise the homes on their books.

      "body": "<p>Last week, photographs of wind turbines were once again juxtaposed with headlines about rising energy prices. The cause on this occasion was no less pre-eminent a body than a Lords committee, comprising former chancellor Norman Lamont and other heavyweight peers.</p> <p>\u201cTo reduce carbon emissions, governments have subsidised renewables, passing on the cost to consumers in their electricity bills. The average domestic electricity bill was 58% higher in 2016 than it was in 2003,\u201d the economic affairs committee said in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/24/low-carbon-policy-less-vital-than-low-energy-bills-and-security\">report on energy policy</a>.</p> <p>Anyone reading it would have been forgiven for directing their anger at windfarms when increases in their energy bills land, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/10/scottish-power-customers-to-be-hit-by-78-price-hike\">as half of the big six energy suppliers are planning</a>.</p> <p>Yet the peers\u2019 report admits that \u201crising international prices for fossil fuels\u201d were the main driver for energy bills going up over the period. Renewable energy subsidies on bills \u2013 the \u201cgreen crap\u201d, as former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/21/david-cameron-green-crap-comments-storm\">PM David Cameron reportedly called them</a> \u2013 do add a cost. But it\u2019s small, at 10% of an average dual-fuel bill, as the peers themselves note.</p> <p>The blame for the latest round of price rises announced by energy suppliers, big and small, does not lie primarily with wind turbines and solar panels. Energy regulator Ofgem was clear about that in front of MPs last week and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/19/big-six-energy-suppliers-warned-rising-prices-ofgem\">its analysis last month</a>.</p> <p>Even First Utility, one of the so-called challenger suppliers meant to be bringing down prices, said on Friday it was raising annual bills by \u00a3105.60 for 117,000 of its 900,000 customers from 1 April. Wholesale electricity and gas prices were up 42% year on year, it said, while the cost of renewable subsidies was up 25%.</p> <p>Yet there is no sign ministers want to get involved in the messy business of capping prices, which some are calling for. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed\">Theresa May</a> and business secretary <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/greg-clark-speech-at-energy-uk\">Greg Clark</a> have both expressed concern for billpayers. But as Iain Conn, the chief executive of British Gas\u2019s parent company, Centrica, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/23/british-gas-standard-tariffs-not-evil-empire-centrica-chief-executive-iain-conn\">said last week when his company reported a 4% rise in profits</a>: \u201cThe government aren\u2019t sure they need to intervene.\u201d</p> <p>So where does that leave efforts to protect householders and industry from rising energy bills? Policies to improve energy efficiency \u2013 the boring but important business of installing wall insulation and fitting new boilers to bring down bills \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/23/uk-ceases-financing-of-green-deal\">have been axed</a> or left on a dusty shelf in Whitehall.</p> <p>The government has no power to manage wholesale electricity and gas prices, inside or out of the EU. We are, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/12/uk-offshore-wind-will-lower-energy-bills-more-than-nuclear\">one energy industry chief said recently</a>, \u201coverexposed to global markets over which we have no control\u201d.</p> <p>Which leaves us with nuclear power and renewables as tools to insulate Britain from the whims of wholesale fossil fuel prices. Nuclear is good at providing a lot of power; Hinkley Point C and Moorside in Cumbria, two of the hoped-for arrivals in a fleet of new atomic plants, would alone provide some 14% of the UK\u2019s electricity.</p> <p>But new nuclear is not cheap and it is not guaranteed to happen. \u201cMost of our witnesses disagreed that the [Hinkley] project provided value for money,\u201d said the Lords economic affairs committee. Its chair, Lord Hollick, believes that the economic justifications for Moorside and Hinkley are hanging in the balance.</p> <p>So we come back to the \u201cgreen crap\u201d. At some point the political narrative and public discourse needs to turn 180 degrees: from blaming renewables for rising energy prices to viewing renewables as our saviour from them.</p> <p>The cost of solar power has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year\">dropped 80% in the last five years</a>, according to the leading energy authority, the International Energy Agency. Even offshore wind, the priciest renewable source, <a href=\"https://ore.catapult.org.uk/our-knowledge-areas/knowledge-standards/knowledge-standards-projects/cost-reduction-monitoring-framework/\">has come down by a third in the past three years</a>.</p> <p>Yes, these things add costs to managing the power grid. But as <a href=\"http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/asset/A090E0B7-13B5-45E0-96B18A6E8AC8ED74/\">an authoritative report found last week</a>, they\u2019ll be modest even if use of renewables such as wind and solar doubles from 15% today to 30%. Hopefully, by that point, the headline next to the windfarm photo will tell a different story.</p> <h2>Rightmove\u2019s hold on internet house adverts looks rock solid</h2> <p>Everyone appears to be winning from the housing market apart from the people actually buying or renting a property. Bovis Homes last week announced that it was having to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/20/bovis-to-pay-7m-to-compensate-customers-angry-at-poorly-built-homes\">pay out \u00a37m to customers who had moved into shoddy homes</a>, but it still managed to increase revenues by 11% to more than \u00a31bn.</p> <p>However, it was Rightmove\u2019s numbers that really caught the eye. The online property portal reported 2016 revenues up 15% to \u00a3220m \u2013 and pre-tax profits up nearly a fifth to \u00a3162m. That is a margin of 74%. By contrast, Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, made the same pre-tax profit last year \u2013 on sales of more than \u00a348bn.</p> <p>Extraordinarily, Britons spent nearly one billion minutes <em>every month</em> looking at property on the website last year. That is some 15 minutes per person, including large swaths of the population who are just dreaming \u2013 with no plan to buy or rent a house. Rightmove has built a hugely dominant position in the housing market. One million residential properties are now advertised on the site \u2013 a third more than any rival.</p> <p>Its profit margin is unsurprising given what Rightmove actually does \u2013 it just runs a website used by estate agents to advertise the homes on their books. It is the equivalent of owning the only big shopping centre in Britain, where each shop pays rent and also pays for its own maintenance and security.
