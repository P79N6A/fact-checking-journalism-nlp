      "bodyText": "And finally, the US stock market has closed....after recovering from its lows. Shares scrambled back after White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Donald Trump\u2019s plan could include carve-outs for Mexico and Canada. So the Dow ended down 80 points, the S&amp;P is flat and the Nasdaq gained 0.4% as Facebook and Alphabet rose 2.2% and 1.3%. Tomorrow Trump may actually release full details of his tariffs. See you then! GW Here\u2019s our news story on Europe\u2019s move on tariffs: The European Union has responded to Donald Trump\u2019s threat of a trade war by warning that it will retaliate with tariffs on a range of US imports including peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. Reacting to the threat from the US president of 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on aluminium, European commissioner for trade Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said on Wednesday the EU was finalising its own list of American exports that could face sanctions, including steel, industrial and agricultural products. However, Malmstr\u00f6m also said the EU still hoped to avoid a full blown trade war, despite the escalating rhetoric between the US and its main global trading partners in recent days. \u201cA trade war has no winners and if it does not happen for the better, then we can work with our American friends and other allies on the core issue of this problem, overcapacity,\u201d she told reporters at a press conference in Brussels. \u201cBut if it does happen we will have to take measures to protect European jobs.\u201d More here: No sign of a recovery on Wall Street yet. The Dow is still down 1%. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has denied acting improperly after selling $31m shares in a company dependent on steel imports. Icahn, a former special advisor to president Trump, insists that he had no knowledge of the plan to impose tariffs. In a statement, Icahn Enterprises says: \u201cWe don\u2019t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.\u201d Despite all these trade war worries, the UK stock market has ended the day a little higher. That\u2019s partly thanks to Rolls-Royce, which jumped after beating profit forecasts and promising more cost savings. Time for a quick recap, for any readers just tuning in. Europe has ratcheted up the pressure on Donald Trump over steel tariffs, by drawing up a list of US goods which could be hit with retaliatory action. Peanut butter, orange juice, bourbon and cranberries are all included, along with an unspecified range of industrial and steel products. Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said Brussels hopes that Trump will not impose blanket tariffs on steel imports into America. But if he does, the EC will take proportionate action. Malmstrom told reporters in Brussels that: We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in Nato, can be a threat to international security in the US.... It is alarming that the US would invoke this article from 1962, to introduce trade restrictions that will mainly impact traditional allies of the United States. President Trump, though, is not backing down. He\u2019s tweeted that America has suffered from bad policies and bad leadership for too long. US Steel has given Trump some good news. It\u2019s re-opening a steel furnace in Illinois and getting hundreds of staff back to work. A group of countries, including China, have raised concerns about Trump\u2019s planned tariffs to the World Trade Organisation. They fear that tit-for-tat retaliations could break out. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, has pledged that America will work constructively with its allies. We won\u2019t \u2018blow up the world\u2019, he says (something administrations don\u2019t usually have to spell out). The US stock market has fallen in early trading. Investors are concerned that the resignation of Gary Cohn as Trump\u2019s top economic advisor raises the risk of a trade war. White House advisor Peter Navarro has just told Bloomberg TV that he\u2019s not on the list to replace Gary Cohn. Navarro, a confirmed sceptic on free trade, says there is a \u201cdeep bench\u201d at the White House. He also claims that metal tariffs are good for the US economy, and will strengthen national security. Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital of New Jersey, reckons Wall Street is anxious about the prospect of a trade war. He says (via Reuters): \u201cIt\u2019s more of the same jitters we had seen recently, with investors in this case fearing that a lack of confidence in the tariffs by Trump\u2019s own people. Investors are taking risk off the table to see how much more damage in the administration this will cause.\u201d After that early slide the Dow has stabilised, now down 170 points (or 0.7%). Equipment and machinery giant Caterpillar is the biggest faller, down 1.5%. Demand for its trucks and diggers would fall if the global economy was hit by a trade war. Aircraft maker Boeing are down 1% -- steel tariffs could push up the cost of making new planes. Financial stocks are also in the red, with Goldman Sachs down 1.3%. DING DING! Wall Street has opened for trading, and the US stock market is taking a leg downwards. The Dow Jones industrial average shed more than 300 points at the open, a drop of 1.2%. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are also in the red, as investors get their first chance to respond to Gary Cohn\u2019s resignation last night. Cohn\u2019s resignation is \u201cdominating proceedings early doors\u201d, says Lawrence Mills of Finsa Markets. The news that Europe is drawing up a list of US goods to target, if Washington doesn\u2019t back down over steel tariffs, is also casting a shadow over the New York stock exchange. Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has pledged that the US won\u2019t blow the world up in its attempt to tackle trade imbalances. I guess that\u2019s reassuring..... CNBC has the details: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Wednesday that President Donald Trump has indicated a degree of flexibility on tariffs for Canada and Mexico. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to blow up the world. There\u2019s no intention of that,\u201d Ross said in an interview with CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cThe president indicated the other day he has a willingness to provide an exemption to Canada and Mexico.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for a trade war. We\u2019re going to have very sensible relations with our allies,\u201d Ross added. \u201cWe hope and we believe that at the end of the day, there will be a process of working with the other countries that are our friends.\u201d The jump in America\u2019s trade deficit will add fuel President Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric, says Capital Economics. They add: Exports fell by 1.3% month-on-month in January, driven by a drop in goods exports, while imports were basically unchanged. In real terms, goods exports fell by 3.3%, compared to a 1.6% decline in real goods imports. Barring a big rebound in February and March, it therefore looks very likely that net trade will subtract from first quarter GDP growth, albeit by much less than the huge 1.1 percentage point drag seen in the fourth quarter. Just in: America\u2019s trade deficit has swelled to its widest level in almost a decade. The Commerce Department reports that the trade gap jumped by 5% in January to $56.6bn. That\u2019s more than expected. The deficit with China has widened particularly sharply -- up 16% year-on-year to $36bn. Newsflash: US Steel has announced that it is reopening some operations at its site in Granite City, in Illinois - and giving Donald Trump the credit. The company will dust off one of two blast furnaces (\u201cB\u201d blast furnace) and the steelmaking facilities at the site, and call back around 500 workers. CEO David Burritt says he\u2019s responding to the president\u2019s plan to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports: In a statement that will be welcomed by the White House, Burritt says the US has suffered from steel dumping: Our Granite City Works facility and employees, as well as the surrounding community, have suffered too long from the unending waves of unfairly traded steel products that have flooded U.S. markets The Section 232 action announced by President Trump last week recognizes the significant threat steel imports pose to our national and economic security. The President\u2019s strong leadership is needed to begin to level the playing field so companies like ours can compete, win and create jobs that support our employees and the communities in which we operate as well as strengthen our national and economic security. We will continue to support our customers with the high-quality products they have come to expect from U. S. Steel.\u201d Burritt has also been speaking on CNBC, saying he sees a \u201crenaissance\u201d in America\u2019s steel industry. The US stock market is still on track to fall when trading begins at 9.30am New York time (2.30pm in the UK). The Dow is being called down 250 points, or around 1%. Breaking: Some blisteringly hot US jobs figures just landed. Private sector companies across America created 235,000 new jobs in February, smashing forecasts for 195,000. That indicates the US labor market remains strong (which is what you want if you\u2019re starting a trade war). It may also be a sign that Friday\u2019s US jobs report (Non-Farm Payroll) will be better than expected. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s, says: \u201cThe job market is red hot and threatens to overheat. With government spending increases and tax cuts, growth is set to accelerate.\u201d The threat of new tariffs on US goods being sold into Europe hasn\u2019t forced President Trump to back down. He\u2019s tweeted a defence of his \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 policy: Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on Europe\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on a range of US goods if Donald Trump presses on with steel and aluminium tariffs: The European Union warned Wednesday that it is ready to retaliate against the U.S. over President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, with counter-measures against iconic U.S. products like Harley Davidson motorcycles, Levi\u2019s jeans and bourbon. Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said that the EU, the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc, rejects Trump\u2019s reasoning that the tariffs are backed by international legal right to protect national security. Should tariffs be introduced, the EU and other partners would take the case to the World Trade Organization, she said. \u201cWe cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in NATO, can be a threat to international security in the U.S.,\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m told reporters in Brussels. \u201cFrom what we understand, the motivation of the U.S. is an economic safeguard measure in disguise, not a national security measure.\u201d Trump has long railed against what he deems unfair trade practices by China and others, and last week declared that his government would levy penalties of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum imports. The tariffs, he said, would remain for \u201ca long period of time,\u201d but it was not clear if certain trading partners would be exempt. Malmstr\u00f6m said Trump\u2019s motives do not appear compatible with WTO rules and that this means the EU can activate safeguards to protect its own markets. She confirmed that the EU\u2019s counter-measures would include tariffs on U.S. steel and agricultural products, as well as other products like bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said that Harley Davidson motorcycles and Levi\u2019s jeans could also be hit. The list is being circulated among EU member states for approval. The Commission also has plans in case steel from other producers is dumped on European markets. European Council president Donald Tusk has just weighed in on the issue, saying Donald Trump is wrong over trade wars: Tusk was speaking as the EU outlined its draft offer to Britain for trade after Brexit. He has ruled out giving the UK a \u2018pick and mix\u2019 approach to access to Europe\u2019s markets. More details in our Politics Live blog: Newsflash: The World Trade Organisation has just revealed that 18 member states, led by China, have raised concerns over America\u2019s steel and aluminium tariffs: Reuters has snapped the details: CHINA SPARKS WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION DEBATE OVER U.S. TARIFFS, 17 OTHER WTO MEMBERS ALSO EXPRESS STRONG CONCERNS - WTO SPOKESMAN WTO MEMBERS SPEAKING OUT OVER U.S. TARIFF PLAN INCLUDED EU, CANADA, TURKEY, RUSSIA, AUSTRALIA, SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, MEXICO, INDIA AND BRAZIL MANY WTO MEMBERS EXPRESSED BOTH COMMERCIAL AND SYSTEMIC CONCERNS ABOUT U.S. TARIFFS PLAN AND SAID THEY FEARED TIT-FOR-TAT TRADE ACTIONS - WTO SPOKESMAN Q: How quickly could the EC implement these countermeasure against the US? Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m says that Europe can bring a complaint to the WTO quite quickly. Implementing rebalancing measures (tariffs on American goods) would take more time, she says, perhaps two months. But the EC could hold back from counter-measures to see how things develop, as it still hopes that the US government won\u2019t impose blanket tariffs that hurt European companies. That\u2019s the end of the briefing. Q: Isn\u2019t there a risk that Europe\u2019s measures could be found illegal, and could annoy allies around the world? Cecilia Malmstrom says the Commission is taking very serious legal advice, to make sure that any countermeasures it takes against America over steel tariffs are fully legal. The EC is also talking to major steel producers, as we don\u2019t want them to be hurt, she adds. Cecilia Malmstrom repeats that the list of US products which could face tariffs in Europe is still provisional. Changes could be made, and the final list will be made public very soon. Q: By singling out American peanut butter, orange juice and bourbon, aren\u2019t you escalating the situation rather than trying to turn the volume down? We are eager not to escalate this, Malmstrom insists, adding: We do not want this to go out of proportion. But the EU wants to have \u201crebalancing\u201d measure ready, in case necessary. We cannot just stay silent when such a major measure could be taken to the EU economy. Q: Might these proposed tariffs on US products break WTO rules, and are member states on side? Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m says the EC is very confident that its proposed actions are compatible with World Trade Organisation rules, and that there is \u201cvery close co-operation with member states\u201d on this issue. Q: Are you confident that the talk of trade wars coming out of the White House will end after the special election in Pennsylvania, where there are many steel workers? Your guess is as good as mine, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m replies. But she notes that Trump did promise to take action on tariffs during his race to the White House. I hope it will not happen, as a trade war has no winners, she adds. But if it does happen, action must be taken to protect European companies and workers. Q: What US products might be hit by the tariffs being drawn up by the EU? Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m says that a provisional list has been drawn up. It is being shared with EU member states now, and will be published soon. The list includes steel products, industrial products, and agricultural products, she tells reporters in Brussels, adding: Certain types of bourbon are on the list, as are other items such peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, etc. Very soon that list will be public, so you will be able to plan your whisky drinking. Onto questions... Q: What do you think about Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the EU is unfair over trade, and his threat to impose tariffs on EU cars? Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m insists that there are \u201conly losers\u201d in a trade war, so Europe will respond in a proportionate and balanced way. Two million cars are produced in the US by EU manufacturers, Malmstr\u00f6m says, creating jobs and US exports. She concedes that the EU has higher tariffs on cars than America, but on the other hand the US has higher tariffs on trucks. The European Commission has been holding intensive talks with officials in Washington for a very long time, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m continues, in the hope of getting the US to rethink its tariffs. Europe still hopes that it will be excluded from the tariffs, she continues. We have made clear that if a move is taken, it will hurt the European Union and put thousands of jobs at risk - and will be met with a firm response. EU Commissioners have decided a three-pronged response, she says: The EU will prosecute its rights under the WTO It is preparing safeguards in case steel is dumped in Europe in response to America\u2019s tariffs New measures on US exports into Europe to match the losses suffered by EU exporters But Europe is still hoping that the US will not impose tariffs, so this retaliatory action can be avoided. Over in Brussels, European Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m has warned that trans-Atlantic relations could be damaged by the looming tariffs on steel and aluminium. Malmstr\u00f6m is speaking in Brussels now, outlining the European Union\u2019s response to Donald Trump\u2019s plans following a \u2018college meeting\u2019 of EU commissioners this morning. Malmstr\u00f6m (who is sporting a natty leather jacket) says \u201cevents in the US are moving quickly\u201d. Malmstr\u00f6m explains that Donald Trump may, in the coming days, sign off a decision to impose 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium imports under the section 232 review of national security. We have \u201cserious doubt\u201d that this can be justified on national security grounds, she says. We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in Nato, can be a threat to international security in the US. We find that assumption \u201cdeeply unjust\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m continues: It is alarming that the US would invoke this article from 1962, to introduce trade restrictions that will mainly impact traditional allies of the United States. We also have serious doubts about whether it is compatible with the WTO rules, Malmstr\u00f6m continues. And in a clear warning to the White House, she warns that these tariffs \u201cwould be damaging to trans-Atlantic relations...and potentially to a global rules-based trading system.\u201d It\u2019s almost 6am in New York, so early bird financial workers will be heading to their desks soon (perhaps via the coffee shop and the gym). And when they get to work, traders are likely to be hitting the sell button as they react to the latest turmoil at the White House. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently called down 330 points (-1.4%), with losses likely on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq too. Uh oh... Veteran City expert George Magnus isn\u2019t impressed by the frontrunners to become Donald Trump\u2019s new chief economic advisor: Patrick Chovanec, managing director of Silvercrest Asset Management, suggests a certain sort of candidate will be needed.... City traders are also fretting about Brexit, as well as trade. The pound has fallen 0.3% to a three-month low against the euro this morning, slipping to \u20ac1.116 for the first time since late November. That means one euro is worth 89.6p. The EU is due to release its draft guidelines for the upcoming trade talks between Brussels and London later today. That will show whether the two sides are converging, following Theresa May\u2019s speech on Brexit last week. MPs have piled on the pressure, warning that UK trade could \u2018fall off a cliff\u2019 unless EU trade agreements with some 70 countries are rolled over soon. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: European politicians have been alarmed, and disappointed, to learn of Gary Cohn\u2019s resignation. German economy minister Brigitte Zypries has warned that the situation over tariffs is serious, adding: \u201cI hope Trump reconsiders. Trade promotes prosperity if it\u2019s based on exchange, on working together.\u201d The European Commission is set to review possible countermeasures which it could launch against the US later today, if tariffs on steel and aluminium are imposed. US-made jeans, bourbon and motorbikes are all in the firing line. European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis has already warned that the EU won\u2019t stand idly by, saying: \u201cWe hope that eventually this initiative from the U.S. side will not be followed through... But it\u2019s also clear that the EU is going to react if these one-sided tariffs are going to be imposed by the U.S.\u201d Back in the UK, house price growth has slowed to a five-year low. The Halifax bank has reported that average house prices increased by 1.8% in the three months to February compared with the same period of 2017. That\u2019s the weakest annual growth since March 2013, down from 2.2% in January. It will fuel concerns that consumer confidence is weak, with the threat of rising interest rates also deterring borrowers. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says she\u2019s very worried by the threat of a global trade war. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, she warns that it\u2019s very easy to start these wars, and quite difficult to finish them. When a president drives his top economic advisor to resign, it creates a vacancy. So there\u2019s plenty of speculation over who might slide into Gary Cohn\u2019s seat and chair the Council of Economic Advisors. One option is Peter Navarro, a fiercely protectionist voice in the White House who is famously sceptical of free trade. CNBC reports that Navarro had been kept on a tight leash by chief of staff John Kelly - even ordered to cc: Cohn on all his emails. But now, Navarro seems to have won the battle and could potentially get a promotion. That could alarm the markets... Conservative economist Larry Kudlow, who served in the Reagan administration, has also been suggested. However, he\u2019s a free trade advocate, so it\u2019s tricky to see how he could back new tariffs. Kudlow has already tweeted that he asked Cohn to stay on.... President Trump has tweeted that he\u2019ll choose a successor soon: Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, has tweeted his support for Gary Cohn: The markets have been choppy this week, as investors have see-sawed over how alarmed they should be about a trade war. Share fell sharply on Friday when Trump announced his plans for tariffs on steel and aluminium, but did then claw back on Monday and Tuesday. That optimism has now been punctured. Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Bank, says investors can\u2019t risk being blas\u00e9: \u201cI\u2019ve gone from being a little bit relaxed about the trade-war thing to being quite a lot more nervous. People are not giving it as much weight as they should be\u2026I don\u2019t think people are really thinking this through.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of red electronic ink on the European markets this morning, following on from the drops in Asia: Investors are worried that Gary Cohn\u2019s departure removes a key opponent to Trump\u2019s protectionist leanings. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, explains: The revolving door in the Whitehouse gets another spin, but the ramifications from Cohn\u2019s exit has the potential to be huge. As his departure was announced after the US markets closed we\u2019re yet to see a real reaction from the US. But as Cohn was Wall Street\u2019s main man in Washington, we doubt they\u2019ll be so happy about it. An advocate of free trade and the biggest critic of tariffs, markets fear his absence from the White House could make the tariffs inevitable. Such tariffs didn\u2019t work out well for the Bush administration, so its difficult for markets to fathom a better outcome this time around. Mining stocks are falling this morning, helping to drag the London stock market into negative territory. That\u2019s due to fears that a trade war will hurt global growth, and dent demand for copper, zinc, iron ore and coal. Anglo American have lost 1.8%, with Glencore shedding 1.7% and BHP Billiton down 1.3%. We\u2019re not looking at a crash, thankfully, but the markets are certainly edgy this morning: Britain\u2019s stock market has followed Asia\u2019s lead, downwards. The FTSE 100 has shed 35 points, or 0.5%, at the open to 7113 -- towards the 14-month low struck on Friday when president Trump announced his tariffs. Other European markets are also dipping, as news of Gary Cohn\u2019s departure rattles the markets. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the changes of a full-on trade war have increased: The implication is that without the restraining influence of Cohn on Trump, the president will now have a free hand to press ahead with further tariffs and generally up the ante on trade. Clearly he fought back on trade and lost. Goldman Sach\u2019s CEO Lloyd Blankfein has tweeted his support for his former colleague, saying he\u2019s disappointed that Gary Cohn is leaving the White House. Rob Carnell of ING fears that investors have been too complacent about the risks of a trade war blowing up: The breaking news this morning is that Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council, is resigning over the issue. Trump, for now, seems unbowed. A 25% tariff on EU cars is his response to potential retaliation to the aluminium and steel tariffs by the EU. It won\u2019t end there. It is hard not to characterise current market behaviour as complacent. Analysts at City firm FXPro warn that Cohn\u2019s departure removes an important voice from the White House: Markets are in risk-off mode this morning, as news broke just after the US market close yesterday that Presidents Trump\u2019s Chief Economic Advisor, Gary Cohn, resigned after a clash with the president due to the implementation of trade tariffs. Cohn was an advocate of free trade and his resignation will dent market confidence in the administration. This leaves an imbalance in the administration, with an unopposed cadre of officials supporting trade tariffs, which could lead to a trade war developing as protectionist policies take hold. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says Trump seems to have won the argument over tariffs: With Cohn\u2019s steadying influence no longer steering economic policy in the Trump administration, in addition to Trump\u2019s recommitment to his nationalist trade agenda, market participants are growing increasingly nervous of where the Trump administration is going. As a result Dow futures plummet 300 points after the bell. The US dollar has hit a two-week low against a basket of currencies this morning, as traders ditch the greenback in favour of the yen. A wave of selling swept through Asia-Pacific markets after Gary Cohn\u2019s resignation hit the wires. Nearly every market is in the red - including Australia (-1%), Hong Kong (0.9%), Tokyo (0.7%) and Shanghai (-0.75%). Money also poured into the Japanese yen - a traditional safe-haven asset. Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG in Singapore, says investors are nervously awaiting for more details of Trump\u2019s tariff plans. \u201cFor the markets, Gary Cohn\u2019s departure certainly points strongly to the likelihood that little can halt the President from going ahead with his tariff plans and may mark more volatility to come for markets,\u201d said \u201cPerhaps the biggest thing to look forward to on this topic will be the details of the plans at the moment, to gain a better gauge of the extent of the impact, whereupon more volatility may be unleashed.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade war fears are sweeping through the financial markets today after Gary Cohn became the latest official to quit the White House - over Donald Trump\u2019s plans for new tariffs on steel and aluminium. Cohn, a former top Goldman Sach\u2019s executive, quit as Trump\u2019s top economic advisor after failing to persuade the president not to impose blanket tariffs on imports into America. His resignation could dash hopes that Trump might be steered away from protectionist policies -- and raises the chances of a full-blown trade war with retaliatory action from Europe, Canada and China. As we reported overnight: Cohn said in a statement issued by the White House that it had been \u201can honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform\u201d. Cohn\u2019s departure represents another blow to the administration, which has suffered several high-profile resignations since the election. Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s close aide and communications director, quit last week, and other senior figures to have left include Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Royal Bank of Canada analysts say Trump could be gearing up for a big fight on trade: Cohn staunchly opposed the invocation of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to impose steel and aluminum tariffs and his resignation has been taken as a strong indication Trump would go ahead with a set of less measured tariffs, risking a larger trade war. Adding to those fears, Trump is said to be considering a clampdown on Chinese investment in the US and broader tariffs in retaliation for alleged intellectual property theft. Asian markets swiftly fell - with Japan\u2019s Nikkei losing 1.6% at one stage (more on that shortly). The futures market is predicting chunky losses on Wall Street later today, with the Dow called down around 350 points (1.4%). European markets are also tipped to open lower, with the FTSE 100 called down 40-ish points The agenda: 8.30am GMT: Halifax house price figures for February 10am GMT: Updated eurozone GDP data for Q4 2017 3pm GMT: Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate decision 3.30pm GMT: US crude oil inventory figures",

      "bodyText": "A slowdown in improvements in life expectancy in Britain has driven a sharp rise in annual profits at the insurance and pensions firm Legal &amp; General. Worsening life expectancy means insurers need to set aside less cash for pension payments and allowed L&amp;G to release \u00a3332m of reserves last year it had previously held back to pay customers. Operating profit at the firm, which manages pensions for 1.1 million people, jumped 32% to \u00a32.1bn in 2017 after the release of the \u201cmortality\u201d reserves, beating City expectations. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t dying quicker \u2026 but [the figures] aren\u2019t improving quite as quickly,\u201d L&amp;G\u2019s chief financial officer Jeff Davies told reporters. \u201cWe are factoring in a slightly lower life expectancy.\u201d The century-long rise in UK life expectancy has stalled in recent years, with experts blaming a number of factors such as rising obesity, dementia, stress, a lack of exercise and alcohol intake, as well as the government\u2019s austerity drive that has led to cuts in health and social spending. \u201cThe rate of increase in life expectancy in the UK has slowed in recent years,\u201d the Office for National Statistics said in September when it released its latest data for 2014-2016. It showed the average life expectancy for a child born in that period was 79.2 years for males and 82.9 years for females. Improvements in life expectancy for men have more than halved from 13.6 weeks a year between 1980 to 1982 and 2009 to 2011, to six weeks a year between 2010 to 2012 and 2014 to 2016; for women improvements have slowed from 10 weeks to 3.6 weeks a year for the same periods. But L&amp;G\u2019s chief executive Nigel Wilson has pointed out that rising mortality rates also mean it has to pay out on life insurance policies earlier. In August, the company said it had changed its assumption for mortality rates but had not made any changes to the tables it uses \u2013 its longevity assumptions for the future. It has now moved to a different mortality table and continues to monitor the situation, a spokesman said. On this basis, its male customers aged 65 are expected to live a further 23.5 years rather than 23.6 as before, while women are now assumed to live a further 24.6 years, rather than 24.8. L&amp;G\u2019s customers have a longer life expectancy than the UK population because they are wealthier than the average. If L&amp;G decides to shift again to a new table called CMI 2017, there would be a further, similar release of mortality reserves.",

The CKI investments on Nolan\u2019s radar are two gas distribution business \u2013 Northern Gas Networks and Wales &amp; West Utilities, which between them manage a decent chunk of the nation\u2019s gas pipes. They are two of the companies whose charges contribute to the \u201cnetwork costs\u201d line on your household energy bill. Those costs are typically \u00a3250 on a dual-fuel bill and were subject to a blistering Citizens Advice report last year that accused energy network companies of exploiting UK consumers to make \u201csky high\u201d profits. Ofgem didn\u2019t accept CA\u2019s numbers at the time but now seems to have conceded that the general thrust was correct. While the network firms kept gas and electricity flowing efficiently, they also got supremely lucky as interest rates, and thus financing costs, turned out to be lower than assumed in official models.

It has \u201cyet to step up\u201d, Nolan wrote in the FT on Wednesday. But he said the same thing in a piece for the Sun last November. CKI, it seems, either has a tin ear or doesn\u2019t care about being seen as profiteering. The row comes at a sensitive moment. CKI\u2019s belligerence took the shine off Ofgem\u2019s latest price review for network companies, which it (and the government) is keen to promote as the toughest ever, delivering savings on energy bills of up to \u00a325 per household. Meanwhile, Labour has argued for nationalisation as a cure-all. Those nationalisation calls won\u2019t be quietened as long as the embarrassing stand-off with CKI continues. There is something desperate, or pathetic, about a supposedly muscular UK regulator writing opinion pieces, or begging letters, in national newspapers to try to shame a rich Chinese owner of UK gas pipes into coughing up a few quid. That cannot be how the system is supposed to work. Clear skies ahead for Rolls Rolls-Royce \u2013 finally \u2013 seems to be turning the corner. Chief executive Warren East came bearing bad news about the cost of replacing worn turbine blades in two Trent jet engines, but the City didn\u2019t mind. The share price improved 11% as Rolls produced \u00a3273m of cash in 2017, more than twice the sum for the previous year. Pre-tax profits, ignoring the enormous swings from currency hedges, rose by a quarter to \u00a31.07bn. The cash-generation figure, as East freely concedes, is still tiny in the context of a company with annual turnover of \u00a315bn. But it was better than forecast and gives confidence that Rolls will deliver East\u2019s target of producing \u00a31bn a year by around 2020. More importantly, the company is sticking to that ambition despite the cost of fixing the turbines, which was \u00a3170m in 2017 and will be twice as much this year. East complained of \u201caccounting fog\u201d on arrival in 2015, and subsequently had to deal with Rolls\u2019 \u00a3671m whack from settling bribery and corruption allegations, but the picture is clearer now. The various efforts to restructure and simplify operation, and remove costs, are plainly having an effect. It is probably time to concede that Rolls\u2019 decision to give a representative of ValueAct, the US activist fund with an 11% stake, a seat on the board was reasonable. The move was controversial at the time and ValueAct\u2019s real contribution is impossible for outsiders to judge \u2013 but life has run better for Rolls since the peace deal was agreed two years ago. Time to bring the accountants to account One conclusion from the post-mortem on Carillion seems clear: it\u2019s time for a competition inquiry into an auditing profession dominated by just four big firms. Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of auditing watchdog the Financial Reporting Council, said as much in January. City fund managers, appearing before the same committee on MPs on Wednesday, agreed.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New Look is considering closing as many as 60 stores, putting up to 980 jobs at risk. The struggling fashion chain has confirmed plans for a restructuring process called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which could involve the closure of more than a tenth of its 593 stores, while a further six sites have been sublet to third parties. The process, which is designed to help struggling companies stave off insolvency, must be approved by creditors including landlords at a meeting on 21 March, will also involve rent reductions at 393 stores. Alistair McGeorge, executive chairman of New Look, said: \u201cGiven our challenged trading performance and over-rented UK store estate, we are having to take tough but necessary actions to reduce our fixed cost base and restore long-term profitability. \u201cWe have held constructive discussions with our key landlords and strategic partners and will now seek creditor approval on our CVA proposal. A priority for us is to keep all potentially affected colleagues informed during this difficult time.\u201d The company said it expected a maximum of 980 redundancies out of a workforce of 15,300 as a result of the store closures which would take place over the next six to nine months. It said efforts would be made to redeploy as many people as possible. McGeorge was parachuted in to lead the retailer late last year after sales and profits collapsed. He has said the previous management team led by Anders Kristiansen pushed up prices and started selling clothes that were \u201ctoo young and edgy\u201d. The likely New Look closures come amid a tough time on the high street which has seen a string of well known brands collapse or close stores. Toys R Us and electronics specialist Maplin both fell into administration last week while Mothercare has admitted it is in talks with its banks in an attempt to fund a turnaround plan that involves the closure of almost half of its 152 UK stores. Other chains including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and House of Fraser are also closing store space. Retailers are facing a pinch because shoppers are switching to buying online and tightening their belts as inflation outstrips wage increases. Other pressures include a rise in the legal minimum wage and business rates as well as the increase in the cost of buying in goods from overseas as a result of the Brexit-fuelled drop in the value of the pound. Daniel Butters, partner at Deloitte, which will be handling New Look\u2019s CVA process, said: \u201cThe retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels. \u201cNew Look is an iconic brand on the high street and the CVA will provide a stable platform upon which management\u2019s turnaround plan can be delivered.\u201d New Look stores identified for potential closure under the CVA proposal: Aberdeen \u2013 Bon Accord; Beckton; Bolton Mens; Borehamwood; Brynmawr; Burton Mens; Cameron Toll; Cardiff \u2013 Queen Arcade; Cheshunt; Clevedon; Craigleith; Doncaster Mens; Dundee \u2013 Wellgate; Exeter Mens; Fleet; Gateshead \u2013 Team Valley; Glasgow \u2013 Buchanan Street Mens; Gorleston; Hanley Mens \u2013 Intu Potteries; Hounslow Mens; Hull \u2013 Whitefriargate; Keynsham; Kingswood; Leeds \u2013 The Core Shopping Centre; Leicester \u2013 Haymarket; London \u2013 Marble Arch; London \u2013 Moorgate/ London Wall; London \u2013 Oxford Circus; Maidenhead; Maidstone Mens; Merry Hill Mens; Metro Centre \u2013 Mens; Monmouth; Newport Mens; Newton Mearns; North Shields; Nottingham Mens; Ocean Terminal; Peterbrough Bridge Street; Pontypool; Portswood; Ramsgate; Reading - Broad Street; Reading Oracle Mens; Rhyl; Romford Mens; Rugby; Shrewsbury Mens; Sidmouth; Stockport \u2013 Merseyway; Stockton-on-Tees; Stratford-on-Avon \u2013 Bridge Street; Thornaby; Tonypandy; Torquay \u2013 Union Street; Tredegar; Troon; Wallsend; Weston Favell; Wigan Mens.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union has responded to Donald Trump\u2019s threat of a trade war by warning that it will retaliate with tariffs on a range of US imports including peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. Reacting to the threat from the US president of 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on aluminium, European commissioner for trade Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said on Wednesday the EU was finalising its own list of American exports that could face sanctions, including steel, industrial and agricultural products. However, Malmstr\u00f6m also said the EU still hoped to avoid a full blown trade war, despite the escalating rhetoric between the US and its main global trading partners in recent days. \u201cA trade war has no winners and if it does not happen for the better, then we can work with our American friends and other allies on the core issue of this problem, overcapacity,\u201d she told reporters at a press conference in Brussels. \u201cBut if it does happen we will have to take measures to protect European jobs.\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m, a veteran of trade talks with the US, said she was eager to avoid an escalation in the war of words between Washington and Brussels over tariffs, saying: \u201cWe do not want this to go out of proportion.\u201d But she said the EU needs to have \u201crebalancing\u201d measures ready, to safeguard the EU economy and protect jobs. \u201cWe cannot just stay silent when such a major measure could be taken to the EU economy,\u201d she said. She said a provisional list of US products that could face EU tariffs is being drawn up and will be published after consultation with member states. \u201cCertain types of bourbon are on the list, as are other items such peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice,\u201d she added. \u201cVery soon that list will be public, so you will be able to plan your whisky drinking.\u201d Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, also weighed in urging \u201cpoliticians on both sides of the Atlantic to act responsibly\u201d. EU leaders would discuss the trade dispute during a summit at the end of March in Brussels where a \u201cproportionate response\u201d would be discussed. \u201cWe should have a clear objective in mind: to keep world trade alive,\u201d Tusk said. Trump announced last week in a tweet that he intended to use his powers to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, honouring a campaign pledge to support domestic smoke stack industries. He later went further by saying this could be extended to European cars following threats from EU officials of counter-measures against US imports such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes, Levi\u2019s jeans and Kentucky bourbon whiskey. Prime minister Theresa May told Trump in a phone conversation that she was concerned about the plan to increase tariffs, saying there were other ways of coping with an over-supply of cheap raw materials entering the US. Trump\u2019s move triggered the resignation of his chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banker who supports free trade, late on Tuesday. Following Cohn\u2019s decision to become the latest White House aide to quit, the president earned a rebuke from Paul Ryan, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, who said he was \u201cextremely worried\u201d about the plan. The threat of trade barriers prompted a sell-off on the Dow Jones Industrial index, which is down almost 2,000 points since January from a record high of 26,616. Investors sold heavily again on Wednesday following Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s statement, with the Dow Jones index down about 300 point and just over 1% by 6pm (GMT). The dollar fell against the yen and euro as foreign exchange traders calculated that US firms would be hit by the extra cost of raw materials, while the pound also fell amid concerns that Britain\u2019s open economy would be badly hit in a trade war. But Trump won plaudits from unlikely quarters in Congress and among trade unions. Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who has called for Trump to resign, said in a tweet: \u201cI urge the administration to follow through and to take aggressive measures to ensure our workers can compete on a level playing field.\u201d US Steel, backed by the United Steelworkers\u2019 union, said it would reopen a mothballed facility in Granite City, Illinois, which it said had closed following \u201cunending waves of unfairly traded steel products that have flooded US markets\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The producers of hit Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street have agreed to pay back $60m to the US government after allegations the film was funded with money stolen from a Malaysian state investment fund. Last year, Red Granite Pictures was implicated in the scandal, in which $3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn) from the government-run 1MDB fund is alleged to have found its way into the bank accounts of associates of Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, to be used for lavish expenses and investments across the world. Red Granite was co-founded by Riza Aziz, Najib\u2019s stepson. It was alleged to have used misappropriated 1MDB money to fund not only 2013\u2019s Wolf of Wall Street, but also films Dumb and Dumber To, and Daddy\u2019s Home. The company denied the accusations but according to a California court filing on Wednesday has now agreed to pay the US government in three instalments: $30m within 30 days, $20m within the next 180 days, and the final $10m within 180 days after that. The settlement stipulates that the payment should not be construed as \u201can admission of wrongdoing or liability on the part of Red Granite\u201d. \u201cWe are glad to finally put this matter behind us and look forward to refocusing all of our attention back on our film business,\u201d Red Granite said in a statement on the filing. Red Granite was a relative unknown before it stumped up $100m to help director Martin Scorsese make The Wolf of Wall Street. Three months after shooting began, Red Granite also gave the film\u2019s star Leonardo DiCaprio a lavish birthday gift: the Oscar given to Marlon Brando for best actor in On the Waterfront, worth around $600,000. DiCaprio has since surrendered the statue as part of the 1MDB investigation. The filing against Red Granite is part of a larger US action to try to reclaim assets worth $1.7bn allegedly bought with 1MDB money. Much of the 1MDB spending spree on hotels, fine art and yachts was alleged to have been carried out by Jho Low, a friend of Aziz. Low denies all the allegations as does Najib, who instigated an investigation in Malaysia that found no evidence of wrongdoing and resulted in no one being charged. Najib also alleges that the $681m of cash that ended up in his personal bank account was not from 1MDB but a gift from a Saudi prince. While the Malaysian government has tried to draw a line under the 1MDB case, US prosecutors have continued to pursue it. Just this week, the super yacht Equanimity \u2013 allegedly belonging to Jho Low and bought with 1MDB funds \u2013 was seized in Indonesia and is now being handed over to the US department of justice.",

      "bodyText": "Former Carillion directors seemed to be more concerned about their pay deals than the operation of the company in the year leading up to its collapse, according to evidence given to MPs by City investment firm BlackRock. The allegation came during the latest hearing of a joint inquiry by two Commons select committees, in which auditor KPMG faced fresh criticism and the investment fund, Aberdeen Standard Investments, appeared to back calls for the big four accounting firms to be broken up. BlackRock managing director Amra Balic told MPs from the business and pensions committees that the investor\u2019s last conversations with the board before Carillion\u2019s collapse were about pay. \u201cMy team meets with the board and has interaction with the board,\u201d Balic said. \u201cMost recently in 2016 and 2017 that was around executive pay, where we received a letter from the remuneration committee looking to allow for more opportunity, larger bonuses for the executives and we categorically said no to that. \u201cIt seems that the board was focusing more, thinking again how to remunerate executives rather than actually what was going on at the business.\u201d Balic added there had been \u201cdefinitely too much focus at the board level around remuneration.\u201d She also revealed that BlackRock\u2019s customers made \u00a336m betting that the company\u2019s shares would fall. Her comments on pay follow disclosures that Richard Howson, who headed the company from 2012 until July 2017, pocketed \u00a31.5m in 2016, including a \u00a3122,612 cash bonus and \u00a3231,000 in pension contributions. As part of his departure deal, Carillion had agreed to continue paying Howson a \u00a3660,000 salary and \u00a328,000 in benefits until October 2018. Similar deals were struck for former finance director Zafar Khan and interim chief executive Keith Cochrane. The evidence session also saw leading investment firms back calls to address a lack of competition between the big four accountancy firms that audit the books of major companies, including Carillion\u2019s auditor KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte. Murdo Murchison, the chairman of Carillion\u2019s former largest investor Kiltearn Partners, said: \u201cThere appears to be a lack of competition in a key part of the financial system, that periodically causes a lot of participants in that system a lot of trouble.\u201d He said Kiltearn had written to directors at other companies in which it invests that are audited by KPMG, asking them to assess the \u201cquality of service\u201d they are receiving. \u201cWe remain puzzled by the fact that someone can be six weeks in a job and discover material issues in accounts that have been approved [by auditors]. \u201cThere appear to have been issues that were hidden in plain sight but were not visible to auditors. That\u2019s a puzzle.\u201d \u201cI do share the concern over the audit industry,\u201d said Euan Stirling, Aberdeen Standard Investments\u2019 head of stewardship. \u201cThere is a lack of competition.\u201d Murchison also voiced concern about the length of time that one company can act as auditor to the same firm, pointing out that KPMG had analysed Carillion\u2019s books since 1999. He cast doubt on claims by former Carillion directors and KPMG that the company\u2019s finances deteriorated rapidly in spring 2017 when four key contracts were found to be underperforming. \u201cThe notion that it all happened in a matter of a couple of months in early 2017 is incredible. There must have been prior issues that were not presented to investors that cause that quite calamitous collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scale here is extraordinary. Carillion, we would argue and hope is an exception to the general rule that an investor can rely on audited accounts.\u201d Stirling said it had become clear that Carillion\u2019s former directors were presenting a better picture of the company\u2019s finances than was correct. \u201cThere was a gloss to the [shareholder] presentations that we felt did not reflect true business circumstances. \u201cOur dealings with the company suggested a confidence in their approach that wasn\u2019t necessarily supported by the facts.\u201d Referring to non-executive directors, who are tasked with questioning the company\u2019s management, he said they were \u201choodwinked as much as anyone else\u201d. The Guardian approached KPMG and former directors of Carillion for comment but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.",

      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola is to produce the first alcoholic drink in its 132-year-history, with plans to launch an alcopop in Japan. The world\u2019s biggest soft drinks company said it would start making a version of \u201cChu-Hi\u201d \u2013 canned sparkling flavoured drinks that include a local spirit called shochu. The company, famous for its red label and secret Coca-Cola recipe, hopes to capitalise on the increase in popularity in Japan of Chu-Hi alcopops. Sales of the drink, which ranges in alcohol content from 3-8%, have surged over the past five years and it is particularly popular with female drinkers. Jorge Gardu\u00f1o, Coca-Cola\u2019s Japan president, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t experimented in the low-alcohol category before, but it\u2019s an example of how we continue to explore opportunities outside our core areas.\u201d Gardu\u00f1o said Coca-Cola would probably sell its alcoholic drinks only in Japan, because of the \u201cunique and special qualities\u201d of the domestic market. Sales of fizzy drinks are in decline worldwide as young people become more health conscious, cutting down on sugar consumption. Coca-Cola has branched out into water, coffee and tea to plug the sales shortfall. Despite the UK\u2019s sugar tax coming into effect next month, Coca-Cola has no plans to change its sugar-laden recipe for its flagship drink. It has said \u201cpeople love the taste \u2026 and have told us not to change\u201d. The group will use smaller bottles and sell at higher prices to offset the impact of the soft drinks tax. The company is also launching three new drinks in the UK this year \u2013 the ice tea drink Fuzetea, ready-to-drink cold coffee Honest Coffee, and the dairy-free smoothies brand AdeZ. Last year a report from the analysts IRI showed sales of bottled water exceeded cola for the first time as many UK consumers turned to healthier options. Howard Telford, head of soft drinks at Euromonitor International, a market research firm, said: \u201cThis is a departure for Coca-Cola, but I think this reflects the way that changing consumer tastes are pushing the company into less familiar areas like premium dairy, coffee, tea and now low-alcohol flavoured drinks. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t think this represents a global shift in company strategy, I do think we can expect Coca-Cola and its competitors to continue looking for new opportunities.\u201d According to Euromonitor, global consumption of fizzy cola drinks fell 3.1% between 2012 and 2017, with double-digit declines in the US and Brazil. Coca-Cola controls 56.5% of the global market. He said: \u201cThe Chu-Hi category is found almost exclusively in Japan. Globally, it\u2019s not uncommon for non-alcoholic beverages to be sold in the same system as alcoholic beverages. It makes sense to give this a try in our market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Co-op is set to roll out technology that allows shoppers to scan and pay for items on their smartphone while they shop, and then walk out of the store without visiting a till. The retailer\u2019s \u201cshop, scan and go\u201d service follows Amazon\u2019s experiment with an automated convenience store in the US. Such initiatives could spell the beginning of the end for the supermarket checkout \u2013 fuelling fears that automation could eventually eliminate millions of retail jobs. In Britain, 2.9 million people are employed in the retail trade. A Co-op spokesman said the pay-in-the-aisle technology, a joint venture with Mastercard, would appeal to time-pressed shoppers looking for a fast, \u201cfrictionless\u201d buying experience where they did not have to queue at the till. The member-owned business is in the final stages of a trial at a store in its support centre in Manchester which is not open to the public. There is expected to be a further trial at the Co-op in Microsoft\u2019s UK headquarters in Reading, Berkshire, but the store group said a wider rollout is expected to start as early as this summer. In September 2017, Sainsbury\u2019s revealed it was testing a similar app. However, that trial was limited to people buying a meal deal of three items at one store in central London. The Co-op said its service was believed to be a UK first for a supermarket because it covered all the products in its store, with no need to visit the till. A number of retailers in the US have launched similar initiatives. Amazon\u2019s automated grocery store in Seattle \u2013 branded Amazon Go \u2013 opened in January 2018. The same month Walmart announced it was expanding a trial of its Scan &amp; Go app to another 100 stores across the country. With the Co-op service, shoppers scan products with their phone as they walk around the store. When they have finished shopping, they can \u201ccheck out\u201d using their payment card details stored within the app, and then leave the store, with both the Co-op and the individual knowing they have paid. The retailer said it was seeing a steep fall in the number of cash transactions in its stores as customers used alternative payment methods. However, it insisted the new technology would complement, not replace, its existing ways of shopping and paying. Matthew Speight, the Co-op director of retail support, said: \u201cIt is all about consumer choices and convenience \u2026 We recognise there are many communities where customers pop in to their local Co-op and enjoy a friendly chat \u2013 it is all part of the service. Whereas for others, perhaps with a train to catch or on a school run, every second can count as consumers seek increased convenience.\u201d Some have wondered whether the rise of checkout-free technology could trigger an increase in shoplifting \u2013 while Sainsbury\u2019s reportedly said of its trial that honest customers \u201cfeel uncomfortable just walking out\u201d.",
