Voser noted that following the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, BP's share price fell sharply, and still had not completely recovered. Equity analysts have speculated over the past 18 months that a BP wounded by the Deepwater Horizon accident was dangerously vulnerable to a foreign predator. But big state-owned groups from China and Russia were seen as the most likely potential buyers, with all the political ramifications that would come with those kinds of approaches. BP has recently agreed a multibillion-pound share swap and exploration deal with Russia's state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, but there would be nothing to stop a Shell bid for BP's wider share capital. The London-based BP is still suffering from a near $40bn (\u00a324.7bn) sell-off of global assets needed to pay for the claims and liabilities from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

They have since moved up to 426p but the oil group is still dogged by the US department of justice, which is pressing on with a criminal case and reiterating its belief that it may have been grossly negligent. Legal specialists have indicated that a successful gross negligence charge would leave BP facing penalties of more than $20bn under the local Clean Water Act.

Citigroup, the US investment bank, has admitted it was behind two of the low-priced trades that raised concern, although it says it was selling gas for energy clients and not on its own behalf.</p> <p>The unreliability of prices quoted in the market was underlined by three major price reporting agencies giving different values for the same period of trading.</p> <p>Matt Osborne, an executive at energy consultant and trader Inenco, which buys \u00a31bn worth of energy a year for customers, said it was time to stop over-the-counter trading (OTC) with its high \"risk premium\".</p> <p>And Jeremy Nicholson, director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents the steel and chemical industries, said some of his members questioned the lack of \"liquidity and transparency\" in Britain's wholesale power markets.</p> <p>There was also unease in the industry that Ofgem does not have the power to properly stamp out abuse, although it has promised to adopt tough new powers next year under the European commission's Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (Remit).</p> <p>Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, has promised to severely punish anyone found guilt of market manipulation at a time when the \"big six\" energy companies are under fire over alleged profiteering in the retail supply sector. They deny the allegations.</p> <p>Proffitt, a former executive at Pilkington glass company, said there was deep unease about the way the wholesale gas market had operated for many years using unregulated OTC trades.</p> <p>\"[Big energy users] have just accepted that this is the way the power sector works. I call it 'under the counter' trades because everything is totally hidden and it is anyone's guess whether rigging takes place. I would welcome everything being moved to an openly traded system on exchanges where individual transactions can be monitored and the operators [of the exchanges] would be obliged to report anything strange.\"</p> <p>Proffitt said he did not think the FSA had the time or Ofgem the staffing power to undertake a sufficient review of the wholesale power markets, and advocated setting up a specialist watchdog with widespread powers, as in the US.</p> <p>America's federal energy regulatory commission said it wanted to levy a $470m (\u00a3290m) fine on Barclays bank and banned the energy trading arm of JP Morgan Chase for six months over alleged trading irregularities.</p> <p>Osborne, risk manager and trading strategist at Inenco, said it was \"inevitable\" that OTC trading in the wholesale gas market would eventually be brought to an end in favour of using energy exchanges such as ICE, N2X or APX.</p> <p>\"As a buyer of gas you need to have confidence in the prices you are paying and if you look at the wide bid offer spreads they are an embodiment of a [large] risk premium. Most other markets are exchange traded, why should energy be any different? Most people want to see more transparency and liquidity. I think it [the Guardian revelations] has been a catalyst for this kind of regulation,\" he said.</p> <p>Nicholson said some of his members wanted to see power transactions go through a single exchange to improve volumes and price reliability, but others were happy to continue with the existing system. \"There is not a single view from the consumer.\"</p> <p>And not everyone believes that using exchanges will bring benefits to the energy users. Roderick Bruce, an analyst at IHS in London who has tracked energy markets for seven years, told Bloomberg recently: \"Any other alternative, like forcing all trades on to an exchange or through a registry, would result in far higher costs for the industry and consumers.\"</p>",

Erratic trading on 28 September brought complaints to the regulators from a whistleblower, Seth Freedman, and his employer, the ICIS Heren price reporting agency. Citigroup, the US investment bank, has admitted it was behind two of the low-priced trades that raised concern, although it says it was selling gas for energy clients and not on its own behalf. The unreliability of prices quoted in the market was underlined by three major price reporting agencies giving different values for the same period of trading. Matt Osborne, an executive at energy consultant and trader Inenco, which buys \u00a31bn worth of energy a year for customers, said it was time to stop over-the-counter trading (OTC) with its high \"risk premium\". And Jeremy Nicholson, director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents the steel and chemical industries, said some of his members questioned the lack of \"liquidity and transparency\" in Britain's wholesale power markets. There was also unease in the industry that Ofgem does not have the power to properly stamp out abuse, although it has promised to adopt tough new powers next year under the European commission's Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (Remit). Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, has promised to severely punish anyone found guilt of market manipulation at a time when the \"big six\" energy companies are under fire over alleged profiteering in the retail supply sector. They deny the allegations. Proffitt, a former executive at Pilkington glass company, said there was deep unease about the way the wholesale gas market had operated for many years using unregulated OTC trades. \"[Big energy users] have just accepted that this is the way the power sector works. I call it 'under the counter' trades because everything is totally hidden and it is anyone's guess whether rigging takes place. I would welcome everything being moved to an openly traded system on exchanges where individual transactions can be monitored and the operators [of the exchanges] would be obliged to report anything strange.\" Proffitt said he did not think the FSA had the time or Ofgem the staffing power to undertake a sufficient review of the wholesale power markets, and advocated setting up a specialist watchdog with widespread powers, as in the US. America's federal energy regulatory commission said it wanted to levy a $470m (\u00a3290m) fine on Barclays bank and banned the energy trading arm of JP Morgan Chase for six months over alleged trading irregularities. Osborne, risk manager and trading strategist at Inenco, said it was \"inevitable\" that OTC trading in the wholesale gas market would eventually be brought to an end in favour of using energy exchanges such as ICE, N2X or APX. \"As a buyer of gas you need to have confidence in the prices you are paying and if you look at the wide bid offer spreads they are an embodiment of a [large] risk premium. Most other markets are exchange traded, why should energy be any different? Most people want to see more transparency and liquidity. I think it [the Guardian revelations] has been a catalyst for this kind of regulation,\" he said. Nicholson said some of his members wanted to see power transactions go through a single exchange to improve volumes and price reliability, but others were happy to continue with the existing system. \"There is not a single view from the consumer.\" And not everyone believes that using exchanges will bring benefits to the energy users. Roderick Bruce, an analyst at IHS in London who has tracked energy markets for seven years, told Bloomberg recently: \"Any other alternative, like forcing all trades on to an exchange or through a registry, would result in far higher costs for the industry and consumers.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European leaders wound up their final summit of 2012 on Friday in much the same manner as they started the year \u2013 kicking the euro crisis can down the road, playing for time, crossing their fingers, hoping the worst is behind them. In almost three years since the Greek drama erupted in February 2010 and spread quickly around the fringes of the eurozone, the leaders have never quite managed to get ahead of the curve despite 22 summits and countless meetings of eurozone finance ministers. This week's two-day summit in Brussels repeated the pattern. It was supposed to lay out a grand plan and timetable for reforming and stabilising the euro regime through a battery of federalising political and fiscal moves. In the event, the documents from the EU council president, Herman Van Rompuy, were shredded amid more clashes over fundamentals between Berlin and Paris, while an even more ambitious blueprint from the Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, was simply ignored. \"One wonders how these two gentlemen will enjoy Christmas,\" quipped Andrew Duff, the Liberal Democrat MEP and ardent European federalist. Van Rompuy, who has had a very bad month, was told to come back in the middle of next year with a better, more modest plan. The mood was darkened further by German Chancellor Angela Merkel dismissing claims that the worst was over for the eurozone and stressing that the bloc faced two years of painful reforms, slow growth and high unemployment. \"The changes we are going through are very difficult and painful,\" she said. \"We have tough times ahead of us that cannot be solved with one big step.\" Despite the stalemate and the seeming complacency, leaders concluded their summit keen to list the year's achievements. And they do have things to brag about. A year ago Greece's days in the euro looked numbered. This week it got \u20ac34.4bn (\u00a328bn) in bailout funds, albeit six months late. There will be no departure from the euro soon. \"Grexit is dead,\" crowed the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras. The bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, an embryo European monetary fund, is up and running. There is agreement it can be used to rescue failing banks without adding to government debt \u2013 though there is no deal on whether, and when, to do that. Despite Bank of Italy figures showing Italian public debt had risen above \u20ac2tn for the first time in October, borrowing costs for Italy and Spain have fallen sharply from highs in the late spring, taking the edge off the crisis. The big shift this week was the deal on the start of a single supervisor for the eurozone banking sector, with authority vested in the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. This looks like a euro glass that is half full and gives the leaders reasons to cheer. But a half-full glass is also half empty. The real fights over the banking supervisor, involving money and who pays to shore-up or wind-up failing banks and guarantee depositors, are still to come and will be vicious. The Germans \u2013 mainly, but not only \u2013 are not interested in having their banks taxed to create a fund that could then be spent, say, to mitigate the impact of a bad Portuguese bank, which is how the so-called common resolution regime is supposed to work. \"The Germans are fighting a brilliant delaying campaign to hollow out the banking union,\" said a senior diplomat. \"They want to avoid all mutualisation. All common pots of money are off the table until after the German election.\" The election is next September when Merkel will run for a third term. All action on the euro crisis will be minimised pending that outcome. It is, by some margin, Europe's biggest political event next year. The biggest event this year was the French election and the victory of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. At every EU summit since May, including early on Friday morning, Hollande and Merkel have clashed over policy framed broadly as German austerity and rigour versus French expansionism and pooled spending. The result has been stalemate and lowest common denominator policy-making. \"When France and Germany don't get along, things are very bad,\" said a senior EU official. \"When they come to a summit without a deal, very little can happen.\" The other newcomer who has arguably had the biggest impact has been Mario Draghi, the ECB president. Within weeks of taking office at the start of the year he was flooding Europe's banks with \u20ac1tn in cheap, short-term credit. That bought a little time, did not really work, but by the summer in London he pledged to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro, amplifying that promise in September with new policy of unlimited bond-buying in the financial markets, albeit tied to stringent conditions. It was a gamechanger, the single biggest shift that relieved pressure on Spain and Italy and took the heat off the eurozone's leaders, even though the bond-buying has not yet been tried. But Draghi, said the senior EU official, is worried his actions have encouraged the politicians to relax, triggering the current complacency and time-wasting. He is also worried that the ECB's new role as eurozone banking supervisor could hurt the bank's reputation and credibility if the new regime is rendered toothless by German resistance. The contrast in fortunes between the two key leaders, Merkel and Hollande, is striking at year's end. More than four out of five Germans, in a poll on Friday, were satisfied with Merkel's conduct, while Hollande's popularity has slipped every month since he was elected to 41% last month, a level half that of the German leader's. Merkel's electoral calculations could still be upset by the need for a Spanish bailout in the spring, predicted by senior people in Brussels, or by political and market turbulence around the same time in Italy. With unemployment soaring across Europe \u2013 albeit not in Germany \u2013 and years of austerity impacting on European societies, the sense among senior policy-makers and diplomats in Brussels is that something will have to give, that economic shrinkage rather than deficits and debt is the bigger problem, that German rigour will need to be relaxed, that it is time for French expansionary policy. There is little sign the Germans are listening.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Leading shares made a valiant attempt to breach the 6000 level for the first time since early July 2011, but stumbled as they approached the final hurdle. In a week when Greece looked set to receive its latest bailout payment, the EU agreed on banking supervision and the US Federal Reserve unveiled further bond buying to boost the country's economy, the FTSE 100 reached a peak of 5948 on Wednesday and looked like moving higher. But in the event, it slipped back as worries about the US fiscal cliff - the tax rises and spending cuts due to come into effect next year - took renewed hold, not to mention news that Standard &amp; Poor's warned of a possible cut to the UK's cherished AAA rating. The index ended 7.85 points lower on Friday at 5921.76, up just 7 points on the week. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 flirted with an all time high, finally closing 32.67 points higher at 12,244.24. One of the day's biggest fallers was insurance group Prudential, down 17.5p at 881p after US group Met Life issued a weak outlook statement. Analyst Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas said many investors had missed the risk to Pru's US growth: Met Life's announcement has a negative readthrough for Pru. We expect an attempted sale of the US business or even capital raising before [2016]. Despite this and a weaker outlook for Asia, the share price has outperformed; we reiterate our sell recommendation. Mining groups Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation and Anglo American fell back after downgrades from UBS. ENRC, down 0.3p at 270p, had been trying to shake off worries about its debt position after news early in the week it was taking full control of its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But UBS said: We downgrade ENRC to neutral (from buy) despite recent share weakness, as we see an increasing risk of financial stress in 2013 with 3 times net debt to EBITDA covenant to be tested and equity potentially to be issued to raise freefloat from 18% to 25% by the end of 2013. We had been positive on the stock as we expected restructuring to crystallise value near-term; we still see potential for divestments, but the recent increase in net debt/ softness in chrome makes the risk/ reward less compelling. UBS also cut Anglo, down 30.5p at 1826.5p, from buy to neutral: While we like the quality of Anglo's assets and remain positive on the sector from a top-down perspective, in our opinion, the valuation, earnings momentum/growth, heightened South Africa risk (as evidenced in recent strikes), and ongoing concerns around Minas Rio makes the risk/reward less compelling than for other diversified miners. Meanwhile JP Morgan Cazenove said investors hopes of a spin-out of Anglo's platinum business Amplats were likely to be misplaced. Whitbread closed 14p lower at \u00a324.30 on profit taking after a positive update on Tuesday. Its Costa Coffee business benefited from consumers switching from Starbucks following the row over the US company's low tax payments. Patrick Coffey at Liberum Capital said: Whitbread is benefitting from the struggles of its biggest rivals (Starbucks and Travelodge) and consumers are showing a clear preference for Whitbread brands. Our consumer survey conducted earlier this year already shows that: 1) Costa is the UK's favourite coffee shop, 2) The recent Which magazine survey shows that Premier Inn is clearly preferred to Travelodge. AstraZeneca lost 34.5p to \u00a329.24 in the wake of disappointing results for its arthritis treatment, prompting analysts at Societe Generale to move from hold to sell. Technology business Smiths Group was steady at \u00a311.45 as analysts at Deutsche Bank suggested a breakup of the business could be on the cards. A couple of year's ago Smiths rejected a bid for its medical business, but the recent sale of Invensys' rail business to Siemens could provide a template for how the disposal could now work, said the bank. Analyst Martin Wilkie raised his recommendation from hold to buy and his target price from \u00a311.50 to \u00a313.35. AG Barr and Britvic, currently in the throes of merging their businesses, edged lower, with Barr down 0.1p at 487.4p and Britvic falling 1.3p to 393.6p. But even before the deal was done, the combined company was already tipped by analyst at Panmure Gordon as a possible bid target for Japan's Suntoryu. Centamin, the Egypt focused gold miner, saw its shares come under pressure on Thursday after it suspended operations at its only production site, due a dispute over diesel supply and news that customs officials had halted shipments. But it regained some of its shine after it said the Egyptian petroleum company involved had sent notification that the fuel supply to the Sukari mine could be resumed. But there was no news on restarting production. The move by customs officials left the business short of working capital, so a resumption of deliveries is key to restarting production. Centamin said: A further update on the status of gold exports will be provided in due course as this will determine when operations at Sukari may resume. The fuel dispute with the state owned petroleum company involved a claim it was owed $65m, but in its latest statement Centamin said it had indicated no retrospective payment was currently due. So after slumping 47% on Thursday, Centamin's shares recovered 6.94p to 34.64p or 25%. Lower down the market Volex lost more than a third of its value, down 51.25p to 89p after the electrical equipment group warned full year profits and revenues would be much lower than expected. This follows a similar warning in September, when it blamed component changes made by its largest customer, Apple. Now it said: Contrary to earlier expectations of growth in second half revenue, the company has experienced a general softening of demand across all sectors as well as delays in specific project timelines, which does not include our largest customer. Insurer Beazley dipped 0.2p to 177.3p after it said it expected a net loss of $90m from superstorm Sandy, based on total Lloyd's of London market losses of $20bn. Finally retailer HMV fell another 5% to 2.37p after it said it was in danger of breaching its banking covenants in January.",

      "body": "<p>Washington lawmakers negotiating the fiscal cliff deal seem to have an appetite for financial destruction. The question is: will they wreck city and state budgets? </p> <p>It comes down to municipal bonds. The $4tn market keeps America's school districts functioning. Cities and states issue municipal bonds to pay for schools, roads and bridges, and investors buy them tax-free. That tax break is a big part of the reason that municipal bonds find so many buyers, and the bonds themselves are direct line between individual investors and cities and states. Around 40% of municipal bonds are owned by individual investors, and if you count mutual funds that represent individual investors, the number goes up to 71% of muni bonds in consumer hands. </p> <p>The problem is that those consumers who buy municipal bonds tend to have money; most of them would count as \"rich\" under the Obama administration's $250,000-per-year threshold. According to the Journal: \"White House officials argue that too much of the roughly $30bn a year in forgone federal tax payments from the interest exemption goes to higher-income households.\"</p> <p>We already know that giving any kind of tax break to financially comfortable households is a concept that sticks in the president's craw. It's one thing for the government to raise taxes on individuals. But effectively raising taxes on other government entities, like state and local governments, is like the snake eating its own tail. </p> <p>That's why, in this case, it's important to look at the bigger picture. Individual investors are dependent on tax breaks to keep investing in muni bonds, and cities and states need investors to keep buying their municipal bonds. Losing the tax exemption \"could reduce the appetite of high income/high wealth investor for this asset class\", wrote Vikram Rai, an analyst for Citigroup. </p> <p>When buyers shy away, it will be harder to find new ones; banks, insurers and pension funds would be the other logical buyers of municipal bonds, but they're not. That's why eliminating the tax exemption for munis \"would have a huge impact\" on cities and states, said Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Alan Schankel. </p> <p>\"If they went with eliminating the tax-free feature, small issuers like a school district borrowing $20m would have limited access to the market and would have to look at a different approach to raise money,\" Schankel said. \"I think it would definitely hurt market access, and it would hurt the capital improvements we need to repair our infrastructure which is in dismal condition.\" </p> <p>Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, said that his firm owns municipal bonds. \"It would adversely affect our investments. The bigger impact would be that it would adversely affect state and local governments.\"</p> <p>It is possible that the tax break on munis won't be eliminated, but reduced. </p> <p>Another proposal that has been floated in Washington is capping the tax break for muni bonds at 28% \u2013 not just for new bonds, but also for ones that people already bought under the impression that they were tax-free. That cap would not affect people who make less than $250,000, according to a report from Citigroup analyst Vikram Rai. </p> <p>But it would make it more expensive for cities and states to borrow money; they'd have to pay higher interest rates. </p> <p>\"If the 28% proposal went through, that would raise borrowing costs for all municipal borrowers,\" Schankel wrote. </p> <p>Citigroup's Rai estimated that if tax rates rise, some municipal bonds could lose anywhere from 2% to 5.5% of their value. His fellow analyst, George Friendlander, said, a cap would \"severely damage the value of existing municipal bonds, and push the borrowing cost for new bonds substantially higher\", Friedlander said in the report.</p> <p>That, in turn, will threaten the ability of already cash-strapped cities and states to raise enough money pay for schools, sewers and bridges. Many cities and states don't make enough money to pay for those services themselves. The financial crisis, followed by unemployment and foreclosures, have ripped cash out of the coffers of many cities and states. As a result, many cities and states are already on shaky financial ground and have been laying off employees. Without cheap, regular financing, they may have to lay off more employees. </p> <p>Schankel expects that munis will lose at least some of their tax-free status. Even though investors are clamoring to buy more municipal bonds \u2013 because they are generally a safe investment \u2013 the demand may not be enough to offset the costs to cities.</p> <p>If the country has to go over the fiscal cliff, Washington should be looking to limit the impact. If municipal-bond tax breaks are on the table, it will only broaden the already ill-conceived and congressionally created disaster around the fiscal cliff.</p>",

But it would make it more expensive for cities and states to borrow money; they'd have to pay higher interest rates. \"If the 28% proposal went through, that would raise borrowing costs for all municipal borrowers,\" Schankel wrote. Citigroup's Rai estimated that if tax rates rise, some municipal bonds could lose anywhere from 2% to 5.5% of their value. His fellow analyst, George Friendlander, said, a cap would \"severely damage the value of existing municipal bonds, and push the borrowing cost for new bonds substantially higher\", Friedlander said in the report. That, in turn, will threaten the ability of already cash-strapped cities and states to raise enough money pay for schools, sewers and bridges. Many cities and states don't make enough money to pay for those services themselves. The financial crisis, followed by unemployment and foreclosures, have ripped cash out of the coffers of many cities and states. As a result, many cities and states are already on shaky financial ground and have been laying off employees. Without cheap, regular financing, they may have to lay off more employees. Schankel expects that munis will lose at least some of their tax-free status. Even though investors are clamoring to buy more municipal bonds \u2013 because they are generally a safe investment \u2013 the demand may not be enough to offset the costs to cities. If the country has to go over the fiscal cliff, Washington should be looking to limit the impact. If municipal-bond tax breaks are on the table, it will only broaden the already ill-conceived and congressionally created disaster around the fiscal cliff.",

      "bodyText": "European markets have ended a busy week on a pretty uninspiring note, following the EU deal on banking supervision, the US Federal Reserve's move towards further quantitative easing, the UK being warned on its AAA rating, and Greek edging closer to getting its crucial bailout money. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 0.13% lower at 5921.76 \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.19% \u2022 France's Cac has closed up 0.15% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is up 0.26% \u2022 Spain's Ibex has edged 0.09% higher \u2022 The Athens market is down 0.32% \u2022 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.07% lower. The euro has climbed to its highest level since early May against the dollar, with traders trying to find a reason for the rise. A fall in US inflation in November allowing the US Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low was cited as one factor. And with that it's time to shut up shop for the week. We'll be back on Monday morning, so have a good weekend and thanks for all the comments. And, as it's nearly the weekend, here's one fan of the forthcoming governor of the Bank of England (click on the link): Despite the current political uncertainty in Italy, Fitch has reaffirmed the country's credit rating at A- with a negative outlook. The agency said the A- rating reflected: Progress with fiscal consolidation and structural reform in 2012 broadly in line with Fitch's expectation. The budget deficit this year will be below 3% of GDP, implying a primary surplus close to 3%. The budget deficit has gradually declined from a peak of 5.4% in 2009. - Low contingent fiscal risks from the banking sector, an underlying budgetary position close to that necessary to stabilise the government debt to GDP ratio and a sustainable pension system which underpins confidence in the long-run solvency of the Italian state. - The Italian sovereign has demonstrated its financing flexibility and resilience during the crisis reflecting a strong domestic investor base and average duration of 4.7 years. Moreover, the announcement of the ECB's Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) programme has materially eased stresses in European sovereign bonds, including for Italian debt. - The rating remains supported by the relatively wealthy, high value-added and diverse economy with moderate levels of private sector indebtedness. As for the negative outlook, it reflected a number of risk factors including, yes, the political situation, where prime minister Mario Monti has resigned and Silvio Berlusconi seems to be relishing making interventions at every turn: Government instability following the forthcoming elections and prolonged uncertainty over economic and fiscal policies and policy continuity. This social media thing is catching on. The Bundesbank is now on Twitter. The euro is moving higher now, up to $1.3137. The brief lull after the EU meeting gives me a chance to guide you over to the Guardian business Christmas quiz - not very Christmasy in truth, but it's certainly a quiz. Give it a go here, even though one of my brilliant questions didn't make the final cut. See if you can do better than baerchen BTL: hmmm only got 38/50 in the Graun's Bumper Business Quiz.

(without wishing to spoil the joke, deKrugman is US economist Paul Krugman while Drachet is an amalgam of Draghi and Trichet) Anyone want to know Herman Van Rompuy's schedule for next week? Well here it is: My favourite quote from Brussels today comes from the French president, Francois Hollande. Asked about Fitch's decision to reaffirm France's triple-A status (see 8.13am), Hollande replied that such baubles have little impact on Paris's thinking. As Hollande put it: France does not determine its economic policy according to credit ratings agencies, it does it according to what is right for France. So we shouldn't expect any grumbling from Paris the next time a rating agency wields the axe. That appears to be the end of the action from Brussels, so I'm going to scoot - and let Nick Fletcher see us home. Cheers all - have a great weekend.... GW The US manufacturing sector has posted much stronger growth than expected, according to new data today. Markit's monthly PMI survey came in at 54.2, up from 52.8 in November. That shows that growth accelerated this month. That's also a much stronger figure than the 46.3 recorded by Germany (see 9.25am). This graph shows how the US is leading the way among major economies: And separately, US industrial output jumped by 1.1% in November, much stronger than expected. That is largely due to demand picking up after Hurricane Sandy, which hit the east coast at the end of October. We now have the full quotes from Angela Merkel's press conference (thanks, Reuters!), and the German chancellor was not prepared to agree that the worst of the crisis was over. Despite the progress this week on Greece's aid payment and single banking supervision, Merkel warned that there are years of pain ahead. She explained: One reason I am careful with my forecasts is the adjustment process, the changes that we are going through are very difficult and painful. As mentioned at 12.12pm, Merkel warned that 2013 would be particularly weak: Next year, and the ECB president said this, we will have very low growth rates, we will see negative growth in some countries, and we can expect very high unemployment levels to continue. On the one hand we have accomplished a lot. But we also have tough times ahead of us that can't be solved with one big step. There has been lots of talk about the one step, whether it be a debt haircut, euro bonds or some other measure that will solve everything. That won't be the case. Merkel's comments are a reminder that there's more to solving the crisis than simply preventing the implosion of the eurozone. Experts have been scrambling to revise their predictions of Greece leaving the euro imminently. But as university lecturer Spyros Gkelis points out, Greeks face years of tough austerity: Also worth remembering Merkel's refusal to support a large fund for countries in trouble (see 11.39am) -- her reluctance to take on more risk underlines how concerned she is about the crisis flaring up again, ahead of the German elections next autumn. Italy's technocratic PM, Mario Monti, has refused to comment on his future plans, during a press conference in Brussels. Amid speculation that he might run in next year's election, Monti cautioned that it was \"not possible or appropriate\" to comment on election prospects right now. That won't dampen the speculation, especially after Monti was feted by other leaders this week. Monti even played that down, saying it was only natural for people to show interest in foreign elections. Almost every Italian feels the need to say something about the US elections. The full, final conclusions from the two-day summit are now online here Herman Van Rompuy kept off the eurozone crisis in his post-summit comments. He explained that European leaders discussed their \"common security and defence policy\" for the first time since 2008: We want the security and defence policy as a whole to become more effective. This includes also our civilian capabilities, a very important aspect, as well as a more systematic cooperation among EU Member States on defence capabilities. We also want to see a stronger defence industry in Europe, which will contribute to more innovation and competitiveness, and to more growth and employment across our Union. This is another slow-burner issue - HVR hopes to present recommendations in time for the December 2013 summit. And as the meeting broke up, the Council president was in upbeat mood: So, to conclude, this was a very positive European Council meeting, which ended a year where the European Union has covered a lot of ground and which mapped out the way forward for next year. David Cameron, UK prime minister, is giving a press conference in Brussels now. After urging more action on Syria, and blasting his Labour predecessors over migration policy, the PM was asked whether Britain was wedged in the slow lane of a two-speed Europe. Cameron denied that Britain was in an uncomfortable position \"at all\", adding: We are in a possition to maximise what we want from Europe. Cameron argued that we now see a multifaceted Europe (thanks to factors such as the single currency, banking supervision), adding: I believe what you'll see is a growth of this multifaceted Europe, and we should see it as a strength. And pointing to Wednesday's UK unemployment data, Cameron argued that Britain had \"every chance of going faster than slower\" by staying outside the euro. Cameron also reiterated his opposition to Britain joining the euro: Another line from Angela Merkel - she warns that the reform process in the eurozone will be \"difficult and painful\" during 2013. And possibly for longer than that. Merkel went on to explain that the 'solidarity mechanisms' on the agenda for the eurozone will be rather official in nature: Angela Merkel is defending her approach to the pace of closer economic and monetary union now, explaining that further fiscal discipline can only come in \"later years\". Some countries (ie, in the periphery) are not in a position to embrace it yet, she explains. Angela Merkel's post-summit briefing is being streamed now (click the box above). The audio (German, no translation) is pretty jumpy, though, but she's been explaining how the European Stability Mechanism (the new bailout fund) should protect the eurozone. It's over! The second day of summit \"action\" in Brussels has ended. Now for the joy of the press conferences.... These are the key quotes from Angela Merkel this morning which confirm that she blocked attempts to agree more radical cures for the eurozone's ills, such as a really significant \"shock absorber\" fund to help struggling eurozone nations. Merkel, though, would only support what Reuters dubs a \"carrot-and-stick vision\". She described the proposed 'solidarity mechanisms' thus: We are talking about support linked to improvements in competitiveness. We are talking about a very limited budget. Not three digit billions, rather 10 or 15 or 20 billion euros. No wonder the Financial Times is also disappointed by the summit, warning that all major decisions on closer fiscal and economic integration have been put off until June: The two most controversial proposals put forward by European Council president Herman Van Rompuy \u2013 a future eurozone budget and binding economic reform contracts \u2013 were nearly stripped entirely from the summit\u2019s communiqu\u00e9. The document, published early on Friday morning, instead said the contracts would be presented as a \u201cpossible measure\u201d in June. David Gow of Nucleus, the 'eurorealist' pressure group, (and our former European business editor), is also unimpressed by Europe's plans for an EMU roadmap: With public opinion polls showing Greece\u2019s official opposition firmly in the lead, party chief Alexis Tsipras is about to make what aides are describing as an \u201cexceptionally important\u201d trip to Latin America, reports Helena Smith. Helena writes: Tsipras\u2019 ten-day trip to Latin America will aim to \u201cinternationalize the Greek crisis.\u201d His radical leftist Syriza party has long argued that early Greek elections are inevitable as a result of popular outrage over EU-IMF-mandated austerity measures that have brought Greeks to their knees. Starting tomorrow, Tsipras will take that message directly to Latin America. \u201cWe\u2019re developing our multi-faceted foreign policy which we will pursue once in government,\u201d Takis Pavlopoulos, one of Tsipras senior aides, told me. \u201cWith the exception of [countries run by] by fascist regimes and dictators we\u2019re talking with everyone about possible ways of cooperation.\u201d Brazil and Argentina will be the focus of the tour. \u201cBrazil is a rising star of the BRICS [countries] and has a lot of say in the IMF,\u201d said Pavlopoulos. \u201cAnd Argentina is a member of the G20. They are both countries with important institutional roles in the world economic system.\u201d Brazil, regular readers will recall, has also hotly opposed giving an advanced western economy, like Greece, continuous aid at the expense of other much poorer nation states. There is much chatter that a Syriza government might even be supported, financially, by states in Latin America. EU leaders looked in cheery form this morning as they arrived for further talks in Brussels. Here's a few photos: Over in Greece, yesterday's decision to finally unlock aid for the country may have been greeted with euphoria in government circles but, as our correspondent Helena Smith reports, the crisis is far from over on the ground. Helena writes: From Greece's powerful -anti-bailout front to ordinary men and women on the street, the message is the same: away from the number crunchers in Brussels the crisis is far from over. The country's main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras has been quick to make the point, saying with Greeks about to enter a sixth straight year of recession, \"no one is convinced\" by the coalition government, and prime minister Antonis Samaras' argument, that the bumper 52 package of rescue loans will save the day. With self-defeating austerity policies the price of the assistance, Greece was still doomed. \"The efforts of the prime minister to present himself and his government as saviours convinces no-one,\" said the radical left leader. \"This 'technical installlment of optimism\" cannot hide the reality which the majority of society is living as a result of the memorandum's policy of austerity,\" he railed. \"[A policy] that reduces incomes, increases unemployment, spreads recession and destroys the country's prospects of growth that is viable and fair.\" Unionists have also shot back, announcing massive strike action, Helena adds. The union of civil servants, ADEDY, said they would stage a general strike next Wednesday against \"the policies of wretchedness.\" It will be the fifth general strike since September. \"Our life is not going to get better, it is going to get worse,\" Ilias Iliopoulos, ADEDY's general secretary told me. \"The measures we are about to see include cuts in wages, 20 % drops in pensions, mass firings, a dramatic decline in health and other services and huge increases in the cost of basic utilities such as electricity. No people can endure such merciless austerity.\" Over in Brussels, the EU Council summit is officially underway - with Herman Van Rompuy issuing a rallying tweet: Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, is there -- and confirms that last night's decisions don't amount to all that much. Spain's prime minister has insisted that his country still does not need a bailout. Mariano Rajoy declared this morning that Madrid would only request help if it were in the interests of the Spanish people - final confirmation that any aid package has been kicked well into 2013. Speaking to Spain's Cadena Ser radio station, Rajoy said: We will use this mechanism only if it necessary to defend the interests of the Spanish people. We do not need it today and that's why we haven't requested it. Spain's borrowing costs remain affordable today, with its 10-year bonds yielding around 5.3% (from 7.6% in mid-July). Suspect Rajoy endorses the FT's decision to make Mario Draghi their Man Person of the Year. New data on car sales this morning was uniformly bad across the eurozone, and not much better in the wider EU. The UK was the only major market which didn't post a drop in sales in November, while total European sales slumped by 10.3%. In Germany, sales were 3.5% lower compared to November 2011. In Greece, they were 47% lower. As my colleague Jo Moulds reports: Figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, the ACEA, showed demand for new cars fell for the 14th consecutive month in the European Union, as the economic gloom spread across the continent. It was the market's first double-digit contraction in more than two years and comes as European leaders met for the second day of a summit to discuss closer integration of the currency bloc to address the ongoing crisis. The UK, though, saw an 11.3% jump in new car sales. Ireland was up 13.5%, although that actually meant just 883 sales during November in its minor (mini?) market. A mixed bag of economic news this morning, with Germany's service sector posting its first growth since April, but its manufacturing sector performing poorly. Here's the highlights of Markit's latest purchasing managers index (PMI) reports for December (in which 50=stagnation, &gt;50=growth and &lt;50=contraction). German service sector PMI: 52.1 (up from 49.7 in November) German manufacturing PMI: 46.3 (down from 46.8) French service sector PMI: 46.0 (up from 45.9) French manufacturing PMI: 44.6 (up from 44.5) And the overall Eurozone private sector PMI hit its highest level in nine months - at 47.3. Encouraging, but that still means the sector contracted -- suggesting the eurozone recession is deepening. As this graph shows: It's interesting to compare Herman Van Rompuy's opening remarks yesterday (here) with the conclusions published this morning (here). Going into the summit, the European council president declared: Our objective for today is to map out our next steps towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. We must implement our agenda on competitiveness and on growth. But in the event, leaders simply agreed that HVR should present possible measures and a \"time-bound roadmap\" for the June 2013 summit (see 8.02am for the highlights). French finance minister Pierre Moscovici has welcomed Fitch's decision to leave the country's AAA rating unchanged, calling it an \"encouragement\" and a \"motivating force\". Speaking on French radio, Moscovici said: It's a pointer for the way ahead. My take on this is that the French economy is solid and can be trusted, and it is absolutely essential that we keep to the path we have mapped out: European construction, budget solidity and competitiveness. Moscovici also said that the eurozone was 'in the process of being saved' -- echoing Herman Van Rompuy's argument that the worst is over.... Back to last night's summit talks.... and there's a consensus that there was little genuine progress last night as leaders tucked into their Turbot and chocolate cake*. Reuters described the conclusions (see 8.02am) as 'verbal commitments' rather than 'concrete decisions', adding: After more than eight hours of late-night talks at a summit in Brussels, leaders promised to push ahead with setting up a mechanism to wind down problem banks, although it was unclear when the facility would be completed. They also launched tentative discussions on how to make countries stick to economic targets and on creating a \"solidarity fund\" to help member states suffering one-off economic shocks, but did not delve deeply into either issue, pushing the debate out to the middle of next year. While Bloomberg was concerned that France and Germany were split, once again, over the way forward: German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, stewards of the euro area\u2019s top two economies, promoted conflicting visions of how to revamp economic management once the fiscal crisis subsides. \u201cA split opened between member states that want to put in place a solidarity mechanism for countries affected by external shocks or internal negative developments and those that support national solutions,\u201d Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said early today after the first session of a Brussels summit, the 22nd since Greece\u2019s debt burst onto the agenda in early 2010. \u201cWe gradually moved closer together but in the details this was difficult.\u201d This has left the Brussels press pack hunkering down for the long haul... * - Luke Baker of Reuters reports that leaders tucked into a decent meal last night: The other breaking story this morning is that Fitch has affirmed France's AAA credit rating (with a negative outlook). Fitch said France still deserved its AAA status due to its: wealthy and diversified economy, stable political, civil and social institutions and its exceptional financing flexibility reflecting its status as a large benchmark eurozone sovereign issuer. Fitch added that France's \"moderate household indebtedness and a relatively high savings rate\" meant its economy was less threatened by private sector deleveraging than the UK or the US (which it also ranks as AAA/negative). The UK, of course, was also cut to AAA/negative by S&amp;P yesterday (see Thursday's blog), prompting chancellor George Osborne to downplay the relevance of the rating agencies. Still, Paris will be pleased to still be ranked Triple-A with one of the big three agencies.... ...for now, anyway. Fitch added that there's a 'slightly greater than' 50% chance of a downgrade, and predicted very weak growth in France over the next two years (+0.3% in 2013, and 1.1% in 2014). Fitch's statement is online here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis, and other key events in the world economy. It's the last day of the final European Council meeting of 2012, with leaders gathering in Brussels again today to discuss the crisis - and the route forwards. Overnight, progress has been made towards a stronger Economic and Monetary Union. Leaders endorsed the banking supervision deal hammered out by their finance ministers this week, and also agreed a \"roadmap\" for the currency union. Herman Van Rompuy, European Council president, presented the conclusions a few hours ago - they're online here. That roadmap includes: \u2022 drawing up plans to work closer together on economic reform. Participating Member States discuss, and co-ordinate \"all major economic policy reforms that they plan to undertake\". \u2022 \"solidarity mechanisms\" for weaker members who are prepared to \"enter into contractual arrangements for competitiveness and growth\" \u2022 Improved governance within the eurozone. But as the roadmap won't be presented until June 2013, we're in for more waiting.... More analysis of Day 1 of the summit to follow, along with all the latest action from Brussels today.",
