      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not often you go to a conference on agriculture and come away feeling quite scared for the future. But this week\u2019s Abare\u2019s 2017 Outlook conference featured a talk on the future of trade that painted a dire picture of trade barriers and nations moving into blocks that engage in trade wars and perhaps more violent conflicts. It was a stark warning to those who value the benefits of trade of the need to also value the concerns of those who miss out on those benefits. In a conference featuring the usual talks on innovation in agriculture and pest management, the Abare conference also featured a speech by Rabobank economist, Michael Every that had me \u2013 and most in the audience \u2013 wondering if it was time to start collecting canned food and building a bunker. His speech was on the changing nature of trade relations and how under the Trump presidency things might get rather precarious. While economists love trade, it has extremely political ramifications. And it is politics that in Every\u2019s view is driving the world back to a 19th century style trade world. A world where after a period of free trade, high tariffs were set up and where trade became a conflict involving domination of one country over another. And the problem is that economic conflict can quickly become real conflict. It was a scary prospect \u2013 not only would raising trade barriers reduce our standard of living \u2013 but if the path of the next 10 years follows the path of the late 1800s and early 1900s then the world gets very dangerous very quickly. The biggest difficulty for those selling the idea of free trade is that a soon as you start talking about things such as \u201ccomparative advantage\u201d people quickly switch off. It\u2019s much easier to understand trade in what is known as a mercantilist sense \u2013 the \u201cdomination\u201d point of view, where the aim is to export more than you import. That is certainly the view of Donald Trump and his trade advisor, Peter Navarro, who has recently argued that because GDP is made up of consumption, government spending, investment and net exports (exports minus imports) reducing the US trade deficit is a good way to grow the US economy. The problem with that view is that in the US \u2013 as in Australia \u2013 the size of net exports pales in comparison to consumption, investment and government spending. That doesn\u2019t mean exports are not important \u2013 currently exports are a leading driver of Australia\u2019s GDP growth \u2013 but if your focus is just on reducing the trade deficit by lowering imports, then you will actually harm the economy because we use imports to produce things. You want net exports to grow because you are producing more exports or getting more tourists or foreign students, not because you are making imports more expensive. The best way to improve economic growth is by increasing the participation of people in the workforce and by having those people be better at producing things \u2013 i.e. increasing productivity. Trade is actually very good at increasing productivity because it forces local companies to compete with those overseas and also allows them to import items they need at a cheaper cost. And the benefits of trade need not just be about Australia exporting more than another nation. If trade enables a poorer nation to become stronger economically that can help us in the long run because, as we have seen with China, a growing middle class in that nation can be a boon for us. But of course trade is not all about winners. Michael Every gave the example of a parent with two children \u2013 one who was good at cleaning bookshelves and general dusting, and another who was good at cleaning toilets. An efficient parent would have each child do the chore that they were best at, but clearly the child cleaning the toilets might soon think this unfair. In response the parent might offer other rewards to that child to compensate for doing the less enjoyable work. We don\u2019t have a world government that can replicate this and so some nations end up with the international trade equivalent of cleaning toilets with no real recompense. But the analogy can also work within individual nations, where the children both end up cleaning the toilets and the parents hire a cleaner to come in and do the dusting. In a real-world sense this is when workers shift to jobs that pay less, or have less permanency, fewer hours, but a greater requirement to work weekends. In an economy-wide sense this can be good. It can see workers being more productive \u2013 as trade forces local firms to compete with the rest of the world, and also see workers move to industries in which Australia is most productive. But unless workers are receiving the benefits of this greater productivity, the system breaks down and talks of the wonders of trade will get pretty short shrift. Is it any wonder that the US has turned more protectionist when, as a research paper out this week highlighted, the wages of workers since 1980 have not kept up with their productivity improvements? Had the wages of US workers risen in line with productivity, as occurred from the end of the second world war until 1980, an American now earning around $40,000 would instead be on $61,000. The problem has been that those arguing for the benefits of freer trade have too often also been those arguing for the benefits of smaller government, lower welfare and less workplace regulation \u2013 such as minimum wages and penalty rates. And it is easy to see why \u2013 free trade has a nice pro-business aspect, and can sucker you into thinking that greater competition and the free market will cure all \u2013 especially if you look to GDP numbers to validate your position. But as Every noted, trade is as much about politics as it is about economics. The economics of free trade work best at a national GDP level; the politics of free trade is personal and local. Those politicians who wish to avert the high protection and militarily belligerent state of the late 19th century need to focus less on trying to convince voters of the goodness of free trade and more on ensuring the benefits of it are distributed equally. Let us hope it is not too late.",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable pushed at the revolving door of General Motors\u2019 New York offices and stepped into the bustle of a February afternoon in Manhattan. As he scanned the street for his awaiting taxi, the then business secretary breathed a huge sigh of relief. It was 2012, and Cable had just persuaded Dan Akerson, then chief executive of car giant General Motors, to hand production of the seventh-generation Astra to Britain. Cable\u2019s 11th-hour intervention, along with generous concessions on pay and conditions from the unions, helped save Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire from closure. It also outmanoeuvred Opel, Vauxhall\u2019s German sister, which was desperate to secure the Astra for its ailing Bochum plant. \u201cThe Germans were incandescent,\u201d Cable recalled. \u201cWe think they even had [Angela] Merkel on the phone to persuade GM to reverse its decision.\u201d Vauxhall won that battle, but the British marque and its workers have again been plunged into a scrap for survival. Last week\u2019s \u00a31.9bn sale of GM\u2019s loss-making European operations, comprising Vauxhall and Opel, to Groupe PSA of France has thrown Vauxhall\u2019s future into fresh doubt. GM Europe employs more than 38,000 people, with about 19,000 at plants in Germany and 4,500 at Vauxhall\u2019s sites in Ellesmere Port and Luton. The scale of the turnaround task facing Carlos Tavares, chief executive of PSA, is clear. The Vauxhall-Opel operation hasn\u2019t made a profit since 1999 and has made cumulative losses of $20bn since then. British carmakers are already nervous about their prospects when the country leaves the European Union: tariffs or other trade barriers on British cars exported to the EU could deal a hammer blow to the sector. Jim Farley, president of Ford Europe, last week insisted that barrier-free trade was essential to protecting his company\u2019s 14,000 British workers. Ford is planning to cut up to 1,100 jobs at its engine plant in Bridgend, south Wales. \u201cFor the future of those employees and for customers in the UK, a zero-tariff environment is really, really important,\u201d Farley said. Britain\u2019s car industry is dominated by continental (Volkswagen and BMW), American (Ford and GM) and Japanese (Nissan and Toyota) manufacturing groups whose main export market is the EU. Eight out of every 10 cars that roll off British production lines are exported and the EU is the biggest export market, with 56% of British-made cars sent there. Car manufacturing in Britain is close to a record high, with 1.72 million made on these shores in 2016: not far off the peak of 1.92 million in 1972. Consequently, the sector is a key player in the British economy. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show the UK car industry clocks up annual turnover of \u00a371bn, employs 169,000 people directly and supports a further 814,000 indirectly. But new trade barriers are also likely to make it more expensive for British manufacturers to import components. If costs go up, it may give PSA an easy excuse to shut its newly acquired British factories. On the flip side, cars made in Britain are likely to be cheaper for UK buyers than those from Germany, Spain or Italy, and if the government can strike trade deals with nations outside Europe, PSA\u2019s UK factories could tap into those markets. Tavares hinted at this, noting the \u201cpotential opportunity\u201d that a hard Brexit might present \u201cto have inside of the UK some manufacturing plants\u201d. This may still mean slimming down operations until enough trade deals with other countries are inked in. The tie-up makes PSA, owner of the Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn marques, the second-biggest European carmaker \u2013 accelerating past Renault, but behind VW \u2013 with a 16% market share. Tavares has a reputation as a cost-cutter, and PSA, which is 14% owned by the French state, estimates savings and other benefits from the deal should reach \u20ac1.7bn on an annual basis. It said most of this would come from \u201csynergies\u201d \u2013 eliminating duplication in head-office functions such as marketing. However, analysts reckon there are sure to be large-scale job cuts, and even plant closures. Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, who leads the Centre for Automotive Research (CAR) at the University of Duisburg-Essen, estimated 6,250 job cuts are required to achieve the necessary savings in production. \u201cThe shuttering of entire plants is therefore not excluded,\u201d he says. Tavares has pledged to honour GM\u2019s current contracts, which guarantee production of the Astra at Ellesmere Port until 2021, and the Vivaro van in Luton until 2025. That gives British workers some assurance about their jobs in the short term. But unions reckon talks about a new model to replace the Astra will start again some time next year. And unlike 2012, ministers and union bosses are likely to have less bargaining power in these negotiations. This time around, the already powerful French and German interests will be in the driver\u2019s seat. Factories inside the EU are sure to target Brexit and the tariff advantage their plants are likely to have over British rivals. Cable is gloomy about the prospect of outfoxing Opel this time. \u201cOf course, we didn\u2019t have to deal with Brexit, which has thrown a huge spanner in the works this time around,\u201d he says. \u201cIt probably makes it more difficult. \u201cGerman pressure is going to be huge. When we were negotiating for Ellesmere Port, there were people pushing from the German side because they didn\u2019t want Bochum to lose out. This time around it will be much more intense.\u201d Pointing to Brexit, the Opel brand\u2019s dominance overseas and the French government\u2019s shareholding in PSA, he repeats: \u201cAll these factors make it a lot more difficult.\u201d Tavares has already sent tremors through Westminster after signalling that he wants to create a \u201cEuropean automobile champion with German-French roots\u201d. It doesn\u2019t bode well for Vauxhall, which has been building cars in Britain since 1903 and was bought by GM in 1925. Trades unions don\u2019t want to leave anything to chance. \u201cThe uncertainty caused by Brexit is harming the UK auto sector,\u201d says Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite. \u201cWe need every assistance from the government to give this sector a fighting chance.\u201d",

On the flip side, cars made in Britain are likely to be cheaper for UK buyers than those from Germany, Spain or Italy, and if the government can strike trade deals with nations outside Europe, PSA\u2019s UK factories could tap into those markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aec4fc15888be7c90bcf55ee5542e81b0e50122b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aec4fc15888be7c90bcf55ee5542e81b0e50122b/0_0_4006_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vince Cable\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vince Cable: \u2018German pressure is going to be huge.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tavares hinted at this, noting the \u201cpotential opportunity\u201d that a hard Brexit might present \u201cto have inside of the UK some manufacturing plants\u201d.</p> <p>This may still mean slimming down operations until enough trade deals with other countries are inked in.</p> <p>The tie-up makes PSA, owner of the Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn marques, the second-biggest European carmaker \u2013 accelerating past Renault, but behind VW \u2013 with a 16% market share.</p> <p>Tavares has a reputation as a cost-cutter, and PSA, which is 14% owned by the French state, estimates savings and other benefits from the deal should reach \u20ac1.7bn on an annual basis.</p> <p>It said most of this would come from \u201csynergies\u201d \u2013 eliminating duplication in head-office functions such as marketing. However, analysts reckon there are sure to be large-scale job cuts, and even plant closures.</p> <p>Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, who leads the Centre for Automotive Research (CAR) at the University of Duisburg-Essen, estimated 6,250 job cuts are required to achieve the necessary savings in production. \u201cThe shuttering of entire plants is therefore not excluded,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Tavares has pledged to honour GM\u2019s current contracts, which guarantee production of the Astra at Ellesmere Port until 2021, and the Vivaro van in Luton until 2025. That gives British workers some assurance about their jobs in the short term.</p> <p>But unions reckon talks about a new model to replace the Astra will start again some time next year. And unlike 2012, ministers and union bosses are likely to have less bargaining power in these negotiations.</p> <p>This time around, the already powerful French and German interests will be in the driver\u2019s seat. Factories inside the EU are sure to target Brexit and the tariff advantage their plants are likely to have over British rivals.</p> <p>Cable is gloomy about the prospect of outfoxing Opel this time. \u201cOf course, we didn\u2019t have to deal with Brexit, which has thrown a huge spanner in the works this time around,\u201d he says. \u201cIt probably makes it more difficult.</p> <p>\u201cGerman pressure is going to be huge. When we were negotiating for Ellesmere Port, there were people pushing from the German side because they didn\u2019t want Bochum to lose out. This time around it will be much more intense.\u201d Pointing to Brexit, the Opel brand\u2019s dominance overseas and the French government\u2019s shareholding in PSA, he repeats: \u201cAll these factors make it a lot more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Tavares has already sent tremors through Westminster after signalling that he wants to create a \u201cEuropean automobile champion with German-French roots\u201d.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t bode well for Vauxhall, which has been building cars in Britain since 1903 and was bought by GM in 1925.</p> <p>Trades unions don\u2019t want to leave anything to chance. \u201cThe uncertainty caused by Brexit is harming the UK auto sector,\u201d says Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite. \u201cWe need every assistance from the government to give this sector a fighting chance.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "From a hilltop in Mas\u2019ade on the Israeli side of the Syrian border in the Golan Heights, Faried al-Said Ahmed surveys his cherry and apple trees 80 feet below. Barbed wire surrounds the steep hillside, preventing people entering a minefield planted when the Six-Day War ended 50 years ago. Currently, the trees are bare. Cherry-picking season is May and June, while 45,000 tons of apples will leave this co-operative farm after they ripen in September and October. Although Syrians are fighting less than three miles away and there\u2019s the danger of being blown up underfoot, Ahmed has a more pressing concern: the European Union. The co-operative sells fruit across Israel, but Ahmed claims that the EU\u2019s protection of its member states\u2019 farms makes exports to Europe all but impossible. \u201cIf it were possible to sell in England then, my God, yes, we would,\u201d he says. The 52-year-old may soon get his wish. When article 50 is triggered in the coming days, the UK will be only two years away from negotiating its own trade deals. The focus has been on an agreement with the US, but given the probable complications of negotiating with self-proclaimed master dealmaker Donald Trump, Israel might be first to sign on the dotted line. After talks in No 10 last month, Theresa May and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced a joint working group charged with \u201cpreparing the ground\u201d for a trade deal. The trade relationship between Israel and Britain is already worth \u00a34.9bn, and on Wednesday foreign secretary Boris Johnson told press in Jerusalem as he stood beside Netanyahu: \u201cWe are ... building a global identity as a Britain that\u2019s coming out of the EU and we want to build on our trading partnership with you. We are the biggest European trading partner with Israel \u2026 We have the largest, fastest-growing Aston Martin dealership anywhere in the world here in Israel.\u201d At his official residence on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, the British ambassador, David Quarrey, points to a growing economic relationship between the countries in the past 18 months. This included the biggest UK-Israel trade deal in history: Rolls-Royce landed a \u00a31bn contract to service and maintain its Trent 1000 engines for the airline El Al and, in the other direction, the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems is in a consortium that provides the Ministry of Defence with training aircraft and simulators. Quarrey says: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing trading bilateral relationships between the UK and Israel, in science and trade for example, doing better than ever. But there\u2019s the potential to do even better, particularly in the context of Brexit. I was with Theresa May and Benjamin Netanyahu in London and it was clear there was the determination for this. \u201cMost businesspeople in Israel look at the UK as a great place to do business, because of its culture, language, and the predictability of the regulatory and tax systems.\u201d Britain, in effect, outsourced trade negotiations to European bureaucrats in the 1970s, so the way the newly formed Department for International Trade (DIT) thrashes out the Israel deal could provide a template for other business agreements. It is understood that the first meeting of the working group will take place by the end of this month. Two to four people will represent each side, including officials from the DIT and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Economy. They will set the parameters for future discussions, expected to take place two or three times a year. Regulatory and industry experts will be brought in on an ad hoc basis thereafter. At present, UK\u2013Israel trade is covered by the latter\u2019s association agreement with the EU. James Sorene, the chief executive at the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre, says \u201cthe first priority will be to establish what preferential trade terms the UK is prepared to offer\u201d. Israelis are required to have work permits in the UK, though many are dual EU citizens and work freely in Britain. Given that this right would end on Brexit, Sorene points out: \u201cIf the UK\u2019s exit arrangements with the EU involve restricted movement for EU nationals this could indirectly cut the flow of Israeli tech workers to the UK, unless the UK designs a special arrangement for Israel.\u201d Technology is booming in Israel: Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft all have research centres there, and there are 300,000 hi-tech workers in a country of only 8.5 million people. The tech sector is likely to be prioritised during negotiations, alongside defence and pharmaceuticals \u2013 not least because one in seven NHS drugs come from Israel. Ron Atzmon, managing director of the ID authentication tech company Au10tix, wants the UK\u2013Israel relationship to replicate aspects of the EU, with harmonisation of VAT rates and intellectual property regulations. Coupled with more relaxed immigration rules, Atzmon says this would ensure Israeli tech firms will come to a UK where tech \u201cknowledge is not overflowing outside of London\u201d. Israel\u2019s phenomenal expertise in cybersecurity will particularly interest British negotiators, given the National Crime Agency confirmed last year that cybercrime is costing the UK economy \u201cbillions of pounds per annum\u201d. Sharren Haskel, a member of the Israeli parliament from the ruling Likud party, says: \u201cOne of the main areas we can co-operate is cybersecurity, where Israel is receiving 20% of worldwide investments \u2013 huge for such a small country.\u201d In turn, the UK\u2019s growing expertise in major infrastructure projects, such as high-speed rail, could benefit an Israel that is struggling to keep up with population growth because of a shortage of 10,000 engineers. Back on the ground, Kibbutz Nirim is overflowing with sweet potatoes and radishes. It is also covered with bomb shelters, because this green paradise in southern Israel is only two kilometres from the border of the Hamas-controlled Gaza strip. Should the Israel-Hamas conflict of 2014 have a sequel, as many Israelis fear will happen, an automated voice repeating the words tzeva adom \u2013 \u201ccolour red\u201d \u2013 will be played if mortars are fired on the kibbutz. This will give the 400 residents a seven-second warning to reach those shelters. But the eyes of Nirim\u2019s general secretary, Anat Heffetz, light up at the prospect of exporting all those vegetables to the UK. \u201cYes, of course, we would love to sell to Britain,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have excellent avocadoes \u2013 because my husband grows them!\u201d Other contenders Canada, Australia and New Zealand are top of the list of countries Brexit ministers believe will be willing and able to sign a trade deal soon after the UK quits the EU. Canada sealed a deal with the EU last year that covers goods and services from agriculture to banking. The UK will be excluded, but could quickly demolish trade barriers by simply adopting the deal itself, should premier Justin Trudeau believe it worth his while. The Brexit ministry is known to be scouting former Canadian negotiators to help get talks started. And more negotiators are crucial after 40 years without any, other than a handful of UK officials at the European commission. If cloning were an option, former trade minister Peter Mandelson might find himself duplicated several times, if only to fill meetings with more experienced heads than the UK has at the moment.Brexit ministers are keen to approach Donald Trump\u2019s administration to negotiate a trade deal, but will find it is more productive talking to Australia and New Zealand. Both countries have said they are interested in talks; they share the same legal system and much the same approach to trade. Australia is attempting to resurrect Barack Obama\u2019s Trans Pacific Partnership free trade deal without the US now that Donald Trump has killed it off, but should still be keen to open its market to the UK.

    "webTitle": "Shell\u2019s sale of dirty tar sands assets cleans up debt and spruces image", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Shell sold most of its Canadian tar sands operations last week, the Anglo-Dutch oil company took a modest step towards making good on its promise to be part of the solution on global warming, rather than the problem. Tar sands are reviled by climate change campaigners as one of the dirtiest forms of energy. The sands are a glutinous, bitumen-addled mix when extracted from the ground and a huge amount of energy is need to turn them into synthetic crude oil. Leading scientists have warned that exploiting tar sands would be \u201cgame over\u201d for tackling climate change, and Shell has faced shareholder rebellions in the past over the risks it faced from exploiting the carbon-intensive oil. But the $7.25bn (\u00a36bn) sale of the majority of its tar sands assets to an independent Canadian oil company is less about the company cleaning up its image than about cleaning up its debt. The deal is the largest single chunk so far in Shell\u2019s $30bn divestment programme, to pay for borrowing it incurred after buying gas giant BG Group for \u00a347bn. \u201cThere is a low-carbon element because these are some of the most carbon-intensive barrels in the oil sector. But it\u2019s more about a general industry trend we\u2019re seen around repositioning portfolios lower down the cost curve,\u201d said Tom Ellacott, senior vice-president of research at oil analysts Wood Mackenzie. While the divestment programme and a move to cheaper sources of oil will have driven the sale, Ellacott said he was sure the carbon-intensiveness of the sands was part of the company\u2019s thinking too. Tar sands are not just one of the dirtiest sources of oil, but one of the most expensive because of the high cost of turning them into usable fossil fuel. That is why big players are quitting the sector. Norwegian oil company Statoil completed the sale of its tar sands assets in January, and France\u2019s Total has sold some of its holdings. US oil giants Chevron and Exxon both downgraded their tar sands reserves because of historically low oil prices that have further reduced the profitability of such a cost-intensive asset. Of course, Shell is not leaving the tar sands game entirely. It is retaining assets including an upgrader plant, the extremely energy-intensive element of the process of turning the bitumen extracted from the ground into crude oil. The company does not want to overstate the carbon benefits of reducing its share in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Alberta \u2013 although it is keeping a 10% stake \u2013 and selling several undeveloped tar sands fields in the province. But it says the sale will bring about an absolute reduction in carbon emissions from its operations, which were 72 million tonnes last year. \u201cShell is a long-time supporter of government-led carbon pricing mechanisms globally and has been a vocal supporter of both Canada\u2019s and the state of Alberta\u2019s climate plans,\u201d said Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive. He said retaining stakes in the tar sands would help both those plans to succeed. Compared with some of its peers, the company talks more strongly about taking global warming seriously. \u201cWe believe climate change is real. We believe action is going to be needed. We believe we are in the middle of an energy transition that is unstoppable,\u201d Van Beurden said during the company\u2019s quarterly results presentation last month. He said the company \u201cwants to be in the vanguard\u201d of that transition to cleaner energy. Shell created a new energy division last year which is targeting an annual spend of $1bn by the end of the decade, or 4% of the $25bn capital expenditure it plans this year. Staffers say that although the proportion may seem small compared with the rest of the company, they are determined to increase it. Shell has become more \u201cgassy\u201d and less \u201coily\u201d in recent years, a trend accelerated by the acquisition of BG Group and helped by the tar sands sale. Production is around half oil and half gas, which is cleaner in carbon terms. Van Beurden is aware that getting out of tar sands has reputational benefits, as well as immediate financial ones. \u201cThe global energy system needs to evolve to one with net zero emissions,\u201d he said, arguing that Shell had a critical role to play in that transition. \u201cBut for us to play this role effectively will require trust, and to help build that trust our industry needs to reduce its own carbon intensity.\u201d Shell confirmed last week that it would tie 10% of executives\u2019 bonuses to management of greenhouse gas emissions, although the company has not said what those carbon targets are. Nevertheless, campaigners maintain that Shell\u2019s approach to climate change is not credible. Greg Muttitt, of the US-based NGO Oil Change International, said: \u201cShell is doing more to move from oil to gas than some of its competitors but that\u2019s not the right move \u2013 the move needs to be to step away from fossil fuels [and into renewables].\u201d",

But it\u2019s more about a general industry trend we\u2019re seen around repositioning portfolios lower down the cost curve,\u201d said Tom Ellacott, senior vice-president of research at oil analysts Wood Mackenzie.</p> <p>While the divestment programme and a move to cheaper sources of oil will have driven the sale, Ellacott said he was sure the carbon-intensiveness of the sands was part of the company\u2019s thinking too.</p> <p>Tar sands are not just one of the dirtiest sources of oil, but one of the most expensive because of the high cost of turning them into usable fossil fuel. That is why big players are quitting the sector. Norwegian oil company <a href=\"https://www.statoil.com/en/news/sells-oil-sands-business.html\" title=\"\">Statoil completed the sale of its tar sands assets in January</a>, and France\u2019s Total has sold some of its holdings.

      "bodyText": "Activists have called for shoppers to boycott Tesco after the supermarket\u2019s chairman claimed white men were becoming an \u201cendangered species\u201d in UK boardrooms. Politicians, business experts and women\u2019s groups have all spoken out against comments made by John Allan during a speech at the Retail Week Live conference a day after International Women\u2019s Day. In a session for aspiring non-executive directors, Allan said: \u201cIf you are female and from an ethnic background, and preferably both, then you are in an extremely propitious period. \u201cFor a thousand years, men have got most of these jobs, the pendulum has swung very significantly the other way now and will do for the foreseeable future, I think. If you are a white male, tough. You are an endangered species and you are going to have to work twice as hard.\u201d He later claimed the comments were meant to be humorous and that he was attempting to highlight the progress made in promoting BAME and female employees. Activists called for people to boycott Tesco in response. Sophie Walker, the leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, said she would be shopping elsewhere and that Allan was completely out of touch. \u201cFar from being in a \u2018propitious\u2019 position, any analysis of senior leadership roles in business will show the woeful under-representation of women and minority groups,\u201d she said. She pointed to data released by the Fawcett Society this week that showed the pay gap was influenced by racial as well as gender inequalities. \u201cWomen, and especially BME women, are a long way from endangering men\u2019s dominance of boardrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are seeing a resurgence of feminist protest and activism against the kind of attitudes Allan betrays with these comments. With him at the helm, Tesco not only risks missing out on female talent, it will also alienate customers. I plan on doing my shopping elsewhere this weekend.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Women\u2019s March London collective said: \u201cWe find Mr Allan\u2019s comments extraordinary \u2026 Women are responsible for the majority of grocery purchases in the UK. As consumers we are a powerful force and can exercise our freedom to shop elsewhere to support women and locally owned businesses. Tesco needs to urgently restructure its boards.\u201d In the private sector, women accounted for just 29% of directors appointed in the UK last year, according to the recruitment firm Egon Zehnder, the lowest proportion since 2012.

      "bodyText": "The shortage of British workers in UK hotels and restaurants is so severe that chains such as Pret a Manger will need 10 years to replace EU staff after Brexit, the British Hospitality Association has warned. Days after Pret\u2019s human resources director told MPs that just one in 50 applicants for jobs at the company were British, the BHA predicted that hotels and restaurants would go bust unless ministers allowed EU migrants to continue to work in low-skilled jobs after the UK leaves the bloc. \u201cIt is going to be very, very tough indeed,\u201d says Ufi Ibrahim, the BHA\u2019s chair. \u201cIt will be a very long time for businesses like Pret a Manger to replace EU staff because they are largely based in the south-east,\u201d she added. \u201cI think it will take 10 years to build a future talent pipeline.\u201d With its cosmopolitan young workforce, free food, paid breaks \u2013 and what the company itself describes as \u201clegendary\u201d staff parties \u2013 the question raised in the House of Lords this week was: why don\u2019t Brits want to work at Pret a Manger? Pret\u2019s head of HR, Andrea Wareham, told the economic affairs committee on Wednesday that 65% of the company\u2019s staff were from EU countries not including the UK. Raising wages, she said, would not attract more British staff. \u201cIt really is a case of do people want to work in our industry? We are not seen always as a desirable place to work,\u201d she told peers when challenged about why so few Britons work alongside the 109 other nationalities in Pret\u2019s 330 stores. At the company\u2019s recruitment centre at London\u2019s Victoria station this week there was no shortage of foreign applicants queuing up for interviews. \u201cSometimes we can go a whole day here without having a single Brit,\u201d said one young Pret executive. Nadia Amato, an Italian economics graduate, arrived in London 10 days ago and is trying her luck at Pret and rival Cafe Nero. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good job. In Italy working as a barista is not a bad thing,\u201d she said, adding that her first mission was to learn English. For Congo-born Elie Kankolongdu, 20, who has been in the UK for five years, Pret is a step up from working in warehouses for Tesco and Asda. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best restaurants in London,\u201d Kankolongdu said. \u201cThey do nice sandwiches and I think it\u2019s a nice place to work.\u201d Mourid Bouderun, a French Algerian, is currently a team leader at All Bar One but is looking for a change. \u201cBritish people don\u2019t want to work in the kitchen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard; it\u2019s a big problem for restaurants all over London. At All Bar One the people in the kitchen are all foreign.\u201d Bouderun\u2019s theory is supported by the anecdotal evidence of an elusive British Pret employee who contacted the Guardian. Steve (not his real name) says he has seen British workers walk out after a few weeks because they can\u2019t take the pressure. \u201cWe can make 250 coffees an hour and with just me on the coffee and six tills shouting their orders it can be absolutely insane,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced stress like it. It\u2019s not a hard job, but they do push you and push you. Towards customers I have a permanent smile on my face, but sometimes I\u2019ve been close to tears; it\u2019s just very intense. John, another Briton, tells a similar story. \u201cIn the first month it was very difficult. You\u2019re supposed to serve the coffee within a minute. After a month you get used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know people in Starbucks or McDonalds; [Pret] is the best of the bad jobs.\u201d Four years ago, when Pret was under fire from ministers for not hiring enough Britons, it set up a school-leaver\u2019s programme, with some success. But now, with more than two-thirds of its 7,500 staff potentially out of reach in post-Brexit Britain, the company is facing a much bigger challenge. The BHA is calling on the government to bolster its newly announced technical qualifications with better promotion within schools of non-academic careers, including hospitality. \u201cWe have to go back into the schools and present hospitality as a career option. to children between the ages of 11 and 14,\u201d Ibrahim said. In the meantime, she says Britain has to have continued access to a low-skilled EU workforce otherwise businesses face bankruptcy. Kathy Dyball, head of marketing at the hospitality job site Caterer.com, says parental attitude is also a challenge. \u201cIf a child says \u2018I want to be a chef\u2019 parents often dissuade them, because they believe the hours are long, the pay is low, it\u2019s not a secure career. It\u2019s a similar reaction to a child announcing they want to be an actor. \u201cBut the fact is, a job in hospitality often evolves into a highly paid and exciting career with international opportunities. It is just not as simplistic as saying British people don\u2019t want to work in hospitality, there are lots of layers to the challenge around the ongoing skills shortage.\u201d",

Towards customers I have a permanent smile on my face, but sometimes I\u2019ve been close to tears; it\u2019s just very intense. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/mar/08/just-one-in-50-job-applicants-british-says-pret-a-manger-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/642fp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3269266\"            data-video-name=\"Just one in 50 job applicants British, says Pret a Manger \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Parliamentlive.tv\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58c077aee4b0f24dba723119\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/03/08/170308ImmigrationCommittee_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/03/08/170308ImmigrationCommittee.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/03/08/170308ImmigrationCommittee_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/mar/08/just-one-in-50-job-applicants-british-says-pret-a-manger-video\">Just one in 50 job applicants British, says Pret a Manger</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>John, another Briton, tells a similar story. \u201cIn the first month it was very difficult. You\u2019re supposed to serve the coffee within a minute. After a month you get used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know people in Starbucks or McDonalds; [Pret] is the best of the bad jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Four years ago, when Pret was under fire from ministers for not hiring enough Britons, it set up a school-leaver\u2019s programme, with some success. But now, with more than two-thirds of its 7,500 staff potentially out of reach in post-Brexit Britain, the company is facing a much bigger challenge.</p> <p>The BHA is calling on the government to bolster its newly announced technical qualifications with better promotion within schools of non-academic careers, including hospitality. \u201cWe have to go back into the schools and present hospitality as a career option. to children between the ages of 11 and 14,\u201d Ibrahim said.<br></p> <p>In the meantime, she says Britain has to have continued access to a low-skilled EU workforce otherwise businesses face bankruptcy.</p> <p>Kathy Dyball, head of marketing at the hospitality job site Caterer.com, says parental attitude is also a challenge. \u201cIf a child says \u2018I want to be a chef\u2019 parents often dissuade them, because they believe the hours are long, the pay is low, it\u2019s not a secure career. It\u2019s a similar reaction to a child announcing they want to be an actor.</p> <p>\u201cBut the fact is, a job in hospitality often evolves into a highly paid and exciting career with international opportunities. It is just not as simplistic as saying British people don\u2019t want to work in hospitality, there are lots of layers to the challenge around the ongoing skills shortage.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "White men are becoming an endangered species in some of the most senior positions in business as firms try to recruit more women and people from minority ethnic backgrounds, Tesco\u2019s chairman has said. John Allan said the latter groups were in a better position now than they have been in the past when it came to non-executive roles, despite concerns that each remains under-represented in boardrooms. He later said his comments were meant to be humorous in nature. \u201cIf you are female and from an ethnic background \u2013 and preferably both \u2013 then you are in an extremely propitious period,\u201d Allan told the audience at a panel discussion. \u201cFor a thousand years, men have got most of these jobs, the pendulum has swung very significantly the other way now and will do for the foreseeable future, I think. If you are a white male, tough. You are an endangered species and you are going to have to work twice as hard.\u201d He told the Retail Week Live conference that he stood by his comments when it came to recruitment for the less powerful non-executive directorships, according to that magazine\u2019s own report. \u201cThere is loads of female talent out there, you have got to be prepared to look for it and you need to tell the headhunters that you really want them to serve up the most talented people they can find but to ensure there is a good mix,\u201d he said. \u201cTesco have appointed an almost completely new board ... in the last 18 months, we now have eight non-executive directors, six of whom are new, three of whom are women.\u201d There are no full-time female executives on Tesco\u2019s board. The proportion of female directors among FTSE 100 companies is 26%, while only 10% of executives at those same firms are women. According to reports last year, only 8% of those directors were not white. By contrast, people from minority ethnic backgrounds made up 14% of the UK\u2019s workforce at large. In 2015, the number of women on FTSE 100 boards exceeded the 25% target set out by Mervyn Davies in a government-backed review in 2011. But figures released last year indicated less than a quarter of the boardroom recruits in the six months to March 2016 were women, the lowest level since 2011. That prompted the then minister for women and equalities, Nicky Morgan, to say that the \u201cmomentum has not kept pace\u201d. She added that there are \u201cstill more [people] called John chairing FTSE 100 boards than there are women\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian on Friday night, Allan insisted that his comments were meant partly in jest. \u201cThe context was [that] I was talking to a bunch of aspiring non-executive directors, many of whom were women, and I wanted to give them some encouragement and, therefore, I used that rather colourful turn of speech,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the audience, I think, was quite amused and quite enjoyed it. \u201cIt was intended to be humorous, a bit hyperbolic. Clearly, white men are not literally an endangered species but I was actually wanting the make the reverse point, which is that it is a great time for women and people of ethnic minorities who want to get on in business.\u201d",
