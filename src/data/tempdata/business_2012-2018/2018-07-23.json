      "bodyText": "Ministers will have the power to block foreign takeovers across all sectors of the British economy on national security grounds under new government proposals designed to protect some of the UK\u2019s most important and technically advanced businesses. The business secretary, Greg Clark, wants to widen the scope of the current system, which is limited to large transactions and certain industries such as defence, to cover all UK firms including small businesses as he seeks to keep vital firms and technologies out of foreign ownership. The proposals, which will be subject to a 12-week consultation, will allow ministers to halt or unwind takeovers and even the smallest asset sales that could be deemed to jeopardise Britain\u2019s national security. Potential targets under the new rules are likely to be Chinese and Russian takeovers of defence-related industries. Technology firms, including cybersecurity businesses that already have links with the Ministry of Defence, or are viewed as crucial to the development of the UK\u2019s financial and commercial defence systems, are also expected to top the list of ministers\u2019 national security concerns. Clark allowed the \u00a374m takeover of the handset maker Sepura by the Hytera Corporation of China last year, making it only the second review of a transaction on national security grounds in 18 months, after the MoD raised concerns this month over the sale of Northern Aerospace to a Chinese buyer. The Competition and Markets Authority later cleared the Northern Aerospace transaction, by which time it had lapsed. Under the proposals, buyers and sellers will be under no obligation to notify civil servants of a purchase, but face five years in jail if they are found guilty of infringing the new regime. The sale of 50% of an asset or 25% of shares in a business will be enough to trigger a review if it raises national security concerns. An asset could include software designs, manufacturing processes or intellectual property. The Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) expects civil servants to consider 200 cases a year under the new rules, leading to 100 formal reviews of which 50 will result in remedies, which could range from deals being blocked to ministers imposing conditions on a sale. Some lawyers have argued that the proposals would result in a radical change in the UK investment landscape and could subject a broad range of transactions to potentially costly and lengthy reviews. The white paper, which follows similar moves by France, Germany, the US and Australia to give ministers greater powers, will require civil servants to review each case within 15 days of notification. Under the current rules stemming from the 2002 Enterprise Act, ministers can only intervene in mergers worth more than \u00a370m and only on limited grounds. New rules will cut the minimum threshold to zero on all deals. Certain industries will be cited as the most likely to targeted, but all business transactions will potentially fall under the new system. Ministers are understood to believe that the race to secure the latest defence-related technologies will lead to a spate of takeovers and asset sales by foreign firms. The industry minister Richard Harrington said last month: \u201cThese new rules ensure mergers and takeovers in key areas of the economy cannot risk our national security, while maintaining the openness to trade and investment that is underpinned by our modern industrial strategy.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on 24 July 2018 to correct the consultation period to 12 weeks in the fourth paragraph and clarify that the minimum threshold for intervening on mergers will fall to zero",

The Irish group can restrict the voting rights of non-EU shareholders, which would include UK investors, in order to comply with ownership rules of EU-based airlines. It can also be confident that a UK operating licence to protect its UK domestic routes will be forthcoming. The show will go on. A greater long-term risk, at least for shareholders, is that the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, could struggle to adapt to his unfamiliar role of negotiating with trade unions. Union recognition is new at Ryanair and the experience is proving less than happy. Monday\u2019s first-quarter trading update contained three paragraphs on strikes and one on Brexit, which may reflect on how much time the management is spending on each issue. O\u2019Leary veered between championing Ryanair\u2019s supposed generosity, in the form of a 20% five-year pay deal for pilots, and belligerence. Ryanair is \u201cnot prepared to concede to unreasonable demands that will compromise either our low fares or our highly efficient model\u201d, he stated. The City will applaud the tough stance only as long as it gets results. The 6% fall in the share price betrayed the worries. One factor behind the current \u201cweaker\u201d environment for prices was described as \u201ccustomer uncertainty about pilot strikes\u201d, meaning some fares have had to be trimmed to keep planes 96% full. Meanwhile, O\u2019Leary is already threatening to move planes out of Ireland this winter and force job losses if strikes by a \u201csmall minority\u201d of Irish pilots continue. These scraps could fizzle out, of course, and the group is sticking to its forecast that after-tax profits will arrive at \u20ac1.25bn (\u00a31.1bn) to \u20ac1.35bn for the full-year. However, it seems equally possible that industrial relations at Ryanair becomes a long-running saga. Indeed in one sense it already has. The rostering errors that led to the airline recognising unions happened 10 months ago \u2013 and still the fallout continues. GlaxoSmithKline can afford to be patient Emma Walmsley, the chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, probably thought she had already killed the idea of breaking up the company. A year ago, fresh in post, she set out her thinking: GSK would stick with its strategy of housing three businesses \u2013 pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer products \u2013 under one roof. Vaccines and consumer brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste produced reliable cashflows, she argued, and thus provided a natural balance to the more volatile game of developing prescription medicines. Besides, there are benefits that come from being able to switch drugs to the consumer category when patents expire. The stance seemed very reasonable. Yet the breakup lobby was never wholly silenced and could be heard again at the weekend as the FT reported that some big investors were lobbying GSK\u2019s chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, to consider spinning off the consumer division. Walmsley will thus have to revisit the subject at Wednesday\u2019s half-year figures. She should stick to her guns: a grand de-merger would be a distraction that GSK does not need at this moment. Walmsley\u2019s plan A is to reinvigorate the drug pipeline and she has hired some big pharma names on even bigger pay packages, including Hal Barron as chief scientific officer, to get results. If that\u2019s the strategy, give it time to work. GSK shareholders are being paid to be patient in the form of an 80p-a-share annual dividend that has been maintained through major patent hits and asset shuffles under her predecessor. Now is not the moment to change direction. Whiff of the past for water industry United Utilities, as it prepares to pay \u00a3181m in dividends to shareholders next month, two days before the likely start of a hosepipe ban, should recall a cautionary tale from the water industry a generation ago. It was in 1995 that Trevor Newton, the then boss of Yorkshire Water, failed to show the necessary sympathy for customers during a drought when he urged them to save water with these stirring words: \u201cI personally haven\u2019t had a bath or a shower for three months.\u201d Cue many jokes about \u201cthe filthy rich\u201d. Newton became a laughing stock and was gone within a year. Steve Mogford, the current chief executive of United Utilities, has avoided such PR howlers but he can surely appreciate that record shareholder dividends do not sit well with hosepipe bans, especially when your pipes are the second most leaky in the industry. The fact that United\u2019s leakage rates are Ofwat-compliant is interesting but, in the end, irrelevant. A boss who has earned \u00a312m in five years is expected to look out for the company\u2019s reputation. A personal pledge not to take a bonus this year is the minimum requirement.",

    "webTitle": "Australia\u2019s tax base is collapsing and we are on a collision course with reality | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A report by the Parliamentary Budget Office on the trends of taxation should sound a large warning to governments around Australia. Our tax base is narrowing at a time when the needs of spending on areas such as pensions and healthcare are growing. Unless changes are made, the government will be forced to either cut spending on services and benefits, or its ability to consistently deliver a surplus will be ever more unlikely. The Parliamentary Budget Office is a fully independent agency that unlike Treasury or the finance department does not report to the government. As such, it is able to deliver some hard truths. And its latest report on trends affecting the sustainability of commonwealth taxes is full of problems governments like to pretend don\u2019t exist. While, as I have noted, at the moment the government is getting a nice influx of revenue, the PBO warns all signs are directed towards our tax revenue base shrinking. The reason is a mixture of politics, policy and how we live our lives. Taxes essentially come from three areas \u2013 labour, capital and consumption. Since 2001-02, when the GST had come into effect, the PBO has found that all three categories have fallen with the biggest fall coming from consumption. The largest fall has come via the drop in the amount of fuel excise that has been collected \u2013 down 0.6% of GDP: This fall is the perfect example of the mix of politics, policy and change in lifestyle that has led to lower tax revenue. In March 2001, in panic at the polls, John Howard froze the indexation on fuel excise \u2013 no longer would it rise in line with inflation. As a result, billions of dollars in tax revenue were forgone for no good economic reason, but purely so Howard could say he was delivering cheaper petrol. Joe Hockey reversed this decision in 2014, but the problem is that the cars we drive now are much more efficient \u2013 meaning we use less fuel per kilometre we drive and thus we pay less tax as well: And this is only going to be further affected with the increased uptake of electric cars. Fuel excise makes up 5% of all commonwealth tax revenue \u2013 what do you do when people stop using fuel? Our consumption habits have similarly affected tobacco excise. While the level of excise has risen dramatically over the past 15 years, the amount of tobacco being smoked has fallen equally dramatically. That is good for our health, but does represent a narrowing of the tax base. Meanwhile our policy towards free-trade agreements has helped reduce the price of goods, but it has also reduced the amount of import excise that is raised. And while the level of excises has been falling, so too has the level of company taxes relative to profits. In 2007-08, company profits were worth 23.9% of GDP \u2013 slightly above the 23.8% recorded in 2016-17, and yet in 2007-08 company taxes were worth 3.9% of GDP compared to just 2.6% in 2016-17: The reason, as the PBO notes, is that losses from previous years are now being offset against profits to reduce the taxable income. This should reduce in time, but the PBO worries that international tax planning practices designed to minimise tax liabilities will continue to erode the company tax base. It also notes that while the company tax is being planned to be cut, unlike previously the tax cuts are not being accompanied with a broadening of the tax base by removing concessions or adding new taxes that keep the \u201ceffective tax rate\u201d relatively level. This occurred for example in the 1980s, when the company tax cut from 49% to 39% at the same time capital gains and fringe-benefits taxes were introduced. The PBO notes that \u201cthe progressive reduction in Australia\u2019s company tax rate over the period to 2026-27, in the absence of any expansion of the company tax base, would be expected to put downward pressure on company tax receipts as a share of GDP\u201d. That would certainly reflect what has occurred in the US where the company tax cuts have led company tax revenue dropping off a cliff: The PBO also sees few prospects for improved collection of the recourses rent tax despite increasing oil and LNG exports: The PBO notes that the cost of developing the LNG projects has been higher than initially estimated and the falling price of LNG means companies will be able to reduce their liabilities even as Australia becomes the world\u2019s leading producer and exporter of LNG. All this has meant that recently our dependence upon taxes from labour \u2013 personal income tax, fringe benefits tax and superannuation contributions \u2013 has risen to its highest levels since the GST was introduced: And the GST itself is also the product of the interaction of politics, policy and household behaviour. In order to get the GST through the Senate, the Howard government did a deal with the Australian Democrats that saw food, health, education and other items excluded. Since the GST was introduced while households have continued to buy the same amount of things subject to GST, they have become much cheaper: And that means we have shifted our spending towards things that are GST free \u2013 especially rent, health, and education. We have not, however, shifted our spending habits towards GST-free food, as we now eat out much more than we did 18 years ago: It means that one way to redresses the narrowing of out tax base would be to include some excluded items under the GST banner. The problem is that the burden of paying for rent and food is much greater for poorer people, meaning including them in the GST would be highly regressive. But including health and education would not be \u2013 although, in the case of health, it would hit older people more than younger ones: But such moves are not even remotely likely to occur. The collision of politics, policy and household behaviour invariably works against any moves to raise the level of tax \u2013 especially on the GST. And coupled with the governments\u2019 moves to cut taxes at a time of a shrinking base, we remain headed for a collision of reality where either revenue will need to be raised, or government spending on services and benefits will have to be cut. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australian columnist",

Since 2001-02, when the GST had come into effect, the PBO has found that all three categories have fallen with the biggest fall coming from consumption.</p> <p>The largest fall has come via the drop in the amount of fuel excise that has been collected \u2013 down 0.6% of GDP:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in tax receipts as a share of GDP, 2001\u201302 to 2015\u201316\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vFyvD/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This fall is the perfect example of the mix of politics, policy and change in lifestyle that has led to lower tax revenue.</p> <p>In March 2001, in panic at the polls, John Howard froze the indexation on fuel excise \u2013 no longer would it rise in line with inflation. As a result, billions of dollars in tax revenue were forgone for no good economic reason, but purely so Howard could say he was delivering cheaper petrol.</p> <p>Joe Hockey reversed this decision in 2014, but the problem is that the cars we drive now are much more efficient \u2013 meaning we use less fuel per kilometre we drive and thus we pay less tax as well:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fuel excise and average passenger car fuel consumption\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hjQB4/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And this is only going to be further affected with the increased uptake of electric cars. Fuel excise makes up 5% of all commonwealth tax revenue \u2013 what do you do when people stop using fuel?</p> <p>Our consumption habits have similarly affected tobacco excise. While the level of excise has risen dramatically over the past 15 years, the amount of tobacco being smoked has fallen equally dramatically. That is good for our health, but does represent a narrowing of the tax base.</p> <p>Meanwhile our policy towards free-trade agreements has helped reduce the price of goods, but it has also reduced the amount of import excise that is raised.</p> <p>And while the level of excises has been falling, so too has the level of company taxes relative to profits.</p> <p>In 2007-08, company profits were worth 23.9% of GDP \u2013 slightly above the 23.8% recorded in 2016-17, and yet in 2007-08 company taxes were worth 3.9% of GDP compared to just 2.6% in 2016-17:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Company profits and taxes\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ajiMN/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The reason, as the PBO notes, is that losses from previous years are now being offset against profits to reduce the taxable income.

      "bodyText": "Orchards in one of Britain\u2019s biggest cider-making regions face being bulldozed because the drinks giant Heineken is pulling the plug on apple-growing contracts. The Dutch brewer \u2013 which has owned Herefordshire-based Bulmers since 2008 \u2013 uses around a third of all the cider-apples grown in the UK. About 180 orchard owners, mostly based in Herefordshire, supply the fruit. Improved productivity, an oversupply of UK-grown apples and a shift among drinkers to sweet fruit ciders has resulted in a glut of the bittersweet apple varieties that make up the backbone of traditional mass-market fare, such as Heineken\u2019s Strongbow. Heineken, the biggest cider producer in the world, is negotiating compensation packages to buy some growers out of their long-term contracts, leaving a question mark hanging over the future of their trees. Grove Farm, at Kimbolton, Herefordshire, has been supplying Bulmers\u2019 cider presses with apples for almost 60 years, recently contributing an annual 50 tonnes. Tim Bunting, who has managed the farm since 1983, said he is desperately seeking a buyer for this year\u2019s harvest after Heineken cancelled his contract in February. Bunting fears he may have to bulldoze his 70-year-old orchard \u2013 home to seven traditional bittersweet apple varieties, such as Brown\u2019s, Vilberie and Dabinett \u2013 and turn it into farmland. He said: \u201cI\u2019m loth to get the bulldozers in but that would be the easiest option. I have to be realistic.\u201d Bunting explained he had an annually renewed \u201csupply agreement\u201d with Heineken, which does not warrant a compensation buyout. A neighbouring farmer, Colin Rogers, 71, is in the same predicament after Heineken refused to renew his contract. He said: \u201cWe need to find a home for this year\u2019s harvest. A few small-scale cider-makers have shown some interest but they only want a tonne or so at a time. \u201cIt\u2019s possible we\u2019ll have to bulldoze the trees. Heineken have said not to be so drastic but what are we supposed to do with all the fruit? You can\u2019t leave so many apples on the ground if you\u2019re using it for grazing \u2013 they\u2019ll kill sheep. I\u2019ve seen cows drunk from eating too many.\u201d Heineken said it was speaking to growers on a case-by-case basis, pointing out that some agreements were due to expire naturally. A spokesperson for the company, which in the UK processes more than 100,000 tonnes of apples a year, said: \u201cHeineken is committed to Herefordshire, investing \u00a358m over the past few years to upgrade our operations. We have positive long-term relationships with our growers, supporting them to improve the productivity and sustainability of their orchards. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely in partnership with our growers and are committed to ensuring a sustainable long-term supply of cider apples.\u201d",

France\u2019s CAC shed 0.5% while the German DAX dipped by 0.1%. Geopolitical anxiety is weighing on shares, says David Madden of CMC Markets. Stocks are broadly lower as dealers remain nervous about the state of global trading relations. European equities have lost ground as the prospect of a full-blown trade war is weighing on investor confidence. That\u2019s probably all for today... US home sales - the other economic data of note today - are out. And they show that sales fell in June for the third month running, down 0.6% to an annual rate of 5.38 million units, from 5.41 million in May. House prices rose, though - with the average price up 5% year-on-year to $276,900. This suggests a shortage of properties on the market is keeping prices up, leaving some potential buyers unable to get on the housing ladder. Just in: there was no pick-up in consumer confidence across the eurozone in July, according to the EC\u2019s monthly healthcheck: Having blasted president Rouhani, Donald Trump has turned his attention to another adversary - Jeff Bezos. Trump has tweeted that the \u201cAmazon Washington Post\u201d (er, what?) has \u201cgone crazy\u201d in its recent coverage of him, and repeated his claim that the e-commerce giant isn\u2019t paying the postal service enough. Over the weekend, the Washington Post (owned by Amazon-founder Bezos) reported that Trump was privately frustrated with the slow progress in negotiations with North Korea. Trump\u2019s attack has knocked Amazon\u2019s share price down by almost 2%: Incidentally, that Supreme Court ruling cited by Trump should allow states to collect more sales tax from e-commerce companies. But it could actually be a win for Amazon, analysts say, as the company already collects sales tax on products it sells directly to US citizens. Wall Street has opened cautiously, as traders wait for Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) to report its results tonight. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average have both dipped by around 0.1%, following the G20\u2019s warning against a trade war. In other auto news, Tesla shares have fallen over 3% in pre-market trading in New York, following reports that it had asked supplies for a financial helping hand. The Wall Street Journal says Tesla has asked some of its suppliers to refund some of its previous spending, as it strives to reach profitability. The WSJ wrote: \u201cThe Silicon Valley electric car company said it is asking its suppliers for cash back to help it become profitable, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that was sent to a supplier last week. Tesla requested the supplier return what it calls a meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016, according to the memo.\u201d CEO Elon Musk has now confirmed that Tesla is seeking cost reductions from suppliers. Tesla has been burning through its cash pile as it strives to hit its production targets, particularly for its Model 3 vehicle ActivTrades\u2019 chief analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa says Sergio Marchionne \u2018s dramatic resignation from Fiat Chrysler has caught everyone by surprise, even insiders at the auto firm. He explains how Marchionne rebuilt Fiat\u2019s fortunes, cutting costs (controversially) and boosting revenues Loved or hated Marchionne is the man who made FCA as we know it today. It is difficult to imagine FCA and Ferrari without the man and his unique style. He wore a sweater rather than the traditional suite and a tie as his every day business attire and with is unconventional leadership style he managed to turnaround one of Italy\u2019s biggest \u2013 and often most troubled--industrial realities. Chosen by Umberto Agnelli on his deathbed, Marchionne took the helm of a an almost bankrupt Fiat 14 years ago and turned it into an international powerhouse. This required sacrifices and controversial decisions, including job cuts and an unpopular \u2018denationalization\u2019 of the company. The relationship between Fiat and Italy, as well as its hometown of Turin, has changed, including from a legal and fiscal point of view, being FCA a Dutch company with fiscal domicile in the UK. The evolution of the company under its guidance is easily summarised in a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u2019s revenue was close to \u20ac47bn, today its exceeds \u20ac140bn. The company profit trebled from \u20ac1.5bn in 2004 to \u20ac4.4bn in 2017, while the stock market capitalization of the FCA universe spiralled from \u20ac5.5bn to \u20ac60bn. After just a weekend to absorb the news markets are now dealing with its consequences. The importance of Marchionne as a leader emerged from the very first minutes after the bell, with FCA, Ferrari and the holding Exor (all these 3 stocks belongs to the FTSE MIB 40, the main basket of the Italian market) opening with heavy losses. Even more under pressure was Ferrari, where Marchionne\u2019s presidency should have continued beyond 2019. But after the initial shock the titles of the Fiat galaxy have started to regain some ground: another sign of Marchionne\u2019s talent: he managed to grow Fiat thanks to his personality, but building a future for the company independent from himself. A future that starts with Jeep, one of the brands that grew the most in recent years, from which the new CEO, Brit Michael Manley, comes from. Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler is facing a very uncertain future today following the shock resignation of long-serving CEO Sergio Marchionne over the weekend. It\u2019s a sad tale - Marchionne had run Fiat for over a decade, masterminding the rescue of America\u2019s Chrysler after the financial crisis. Its share price surged on Marchionne\u2019s watch, as he rebuilt Chrysler and also successfully spun off Ferrari, Fiat\u2019s ultra-luxurious brand. But his stint has ended too soon; complications following shoulder surgery forced Marchionne to step aside over the weekend. Fiat Chryster\u2019s board have moved quickly, promoting Michael Manley, the head of the group\u2019s Jeep brand, as their new CEO. Manley, aged 54, was born in London and trained as an engineer. Jeep is one of Fiat\u2019s success stories of the last decade. But Fiat shares have fallen 3.3% today, as investors fret about how the company will cope without Marchionne\u2019s experience, wisdom, and work ethic. Bloomberg\u2019s Tommaso Ebhardt has written a touching account of his time trying (and usually failing) to get an interview with Marchionne. Here\u2019s a flavour: It was not easy for Marchionne\u2019s aides and for everyone at the the Italian-American company. He demanded full dedication and had a constant sense of urgency. That cost him some talented executives. Marchionne could also be brutal, which hurt his relationships with CEOs in the industry and with political leaders. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for BS,\u201d he used to tell me. The son of a policeman, who moved with his family from Italy to a suburb of Toronto at the age of 14, he joined Fiat in 2004 with no experience in the car industry. Marchionne had planned to retire next year, Ebhardy adds: At the dinner in Michigan, the night before his last Detroit auto show, he acknowledged the time was coming to spend more time with his partner. \u201cThis business, if you want to do it at least the way I think it should be done, it is all -consuming,\u201d he said, describing 14- and 16-hour days doing everything from approving Super Bowl commercials to deciding on electric cars. \u201cNow I am tired, I want to do something else.\u201d In another blow to Fiat, there are reports that its European chief, Alfredo Altavilla, has stepped down. He was seen as a possible candidate to replace Marchionne, before Manley got the job.... Germany\u2019s economy is perking up, despite the threat posed by trade tariffs to its export base. That\u2019s according to the Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, in its monthly assessment of Europe\u2019s largest economy. It says: \u201cThe economy has likely showed better momentum in the spring than at the start of the year. Although it is unlikely that the high growth rates of the past year will be repeated, manufacturing was once again the key economic driving force.\u201d Germany would welcome a pick-up in growth. GDP only rose by 0.3% in the first three months of this year, down from 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017. The oil price is creeping higher, following Donald Trump\u2019s blast towards Iranian president Hassan Rouhani a few hours ago. It\u2019s a fairly modest rally, though; Brent crude is up almost 1% at $73.72 per barrel, which doesn\u2019t suggest the markets are pricing in a new conflict in the Middle East. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote Bank says investors are remembering how Trump tackled North Korea - furious tweets were followed by encouraging noises, and an all-smiles summit with Kim Jong-un. Masset explains: Market participants appeared not too concerned: they are used to Trump\u2019s exaggerations. Last summer he promised \u201cfire and fury\u201d to North Korea: a year later Kim and Donald are best friends and North Korea has not shut down nuclear production Ryanair is dragging the European markets down, after the budget airline posted a 20% drop in profits. Worryingly for passengers, Ryanair also warned that recent strikes will probably continue this summer, due to an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions with its pilots and cabin crews. Ryanair also warned that the risk of a hard Brexit is \u201c being underestimated.\u201d, helping to send its shares down over 5% this morning. Rival airline easyJet\u2019s shares are down almost 2%, leading the FTSE 100 fallers in London. European stock markets are solidly in the red this morning, as traders digest the G20\u2019s warning on trade tensions. In London the FTSE 100 has lost almost 50 points, or 0.6%, at 7629. Commodity prices are also dipping, reflecting worries that a trade wars will hit demand for agricultural goods. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says investors are focusing on the \u201cunsurprisingly inconclusive G20 meeting\u201d, and Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. In other geopolitical development, Donald Trump has launched a late-night, CAPS-LOCKED blast at Iran: Trump\u2019s ire was sparked after Iranian president Hassan Rouhani warned that the US would regret getting into a conflict with Iran, saying: \u201cMr Trump, don\u2019t play with the lion\u2019s tail, this would only lead to regret.\u201d America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.\u201d The financial markets don\u2019t seem to be taking the war of words too seriously, though, says Paul Donovan of UBS: US President Trump sent out a tweet threatening Iran with all sorts of dire consequences if Iran is mean about the US. The tweet used lots and lots of capital letters. The oil market, understandably reacted \u2013 oil prices fell a tiny bit. It is possible that US President Trump is unfamiliar with Aesop\u2019s fable of the boy who cried \u201cwolf.\u201d After North Korea, markets are less inclined to take the US president seriously. Newsflash: China has fired a warning shot towards Donald Trump after he threatened to slap tariffs on all its exports to America. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that threats and intimidation on trade won\u2019t work. He added that China didn\u2019t need to devalue its currency to aid its exports. The yuan strengthened a little today, and is trading around 6.778 to the US dollar, up from 6.81 on Friday. Anti-austerity demonstrators held protests against the G20 and the International Monetary Fund, outside the meeting in Buenos Aires. There was clear anger about Argentina\u2019s decision to seek a $50bn loan from the IMF, with strict promises to cut spending to bring its deficit down. Unions fear the plan will cost thousands of public sector jobs, and recreate the suffering seen in Greece since its debt crisis began. \u201cTo jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war\u201d, as Churchill put it. But the talking at the G20 meeting hasn\u2019t yielded a breakthrough in the Washington-Beijing trade row. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reports there had not been any \u201csubstantive discussions\u201d with China about trade during the gathering in Argentina. He also argued that the ball is now in their court, saying: \u201cAnytime that they want to sit down and negotiate meaningful changes, I and our team are available.\u201d Mnuchin also denied that America was being protectionist, insisting that it simply wants trade to be conducted on \u201cfair and reciprocal terms.\u201d The G20 meeting has provided fresh evidence that America and her allies (or \u2018foes\u2019, as Donald Trump sometimes sees them) remain split over trade policies. EU financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici hit out at president Trump\u2019s recent tariffs, warning that no-one would win from a trade war. He told a press conference after the meeting that: \u201cProtectionism, I want to insist on that, is good for no one. \u201cTrade wars are not easy ... they create no winners, only casualties.\u201d Moscovici also warned that trade disputes could get worse, given the \u2018very challenging\u2019 state of global relations. As he put it: \u201cThese meetings have been taking place in an international context which is very challenging. ... Trade tensions remain high and they threaten to escalate further. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Anxiety over a trade war continues to build, after finance ministers and central bankers warned that the risks facing the global economy are risking. After a sometimes bruising G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, finance chiefs from the world\u2019s advanced economies cautioned that growth is becoming \u201cless synchronised\u201d. With inequality rising and geopolitical tensions bubbling away, the G20 fear that the risks to the financial recovery are rising. The G20 meeting ended with a call for more dialogue to prevent trade disputes -- just a few days after US president Trump rattled the markets by threatening to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. The communique declared that: \u201cGlobal economic growth remains robust and unemployment is at a decade low,. \u201cHowever, growth has been less synchronised recently, and downside risks over the short and medium term have increased.\u201d The G20 cited a series of risks... \u201cThese include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, global imbalances, inequality and structurally weak growth, particularly in some advanced economies. We ... recognize the need to step up dialogue and actions to mitigate risks and enhance confidence.\u201d These stern words from the G20 are unlikely to deter Trump from pushing his America First agenda, though. So, the threat of a trade war continues to weigh on investors Asian markets are having a mixed day, with Japan\u2019s Topix down 0.35% and the Australian S&amp;P/ASX 290 down almost 1%. Shares are also dipping in early trading in London, with the FTSE 100 down 0.35% or 26 points at 7652. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: No progress at the G20 over trade issues means trade jitters are being sent through the markets. Asian equity markets dropped lower as traders took risk off the table, whilst flows into safe haven assets were once again on the increase. Safe haven Japanese yen was seen extending Friday\u2019s 0.9% gain versus the dollar, whilst gold followed a similar pattern. European futures are also pointing to a lower start after the opening bell. There\u2019s not much economic data to distract the City today, apart from US house sales and eurozone consumer confidence data this afternoon.

The relationship between Fiat and Italy, as well as its hometown of Turin, has changed, including from a legal and fiscal point of view, being FCA a Dutch company with fiscal domicile in the UK.</p> <p>The evolution of the company under its guidance is easily summarised in a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u2019s revenue was close to \u20ac47bn, today its exceeds \u20ac140bn. The company profit trebled from \u20ac1.5bn in 2004 to \u20ac4.4bn in 2017, while the stock market capitalization of the FCA universe spiralled from \u20ac5.5bn to \u20ac60bn.</p> <p>After just a weekend to absorb the news markets are now dealing with its consequences. The importance of Marchionne as a leader emerged from the very first minutes after the bell, with FCA, Ferrari and the holding Exor (all these 3 stocks belongs to the FTSE MIB 40, the main basket of the Italian market) opening with heavy losses. Even more under pressure was Ferrari, where Marchionne\u2019s presidency should have continued beyond 2019. But after the initial shock the titles of the Fiat galaxy have started to regain some ground: another sign of Marchionne\u2019s talent: he managed to grow Fiat thanks to his personality, but building a future for the company independent from himself. A future that starts with Jeep, one of the brands that grew the most in recent years, from which the new CEO, Brit Michael Manley, comes from.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b55b40be4b0f7abbc8f153c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-23T11:18:42.982Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fiat shares slide after Marchionne steps down</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a04c78319a60cc726471003f98ece221ec7c8882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a04c78319a60cc726471003f98ece221ec7c8882/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler is facing a very uncertain future today following the shock resignation of long-serving CEO Sergio Marchionne over the weekend.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a sad tale - Marchionne had run Fiat for over a decade, masterminding the rescue of America\u2019s Chrysler after the financial crisis.

Stagecoach said the single-decker bus will run autonomously only in its depots until laws change to allow it to carry passengers. Work is being carried out to adapt the bus with the same technology used on driverless pods recently used in a trial in Greenwich, south-east London. The operator said the bus would be able to park in depots and drive itself to refuelling and wash points. No driver will be required when it is off public roads. Stagecoach said it believed wider use of self-driving buses could be safer, more efficient and save space within its depots. Even on the road with a driver, the bus could be safer for other road users, with the sensor system able to give more warning of cyclists or pedestrians in blind spots or unexpected proximity. Stagecoach\u2019s UK bus engineering director, Sam Greer, said the bus, which is being designed in partnership with the manufacturer Alexander Dennis Limited and the technology company Fusion Processing, was an exciting project that \u201ccould, in time, help improve safety and efficiency within our depots, and over the longer term, help transform bus travel in the future\u201d. The move by a traditional bus operator using a full-size vehicle could mark a fresh step towards wider adoption of autonomous vehicles in the UK, where so far only pods and smaller shuttle vehicles have carried passengers in public spaces. Passenger services using small driverless vehicles have been given trials in France, while China has already tested larger driverless buses on major city roads in Shenzhen. The trials in Greenwich suggested that passengers might embrace larger autonomous vehicles more readily than pods when it comes to public transport. While driverless trains have long run in the area, researchers found that those testing the four- to-six-seater shuttles had concerns about using them with strangers, with 85% of users saying they were happy with autonomous technology but only 46% happy to ride share. Most said they were also unwilling to pay a significant premium over a normal bus fare to use driverless pods.",

    "webTitle": "Starbucks is banning straws \u2013 but is it really a big win for the environment?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This month, Starbucks joined a growing movement to ban single-use plastic straws, announcing it would eliminate the items from its stores by 2020. In their place, the company will be introducing strawless lids, which have a sippable protrusion. It will also make alternative-material straws available. Starbucks already has strawless lids available in more than 8,000 of its North American stores. These were developed for its \u201cNitro\u201d coffee beverages which have a creamy top and are best drunk without a straw. Now, however, the coffee chain will be making the Nitro lids standard for all cold beverages, most of which now come with straws. Cold beverages make up more than 50% of Starbucks\u2019s beverage mix, an increase from 37% just five years ago. The Seattle-based coffee chain estimates that this move will eliminate more than 1bn plastic straws a year across its more than 28,000 stores around the world. It\u2019s a big win for anti-straw advocates. But is it really a big win for the environment? Reason, a magazine and blog published by the rightwing Reason Foundation, has claimed that the Nitro lids Starbucks will be making standard use more plastic than a combination of the company\u2019s current lids and plastic straws. Some social media users have also noticed that the Nitro lids are noticeably thicker than the current lids and have speculated about whether they will really be better for the environment. The Guardian weighed the Nitro lids and found that they are indeed heavier than the current lid/straw combination, if only by a tiny amount. Nevertheless, even a tiny bit more plastic adds up quickly, considering Starbucks\u2019s enormous scale. Starbucks does not dispute that the new lids use more plastic. However, they stress that \u201cthe strawless lid is made from polypropylene, a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that can be captured in recycling infrastructure, unlike straws which are too small and lightweight to be captured in modern recycling equipment.\u201d While it is true that plastic straws cannot be recycled, it should not be automatically assumed that the new plastic lids will definitely be recycled. Only 9% of the world\u2019s plastic is recycled. A large number of things that are theoretically recyclable do not get recycled for reasons such as contamination. Compounding this problem is the fact that the US exports about one-third of its recycling, the majority of which goes to China. At the beginning of 2018, however, China implemented a ban on importing plastic waste. Over the last few months states such as Oregon, which have relied heavily on exporting trash to China, have sent much of their recyclables to landfill while they look for another solution. It is hard to gauge exactly how much Starbucks\u2019s decision to increase its use of plastic, but eliminate plastic straws, will help the environment. To some extent the move to Nitro lids feels like a way to channel some easy PR from the growing anti-straw movement, rather than a meaningful sustainability initiative. Where Starbucks can make a significant impact, however, is by tackling its disposable cup problem. The coffee chain is described as a \u201cCup Monster\u201d by some environmental groups, and up to 6bn of its disposable cups end up in landfills every year. Starbucks recently announced it plans to fix this; the company is working with McDonald\u2019s to develop a global recyclable and/or compostable cup solution, and says it will \u201ccontinue to push ourselves and work with the industry on solutions to reduce waste\u201d. This isn\u2019t the first time Starbucks has said it is working towards a better cup. A decade ago Starbucks said it would make 100% of its cups reusable or recyclable by 2015. That hasn\u2019t happened yet.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/09/starbucks-eliminate-plastic-straws-globally-2020\">This month</a>, Starbucks joined a growing movement to ban single-use plastic straws, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/09/starbucks-eliminate-plastic-straws-globally-2020\">announcing</a> it would eliminate the items from its stores by 2020. In their place, the company will be introducing strawless lids, which have a sippable protrusion. It will also make alternative-material straws available. </p> <p>Starbucks already has strawless lids available in more than 8,000 of its North American stores. These were developed for its \u201cNitro\u201d coffee beverages which have a creamy top and are best drunk without a straw. Now, however, the coffee chain will be making the Nitro lids standard for all cold beverages, most of which now come with straws. Cold beverages make up more than 50% of Starbucks\u2019s beverage mix, an increase from 37% just five years ago. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/09/starbucks-eliminate-plastic-straws-globally-2020\">Starbucks to ditch plastic straws globally by 2020 to help environment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Seattle-based coffee chain estimates that this move will eliminate more than 1bn plastic straws a year across its more than 28,000 stores around the world. It\u2019s a big win for anti-straw advocates. But is it really a big win for the environment?</p> <p>Reason, a magazine and blog published by the rightwing Reason Foundation, <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2018/07/12/starbucks-straw-ban-will-see-the-company\">has claimed</a> that the Nitro lids Starbucks will be making standard use more plastic than a combination of the company\u2019s current lids and plastic straws. Some social media users have also noticed that the Nitro lids are noticeably thicker than the current lids and have speculated about whether they will really be better for the environment. The Guardian weighed the Nitro lids and found that they are indeed heavier than the current lid/straw combination, if only by a tiny amount. Nevertheless, even a tiny bit more plastic adds up quickly, considering Starbucks\u2019s enormous scale. </p> <p>Starbucks does not dispute that the new lids use more plastic. However, they stress that \u201cthe strawless lid is made from polypropylene, a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that can be captured in recycling infrastructure, unlike straws which are too small and lightweight to be captured in modern recycling equipment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea3b1242578746c9ae90a2467d7d6c6a8d62bf67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea3b1242578746c9ae90a2467d7d6c6a8d62bf67/0_41_4644_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new Starbucks lid is intended to cut down on plastic waste.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new Starbucks lid is intended to cut down on plastic waste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eva Hambach/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While it is true that plastic straws cannot be recycled, it should not be automatically assumed that the new plastic lids will definitely be recycled. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/03/06/only-9-of-the-worlds-plastic-is-recycled\">Only 9%</a> of the world\u2019s plastic is recycled. A large number of things that are theoretically recyclable do not get recycled for reasons such as contamination.</p> <p>Compounding this problem is the fact that the US exports about one-third of its recycling, the majority of which goes to China. At the beginning of 2018, however, China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/02/rubbish-already-building-up-at-uk-recycling-plants-due-to-china-import-ban\">implemented a ban on importing plastic waste</a>. Over the last few months states such as Oregon, which have relied heavily on exporting trash to China, have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/12/09/568797388/recycling-chaos-in-u-s-as-china-bans-foreign-waste\">sent much of their recyclables</a> to landfill while they look for another solution. </p> <p>It is hard to gauge exactly how much Starbucks\u2019s decision to increase its use of plastic, but eliminate plastic straws, will help the environment. To some extent the move to Nitro lids feels like a way to channel some easy PR from the growing anti-straw movement, rather than a meaningful sustainability initiative. </p> <p>Where Starbucks can make a significant impact, however, is by tackling its disposable cup problem. The coffee chain is described as a <a href=\"http://komonews.com/news/local/protesters-display-giant-cup-monster-ahead-of-annual-starbucks-meeting\">\u201cCup Monster\u201d</a> by some environmental groups, and up to 6bn of its disposable cups end up in landfills every year. </p> <p>Starbucks recently announced it plans to fix this; the company is <a href=\"https://news.starbucks.com/press-releases/mcdonalds-joins-starbucks-closed-loop-partners-to-end-cup-waste\">working with McDonald\u2019s</a> to develop a global recyclable and/or compostable cup solution, and says it will \u201ccontinue to push ourselves and work with the industry on solutions to reduce waste\u201d. This isn\u2019t the first time Starbucks has said it is working towards a better cup. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40547187/starbucks-generates-an-astronomical-amount-of-waste-can-it-stop\">A decade ago </a>Starbucks said it would make 100% of its cups reusable or recyclable by 2015. That hasn\u2019t happened yet. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair has warned staff planning a summer of strikes that efforts to secure improved pay and working conditions could put their jobs at risk, as it reported a 20% decline in first-quarter profit. The no-frills airline continues to grow rapidly, reporting a 7% increase in passenger numbers to 37.6 million that pushed revenue up 9% to nearly \u20ac2.1bn (\u00a31.86bn). However, soaring costs during the three-month period meant that after-tax profit slumped by 20% to \u20ac319m, sending its shares down as much as 5% in early trading. The Dublin-based carrier blamed falling profits on factors including high fuel prices, overcapacity and labour disputes that it admitted were likely to continue over the peak summer period. In a statement to the stock market, the airline warned staff that they could be made redundant if it cuts back operations in response to the disruption, which has resulted in 600 flights being cancelled already. \u201cIf these unnecessary strikes continue to damage customer confidence and forward prices/yields in certain country markets then we will have to review our winter schedule, which may lead to fleet reductions at disrupted bases and job losses in markets where competitor employees are interfering in our negotiations with our people and their unions,\u201d it said. \u201cWe cannot allow our customers\u2019 flights to be unnecessarily disrupted by a tiny minority of pilots.\u201d However, the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, a trade union umbrella group acting on behalf of cabin crew, said Ryanair had been slow to recognise staff\u2019s concerns. \u201cAfter the big announcement that they\u2019d recognise unions and change human resources policy, progress has been slow and the style has been much the same,\u201d the ITF civil aviation secretary, Gabriel Mocho Rodr\u00edguez, said. \u201cThey\u2019ve changed practices slowly but not their mindset. Instead of honest and fruitful dialogue, they\u2019re thinking about the best way of blackmailing the unions to take them where they want. \u201cThis is unacceptable and explains the difficulties workers are having.\u201d Ryanair\u2019s tussle with cabin crew and pilots has lasted for months, with strikes due this week in important European markets, including Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Italy. The aviation analyst Gerald Khoo, of stockbroker Liberum Capital, said further cancellations would weigh on revenues by driving down average fares. \u201cWhen there are strikes, they move passengers on to other flights and into seats that would have been sold at higher prices at the last minute,\u201d he said. But he added that it was in Ryanair\u2019s interest to hold firm against union demands, in order to protect the low-cost model that gives it an advantage over rivals. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to endure industrial action because they need the right deals for the long term. \u201cEfficient working practices are why prices are so low, so they\u2019re trying to make sure their advantage in terms of efficiency and productivity persists.\u201d Ryanair, which employs 14,000 people, also blamed its falling profits on fuel prices and staff pay rises introduced earlier this year amid previous rounds of negotiation with pilots and crew. It said fuel was up from $50 a barrel last year to $80, an increase that was likely to cost the company \u20ac430m over the course of the year. In a statement accompanying its results, the airline also issued a warning about the prospect of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, in which the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement on matters such as trade, increasingly likely. \u201cWe remain concerned by the danger of a hard (\u201cno-deal\u201d) Brexit in March 2019,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile there is a view that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented (and extended), recent events in the UK political sphere have added to this uncertainty and we believe that the risk of a hard Brexit is being underestimated.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The vegan food boom has prompted one of Britain\u2019s biggest names in meat-free food to make a multimillion-pound investment in R&amp;D. Quorn is spending \u00a37m on a research and development facility at its North Yorkshire headquarters as the meat-alternative brand attempts to capitalise on the increased popularity of veganism. Revealing a 12% rise in sales to \u00a3112m in the first six months of the year, Quorn\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Brennan, said the company was determined to step up innovation to ensure it kept up with a battalion of new rivals by developing its own bleeding vegan burger. While all Quorn\u2019s products are vegetarian, most contain some egg. After a surge in demand for its vegan products it is rapidly developing more. \u201cNobody can yet produce the array of products available at such high quality and we want to keep that advantage,\u201d Brennan said. The company, which makes its meat substitute from a \u201cmycoprotein\u201d fermented in vats from a fungus found in soil, is investing to benefit from what Brennan called generational growth in meat alternatives and plant-based eating. He said the global meat-free category is growing by between 10% and 20% a year, with the more developed UK market rising by about 15%. Brennan said: \u201cAll over the world we have seen a real step-change in the way people are eating. Young consumers are really starting to have concerns around meat from a health and sustainability point of view. It\u2019s not that younger consumers are all turning vegan or vegetarian but they are eating substantially less meat.\u201d Brennan said services such as Netflix were boosting the trend with a stream of documentaries flagging the environmental and health effects of eating meat such as Cowspiracy and Live and Let Live, while retailers, from Waitrose to Iceland, were giving over more space to vegetarian and vegan foods. Quorn expects to take on about 100 new staff during the year ahead, including boosting its 35-strong research and development team based in Stokesley, North Yorkshire. The company, which currently produces 50,000 tonnes of its mycoprotein a year, will also open a manufacturing plant beside its fermentation facility in Billingham, Teesside in September, enabling it to double production of meat-free pieces and mince substitutes, its biggest sellers. Quorn is aiming to reach $1bn (\u00a3760m) of annual sales by 2027 and Brennan said the group was on target despite a slight lift in the value of the pound against the dollar in recent months, which had slowed the pace of growth from about 15% last year. Quorn\u2019s sales in the UK, by far its biggest market, rose by 12% in the first half of the year, as Brennan said snacks such as vegan scotch eggs and cocktail sausages were selling particularly well. \u201cWe are already seeing amazing growth internationally: Australian sales are up 50% and US sales are up 23%. In the US supermarket giant Kroger, we now have the fastest selling product in the [meat alternative] category. With continued investment we believe we can continue this level of performance,\u201d Brennan said.",

It\u2019s not that younger consumers are all turning vegan or vegetarian but they are eating substantially less meat.\u201d</p> <p>Brennan said services such as Netflix were boosting the trend with a stream of documentaries flagging the environmental and health effects of eating meat such as Cowspiracy and Live and Let Live, while retailers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/08/appetite-grows-vegan-products-uk-supermarkets-waitrose-iceland\">from Waitrose to Iceland</a>, were giving over more space to vegetarian and vegan foods.</p> <p>Quorn expects to take on about 100 new staff during the year ahead, including boosting its 35-strong research and development team based in Stokesley, North Yorkshire. The company, which currently produces 50,000 tonnes of its mycoprotein a year, will also open a manufacturing plant beside its fermentation facility in Billingham, Teesside in September, enabling it to double production of meat-free pieces and mince substitutes, its biggest sellers. </p> <p>Quorn is aiming to reach $1bn (\u00a3760m) of annual sales by 2027 and Brennan said the group was on target despite a slight lift in the value of the pound against the dollar in recent months, which had slowed the pace of growth from about 15% last year.</p> <p>Quorn\u2019s sales in the UK, by far its biggest market, rose by 12% in the first half of the year, as Brennan said snacks such as vegan scotch eggs and cocktail sausages were selling particularly well.</p> <p>\u201cWe are already seeing amazing growth internationally: Australian sales are up 50% and US sales are up 23%. In the US supermarket giant Kroger, we now have the fastest selling product in the [meat alternative] category. With continued investment we believe we can continue this level of performance,\u201d Brennan said.</p>",
