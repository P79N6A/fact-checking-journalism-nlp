Rarely do budgets draw such a stark line across the business landscape \u2013 or provide so many opportunities for fast stockmarket traders. Spending incentives for small and medium-sized business, in the form of a doubling of annual investment allowances to \u00a3500,000, exceeded even what the CBI had lobbied for. As for big insurers enjoying a comfortable living selling annuities offering meagre incomes, this was a shocker. Legal &amp; General's shares fell 8%; Resolution, the Friends Life group and Aviva were down 5%. By contrast, Hargreaves Lansdown, the DIY investment platform that will be an immediate beneficiary of substantially higher ISA allowances, soared 14%. Eye-catching stuff and, from a business perspective, George Osborne got much right, given his limited scope for sweeteners. He is exposed to the charge that the recovery is little more than a housing-inspired mirage which has bypassed exporters. Levels of business investment have flat-lined at historically low levels even as GDP numbers have improved. Businesses' unwillingness to invest for growth is starting to look ingrained, rather than an issue to be blamed, repeatedly and unconvincingly, on weakness in the eurozone. A doubling of capital allowances until 2015, then, at least acknowledges the problem. The measure, expected to cost \u00a32bn, will not rebalance the economy alone \u2013 but it ought to bring forward some investment in plants and machinery. The CBI already had some punchy-looking forecasts for a rebound in business investment (6.6% in 2014 and 8.3% in 2015). There will be fewer excuses now if a higher level of investment does not materialise. Meanwhile, the government \u2013 predictably \u2013 ignored any objections from the green quarter by freezing the carbon price and giving steel mills, paper plants and other heavy energy users substantially more relief. For business, the energy package looks significant. And the cut in tax on long-haul flights will be cheered in boardrooms (albeit not that of British Airways, which is rarely satisfied). Business got about 80% of what it wanted. The exception was business rates, where the next revaluation in 2017 looks horribly distant for those high-street retailers and operators paying over the odds. The receipts, it seems, are simply too chunky for the Treasury to allow the current rates to be frozen until overdue reform arrives. On pensions, the market's snap reaction was simple: providers will lose, thus the steep falls in life assurers' shares. That assessment was understandable \u2013 a policy on which there has been zero consultation with the industry usually spells trouble, especially when it's billed as the biggest shake-up since 1921. The day two reaction, however, may be more nuanced. Yes, the likes of L&amp;G and Aviva will obviously sell fewer annuities. That is bound to happen if pensioners in defined contribution schemes are no longer compelled to buy annuities. But they are far from being one-trick ponies. L&amp;G's book of annuities from defined benefit schemes, which are unaffected, will carry on regardless. And the fund management arms of the big insurers will hope to gather some of the newly liberated cash to manage. They will have to invent new savings and income products, which implies stiffer competition, but not every corporate provider will be a loser from Osborne's big announcement. What's more, if the reforms achieve their intended purpose, Britons may actually save more before retirement, which they should. Yes, Osborne should get the sugar-rush of new pensioners spending more freely, which is what the official numbers project. The long-term impact, however, may be an increase in the pool of savings in the UK. The obvious losers are companies offering only annuities and nothing else \u2013 thus the 55% crash in the share price of Partnership, a specialist in so-called \"non standard\" annuities for the ill, the infirm and smokers. Many of its future customers will surely be inclined to turn their pension pots into a lump sum and spend the cash or invest it elsewhere. That corner of the annuity market looks fundamentally changed for ever. For the rest, though, it's a matter of reinventing their business models.",

    "webTitle": "Osborne's energy measures please firms but anger environmentalists", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government promised a \u00a37bn packet of measures to cut energy costs for manufacturers and bring some benefits for homeowners, which centred on freezing a newly introduced green tax, the carbon floor price. The move delighted hard-pressed manufacturers but angered environmentalists, while some independent energy analysts warned that the move was a short-term boost that would worsen longer-term energy insecurity. The carbon floor price was designed to set a minimum price, related to emissions from fossil fuels, which would rise annually and encourage manufacturers to switch to greener fuels. It was introduced only last year. Capping the carbon price support rate at \u00a318 a ton of CO2 from 2016 to 2020 would save a medium-sized manufacturer about \u00a350,000 on its annual energy bill and shave \u00a315 off a family bill, George Osborne said in the budget. He also extended an existing compensation scheme for energy-intensive industries, such as steel and paper mills, for a further four years and introduced a scheme to shield firms from the cost of supporting windfarms and solar arrays through the renewables obligation and the feed-in tariffs. \"Today I have cut the cost of manufacturing in Britain,\" the chancellor said in his speech. \"Half of the firms that will benefit most are in the north of England. A third are in Scotland and Wales. Thousands of jobs will be protected. A more resilient economy. A government on the side of manufacturers. A Britain that makes things again.\" The moves \u2013 about which little detail was given, such as how the \u00a37bn figure was arrived at, or how compensation would be funded \u2013 followed a noisy campaign from the manufacturing sector, insisting that soaring power costs in Britain were making companies uncompetitive and were responsible for job layoffs and plant shutdowns. But the lobbying was met with counter-pressure from the nuclear and renewable energy sectors, which, unusually, teamed up to warn the chancellor before the budget that it would increase uncertainty and reduce \"green\" investment. John Cridland, director-general of the employers' organisation the CBI, said the budget would \"put wind in the sails of business investment\", especially for manufacturers: \"This was a make-or-break budget, coming at a critical time in the recovery, and the chancellor has focused his firepower on areas that have the potential to lock in growth.\" Jeremy Nicholson of the Energy Intensive Users Group, agreed, describing it as a \"very, very significant move forward\", which should keep jobs and opportunities in Britain that could have bled abroad. But Renewable Energy Systems, which claims to be the UK's largest independent renewable energy developer, said freezing the carbon price undermined the stability of the green investment case that had been promised by the government. \"It will unnerve investors already spooked by a rapid succession of energy policy exchanges, raise the cost of capital for British businesses building new power plants and deter institutional investors needed to renew the UK's ageing energy infrastructure,\" said Gordon MacDougall, chief operating officer of RES. Lord Stern, author of the influential climate change report of the same name, said the chancellor should have resisted the \"temptation to fiddle\", which had only increased uncertainty and reduced investor confidence. Friends of the Earth said that Osborne had promised only weeks ago to tackle floods and climate change, but had caved in to the corporate lobby. \"Freezing the carbon floor price is simplywas code for letting polluters pollute while clean industries suffer ever more stifling restrictions,\" added the organisation's economics campaigner, David Powell. In other green initiatives, the government has exempted from the carbon floor price electricity produced by combined heat and power plants, which some manufacturers use. The chancellor has also extended the 2% increase in company car tax up to 2019, increased the discount for ultra-low emission vehicles and reduced fuel duty on methanol.",

Lynch has urged shareholders at the HP meeting in Santa Clara, California, to demand HP release calculations it used to make an $8.8bn (\u00a35.3bn)writedown on the value of Autonomy in November 2012, a year after acquiring it for $11bn. He writes: \"In the 16 months that have followed, HP has not provided information or evidence to the Autonomy team to substantiate any allegation. Instead, it has selectively leaked documents and information to the international media, frequently using material taken out of context to create false impressions and smear our reputations.\" Lynch also claims that HP's senior executives were aware of certain Autonomy sales practices months before it told shareholders a whistleblower had flagged them. The letter also calls for HP to release valuation reports prepared by its advisers, which he claims confirm HP paid a fair price for his business. \"HP's independent advisers carried out several valuation reports of Autonomy after the acquisition, which explicitly included Autonomy's hardware sales and confirmed the value of the company at $11bn? Does HP management deny this? Will they disclose these reports to shareholders?\" Lynch has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Feted as Britain's most successful software entrepreneur when he sold his company in 2011, he is now fighting to save his reputation. His letter states: \"Meg Whitman has made incendiary and defamatory accusations on behalf of her company. She should now present the detailed evidence that justifies those allegations.\" HP responded with a statement, saying: \"As HP has previously reported, it uncovered numerous accounting irregularities at Autonomy prior to its acquisition by HP.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve cut another $10bn from its economic stimulus programme on Wednesday even as chairwoman Janet Yellen warned that harsh winter weather had hampered the country\u2019s economic recovery. After a two-day meeting, the first to be chaired by Yellen, the central bank insisted that it would continue its efforts to keep interest rates down beyond the point at which it stopped buying government bonds in support of domestic economy. Yellen also announced that the Fed has decided to alter its guidance on when interest rates would rise. Previously the central bank had indicated that rates could rise when the unemployment rate dipped below 6.5%. The unemployment rate hit 6.7% last month but some sections of US society remain hard hit. Unemployment for black people was 12% last month, for teenagers it was 21.4%. The Fed has now dropped the reference to the 6.5% jobless rate. Instead, the central bank said it would \u201cassess progress \u2026 toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation\u201d. The central bank has kept rates at close to zero for more than five years in an attempt to stimulate the economy in the aftermath of the recession. Yellen, an expert on the labour market, has previously noted that the headline rate of unemployment can overstate the job market\u2019s health. She said the job market was still improving and there was still sufficient signs of recovery for the Fed to continue to cut back on its quantitative easing (QE) economic stimulus programme. But she noted that some parts of the US are still suffering the worst winter weather in 30 years. \u201cUnusually harsh weather in January and February has made it especially hard to assess the underlying economy,\u201d said Yellen. Apart from the disparity among various groups, in recent months the rate has fallen because many people without a job have stopped looking for one and are no longer counted as unemployed. The \u201cparticipation rate\u201d, which measures the percentage of people in the workforce, is currently at 63%, a low unseen since the 1970s. At a press conference Yellen said the labour market was improving but that the rates of long-term unemployment and under-employment were still too high. The 6.5% benchmark was set in December 2012 when unemployment stood at 7.8%. \u201cSince then the progress in the labour market has been more rapid than expected while inflation has been lower than expected,\u201d said Yellen. She said that rates were likely to remain close to zero for some \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after QE comes to an end. \u201cInformation received since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met in January indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions,\u201d the Fed said in a statement. \u201cLabour market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.\u201d But despite some remaining issues and the winter weather the Fed said the economy was showing \u201ccumulative progress\u201d and cut its quantitative easing (QE) economic stimulus programme by $10bn to $55bn a month. It bought $65bn in March, and $85bn last December. The Fed\u2019s massive bond-buying programme has been intended to keep long-term borrowing rates low and spur spending. On current trends the programme will end later this year.",

      "bodyText": "Inditex, the owner of Zara, has revealed its first fall in annual profits in five years as the world's biggest fashion retailer invested in stores while foreign exchange rates moved against it. Pre-tax profits for the year to 15 March slipped 2.5% to \u20ac3.05bn despite a 4.9% rise in sales to \u20ac16.72bn as consumer spending bounced back in southern European markets. However, shares in the Spanish retail group rose 4.8% to \u20ac108 after the company revealed a step up in underlying sales growth to about 4% in the final quarter of the year to 15 March, according to analysts. That compared to about 3% in the previous three months. The company said sales in Spain, which account for a fifth of the group total, rose 3% in the second half of last year and the chief executive, Pablo Isla, said he expected the positive trend to continue in 2014 after several years of difficulties in the company's home market. \"We are seeing recovery in southern Europe and Inditex is quite highly exposed to southern Europe. Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy \u2013 all those countries are bouncing back,\" said Anne Critchlow, retail analyst with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Inditex, which owns the Pull &amp; Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Lefties and Urterque brands as well as Zara, also revealed plans to increase investment in refurbishments and new stores from \u20ac1.2bn last year to \u20ac1.35bn, allowing it add up to 500 new stores this year compared to 330 in 2013. \"We have big expectations for Zara in 2014,\" Isla told analysts, adding that the store revamp programme had been largely completed and pointing to flagship openings in Madrid, Hong Kong, Miami and Zurich. The company also said it had started online sales in Greece in March and would launch in Romania in April, followed by South Korea and Mexico later in the year, taking the total number of e-commerce markets to 27, compared with a planned 13 for H&amp;M. \"Online came very, very naturally to us... we believe the growth opportunity is huge,\" Isla said.",

In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5329dc3de4b096328977159f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-19T18:05:38.861Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140319a.htm\"> full Federal Reserve statement</a>.</p> <p>Wall Street has reacted to the news with a near 40 point fall on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5329db48e4b02042d4c27b66\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-19T18:02:38.160Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Federal Reserve trims bond buying by another $10bn a month</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After its first meeting with Janet Yellen as chair, the US Federal Reserve has trimmed its monthly bond buying programme by another $10bn to $55bn.</p> <p>It also dropped the unemployment rate as a measure for gauging the economy\u2019s strength and said it would use a wide range of measure in deciding whether to raise interest rates.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5329cbd9e4b0e2aaa235fd2f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-19T17:11:51.065Z\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets close mixed ahead of Federal Reserve meeting</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A cautious day for investors as they wait for the outcome of Janet Yellen\u2019s first meeting as chair of the US Federal Reserve.

For now, the Russia/ Ukraine stand-off in Crimea seems to be considered a political, not an economic crisis after Putin said that Russian gas will continue to flow through Ukraine.</p> <p>The bigger risk to the markets today is that Yellen is less dovish than expected, reflecting the range of views at the Fed, including hawkish ones from some new members, which could stir up fears that the Fed may quicken the pace of tapering if economic growth picks up next quarter. Watch out for any sign of discord at the Fed around the structural level of unemployment. Some expect this to be larger than expected, which could mean that the Fed has less work to do to try and promote job growth, which could lead to a faster pace of rate normalisation than the market currently expects (the first rate hike is not scheduled until Autumn 2015). While we think Yellen is unlikely to dive into this debate today, if she does then we could see a sharp relief rally in the dollar, and stocks could come under pressure. </p> </blockquote> <p>The general consensus seems to be that the Fed will continue to \u201ctaper\u201d its stimulus package, trimming its monthly bond buying programme by another $10bn.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53297b8ce4b0ffcfb3ba576a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-19T11:14:44.694Z\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>In another piece of good news for George Osborne Bentley Motors, the German-owned luxury car group, has said it would move production of all its W12 engines to Britain from Germany by the end of the year.</b> Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The firm, bought by Volkswagen in 1998, said it would produce all of its 12 cylinder engines at its Crewe facilities in central England by the end of 2014, and expects to be producing a total of 9,000 engines by 2017/18.</p> <p>Currently some 5,000 engines are manufactured in Crewe, with a remaining few thousand made in Salzgitter in Germany.</p> <p>The increase in the number of engines would lead to Bentley exporting engines to cars made outside of Britain for the first time, with some to be used in as-yet unspecified Audi and Volkswagen models.</p> <p>Bentley, which posted a 67% jump in operating profit to a record \u00a3139.7m, has been making its ultra-luxury vehicles including the flagship Mulsanne limousine at its factory in Crewe since 1946.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53297a2be4b085d4434ee99a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-19T11:08:23.824Z\">11.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mark Carney\u2019s mission to create \u201cone bank\u201d for the Bank of England has prompted this response from M&amp;G\u2019s bond vigilantes, given the recently announced reshuffle and the plethora of new deputy governors:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bondvigilantes/statuses/446240152784891905\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>One Bank, Four Deputy Guvnors. <a href=\"http://t.co/AZQB9aLNvH\">pic.twitter.com/AZQB9aLNvH</a></p>&mdash; Bond Vigilantes (@bondvigilantes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bondvigilantes/statuses/446240152784891905\">March 19, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53297888e4b0916182da3d03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-19T11:01:39.175Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Here\u2019s our take on the UK jobs and earnings data.</b> My colleague Katie Allen writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>George Osborne got a welcome boost ahead of his budget with news that earnings are picking up and the number of people claiming jobless benefits is falling.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/march-2014/statistical-bulletin.html\">Official figures just hours before the chancellor\u2019s fifth budget</a> showed the unemployment rate held steady at 7.2% in the three months to January but younger people continue to be left behind and one in five is still out of work.</p> <p>Average earnings were up 1.4% on a year ago, a bigger rise than the City had been expecting and closing in on inflation, which is running at 1.9%.

Given pay awards are creeping higher \u2013 Income Data Services has reported that newly agreed wage deals are running at 2.4% - we are hopeful that real wages will soon turn positive.</p> <p>This would be a big boost for the household sector after nearly 6 years of wages failing to keep pace with the cost of living. It clearly boosts purchasing power and with employment continuing to grow, aggregate household incomes are going to strengthen further. The fact that wage rates are starting to pick up is also a sign that the spare capacity in the labour market is being reduced.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK labour market remained solid in February, with jobless claims falling by a stronger than anticipated -34,600 over the month and the claimant count rate edging a touch lower to 3.5% from 3.6% the prior month. Jobless claims have fallen each month since November 2012, suggesting a consolidation of the labour market is underway despite the still ample output gap in the economy. This is the result of the relative flexibility of the UK labour that - during the phases of recovery in activity - allows more job creation for part-time and temporary jobs. Survey indicators remained upbeat in terms of job creation over the next few months, anticipating more momentum for the UK labour market going forward.</p> <p> That said, the ILO unemployment rate showed some stabilization at 7.2% the three months through January, confirming the idea that the recent downward trend has lost some steam. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53296848e4b085d4434ee98b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-19T09:51:06.888Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It appears the unemployment rate even went below Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s initial forward guidance of 7% (now abandoned of course):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/statuses/446219985552429056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The UK unemployment rate held steady at 7.2% in the 3 months to January, but in January alone it fell to 6.9%, the lowest since Feb 2009</p>&mdash; Chris Williamson (@WilliamsonChris) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/statuses/446219985552429056\">March 19, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/446219864307683328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Are you watching Mark Carney?

      "bodyText": "Partly the Fed blamed the weather: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions. It has also revised its GDP growth expectations down from a range of 2.8% to 3.2% for 2014 to 2.8% to 3.0%. And on that note, we\u2019ll close the blog for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The statement said: The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. Here\u2019s the full Federal Reserve statement. Wall Street has reacted to the news with a near 40 point fall on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. After its first meeting with Janet Yellen as chair, the US Federal Reserve has trimmed its monthly bond buying programme by another $10bn to $55bn. It also dropped the unemployment rate as a measure for gauging the economy\u2019s strength and said it would use a wide range of measure in deciding whether to raise interest rates. A cautious day for investors as they wait for the outcome of Janet Yellen\u2019s first meeting as chair of the US Federal Reserve. The Fed is widely expected to trim its monthly bond buying programme by another $10bn but Yellen\u2019s comments to accompany the news will be widely watched. European markets turned in a mixed performance but the FTSE 100 fell back following George Osborne\u2019s budget announcement, with insurers hit hard by proposed changes to annuities while bookies were bashed by news of an increase in tax on fixed odds betting machines from 20% to 25%. (Don\u2019t forget, our live blog of the budget and reaction to the measures continues here.) As for the markets, the final scores on the doors showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished down 32.15 points or 0.49% at 6573.13 \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax was up 0.37% at 9277.05 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.12% lower at 4308.06 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 0.29% at 20,976.99 \u2022 Spain\u2019s Ibex added 0.42% to 10,093.3 \u2022 The Athens market edged 0.38% lower at 1364.40 Over on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged ahead of Yellen, up just 0.02%. How Bulgaria is benefitting from Greece\u2019s economic weakness. Helena Smith reports on the flow of companies moving across the border: Every time Akis Agorastos drives back over the border from Bulgaria to Serres, the northern Greek town where he was born, his blood pressure rises a little. The shuttered stores, derelict factories, myriad \u201cfor rent\u201d signs and empty streets fill him with gloom. \u201cAnger and sadness overwhelm me,\u201d said the entrepreneur. \u201cI grab the steering wheel a little tighter and feel my pulse rise. I can\u2019t believe that this is the country where I grew up. For my generation it was never meant to be this way.\u201d In 2012, at the height of Greece\u2018s debt crisis, Agorastos moved his business \u2013 an American-style gym that only a year earlier had been thriving in Serres \u2013 across the border to Bulgaria. Relocating was not easy: he had to rent three trucks \u201cat enormous expense\u201d to ferry sports equipment to the southern Bulgarian town of Blagoevgrad, 100 miles north of the frontier. And then, he added, there was the risk of moving to a country that was itself the poorest member of the EU and where few wanted to stay at all. \u201cBut after doing my sums I understood it was the only way to survive,\u201d said the 32-year-old, whose enterprise is now ensconced in a subterranean room that, though a fifth the size of his outlet back in Serres, is also a tenth of the price to run. ....The spectre of a former eastern European state like Bulgaria offering stability and solace to entrepreneurs such as Agorastos would have been inconceivable not that long ago when Greece, the Balkans\u2019 only EU member, was attempting to cast itself as the regional economic leader. Agorastos is far from alone. What started as a trickle of Greek companies branching out to the new market economies of neighbouring Balkan states before the crisis had even begun, has turned into a steady flow as businesses seek to escape crippling duties and an economy that for six straight years has been entrenched in austerity-driven recession. The full story is here. Over in Greece government officials are saying that the final version of its breakthrough agreement with international lenders will be released by the end of the day. But as Helena Smith reports, the fiscal progress still remains far removed from the mood on the ground. A day after clinching the deal, Greek government officials are clearly in euphoric mood. Echoing the optimism expressed by prime minister Antonis Samaras, insiders at the finance ministry say the agreement is the turning point that will allow a \u201cnew Greece\u201d to be born. But with the long- awaited accord yet to be made public (it is expected to be released by troika representatives by the end of the day) the political opposition accused the government of hoodwinking Greeks by keeping them in the dark as to what it has really signed up to. As thousands of civil servants kicked off a 48-hour strike, with rallies across the country, it was clear that despite the fiscal progress there remains a huge disconnect between improved economic indicators and the desperation of people on the ground. Many Greeks, like Manolis Kolagoliaris, a school technician, are far from convinced that the headway \u2013 not least the primary budget surplus Athens has managed to achieve - will have an impact on their daily lives. \u201cNow the government is saying it is going to distribute money here and there, give back to the poor what it has taken since the crisis began,\u201d he said. \u201cBut,\u201d he continued, attributing the promises to forthcoming European and local elections, \u201cwe\u2019ve heard that sort of thing again and again which is why we are in this mess.\u201d Marching through Athens, Harris Bastas who heads the recently founded association of school guards dismissed from the public sector, agreed. \u201cThe optimism is totally artificial,\u201d said the 59-year old who has been forced to raise two children on a monthly salary of \u20ac650 for the past eight months. \u201cThere are more than 2,000 of us who, on Friday [the government deadline for dismissed employees to find other jobs] will face permanent dismissal at the request of the troika. With more than 1.5 million unemployed there is not a chance in hell that we will find work. The government is in for a surprise if it thinks we won\u2019t react.\u201d J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, the former banker at the heart of one of the world\u2019s biggest rogue trading scandals, will serve three years in jail but will not have to pay back the \u20ac4.9bn (\u00a33.96bn) he cost his bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Kerviel, 35, was first found guilty in October 2010 of forgery, breach of trust and unauthorised computer use in one of the biggest trading frauds in history, which almost brought down one of France\u2019s oldest banks. The former trader has made a number of appeals, but France\u2019s highest court has now ruled against him on the jail sentence. However the Court of Cassation ruled he was no longer liable to pay compensation to the bank. A new civil trial will take place to decide on the eventual damages. Kerviel always admitted making unauthorised bets on the futures markets without covering his risks \u2013 at one point he was gambling with up to \u20ac50bn, more than his employer SocGen was worth. But he told judges the bank had known about his exorbitant trades in 2007 and 2008 and turned a blind eye as long as they made money, which the bank denied in court. After today\u2019s ruling Kerviel said the quashing of the fine was good news, Reuters reported, but he would continue fighting. Back to the UK budget and the news that pensioners will no longer need to use their pension pot to buy an annuity has hit insurance companies hard: The Greek government will be able to spend some of its budget savings to strengthen social-security programs, EU economics chief Olli Rehn has said. The Wall Street Journal reported: Rehn was responding to a statement by Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras, that he intends to use \u20ac500m of savings for social-security programs. The development marks a change in the attitude that Greece\u2019s creditors have shown to hints of extra spending following a period of severe government spending cuts. But Rehn said consolidating the government\u2019s budget and strengthening social security aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, especially since the Athens government seems likely to overshoot a target for its primary budget surplus set by the IMF and the European Union. \u201cGreece has delivered a significant primary surplus and as part of this agreement we have agreed that there will be a stepping up of efforts to...protect the vulnerable,\u201d he told reporters. Greek officials this week reached an agreement on a number of outstanding issues with representatives from the institutions managing the country\u2019s mammoth bailout. The talks had dragged on for months, but their conclusion means that the way is now open for Greece to receive a fresh slice of long-blocked aid. Rehn said euro-zone finance ministers would be able to approve this at a meeting in Athens on April 1. The US current account deficit fell to a 14 year low in the fourth quarter, as exports hit a record high, according to government figures released earlier. The gap narrowed from a revised $96.4bn in the third quarter to $81.1bn, the lowest since 1999, helped by a 2.5% rise in exports of goods and services. Imports rose just 0.7%. Greece is considering a return to the bond markets in the first half of the year, according to Reuters. A finance ministry source has reportedly said that no decision had yet been taken but it could seek to raise \u20ac1.5bn to \u20ac2bn with a five year bond as a test issue before a full return to market. Over in the US, Wall Street has opened and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is almost unchanged in early trading, just 3 points lower ahead of Janet Yellen\u2019s announcement after chairing her first Federal Reserve meeting. George Osborne has finished his speech in just under an hour, and the FTSE 100 is now down around 16 points or 0.25%. William Hill is a big faller, down 5% after the chancellor raised the tax on fixed odds betting machines. Ladbrokes is down 8% for the same reason, but Hargreaves Lansdown is up nearly 1% on news on Osborne\u2019s changes to ISAs. Full coverage of reaction to the budget continues at our live blog here.

One interesting announcement (although the BBC mean Turing of course): Still with Italy, bad loan writedowns at the country\u2019s banks will continue to be significant in the coming months, according to Bank of Italy governor Ignazio Visco. Reuters has the story: \u201cThere will be other quarters (of difficult figures on bad loans) because the recovery is very slow,\u201d Visco told journalists after attending a meeting of the Italian banking association ABI in Milan. Visco said it was \u201ccomforting\u201d to see a slowdown in the rate tracking the share of loans which turn sour. \u201cBut before seeing a fall in bad loans we still need to witness the impact of the crisis on businesses.\u201d Italian banks stepped up loan loss provisions in the last quarter of 2013 in an effort to clean-up their balance sheets ahead of a review of banking assets by European authorities this year. Asked about Italian banks\u2019 recapitalisation efforts, Visco said this was what the central bank had requested. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is that if a bank has (good)prospects, a (business) plan and so forth, there are capitals (that can be invested in a share sale) both in Italy and from other countries.\u201d Elsewhere, as pointed out by mrwicket below, Italy is currently in the throes of a 24 hour transport strike over workers\u2019 contracts which will affect buses, metros and trams across the country. When Osborne started his speech, markets were fairly calm, with the FTSE 100 virtually unchanged at 6604. The pound was sitting at $1.6640. George Osborne has begun by saying the UK economy continues to recover and no advanced economy in the world is growing faster than Britain. He says support for savers is at the heart of the budget.

Follow all the details with our live blog: Budget 2014 - live Spain\u2019s poorest have been hit harder than any other group in any OECD country in the years of financial crisis and downturn, according to the OECD, reported Stephen Burgen in Barcelona: While the wealthiest 10% of Spaniards saw their income fall by barely 1% between 2007 and 2010, for the poorest 10% the fall has been 14%. Italy\u2019s poorest fared far better, suffering a 4% drop in income, according to the report Society at a Glance 2014. Spain\u2019s wealthiest earn 13 times more than the poorest, compared to an OECD average of 9.4. By comparison, in Iceland the richest have lost 12% of their income while for the poorest the figure is 8%. The full story, first put up last night, is here: Spain\u2019s poor affected the most among OECD nations in financial downturn In Greece public sector employees are staging a 48-hour strike in protest at job losses as part of the cost cutting measures demanded by the troika of international lenders. Some 45 minutes until George Osborne\u2019s budget and there is growing talk he has a rabbit to pull out of his hat.... See our budget blog here: Budget 2014 - live Portugal has reported a successful bond auction, selling \u20ac1.25bn worth of six and twelve month bills, at lower yields. As the country aims for an exit from its bailout this year, yields on the 12 month bills fell from 0.750% in a February auction to 0.602%, the lowest since 2009. The yield on the six month bills fell to 0.438% to 1.041%. Kathleen Brooks at Forex.com has been looking ahead to this evening\u2019s news from the US Federal Reserve, marking Janet Yellen\u2019s first meeting as Fed chair. The markets seem fairly calm ahead of the announcement, she says: The market seems to be expecting a dovish Yellen, and US stocks managed to rally on Tuesday as the financial community put the Ukraine crisis on the back burner. For now, the Russia/ Ukraine stand-off in Crimea seems to be considered a political, not an economic crisis after Putin said that Russian gas will continue to flow through Ukraine. The bigger risk to the markets today is that Yellen is less dovish than expected, reflecting the range of views at the Fed, including hawkish ones from some new members, which could stir up fears that the Fed may quicken the pace of tapering if economic growth picks up next quarter. Watch out for any sign of discord at the Fed around the structural level of unemployment. Some expect this to be larger than expected, which could mean that the Fed has less work to do to try and promote job growth, which could lead to a faster pace of rate normalisation than the market currently expects (the first rate hike is not scheduled until Autumn 2015). While we think Yellen is unlikely to dive into this debate today, if she does then we could see a sharp relief rally in the dollar, and stocks could come under pressure. The general consensus seems to be that the Fed will continue to \u201ctaper\u201d its stimulus package, trimming its monthly bond buying programme by another $10bn. In another piece of good news for George Osborne Bentley Motors, the German-owned luxury car group, has said it would move production of all its W12 engines to Britain from Germany by the end of the year. Reuters reports: The firm, bought by Volkswagen in 1998, said it would produce all of its 12 cylinder engines at its Crewe facilities in central England by the end of 2014, and expects to be producing a total of 9,000 engines by 2017/18. Currently some 5,000 engines are manufactured in Crewe, with a remaining few thousand made in Salzgitter in Germany. The increase in the number of engines would lead to Bentley exporting engines to cars made outside of Britain for the first time, with some to be used in as-yet unspecified Audi and Volkswagen models. Bentley, which posted a 67% jump in operating profit to a record \u00a3139.7m, has been making its ultra-luxury vehicles including the flagship Mulsanne limousine at its factory in Crewe since 1946. Mark Carney\u2019s mission to create \u201cone bank\u201d for the Bank of England has prompted this response from M&amp;G\u2019s bond vigilantes, given the recently announced reshuffle and the plethora of new deputy governors: Here\u2019s our take on the UK jobs and earnings data. My colleague Katie Allen writes: George Osborne got a welcome boost ahead of his budget with news that earnings are picking up and the number of people claiming jobless benefits is falling. Official figures just hours before the chancellor\u2019s fifth budget showed the unemployment rate held steady at 7.2% in the three months to January but younger people continue to be left behind and one in five is still out of work. Average earnings were up 1.4% on a year ago, a bigger rise than the City had been expecting and closing in on inflation, which is running at 1.9%. A pick-up in wages will bring welcome relief to households after years of grappling with below-inflation rises. The numbers, which showed wage growth in January alone was 1.7%, will be welcomed by Osborne as he faces opposition criticism over the \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d. \u201cThe latest jobs figures are just what the chancellor would have wanted to see as he put the finishing touches to his budget. Recent improvements to UK construction figures, combined with an increased demand for engineers, means that it won\u2019t be a surprise to see employment rising across other sectors,\u201d said Bernard Brown, head of business services at KPMG Management Consulting. The Office for National Statistics said the number of people out of work and claiming jobless benefits fell by 34,600 in February, more than a forecast for a 25,000 fall in a Reuters poll of economists. But young people still appear to be largely missing out in the jobs market turnaround, with the youth unemployment rate at 19.8% \u2013 almost three times the UK\u2019s overall jobless rate. Full story here: Budget 2014: chancellor gets boost as average earnings rise In Germany\u2019s bond auction, it sold \u20ac3.262bn of its 10 year bund, with the Bundesbank keeping \u20ac0.738bn or 18.45%. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Today\u2019s auction comes on the heels of a technically undersubscribed 10 year auction in February that raised some worries with regards to market interest for German paper at the current level of yields. Today\u2019s auction was better received but market interest for the paper was mitigated by the recent lows for German 10 year yields that - in our view - don\u2019t have much room for further rally. In details, the paper was priced at an average 1.58%... Total bids were \u20ac 5.191bn, which led to an bid/cover ratio of 1.6 times versus 1.1 times at the previous auction (excluding the Bundesbank) but lower than the previous two auctions average of 1.75 times. All in all, today\u2019s auction was decently received... That said, demand was not extremely strong either. Back with the UK employment data, and the figures show that youth unemployment was down 29,000 to 912,000 in the three months to January compared to the previous quarter. But the rate is still 19.8%, and David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce said: These figures show that while the UK labour market remains strong and flexible, the pace of improvement is slowing. Youth unemployment edged down slightly, but with the rate at 19.8%, it is still nearly three times the rate of unemployment as a whole. While earnings growth increased slightly it remains below inflation. For pay to increase further, we need to see similar increases in productivity in order to sustain it. Overall the jobs market is still improving, and suggests that the recovery is making progress. Against this backdrop, in his budget speech we hope that the Chancellor makes every effort to tackle youth unemployment, while introducing measures to boost investment and exports. Over in Greece, following Tuesday\u2019s agreement with the troika of lenders - the EU, ECB and IMF - the country hopes the latest tranche of funds will be agreed next month. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: After reaching an agreement with the troika on Tuesday, the Greek government now has to prepare legislation for the reforms it agreed with its lenders in the hope that the disbursement of at least \u20ac10bn in loans will be approved at an informal Eurogroup meeting due to take place in Athens on April 1. Athens and the troika did not comment publicly on the details of the deal, clinched around lunchtime, apart from Prime Minister Antonis Samaras confirming that social security contributions would be reduced by 3.9 percentage points. Samaras is due to meet deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos at the Maximos Mansion on Wednesday to discuss the coalition\u2019s next steps. Government sources said that the two leaders must decide whether the reforms Athens agreed to will be legislated in one multi-bill or if several draft laws will be submitted to Parliament. The coalition aims to pass the measures before the end of the month so eurozone finance ministers can approve the release of the next tranche on April 1. It is not clear how much will be disbursed, though. Greece has a maximum of \u20ac11bn to receive from the eurozone and \u20ac3.6bn from the International Monetary Fund. Full story here: After troika deal, Greek coalition aims to secure next bailout tranche on April 1 Labour costs grew more rapidly in the fourth quarter in the eurozone, up 1.4% compared to an increase of 1.1% in the previous three months. Smiths Group, the medical and engineering group, said first half profits fell 3% after increased competition and the effect of a strong pound on its US earnings. The company, which gets around 95% of its revenues outside the UK, said full year earnings would be cut by 4% to 5% if exchange rates remained at current levels. The news has knocked the company\u2019s shares nearly 6% lower, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. More on Janet Yellen\u2019s first meeting as chair of the US Federal Reserve. AP writes: Investors will be watching closely on Wednesday for any hints of how a Janet Yellen-led Federal Reserve might differ from the path set by her predecessor, Ben Bernanke. The Yellen era will begin in earnest when the Fed ends two days of policy discussions. It will be her first meeting as Fed chair, a position she assumed on 3 February, after Bernanke stepped down following eight high-profile years. After the Fed issues a statement at the end of its policy meeting and updates its economic forecasts, Yellen will preside over a news conference. She is widely expected to embrace Bernanke\u2019s approach of keeping interest rates low while gradually paring the Fed\u2019s economic stimulus. Most analysts expect the Fed to announce a third reduction in the monthly pace of its bond purchases from $65bn to $55bn. Those reductions are expected to continue this year until the bond purchases end altogether by December. Full story here: Janet Yellen to enter spotlight as new leader of Federal Reserve The Bank of England minutes released at the same time as the UK unemployment data showed the members of the monetary policy committee were unanimous in voting 9-0 to keep quantitative easing at \u00a3375bn. The Bank said the latest revisions to GDP data showed the UK recovery was becoming more balanced but there was some way to go before it was sustainable. As expected there was some divergence on the issue of spare capacity. James Knightley at ING said: The Bank minutes to the March decision showed a unanimous vote to leave policy unchanged although there are a range of views on the amount of spare capacity in the UK. The general tone though suggests that the Bank are keen to keep rate hike expectations pushed back with an emphasis on sterling strength, which has tightened monetary conditions already. Nonetheless, with the UK growth and employment story looking very healthy we are comfortable with the view that the Bank will end up tightening policy within the next twelve months, most probably at the February 2015 MPC meeting. Here\u2019s some early reaction to the UK jobless data. James Knightley at ING said: The UK labour data is pretty much in line with expectations - unemployment rate remaining at 7.2%, employment rising 105,000 in the three months to February and unemployment falling 63,000. However, there was a bit more encouragement on wages, which rose to 1.4% three month/year on year with the single month figure coming in at 1.7% year on year (excluding bonuses it was 1.8%). Given pay awards are creeping higher \u2013 Income Data Services has reported that newly agreed wage deals are running at 2.4% - we are hopeful that real wages will soon turn positive. This would be a big boost for the household sector after nearly 6 years of wages failing to keep pace with the cost of living. It clearly boosts purchasing power and with employment continuing to grow, aggregate household incomes are going to strengthen further. The fact that wage rates are starting to pick up is also a sign that the spare capacity in the labour market is being reduced. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The UK labour market remained solid in February, with jobless claims falling by a stronger than anticipated -34,600 over the month and the claimant count rate edging a touch lower to 3.5% from 3.6% the prior month. Jobless claims have fallen each month since November 2012, suggesting a consolidation of the labour market is underway despite the still ample output gap in the economy. This is the result of the relative flexibility of the UK labour that - during the phases of recovery in activity - allows more job creation for part-time and temporary jobs. Survey indicators remained upbeat in terms of job creation over the next few months, anticipating more momentum for the UK labour market going forward. That said, the ILO unemployment rate showed some stabilization at 7.2% the three months through January, confirming the idea that the recent downward trend has lost some steam. It appears the unemployment rate even went below Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s initial forward guidance of 7% (now abandoned of course): The number of people in employment hit a new high of just under 30.2m, helped by a rise in self-employment, UK government figures show. Meanwhile the jobless rate was steady at 7.2% as expected, not far away from the now abandoned target set by the Bank of England in its initial attempt at forward guidance. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell by 34,600, more than the 25,000 decline expected. The figures underline the recovery in the labour market. Average earnings rose by 1.4% in the three months to January, higher than the expected 1.3% increase and marking the largest rise since the middle of 2013. Here are the Reuters snaps on the jobs data: 09:30 - UK FEB UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT CLAIMANT COUNT -34,600 (POLL -25,000) 09:30 - UK ILO JOBLESS RATE 7.2 PCT IN THE 3 MTHS TO JAN (POLL 7.2 PCT) 09:30 - UK LFS EMPLOYMENT +105,000 TO 30.191 MLN IN 3 MTHS THROUGH JAN 09:30 - UK AVG WEEKLY EARNINGS 1.4 PCT YY IN 3 MTHS THROUGH JAN (POLL +1.3 PCT); JAN ALONE 1.7 PCT YY 09:30 - UK AVG WEEKLY EARNINGS EX-BONUSES 1.3 PCT YY IN 3 MTHS THROUGH JAN (POLL +1.2 PCT), JAN ALONE 1.8 PCT YY The unemployment rate was steady at 7.2% in the three months to January, while claimant count fell 34,600 compared to estimates of 25,000. Average earnings rose 1.4%, higher than the expected 1.3% More developments at the troubled Co-operative Group. It has delayed its annual results - due on 26 March - until April 17. Meanwhile it has made some management changes, among them Claire Davies joining from Lloyds Banking Group as group secretary. There will be a new role of chief operating officer, which will be filled by Richard Pennycook, who is currently interim chief executive, when a permanent chief executive is appointed. The full statement is here: Changes to executive management team Very little in the way of company news at the moment, but Spain\u2019s Inditex - owner of the Zara brand - has reported flat profits of \u20ac3.9bn for last year. This is the first time growth has stalled since the company went public in 2001, hit by falling currencies outside the eurozone and the cost of revamping some of its stores. But its shares have added more than 3% in early trading after the company - the world\u2019s biggest fashion retailer - said sales had picked up in the current year, up 12% between February 1 and March 15. This compares to a 5% rise last year. It also plans to accelerate investment in 2014 and open more new stores. My colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Graeme Wearden are live blogging George Osborne\u2019s latest budget, with all the previews, the speech and details of the proposed measures, as well as all the reaction. The blog can be found here: Budget 2014 - live In Japan export growth fell short of expectations, prompting analysts to forecast further stimulus measures by the central bank by the summer. February exports grew by 9.8% but this was below the 12.4% predicted. Shipments to the US slowed sharply after the cold spell there. Japan\u2019s domestic growth could be hit by a sales tax hike which comes next month, so exports are key to countering any slide at home. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and the business world. Markets are cautious this morning after Russia annexed Crimea into the federation following Sunday\u2019s referendum vote, leaving the situation in Ukraine uncertain. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: Yesterday\u2019s move higher in equity markets was pretty much predicated on the premise that Russian President Vladimir Putin would stick to his word when he said that Russia had no intention of splitting Ukraine, and would respect the rest of the territorial integrity of the country. While markets may be na\u00efve enough to take this comment at face value it\u2019s hardly likely to sit well elsewhere in the region, and his words might carry more weight if there weren\u2019t thousands of troops sitting on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border, where just miles inside that border there is a strong separatist movement, which could well go on to cause further problems for Kiev in the coming days. There is also the fact that EU and US leaders are hardly likely to sit idly by and do nothing and certainly have room to add further sanctions to the initial list announced Monday, which suggests that the recent volatility in stock markets is likely to continue for some time to come, particularly if further economic sanctions are agreed upon later this week. So the FTSE 100 has slipped 20.6 points or 0.3% while France\u2019s Cac is down around 9 points. But Germany\u2019s Dax is virtually unchanged. Away from Russia, it is a big day for UK data. Unemployment figures are due at 9.30 and are forecast to show the jobless rate steady at 7.2%. Average earnings are expected to show a 1.3% rise for the three months to January. Bank of England minutes are also due and could show a difference of opinion over the amount of spare capacity in the UK economy, to judge by testimonies to the Treasury Select Committee last week. There is also the UK budget to contend with, and later, Janet Yellen will unveil the outcome of her first meeting as Federal Reserve chair, with the central bank expected to trim its monthly bond buying programme by another $10bn.",

I know that the company and the unions are alert to this \u2026 we cannot leave the situation as it is,\" she told French radio.</p> <p>The observatory was set up after the earlier wave of suicides caused widespread concern about working conditions and practices at the firm.</p> <p>The company's former boss Didier Lombard resigned after 35 employee killed themselves between 2008 and 2009. He was lambasted and forced to apologise after suggesting suicide was a \"fashion\" at the company.</p> <p>In 2012, Lombard was put under formal police investigation accused of installing \"brutal management methods\" that amounted to \"moral harassment\".</p> <p>Le Parisien published an internal company document from 2006 in which Lombard allegedly told directors he was determined to cut 22,000 jobs, adding \"I'll do it in one way or the other, by the window or by the door.\"</p> <p>Lombard denied that his methods were the cause of the deaths.

Of the estimated 10,000 suicides in France each year \u2013 27 every day \u2013 at least 400 can be directly linked to stress caused by work, but employment concerns are believed to be a factor in many more deaths.</p> <p>In May 2012, the left-leaning newspaper Lib\u00e9ration published a manifesto signed by 44 French psychiatrists, sociologists and politicians calling for a national observatory to monitor suicide cases and understand the phenomenon with a view to better prevention.</p>",

On Wednesday the French health minister, Marisol Touraine, called the new deaths worrying. \"The company has to take the necessary measures. I know that the company and the unions are alert to this \u2026 we cannot leave the situation as it is,\" she told French radio. The observatory was set up after the earlier wave of suicides caused widespread concern about working conditions and practices at the firm. The company's former boss Didier Lombard resigned after 35 employee killed themselves between 2008 and 2009. He was lambasted and forced to apologise after suggesting suicide was a \"fashion\" at the company. In 2012, Lombard was put under formal police investigation accused of installing \"brutal management methods\" that amounted to \"moral harassment\". Le Parisien published an internal company document from 2006 in which Lombard allegedly told directors he was determined to cut 22,000 jobs, adding \"I'll do it in one way or the other, by the window or by the door.\" Lombard denied that his methods were the cause of the deaths. He remains under investigation. An official report by the works inspectorate in 2010 blamed a climate of \"management harassment\" that it said had \"psychologically weakened staff and attacked their physical and mental health\". Since then, Patrick Ackermann, delegate for the SUD union and member of the observatory, said the situation had eased, but last month the group issued a warning to management of a \"dramatic worsening\" of morale within the company to 2007 levels. \"For the last two years, the pressure from management has started again and working conditions have once more deteriorated,\" it said. Factors driving workers to depression included a reduced workforce being asked to produce better results, staff being obliged to relocate, the threat of site closures and job losses, and an atmosphere of increased competition between workers. \"Also, what we are seeing among mid-level directors is a return to old and brutal methods of management,\" the observatory said in a statement. France Telecom was privatised in 2004, sparking a major restructuring and the loss of scores of jobs. The company, known since last year as Orange to match the name of its mobile phone operation, currently employs around 100,000, but has pledged further cuts to the workforce. In a statement, Orange admitted there had been \"several suicides\" this year, adding: \"Each of these acts is by its nature singular and stem from different contexts. But these situations remind us to be vigilant and for the need to repeatedly question the efficiency of the numerous preventative measures put in place several for the past few years.\" The firm's mediator, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Colin, will meet with staff representatives on Friday to talk about \"preventative measures\" for those at risk. France has a suicide rate of 14.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, well above the European average of 10.2 per 100,000 people, three times higher than in Italy and Spain and twice the rate in Britain. Of the estimated 10,000 suicides in France each year \u2013 27 every day \u2013 at least 400 can be directly linked to stress caused by work, but employment concerns are believed to be a factor in many more deaths. In May 2012, the left-leaning newspaper Lib\u00e9ration published a manifesto signed by 44 French psychiatrists, sociologists and politicians calling for a national observatory to monitor suicide cases and understand the phenomenon with a view to better prevention.",

    "webTitle": "Toyota reaches $1.2bn settlement in safety-related criminal inquiry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Toyota agreed to pay $1.2bn on Wednesday to end a US criminal investigation into misleading statements the car company made about safety issues in Toyota and Lexus vehicles after a series of crashes. The deal, announced by the Department of Justice, caps a four-year investigation on the way Toyota disclosed issues related to allegations of sudden acceleration in its cars in the late 2000s. At a press conference, attorney general Eric Holder called Toyota\u2019s behaviour \u201cshameful\u201d and said the company had deliberately concealed issues with its vehicles from the authorities. Sporadic reports of unintended acceleration gained national attention in the US 2009 after off-duty California highway patrolman Mark Saylor and three family members were killed when he lost control of the Lexus ES 350 he was driving. Saylor\u2019s brother-in-law made a frantic 911 ahead of the crash saying: \u201cWe\u2019re in a Lexus \u2026 and we\u2019re going north on 125 and our accelerator is stuck .\u2026 there\u2019s no brakes \u2026 we\u2019re approaching the intersection \u2026 Hold on \u2026 hold on and pray \u2026 pray.\u201d Investigators determined the accident was caused by an improperly installed floor mat that trapped the gas pedal. Shortly after Toyota recalled 3.8m cars and trucks to replace their gas pedals with a design less susceptible to interference from floor mats. But it knew of another problem relating to some US-manufactured pedals that caused them to stick, failed to alert investigators and did not inform the public. \u201cRather than promptly disclosing and correcting safety issues about which they were aware, Toyota made misleading public statements to consumers and gave inaccurate facts to members of Congress,\u201d said Holder. \u201cWhen car owners get behind the wheel, they have a right to expect that their vehicle is safe. If any part of the automobile turns out to have safety issues, the car company has a duty to be upfront about them, to fix them quickly, and to immediately tell the truth about the problem and its scope. Toyota violated that basic compact. Other car companies should not repeat Toyota\u2019s mistake: a recall may damage a company\u2019s reputation, but deceiving your customers makes that damage far more lasting.\u201d In a prepared statement, Toyota said it had overhauled its procedures in an attempt to win back the trust of consumers. Christopher Reynolds, its chief legal officer for north America, said: \u201cAt the time of these recalls, we took full responsibility for any concerns our actions may have caused customers, and we rededicated ourselves to earning their trust. In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first.\u201d The fine is the largest ever imposed on an auto maker, and includes a deferred prosecution agreement, which allows Toyota to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court. An independent monitor will review and assess Toyota\u2019s policies, practices and procedures relating to public safety statements and its reporting obligations. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), five people died as a result of accidents involving claims of unwanted acceleration. The NHTSA\u2019s investigations determined that driver error or floor mats trapping accelerator pedals were involved in most accidents and did not find any evidence of electronic fault. Toyota deceived the NHTSA, said the Justice Department, when it claimed improperly secured or incompatible all-weather floor mats trapping a depressed gas pedal were the \u201croot cause\u201d of cars accelerating to a high speed. At the same time as the company claimed to have identified the primary issue, Toyota knew it had another problem relating to pedals manufactured by a US manufacturer, unnamed by the US authorities, and installed in many Toyota brand vehicles in north America as well as Europe. Plastic material inside the pedals were causing some accelerator pedals to become stuck in a partially depressed position. The sticky pedal issue first surfaced in Europe in 2008, and the company told dealers to replace the pedals if customers complained with one made by a rival to the unnamed US pedal manufacturer. However, the company did not inform the US authorities of the issue \u2013 even though sticky pedal incidents were being reported in the US. But after the Saylor crash, Toyota decided to hide the stick pedal issue from the NHTSA, said the justice department. The company quietly cancelled a planned design change in order not to create a paper trail that would be picked up by the US authorities, said the justice department. In 2009, responding to media allegations that the company had hidden defects in its cars, Toyota issued the following statement: \u201cToyota has absolutely not minimized public awareness of any defect or issue with respect to its vehicles. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong and borders on irresponsibility. We are confident that the measures we are taking address the root cause and will reduce the risk of pedal entrapment.\u201d \u201cIn fact, Toyota had \u2018minimized public awareness of\u2019 both sticky pedal and floor-mat entrapment,\u201d said the Justice Department. \u201cToyota stands charged with a criminal offense because it cared more about savings than safety and more about its own brand and bottom line than the truth,\u201d said Preet Bharara, US attorney for the southern district of New York. \u201cIn its zeal to stanch bad publicity in 2009 and 2010, Toyota misled regulators, misled customers, and even misstated the facts to Congress.\u201d The auto maker has been fined a total of $66.2m by NHTSA for failing to report safety defects to the government. The settlement comes after General Motors has recalled 3.3m vehicles in four separate recalls that have been linked to a dozen deaths. Those recalls are now subject to a federal investigation that has shown GM employees first identified the problems a decade ago. GM chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday: \u201cSomething went wrong with our process in this instance, and terrible things happened.\u201d",

In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first.\u201d</p> <p>The fine is the largest ever imposed on an auto maker, and includes a deferred prosecution agreement, which allows Toyota to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court. An independent monitor will review and assess Toyota\u2019s policies, practices and procedures relating to public safety statements and its reporting obligations.<br></p> <p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), five people died as a result of accidents involving claims of unwanted acceleration. The NHTSA\u2019s investigations determined that driver error or floor mats trapping accelerator pedals were involved in most accidents and did not find any evidence of electronic fault.</p> <p>Toyota deceived the NHTSA, said the Justice Department, when it claimed improperly secured or incompatible all-weather floor mats trapping a depressed gas pedal were the \u201croot cause\u201d of cars accelerating to a high speed. </p> <p>At the same time as the company claimed to have identified the primary issue, Toyota knew it had another problem relating to pedals manufactured by a US manufacturer, unnamed by the US authorities, and installed in many Toyota brand vehicles in north America as well as Europe. Plastic material inside the pedals were causing some accelerator pedals to become stuck in a partially depressed position. </p> <p>The sticky pedal issue first surfaced in Europe in 2008, and the company told dealers to replace the pedals if customers complained with one made by a rival to the unnamed US pedal manufacturer. </p> <p>However, the company did not inform the US authorities of the issue \u2013 even though sticky pedal incidents were being reported in the US. But after the Saylor crash, Toyota decided to hide the stick pedal issue from the NHTSA, said the justice department. The company quietly cancelled a planned design change in order not to create a paper trail that would be picked up by the US authorities, said the justice department.</p> <p>In 2009, responding to media allegations that the company had hidden defects in its cars, Toyota issued the following statement: \u201cToyota has absolutely not minimized public awareness of any defect or issue with respect to its vehicles. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong and borders on irresponsibility. We are confident that the measures we are taking address the root cause and will reduce the risk of pedal entrapment.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIn fact, Toyota had \u2018minimized public awareness of\u2019 both sticky pedal and floor-mat entrapment,\u201d said the Justice Department.</p> <p>\u201cToyota stands charged with a criminal offense because it cared more about savings than safety and more about its own brand and bottom line than the truth,\u201d said Preet Bharara, US attorney for the southern district of New York. \u201cIn its zeal to stanch bad publicity in 2009 and 2010, Toyota misled regulators, misled customers, and even misstated the facts to Congress.\u201d</p> <p>The auto maker has been fined a total of $66.2m by NHTSA for failing to report safety defects to the government.</p> <p>The settlement comes after General Motors has recalled 3.3m vehicles in four separate recalls that have been linked to a dozen deaths. Those recalls are now subject to a federal investigation that has shown GM employees first identified the problems a decade ago.</p> <p>GM chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday: \u201cSomething went wrong with our process in this instance, and terrible things happened.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The embattled Co-operative Group has been forced to delay its full-year results, it admitted on Wednesday, as it announced a management overhaul in the wake of the sudden resignation of chief executive Euan Sutherland. The chain of supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes, which is on course to report losses of at least \u00a32bn, also revealed it intended to hold a special meeting of its members in June or July to vote on proposals by Lord Myners for a radical overhaul of its complex management structure. Sutherland quit a week ago after just 10 months in the job, after details of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal were leaked to the Observer along with revelations that his newly assembled management team was also being offered \"retention\" packages for 2013 and 2014. It is understood that the remaining members of the team, including Sutherland's temporary stand-in, Richard Pennycook, are considering whether to accept those controversial retention deals, which were agreed by the board last July in the midst of the battle to stop the Co-op bank collapsing. Pennycook, the respected former finance director of supermarket chain W M Morrison, was left to front the management overhaul that Sutherland had set in train before his resignation and insisted the changes would mean the group was \"better positioned to tackle the complex issues we face\". He is eventually to become chief operations officer, the group said on Wednesday, and according to the Observer leak he would receive a \u00a3900,000 salary and be entitled to a \u00a3900,000 rentention package. The results, expected to include a deep write-down of the value of the Somerfield supermarket business which has left the group saddled with debt, will now be presented on 17 April instead of 26 March to give Pennycook more time to prepare. The results of the bank \u2013 of which the group owns just 30% after least year's \u00a31.5bn rescue fundraising \u2013 may also be delayed. The Co-op confirmed for the first time that Rebecca Skitt, the personnel director, had left but would not comment on the leak that she had been handed a \u00a32m pay-off. Such information would be expected to be included in the annual report, also now scheduled for publication on 17 April.

Myners, who was chairman of Guardian Media Group until his elevation to the Lords to become City minister during the banking crisis, has also called for an audit of \"controls over money spent on social goals and given to affiliated bodies\".
