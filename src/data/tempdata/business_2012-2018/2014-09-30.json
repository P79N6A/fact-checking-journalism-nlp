This could be the new mantra at Sainsbury\u2019s checkouts after a secret new strategy to boost sales was accidentally revealed by a member of staff at the grocer\u2019s Romford branch. The supermarket is exhorting its staff to get shoppers to spend an extra 50p on every visit \u2013 but the cunning plan was mistakenly made public when a poster designed for the supermarket\u2019s staff room was instead pasted in the grocer\u2019s window for all to see. The \u201cFifty pence challenge\u201d poster was snapped by passerby Chris Dodd, who loaded his picture onto Twitter . The image was then rapidly retweeted by more than 3,700 people. \u201cLet\u2019s encourage every customer to spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip between now and the year end,\u201d it read. Encouraging shoppers to buy a little extra is a common retail trick, famously employed by the burger chain McDonalds which boosts sales by asking \u201cwould you like fries with that?\u201d and by WH Smith, which has long tried to force feed its customers with giant slabs of chocolate at the cash register. Retail insiders said Sainsbury\u2019s staff faced a trickier task, given that supermarkets are self-service. But the wags on Twitter had a variety of suggestions: \u201cWhen customers are not looking, just stuff a few extra items into their basket,\u201d offered one. Another idea put forward was to \u201cdouble swipe a 50p item at the checkout.\u201d Some, however, were outraged that Sainsbury\u2019s was pushing staff to get shoppers to spend more, when the grocer\u2019s new adverts promise to save shoppers money with price cuts and its slogan is \u201cLive well for less\u201d. In a statement, the retailer admitted that the poster had been mistakenly put up on public display, but said the spend more strategy was supposed to spread a little joy into the lives of its store assistants: \u201cWe often use posters to make store targets fun and achievable for our colleagues.\u201d PR expert Mark Borkowski said the commotion on Twitter was \u201cembarrassing and not useful\u201d for Sainsbury\u2019s, but he pointed out that the grocer has \u201cgot much bigger issues\u201d as competition hots up in the grocery business. Sainsbury\u2019s is today expected to reveal a sharp drop in sales amid a bitter price war. All the big supermarkets are under increasing pressure as food prices are barely rising and shoppers are defecting in their droves to discounters such as Lidl and Aldi.",

Equally, it should not require the chief executive of Next to point out that it\u2019s been sunny lately for the City to guess that sales of clobber for autumn and winter might be running a little light. Lord Wolfson\u2019s non-revelation about \u201cthe recent spell of unseasonably warm weather\u201d nevertheless dented Next\u2019s share price by 4%. Did the City think the retailer had sun-resistant qualities? Next is a top-class operator but that was assuming too much. As it happens, Next\u2019s \u201cmiss\u201d wasn\u2019t much to shout about. Sales in the third quarter to date (August and September) are 6% ahead of last year, against the company\u2019s forecast of 10%. The trade won\u2019t all come back when the weather turns, but some will. In the meantime, guidance for full-year profits of \u00a3775m-\u00a3815m remains unchanged, barring warm weather for \u201cthe full duration\u201d of October. No big deal. It\u2019s harder, though, to be confident that September sun won\u2019t cause upsets elsewhere. Not every clothing retailer shares Next\u2019s iron discipline in avoiding panicky sales. Is there a touch of sunstroke at work in Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s current \u201c50% off\u201d posters? Just a planned mid-season sale on selected items, same as last year, says the company. Well, maybe, but the M&amp;S share price, down 2.5%, has once again drifted within pennies of 400p, where it hasn\u2019t been for 16 months. The 400p figure, being the level at which Sir Philip Green made his cheeky bid a decade ago, is totemic. Its reappearance spells fresh danger for chief executive Marc Bolland, who seemed to have turned the corner six months ago when a 500p share price was spotted and the shiny new website finally appeared. Bolland has been boss for four years \u2013 far too long to blame a brief Indian summer if M&amp;S is once again losing market share in clothing. The difference at Next is that sales still go up when the market is weak. RBS property boost These look like big numbers at Royal Bank of Scotland. Some \u00a3800m of impairment charges will be released in the next set of quarterly results \u2013 that\u2019s a net figure, too. Rising property prices, especially in Ireland, are finally providing relief. It\u2019s welcome news, of course, but let\u2019s get some context. RBS\u2019s Ulster Bank unit alone accumulated provisions of \u00a317.4bn from 2009-2014, so the upcoming release of \u00a3300m in Ireland is little more than a rounding entry. Nor is chief executive Ross McEwan encouraging thoughts that RBS might be able to pay a dividend sooner than hoped. His \u201cmental timeline\u201d is still 18 months and he has good reason to dampen any enthusiasm. \u201cPreviously disclosed uncertainties remain, particularly relating to conduct and litigation matters,\u201d said the statement. You bet. At the top of the list is mortgage-backed securities in the US. Then there\u2019s possible foreign exchange rigging. And there could more hits from payment protection insurance and interest-rate swaps. What does that unlovely collection add up to? Ask the analysts and you will find estimates ranging from \u00a32bn to \u00a35bn. US regulators, in particular, are impossible to read and dangerous to underestimate. RBS remains a place where a positive \u00a3800m can get lost in the wash. McEwan is right to be cautious. U-turn on PayPal One minute eBay said it was wedded to owning PayPal for eternity because the businesses were joined at the hip; the next it plans to liberate the payment system via a stock market listing. Activist investor Carl Icahn, chief lobbyist for the demerger, sometimes waits years before his efforts bear fruit, if at all. In this case, eBay has rolled over in nine months. It\u2019s an extraordinary corporate U-turn. What happened? The short answer is that Icahn was right all along. John Donahoe, eBay chief executive, had run out of decent objections to a split. The argument in favour of a demerger is very simple. PayPal\u2019s growth was supercharged in early years of ownership because the service was force-fed to eBay customers. But the game now is about enticing the likes of Apple and Amazon to use PayPal, a task that is more easily done beyond eBay\u2019s control and without competitive conflicts. Well played Icahn. Sainsbury\u2019s 50p target How will Sainsbury\u2019s staff persuade the customers to spend an extra 50p per visit? Twitter\u2019s best answer was to slip a product or two in the punters\u2019 baskets when they\u2019re not looking. That, one assumes, is not what management has in mind. But you can\u2019t blame staff for being confused by such a vague exhortation from head office to up their game. And why 50p? Perhaps new chief executive Mike Coupe came up with the figure while gazing at the fall in Sainsbury\u2019s share price since he took over in July. That\u2019ll be 65p now.",

      "bodyText": "Weak eurozone inflation figures helped lift stock markets, as investors bet the European Central Bank would act to stimulate the region\u2019s flagging economy. The ECB meets on Thursday, with more details of its plan to buy asset backed securities expected. Despite the increases, investors were still cautious, with the continuing protests in Hong Kong, reports (later denied) that Russia was considering capital controls, and a weak manufacturing survey from China. And the FTSE 100 missed out on the rises, with retailers under pressure after stock market star Next said it may have to trim its profit forecasts since the warm weather was putting people off buying winter clothes. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 23.88 points or 0.36% lower at 6622.72 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.55% to 9474.30 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.33% higher at 4416.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 1.78% to 20,892.11 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.31% better at 10,825.5 as Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy said he was legally appealing Catalonia\u2019s proposed independence referendum In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 49 points or 0.29% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Mission chiefs representing Greece\u2019s triumvirate of creditors are back in the county for what many believe will be a stormy last review of the Greek economy - ahead of more talks over how to deal with its debt later in the year. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Finance Minister Gikas Hardouvelis kicked off what essentially is the fifth economic review of the Greek economy - and if government officials are to be believed the last by international supervisors connected to the EU, ECB and IMF - earlier today with a meeting with troika officials in his sixth floor office. Greeks officials are putting on a bold face saying: \u201cthe talks took place in a good climate and went well.\u201d But the negotiations are not going to be easy: the two sides are at odds over next year\u2019s budget, the size of the financing gap slated for 2015/16, the size of the primary surplus Greece has said is one of its biggest achievements, and whether Athens will need a third bailout. The government, facing stiff opposition from the vehemently anti-bailout radical left Syriza party which is now leading in all polls, is determined it does not need a new financial assistance programme with prime minister Antonis Samaras telling MPs over the weekend that Greece has exited the \u201cmemorandum\u201d accord with its creditors and will be forging ahead with tax breaks (another point of contention). Perhaps everything isn\u2019t as rosy in America\u2019s economy as expected. US consumer confidence has fallen unexpectedly this month, to a four-month low. The Confidence Board\u2019s monthly survey of morale dipped to 86.0 from 93.4 in August. Consumers said they were more worried about job prospects and likely future economic conditions. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, explains: \u201cA less positive assessment of the current job market, most likely due to the recent softening in growth, was the sole reason for the decline in consumers\u2019 assessment of present-day conditions.\u201d \u201cAll told, consumers expect economic growth to ease in the months ahead.\u201d Oh dear. There will be red faces at Europe\u2019s statistics body, Eurostat, this afternoon, after it admitted getting some of this morning\u2019s inflation data wrong. It initially reported that one measure of core eurozone inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed food) had fallen to 0.7% from 0.9%. But after checking its sums again, eurostat has realised the correct answer was 0.8%. It\u2019s being blamed on a \u2018rounding error\u2019. The headline inflation rate is unchanged, though, at just +0.3%. From Wall Street, here\u2019s my colleague Dominic Rushe on today\u2019s eBay news: Online auction site eBay plans to spin off its PayPal business into a separate publicly traded company next year, the company announced on Tuesday. The surprise move comes after the company had rebuffed calls from billionaire hedge fund investor Carl Icahn to sell off its online payments business. The decision comes shortly after Apple unveiled a new mobile payment system, Apple Pay, that looks set to be a fierce rival to PayPal and Alibaba, China\u2019s massive online marketplace, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cThe industry landscape is changing, and each business faces different competitive opportunities and challenges,\u201d eBay chief executive John Donahoe said in a news release.... (for more click here) eBay\u2019s share price surge has taken it close to the recent high set in August but it\u2019s still below the all-time closing high (i think) set in early March this year. As this chart shows, eBay shares started to fall after investor Carl Icahn stopped agitating for the company to spin off PayPal. DING DING DING goes the Wall Street opening bell, and UP UP UP go eBay\u2019s shares. Shares in the company jumped by 7.3% at the start of trading. They\u2019ve now settled up 6.5%, gaining almost $3.50 to $56.12. Other tech companies are also rising. Investors clearly feel that the two operations are better apart, and agree with eBay\u2019s CEO John Donahoe that a split will help PayPal and eBay to tackle \u201cdifferent competitive opportunities and challenges.\u201d There\u2019s an media truism that \u2018all headlines come true eventually\u2019. Technology venture capitalist Josh Kopelman could claim the same about his forecasts: Looking back at the eBay-Paypal split...and analysts suggest that the deal could give the payments service new life. Jason Del Rey of Re/code flags up that PayPal has lost the gloss it once enjoyed as a serious tech pioneer, before being bought by eBay in 2002. Based on conversations with people who work in the payments game, PayPal rarely ranks at the top of wish lists that top talent wants to work for, despite generating $6.6 billion in revenue last year and growing at a rate of 20 percent annually. Part of the reason for that is after 12 years as an eBay subsidiary, PayPal is no longer seen as an innovator. After the split, PayPal will be able to offer its own stock to potential employees to lure them on board, along with the promise of a more focused business. The move gives eBay new leadership too; with president of eBay Marketplaces, Devin Wenig, stepping up. The PayPal question may also have been dragging eBay back; its shares have underperformed the wider tech sector this year. Carl Icahn\u2019s regular prompting must have been a boardroom distraction; at a time when eBay\u2019s overall revenues are only growing half as fast as PayPal\u2019s. Currently, PayPal handles one of every six dollars spent online. So Apple, with its new Pay service, is a major threat. And the web market is still changing fast, as the WSJ points out: Additionally, the recent U.S. initial public offering of China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2014a massive, rapidly growing, multifaceted online marketplace\u2014commenced a new stage in the transformation of commerce and payments. Here\u2019s our take on the other big story of the day, the European Union\u2019s investigation into the\u201dsweetheart\u201d tax relief which the Irish government granted to Apple for over a decade. Apple may have to repay millions from Irish government tax deal Apple may have to repay the tens of millions of euros that it received as \u201cillegal state aid\u201d through a sweetheart tax deal with the Irish government between 1991 and 2007. The European commission (EC) on Tuesday formally opened an investigation into the deals, with the outgoing competition commissioner, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, warning that the recipient of any state aid would be liable to repay it..... (click here for more) Marketwatch flags up Carl Icahn\u2019s eBay stake is now worth a chunky $138m more than last night, based on pre-market moves on Wall Street. It\u2019s a good day for Carl Icahn. Not only is eBay now following his proposal to spin off the faster growing PayPal business into a separate company, but the news has sent eBay\u2019s shares sharply higher in pre-market trading. So Icahn is vindicated and his 30m shares in the company are worth substantially more. eBay shares were suspended in pre-market trading ahead of the announcement of the PayPal spin-off, but they are back now: Interesting news coming out of the US, with eBay announcing it has decided to spin off its PayPal business into an independent publicly traded company next year. The move seems to be a u-turn from the company\u2019s previous position but eBay president John Donahoe said: For more than a decade, eBay and PayPal have mutually benefitted from being part of one company, creating substantial shareholder value. However a thorough strategic review with our board shows that keeping eBay and PayPal together beyond 2015 clearly becomes less advantageous to each business strategically and competitively. The industry landscape is changing, and each business faces different competitive opportunities and challenges. eBay and PayPal will be sharper and stronger, and more focused and competitive as leading standalone companies in their respective markets. Earlier this year activist investor Carl Icahn pressed the company to split the faster growing PayPal business from the original auction site, but the board managed to see off these demands. Now however, the plans seem to have changed. A presentation on the spin-off is here (PDF) Back with the news that the UK economy grew even faster than expected in the second quarter of this year, and the reaction continues to come in. One point for discussion is what effect the stronger than forecast figures will have on the Bank of England\u2019s deliberations about raising interest rates. David Kern, Chief Economist at the British Chambers of Commerce said: Overall these figures are positive \u2013 they show an upward revision in quarterly growth in the second quarter and growth in business investment. The current level of GDP is considerably higher than its pre-recession level, which mirrors our view that earlier official estimates have understated growth in recent years. However, there are concerning features in the latest figures - the volume of exports has fallen slightly and the current account deficit has widened to above 5% of GDP, a level which in the long- term will prove to be unsustainable. While the strength of the recovery will support business confidence, these figures reinforce the need to rebalance the economy towards exports and investment. It is important that the [Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee] and the government make every effort to sustain the recovery. Interest rates must be kept low until there is a clear need to start increasing them, and government must do more to support exporters and improve access to finance for growing businesses. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: Overall, while sizeable, the adjustments to measured GDP do not significantly change the story of a deep recession followed by a protracted recovery. And since key indicators of the amount of spare capacity in the economy such as inflation, wages and unemployment are not being revised, there seems little reason for the OBR or the Bank of England to change their view on this. So the implications of the revised national accounts for economic policy should be limited. But Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: All in all, the data paint a far brighter picture of the UK\u2019s economic recovery than previously thought, but the revisions will probably do little to change the official economic outlook at the Bank of England. The Bank had already pencilled-in faster growth in the second quarter, and also uses the business surveys to \u2018back-cast\u2019 GDP over recent years, so the upward revisions to the official data were already baked into the policy cake to a large degree. However, while the Bank\u2019s official outlook is likely to be little changed following these revisions, it\u2019s hard to see that the brighter picture will not add strength to the voices and conviction of those members of the Monetary Policy Committee who have already voted to hike interest rates. Meanwhile the TUC focused on the signs of falling household incomes. General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: While the size of the economy has been revised up, household incomes have been revised down. It turns out the UK\u2019s living standards crisis is even worse than we thought. This is set to be the first full Parliament since the Second World War when the government leaves office with people\u2019s pay packets worth less than when they came into power. There is something deeply wrong when the economy is growing, but the people who do all the work face ever shrinking pay and falling living standards. We need an economy where everyone gets a fair share of growing prosperity instead of just a few at the top, with growth driven by rising wages rather than growing household debts. Today\u2019s downbeat eurozone data means ECB president Mario Draghi might soon have to bite the bullet and authorise fully blown quantitative easing, something that Germany for one is not keen on. That is the view of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, whose economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said: Today\u2019s news of a further fall in inflation set an urgent ground for the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) announcement on Thursday detailing its plan to buy asset-backed securities. Cebr is cautious about whether such a programme will be enough to steer the Eurozone ship towards a sustainable recovery. Even the maximum possible of \u20ac1.4 trillion of asset purchases will be equivalent to roughly only 15% of Eurozone GDP \u2013 the scale of quantitative easing in the US and the UK was higher at around 25% of GDP. With both domestic and global weaknesses keeping inflation subdued, it might not be too long before Draghi has to resort to full-blown QE. Time for a quick catch-up after a busy morning. Pressure is mounting on the European Central Bank to take fresh action after inflation in the euro area fell to just 0.3% this month, and core inflation weakened to 0.7%. The euro has fallen to fresh two-year lows against both the US dollar and the pound, as traders anticipate more easing from the ECB. There\u2019s also little improvement in Europe\u2019s labour market. The eurozone jobless rate was unchanged last month at 11.5%... ..and youth unemployment in Italy has hit a fresh record high. In the UK, though, fresh data has shown that the economy is bigger than previously thought. Revisions, to bring Britain into line with global standards, show that it surpassed its pre-crisis peak a year ago. The recovery is still slow in historic terms, though: The Office for National Statistics also reported that the UK grew a little faster than expected in the last quarter, with GDP rising by 0.9% (not 0.8%). Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s story: UK economy bigger and growing faster than thought, says ONS Elsewhere.... Nationwide has reported that UK house price have fallen, for the first time in 17 months. Prices in St Ablans are up 24%, and some London boroughs are even hotter than that. High street retailer Next has warned that recent warm weather has hit demand for new clothes. Shares are down 4.3% at pixel time. Profits at payday lender Wonga have halved. The \u2018fake letter\u2019 scandal, in which it sent 45,000 legal letters from a ficticious law firm, cost the company a total of \u00a318.8m. But Royal Bank of Scotland has announced that its bad loan provisions will be smaller than thought, thanks to an economic recovery in \u201ckey markets, including Ireland\u201d. Shares are up 2.7%. John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist, says today\u2019s revised British growth figures \u201cnow makes the UK look more like Germany and less like France\u201d. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says today\u2019s data show eurozone inflation continues to fall perilously close to zero: While it was widely forecast, today\u2019s drop in consumer price inflation to just 0.3% - a five year low - heaps further pressure on Mario Draghi to engage in QE. I believe he will succumb to this pressure eventually, though perhaps not as soon as Thursday\u2019s policy announcement. Stiff opposition from Germany will need to be overcome, and that will take time. Last week Draghi hinted at the prospect of QE, saying \u201cwe stand ready to use additional unconventional instruments\u201d. The market certainly believes today\u2019s figure has brought QE closer \u2013 the euro fell sharply on the news (by almost a cent against the US dollar). The euro is now 9% lower against the dollar than its May peak, and this should aid the euro zone\u2019s struggling exporters. The ECB has in the past taken comfort in the fact that while inflation may be falling, inflation expectations are positive. However, inflation expectations are also declining amongst both consumers and producers, and it is worth noting that inflation expectations remained positive in Japan prior to its \u2018lost decade\u2019. Credit Agricole economist Frederik Ducrozet reckons that core eurozone inflation (down from 0.9% to 0.7%), could be revised higher in Eurostat\u2019s final data. Unless France\u2019s prices have fallen really sharply.... BNP economist Alexandra Estiot flags up that sales are rampant in Paris right now, so maybe something is afoot in France.... Looking back at the new UK growth data....Andrew Goodwin, Senior UK Economist at Oxford Economics, flags up that America\u2019s economy has still powered ahead: The euro has fallen sharply following the news that eurozone inflation sagged to just 0.3% this month. It shed three quarters of a cent against the US dollar, to \u20ac1.2608, a new two-year low. And the euro has also hit a 26 month low against sterling, meaning one pound is now worth \u20ac1.2843. Traders are calculating that today\u2019s inflation report, including the drop in core inflation, will spur the European Central Bank into action. It meets on Thursday, and should discuss the asset-backed securities purchase scheme it announced (without much detail) last month. Crucially, core inflation in the eurozone (stripping out volatile food, alcohol and energy prices) has fallen too, to just 0.7% from 0.9% in August. The eurozone has slipped closer to deflation this month, which will renew fears that Europe risks suffering Japanification unless policymakers manage to stimulate the economy. Inflation across the single currency region has fallen to a fresh five-year low of 0.3% this month, Eurostat has reported. That\u2019s down from 0.4% in August. Once again, falling energy costs were the main driver behind the slowdown in the rising cost of living. But it wasn\u2019t the only factor. Eurostat estimates that inflation in the service sector rose by 1.1%, annually, this month. Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco prises rose by just 0.2%, and non-energy industrial goods by just 0.1%. Energy prices slid by 2.4%, having dropped by -2.0% in August. Reaction to follow.... Europe\u2019s young people continue to suffer badly from the crisis. In August 2014, the youth unemployment rate across the European Union was 21.6%, down from 23.5% a year ago. In the eurozone, the youth unemployment rate is 23.3%, down from 23.9% in August 2013. And as flagged up earlier, Italy\u2019s youth jobless rate hit a record high. Our data editor Alberto Nardelli has tweeted the details: Back to the eurozone, the unemployment rate across the single currency region was steady at 11.5%, Eurostat has just reported. That\u2019s no better than in July, and not far from the record high of 12% set last year. The wider rate across the EU fell to 10.1%, from 10.2%. And as usual, there are sharp differences between Member States: The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.7%) and Germany (4.9%), according to Eurostat\u2019s methodology and the highest in Greece (27.0% in June 2014) and Spain (24.4%). Compared with a year ago, the unemployment rate fell in twenty-two Member States, increased in four and remained stable in two. The largest decreases were registered in Hungary (10.2% to 7.8% between July 2013 and July 2014), Portugal (16.1% to 14.0%), Spain (26.1% to 24.4%) and Croatia (18.2% to 16.5%), and the highest increases were registered in Finland (8.1% to 8.6%) and France (10.2% to 10.5%). And here\u2019s how the ONS sums up the situation: The latest figures for Q2 2014 show the UK recovery continuing. With GDP in real terms growing by 0.9% compared with the previous quarter, and by 3.2% between Q2 2013 and Q2 2014, the strongest quarter on same quarter a year ago growth since before the economic downturn. GDP is now 2.7% above the pre-economic downturn level and there have been encouraging signs across the three approaches to measuring GDP. From the output approach, growth in services continues to strengthen with output now 6.4% above its pre-downturn peak, while production and construction output continues to grow. The expenditure measure shows continued growth in gross fixed capital formation and the largest component, household final consumption expenditure. The income measure shows strong growth in gross operating surplus of corporations for the fourth consecutive quarter, rising by 3.2% in Q2 2014. You can see the ONS\u2019s full report on the UK economy here. More reaction is coming in. Here\u2019s Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon: As this chart shows, the \u2018great recession\u2019 of 2009 was still the biggest plunge in output in decades, even after today\u2019s data revisions. And the recovery has still been slower than after the 1970s and 80s recessions. As this chart shows, Britain\u2019s recovery stalled in 2011 and 2012 -- a combination of the government\u2019s austerity cutbacks and the impact of the eurozone crisis: Sky News\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway flags up that Britain\u2019s recovery now looks less dire than its international rivals. Britain\u2019s GDP is now 2.7% higher than the pre-economic downturn peak of Q1 2008, the ONS now reckons. These changes are being made to bring the UK into line with international standards. Perhaps the biggest news this morning is that Britain\u2019s Great Recession was not quite as deep as previously thought. The ONS now believes that the UK recovered all the output lost after 2008 in the third quarter of last year, rather than in this spring as initially thought. The ONS has also revised down its estimate for growth in the first three months of 2014, from +0.8% to +0.7%. BREAKING NEWS: The UK economy grew even faster than expected in the second quarter of this year. The Office for National Statistics has just revised up its estimate for GDP growth in the April-June quarter to +0.9%, from 0.8% previously. The ONS reported that output in Britain\u2019s services industry rose by 1.1% in the second quarter, the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2011. Construction was revised up sharply to show 0.7 %, compared with a previous estimate of no growth. It suggests the recovery was even stronger than expected this spring, and means the UK was 3.2% higher than a year ago. The ONS also confirmed that the UK economy has exceeded its pre-crisis peak, and earlier than previously thought, as it revises a swath of historic GDP data. Lots more details and reaction to follow.... Nearly time for the updated UK GDP data... Back in the UK, pre-tax profits at payday firm Wonga have slumped by 53%. And net profits have halved, as Wonga is hit by rising operating costs and a new tougher environment. fastFT has more details: Wonga\u2019s loan book rose by 8 per cent to \u00a31.3bn at the end of 2013, while its default rate nudged down from 7.4 per cent in 2012 to 7 per cent last year. However, operating costs - including investments in debt collection and fines - climbed by 56 per cent to \u00a3133.7m, even as revenues only inched up to \u00a3314.7m, crimping profits severely. More on this shortly.... Here\u2019s AFP\u2019s take on the rise in German (seasonally adjusted) unemployment this month: Unemployment in Germany stagnated in September, as clouds continue to build over Europe\u2019s biggest economy, official data showed on Tuesday. The unemployment rate stood at 6.7% in seasonally adjusted terms in September, unchanged from August. But the number of people registered as unemployed increased by 12,000, the Federal Labour Office said in a statement. That took analysts by surprise. They had projected a decline of around 2,000. \u201cThe German economy contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter. Weak exports and investment could not be offset by stable consumption, which means that the continual growth seen in the preceding four quarters was halted,\u201d the labour office said in a statement. \u201cExternal economic uncertainty is having an increasing effect, notably the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine,\u201d the office continued. \u201cThe signs for the third quarter are also very subdued. On the labour market, however, demand remains solid,\u201d it said. In raw or unadjusted terms, the German jobless total fell by 94,000 to 2.808 million and the unadjusted jobless rate slipped to 6.5% from 6.7%, the office calculated. Italy\u2019s youth unemployment total has hit a fresh record high, according to data just released by ISTAT. ISTAT reported that Italy\u2019s youth jobless rate (covering 16-24 year olds) jumped to 44.2 in August, from 43.2 in July. But there is a glimmer of optimism too; the wider jobless rate has fallen, to 12.3% from 12.6% last month. Such high unemployment rates underline the worrying state of Italy\u2019s economy as it slides back into recession. Last night, prime minister Matteo Renzi won a vote on reforming Italy\u2019s labour market. Those changes include making it easier for big firms to fire staff -- the argument being that this will encourage companies to hire workers. Unions, though, warn that the measure will simply bring more pain to low paid workers who have already suffered from Italy\u2019s persistent growth problems. Renzi is also aiming to move other workers off precarious short-term contracts and onto permanent roles. Here we go, the first slice of eurozone jobless data, from Germany. And the headline news is that the number of people out of work in Germany jumped by 13,000 in September, to 2.918m. Economists had expected a 2,000 drop. That still leaves the seasonally adjusted rate unchanged at 6.7%. But on an unadjusted basis, the jobless total fell to 2.808m, from 2.902. Next up, Italy... UK house prices fall for first time in 17 months, says Nationwide The regional house price data from Nationwide is quite fascinating, although also depressing if you\u2019re trying to get on the housing ladder. Nationwide also reported that St Albans in Hertfordshire saw the biggest hike in house prices, up 24% over the last year to reach an average of \u00a3479,497. London, Cambridge and Belfast all recording annual increases of 21%. The average house price in Cambridge is \u00a3423,904, while in Belfast it is \u00a3188,240. And within London, it said Camden has seen values typically surge by a \u201cremarkable\u201d 42% annually to reach \u00a3884,103. Several London boroughs, including Lewisham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest, which have all recorded a 30% increase in prices. Lambeth has recorded 33% annual price growth, while in Haringey properties are up 31% since September 2013. Back on the surprise 0.2% drop in UK house prices in September (details start here). This Nationwide chart, which compares average prices over the last quarter compared to the previous three months, suggests a clear slowdown over the summer: While UK retailers worry about the weather, their counterparts in Germany can cheer a strong summer\u2019s trading. Retail sales jumped 2.5% in August compared with July; a post-World Cup boost, perhaps? Retail analyst Nick Bubb says Next\u2019s warning that the warm weather could hit its profits could spook investors: Next are probably being unnecessarily cautious, ahead of investor meetings this week, but the market is unlikely to take any chances.... High street retailer Next has sent a shiver through the retail sector this morning, warning that the recent warm weather has hit demand for clothes. In an unexpected statement to the City, Next warned that demand this month have been lower than expected, as Britain enjoyed one of the warmest and driest Septembers on record. Next did report that it had benefitted from the cooler August, which sent shoppers racing to the high street to update their wardrobes with warmer items. But if the current warm weather continues throughout October it could be forced to reduce annual profit guidance. Next said: Cooler weather in August resulted in several very strong weeks. However, warmer weather in the more important month of September has had the reverse effect. The overall effect is that Quarter Three sales to date are up 6%, which is lower than our previous forecast of +10%. That warning sent Next\u2019s shares sliding by 3.7% in early trading, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Rival Marks &amp; Spencer is also feeling the effects, down 3.5%. Royal Bank of Scotland has given its investors some good news this morning, reporting that its bad loan impairments are much less than expected. RBS, still majority owned by the UK taxpayer, reported a \u201ccontinued improvement in economic conditions and asset prices in our key markets, including Ireland\u201d. And its share have jumped 4% at the start of trading. One last chart, showing how houses are much less affordable than 20 years ago; the situation was even worse before the financial crisis struck, though: Nationwide also warned that the UK housing market\u2019s prospects remain unclear, after this month\u2019s 0.2% drop in prices. Here\u2019s chief economist Robert Gardner again: Price growth may soften further in the final quarter of the year, given the high base for comparison from Q4 2013. However, the outlook remains uncertain. There have been tentative signs from surveyors and estate agents that buyer demand may be starting to moderate, but the low level of interest rates and strong labour market suggest that underlying demand is likely to remain robust.\u201d Nationwide, the building society, has reported that UK house prices have fallen for the first time in 17 months, in the latest sign that the market is cooling. It reports that average house prices fell by 0.2% month-on-month in September, which drags back the annual growth to 9.4%; an eight-month low. The average house price, according to Nationwide, is now \u00a3188,374, down from \u00a3189,306 in August. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said that the market remains relatively strong, but with \u201csignificant regional variation\u201d. The South of England is still seeing the strongest rates of growth. \u201cAnnual house price growth in London slowed somewhat, from 25.8% in Q2 to 21% in Q3. Nevertheless, at \u00a3401,072, average prices in the capital reached a record high, 31% above their 2007 peak. In the UK as whole, prices are around 2% above their pre-crisis peak (excluding London they are less than 1% above their 2007 peak). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. We\u2019ll have a close eye on the eurozone economy today, with the release of the latest inflation reading for September and also August\u2019s unemployment data, both at 10am BST. Economists predict that inflation across the euro region have slipped to 0.3%, a new five year low, which would tee up Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting. And we\u2019re not expecting much improvement in Europe\u2019s jobs crisis. The forecasts are that the headline unemployment rate will be unchanged at 11.5%, with Germany just 6.7% and Italy as high as 12.6%. In the UK, we\u2019ll get the third estimate of GDP for the last quarter, at 9.30am. It is likely to confirm that the economy grew by 0.8%. That will include a breakdown of expenditure in Q2 GDP, probably showing the economic recovery remained domestically-driven, with business investment continuing to rise. The data will also show the full effects of the revisions taking place to bring the UK\u2019s national accounts in line with the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010) methodology. (effectively including the impact of the underground economy; sex workers, drugs et al). And in the eurozone, Greece\u2019s lenders are returning to Athens for another series of talks over its bailout programme. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

David Kern, Chief Economist at the British Chambers of Commerce said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall these figures are positive \u2013 they show an upward revision in quarterly growth in the second quarter and growth in business investment. The current level of GDP is considerably higher than its pre-recession level, which mirrors our view that earlier official estimates have understated growth in recent years. However, there are concerning features in the latest figures - the volume of exports has fallen slightly and the current account deficit has widened to above 5% of GDP, a level which in the long- term will prove to be unsustainable.</p> <p>While the strength of the recovery will support business confidence, these figures reinforce the need to rebalance the economy towards exports and investment. It is important that the [Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee] and the government make every effort to sustain the recovery. Interest rates must be kept low until there is a clear need to start increasing them, and government must do more to support exporters and improve access to finance for growing businesses.</p> </blockquote> <p>Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, while sizeable, the adjustments to measured GDP do not significantly change the story of a deep recession followed by a protracted recovery. And since key indicators of the amount of spare capacity in the economy such as inflation, wages and unemployment are not being revised, there seems little reason for the OBR or the Bank of England to change their view on this. So the implications of the revised national accounts for economic policy should be limited.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All in all, the data paint a far brighter picture of the UK\u2019s economic recovery than previously thought, but the revisions will probably do little to change the official economic outlook at the Bank of England. The Bank had already pencilled-in faster growth in the second quarter, and also uses the business surveys to \u2018back-cast\u2019 GDP over recent years, so the upward revisions to the official data were already baked into the policy cake to a large degree.</p> <p>However, while the Bank\u2019s official outlook is likely to be little changed following these revisions, it\u2019s hard to see that the brighter picture will not add strength to the voices and conviction of those members of the Monetary Policy Committee who have already voted to hike interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the TUC focused on the signs of falling household incomes. General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the size of the economy has been revised up, household incomes have been revised down. It turns out the UK\u2019s living standards crisis is even worse than we thought.</p> <p>This is set to be the first full Parliament since the Second World War when the government leaves office with people\u2019s pay packets worth less than when they came into power.</p> <p>There is something deeply wrong when the economy is growing, but the people who do all the work face ever shrinking pay and falling living standards.</p> <p>We need an economy where everyone gets a fair share of growing prosperity instead of just a few at the top, with growth driven by rising wages rather than growing household debts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-09-30T14:16:57.550Z\">at 3.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-542a8717e4b0700b651fec89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-30T10:37:50.649Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today\u2019s downbeat eurozone data means ECB president Mario Draghi might soon have to bite the bullet and authorise fully blown quantitative easing,</strong> something that Germany for one is not keen on.</p> <p>That is the view of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, whose economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s news of a further fall in inflation set an urgent ground for the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) announcement on Thursday detailing its plan to buy asset-backed securities.</p> <p>Cebr is cautious about whether such a programme will be enough to steer the Eurozone ship towards a sustainable recovery.

With the subsequent share price fall, analysts at Credit Suisse believe the shares now look good value. They moved their rating on ABF from neutral to outperform, with a \u00a330 target price, saying:</p> <blockquote> Historically, Primark has been the key to the share price, but less so the earnings as sugar profits fell over 3 years from over \u00a3500m to under \u00a3100m. But sugar is now under 10% of the earnings with profits we believe at their trough; Primark is over 60% of profits and now the key to earnings as well. <br> Indeed, 2015/16 is lining up to be a year of significant earnings per share growth as Primark openings accelerate as the group enters the US, ingredients continue their recovery and sugar profits also improve smartly as the lower beet price feeds into earnings. We have 15% earnings per share growth.  The fall in the share price has taken the implied Primark multiple from over 30 times to 24 times today (based on 2015/16 estimates). As emerging markets continue to slow, so growth stories in the developed world take centre stage, and it is hard to find a better structural growth story than Primark, in our view. </blockquote> <p>ABF ended 116p higher at \u00a326.79, the biggest riser in the leading index.</p> <p>Overall, though, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> was on the slide again, down 23.88 points at 6622.72. Investors were cautious ahead of this week's European Central Bank meeting and US non-farm payroll figures. Geopolitical tensions played a part, of course, with the continuing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, worries about the repercussions of air strikes on Isis, and the sanctions on Russia over Ukraine.

      "bodyText": "Despite another downbeat day on the UK stock market, Associated British Foods, owner of Primark and British Sugar, managed to recover some of its recent losses. The company warned earlier this month that falling sugar prices would hit the division's profits, albeit offset by continued growth at Primark. With the subsequent share price fall, analysts at Credit Suisse believe the shares now look good value. They moved their rating on ABF from neutral to outperform, with a \u00a330 target price, saying: Historically, Primark has been the key to the share price, but less so the earnings as sugar profits fell over 3 years from over \u00a3500m to under \u00a3100m. But sugar is now under 10% of the earnings with profits we believe at their trough; Primark is over 60% of profits and now the key to earnings as well. Indeed, 2015/16 is lining up to be a year of significant earnings per share growth as Primark openings accelerate as the group enters the US, ingredients continue their recovery and sugar profits also improve smartly as the lower beet price feeds into earnings. We have 15% earnings per share growth. The fall in the share price has taken the implied Primark multiple from over 30 times to 24 times today (based on 2015/16 estimates). As emerging markets continue to slow, so growth stories in the developed world take centre stage, and it is hard to find a better structural growth story than Primark, in our view. ABF ended 116p higher at \u00a326.79, the biggest riser in the leading index. Overall, though, the FTSE 100 was on the slide again, down 23.88 points at 6622.72. Investors were cautious ahead of this week's European Central Bank meeting and US non-farm payroll figures. Geopolitical tensions played a part, of course, with the continuing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, worries about the repercussions of air strikes on Isis, and the sanctions on Russia over Ukraine. There was even a report, later denied, of possible capital controls by Russia's central bank, which weakened the rouble further. There were renewed concerns about the US economy, with consumer confidence falling unexpectedly in September. Earlier came a disappointing Chinese purchasing managers index, down from a prelimary estimate for September of 50.5 to 50.2. Retailers came under pressure after Next warned it might have to reduce its profit forecast if the current warm weather continued. The news sent its shares down 260p to \u00a366.05 while rival Marks &amp; Spencer fell 10.8p to 404.6p. Housebuilders slipped back after Nationwide said UK house prices fell by 0.2% in September, with Persimmon down 9p at \u00a313.34. And chip maker Arm fell 18.5p to 906p after analysts at Bernstein cut their rating from market perform to underperform. On the positive side Royal Bank of Scotland rose 6.8p to 368.2p after it said \u00a3800m of provisions would be released as economic conditions had improved. Testing equipment specialist Intertek added 54p to \u00a326.21 as it appointed Andre Lacroix from Inchcape as its new chief executive to replace the retiring Wolfhart Hauser. Among the mid-caps Melrose rose 10.3p to 247.7p after the industrial group announced the purchase of US heating component specialist Eclipse for $158m in cash. But Al Noor Hospitals lost 71p to \u00a310.18 after the UAE healthcare group's founder Kassem Alom arranged to sell 5m shares at \u00a310 to \u00a310.50 each. Interdealer broker Icap dropped 8.4p to 387.3p as it warned first half revenue would be around 10% lower than a year ago after poor trading volumes. Lower down the market, Finnish paper and packaging group Powerflute put on 29% to 47p after its agreed to pay \u20ac81m to buy coreboard maker Corenso from Stora Enso Oyj. But green technology company TEG slumped 50% to 2.4p after it made a half year operating loss of \u00a31.17m and said it needed to raise new funds to secure its future. Chairman Leo McKenna said: The group remains at risk unless secure additional financing is achieved, but on the basis such funding can be secured, the board is confident [it] has a positive future.

The Office for National Statistics published sweeping updates to its previous estimates on the economy on Tuesday that suggested Britain recovered from the recession three-quarters sooner than initial estimates. Its move to new ways of measuring GDP put the size of the economy at 2.7% above its pre-crisis peak in 2008, compared with the previous estimate of 0.2%. But the TUC said the figures also revealed that the toll taken by years of falling real wages was greater than previously thought, as estimates of household disposable income were revised to show it further off its previous peak. For 2013, real household disposable income per capita, described by the TUC as \u201cthe most comprehensive measure of living standards\u201d, was 2.6% below its peak according to the latest data. It was \u00a316,881 in 2013 down from a peak of \u00a317,324 in 2007. On the previous figures, the measure had been 1.8% off the peak, standing at \u00a315,764 in 2013 down from a peak of \u00a316,060 hit in 2009. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cWhile the size of the economy has been revised up, household incomes have been revised down.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A decline in infrastructure spending over the last 30 years needs to be reversed to boost growth, according to the International Monetary Fund, which meets next week in Washington against a backdrop of slowing global growth. The IMF said the benefits of debt-financed infrastructure projects could give an important boost to economic growth especially when the world is threatened by a long period of stagnation. In documents released before its revised economic outlook, it urged governments to examine where infrastructure investments could benefit longer-term growth. It said: \u201cDebt-financed projects could have large output effects without increasing the debt-to-GDP ratio, if clearly identified needs are met through efficient investment. In other words, public infrastructure investment could pay for itself if done correctly.\u201d The report singles out the US and Germany as in need of large-scale infrastructure investment following a stream of critical reports from the business community over the upkeep of road and rail networks. It says the US needs to act to arrest the decline in its network of roads. \u201cAs the American Society of Civil Engineers notes, 32% of major roads in the US are now in poor or mediocre condition, and the US Federal Highway Administration estimates that between $124bn [\u00a376bn] and $146bn annually in capital investment will be needed for substantial improvement in conditions and performance \u2013 considerably more than the $100bn spent on capital improvements at all government levels,\u201d it said. George Osborne is likely to take some comfort from the analysis, which brackets the UK with Canada, Italy, France and Japan as having an improving level of infrastructure, \u201calbeit from relatively low levels\u201d. The IMF, which acts as lender of last resort to struggling countries, has been a keen supporter of infrastructure investment since the financial crash as a way to boost employment and increase productivity. Better roads and rail, digital infrastructure and power networks support local businesses and help them increase output at lower costs. However, in its most recent study it is more circumspect with its recommendation, cautioning governments to make an assessment of how good they are at implementing large-scale projects. It warns that many infrastructure projects can be bedevilled by a lack of competence and duplication of effort that leads to cost overruns. A debate over the relative merits of private versus public investment is made difficult in developing countries by a lack of reliable information, but it is clear that in developed countries public investment can provide much-needed infrastructure projects alongside the private sector, it says. Even the massive public spending by Japan in the 1990s to counter the recession of the late 1980s, which has been much derided in rightwing circles, is defended in the report, which says it made a positive contribution to GDP growth and provided a platform for investment and productivity gains. The report spares Germany the embarrassment of highlighting some of its recent failures, though it could have pointed to the much delayed and still not completed Berlin international airport and the threat of an energy crisis in the next decade when a generation of nuclear power stations are due to be switched off. In a separate report, the IMF highlights how the large imbalances in the world economy have reduced in the five years since the financial crash, but have left the world economy vulnerable to further shocks and trapped some countries into a period of low growth. It welcomes the halving of the US deficit with China and the halving of the surpluses racked up each year by China and Japan from trade and investments abroad. It says these welcome developments could be reversed in the next few years because many countries have reduced their reliance on imports by depressing internal domestic consumption. Spain, Greece and many European countries have reduced their balance of payments deficits following a sharp cut in demand. A recovery in the domestic consumption of foreign goods and services could generate a rise in imbalances again unless those countries affected change their behaviour. The report also points out that imbalances have shrunk, but not reversed, leaving some countries that grew quickly following a large inflow of funds to suffer even bigger deficits.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy was bigger and grew faster than previously thought over the second quarter, according to official figures that measure GDP in a new way. The economy also recovered sooner than previously thought from the recession. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy expanded 0.9% over April to June as both the dominant services sector and construction enjoyed strong growth. That beat economists\u2019 forecasts for GDP growth to hold at a previous estimate of 0.8%. But at the same time the ONS revised down the first quarter figure to 0.7% from 0.8%, leaving the estimate of year-on-year growth at 3.2%. The size of the economy was also upgraded as the ONS moved to a new European-wide way of measuring GDP and incorporated other changes. Under the new method, illegal activities such as drug dealing and prostitution are included and other activities are accounted for differently, including research &amp; development and military spending. Explaining the figures, the ONS said: \u201cThe new data are based on the most far-reaching set of improvements to the national accounts in the last 15 years or so.\u201d The ONS left full-year GDP growth in 2013 unrevised at 1.7%. But it said the changes meant that UK GDP recouped lost ground from the downturn sooner than previously thought. \u201cThe new data show that during the recent downturn the economy shrank by 6.0%, rather than the 7.2% previously estimated. GDP was also estimated to have exceeded its pre-financial crisis levels in Q3 2013, three quarters sooner than previously estimated. However, overall, the average absolute quarter-on-quarter revision between 1997 and 2014 Q2 was 0.16 percentage points,\u201d statisticians wrote alongside the data. Economists said the new estimates suggested there was less slack in the economy than previously thought and that could have implications for how soon the Bank of England starts to raise interest rates as it seeks to contain price pressures. James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets said: \u201cThe substantial revisions due to new methodology mean that the UK economy is now 2.7% larger than it was before the global financial crisis started. Under the old methodology the data had shown that the UK was only 0.2% larger, which implies that there is now less spare capacity in the UK economy than previously thought. \u201cTaken on its own this could suggest that the UK may need to raise rates earlier and more aggressively than previously expected, but in the absence of inflation and wage pressures and with signs that the housing market is cooling we doubt that the Bank of England will move imminently. We still favour a February hike.\u201d Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the UK\u2019s performance was still \u201cvery weak by historical and international standards\u201d. \u201cIt remains the case that it took longer than after any of the recessions in the 20th century for output to return to its peak,\u201d he said. For the second quarter, the ONS said growth was \u201cbroad-based\u201d in output terms with production, construction and services all expanding from the first quarter. Agriculture, forestry and fishing contracted slightly quarter on quarter. Growth in the service sector, which ranges from hotels to banking, was revised up to 1.1% from 1.0% and was the strongest growth for two and a half years. Against the backdrop of a buoyant housing market, the construction sector grew 0.7% rather than not at all, as previously estimated. But at less than 7% of the economy it has little impact on overall GDP. In news likely to be welcomed by the government as it tries to move to an economy less reliant on consumer spending, the ONS said business investment growth accelerated in the second quarter. It increased by 3.3% on the quarter, compared with 0.9% growth in the first quarter. Household spending rose 0.6%, compared with 0.7% in the first quarter. The savings ratio, an estimate of how much households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income, rose to 6.7% but the general trend has been downwards over recent years as workers\u2019 wages fall in real terms. Less encouragingly for the government, exports fell 0.4% from the first quarter and were down 5.2% year-on-year. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, saw little improvement on the horizon for trade. \u201cNet trade will likely find it difficult to make any significant positive contribution to UK growth in the near term at least. The combination of weak eurozone economic activity and a strong pound is hampering the prospects for UK exports to develop decent growth and help overall economic expansion to become more balanced,\u201d he said. Overall, he forecasts growth will have slowed in the third quarter of July to September. \u201cThe latest economic news remains largely strong, although it has been a little more mixed recently. It looks likely that consumer spending growth slowed to some extent in the third quarter, while the manufacturing sector clearly lost momentum,\u201d Archer added.",

A spokesman said no executives would be made available for comment on Tuesday. The company, which has come under sustained attack for charging interest rates as high as 5,853% a year, lent \u00a31.3bn to 4.6m people last year, an increase of 8% on 2012. Revenue was up 2% to \u00a3314.7m. The loan default rate was 7%, down from 7.4% in 2012. This summer, Wonga brought in the respected City veteran Andy Haste to shore up the company\u2019s reputation following a series of scandals. \u201cWonga has understandably faced criticism and we know we need to repair our reputation and regain our right to be an accepted part of the financial service sector,\u201d Haste said when he took on the \u00a3500,000-a-year job in July.
