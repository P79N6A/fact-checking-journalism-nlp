      "bodyText": "Theresa May has vowed to reform capitalism in the wake of last week\u2019s damning report by MPs into the collapse of BHS. As a parliamentary committee described the failure of BHS as the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d, the new prime minister reiterated her pledge to tackle corporate irresponsibility by promising to \u201creform capitalism so that it works for everyone, not just the privileged few\u201d. We asked experts what May could do to pull off a genuine revamp. Put workers on boards One idea that May has raised herself is for consumers and workers to be represented on company boards. After years of pushing for the UK to follow many of its European neighbours on this, the TUC has welcomed the proposal. Kate Bell, head of economic and social affairs, says employee representatives can provide a restraining voice on pay in the boardroom. She adds: \u201cWorkers can bring other values to the board, such as understanding what\u2019s going on on the shop floor [and] how technology changes are working out ... but they should also have an influence on pay and conditions.\u201d But May should expect to encounter resistance from business groups wary of sweeping regulations that make life more complicated for those already playing by the rules. Adam Marshall, acting director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says businesses are fed up with the focus on bad examples like BHS. \u201cThe government should focus on what\u2019s going right in such a large number of smaller and medium-sized companies. \u201cWhen government starts to address these things by regulating it becomes the thin end of the wedge and it can hamstring great businesses.\u201d Publish pay ratios Another May idea that has been broadly welcomed is making shareholder votes on corporate pay not just advisory but binding. She also wants companies to publish the ratio between the chief executive\u2019s pay and the average company worker\u2019s pay. The proposals have won the approval of the High Pay Centre. The thinktank\u2019s director, Stefan Stern, wants May to live up to her words. \u201cLet\u2019s not hang about, let\u2019s have compulsory pay-ratio publication,\u201d he says. With people talking about \u201cemployer brand\u201d there are advantages for companies in this transparency, believes Stern. \u201cYou can position yourself as a business as being more of a John Lewis or Co-op,\u201d he says. Force businesses to look beyond shareholder value While some campaigners for corporate governance reform welcome the proposals on pay and worker representation, others warn such changes will not tackle the root problems of a capitalism that appears to work for the few only. Calls are growing for a shift in focus so business is operated for all stakeholders, not just for shareholders \u2013 in other words, putting the interests of employees, communities and the environment alongside the interests of shareholders. James Perry, co-founder of the B Corps movement in the UK, which backs the idea, explains: \u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to make rules on executive pay and board representation if the board continues to believe it\u2019s there to maximise shareholder value. \u201cWe want to see shared and durable prosperity for all and we believe there is a better alternative for capitalism. What Theresa May can do is make that better alternative clear to people. Fiduciary duty needn\u2019t be about maximising shareholder value; it can be about maximising shared value.\u201d Introduce tougher standards for company directors The BHS collapse has highlighted the need for higher-calibre directors on boards to scrutinise decisions and speak out when necessary. The Institute of Directors, a lobby group for business leaders, responded last week to May\u2019s calls with a \u201cblueprint for good business leadership\u201d. It set out expectations on directors at companies of all sizes, including listed and unlisted firms, and not-for-profit organisations. The lobby group\u2019s demands on directors include knowledge of finance but equally an ability to encourage diverse views. It also recommends directors get regular training. Tackle living costs and economic insecurity If May really wants to see the benefits of capitalism shared more equitably, her government must raise housing supply and cut the cost of renting or buying a home, says Torsten Bell, director of the thinktank Resolution Foundation. \u201cThere is nothing you could do on pay that could have as big an effect on people\u2019s finances than sorting out the housing situation.\u201d Shoring up economic security is also key in an age of zero-hours contracts and when many people are working fewer hours than they wish or going self-employed out of necessity, say anti-poverty campaigners. Katie Schmuecker, head of policy at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, comments: \u201cHalf the people that are experiencing poverty are in working households. People want stability. \u201cWe need to look at the way in which pay, in-work benefits, taxation, the cost of housing and the cost of childcare work together.\u201d",
