Rich Russians and wealthy Cypriots knew the crisis was coming and have had the best part of a fortnight to spirit their money out of the country since it broke, even assuming they did not do so beforehand. The restrictions will intensify the slump Cyprus faces while not removing the risk of bank runs when branches finally open for businesson Thursday. What's more, the controls severely damage the credibility of the euro. That's not to say the controls are unnecessary. Even with the severe restrictions announced in place, there is a possibility of bank runs. Without them, bank runs would be a certainty. Modern banking is essentially based on a sleight of hand under which banks have readily available funds that are only a fraction of their total deposits. If all the customers demand their money at once, as would be the case in Cyprus without controls, the banks go under. The government in Nicosia insists capital controls will be removed within a week, but that looks as heroic an assumption as the idea that the economy will shrink by just 3.5% this year, the current EU forecast. Iceland introduced capital controls in 2008 and still has them in place. There will no doubt be pressure from Brussels on Cyprus to lift the controls as quickly as possible, but most analysts expect them to be in place for a minimum of six months. As far as the real economy is concerned, Latvia \u2013 which had pegged its currency to the euro \u2013 suffered an 18% contraction of its economy following a banking collapse. And bank deposits were just 100% of GDP in Latvia; in Cyprus they were 800% of GDP before the crisis. To sum up, Cyprus is going to have a collapsing economy buttressed by capital controls, but unlike Iceland will not have the option of devaluation to make itself more competitive. Speculation that it will become the first country to leave the euro will not go away. Indeed, it will intensify the longer the capital controls are in place. There are, of course, wider implications for Europe despite attempts over the last week to say that Cyprus is a special case. When the euro was created just over a decade ago it was supposed to embody certain principles. One of those principles was that a euro would be a euro anywhere inside the single currency zone. That has now been violated; a euro in Nicosia is not worth the same as a euro in Berlin. A second trait of the single currency was that it was supposed to be a secure store of wealth. International investors would have confidence in it and it would rival the dollar as a global reserve currency. That idea has also taken a pasting as a result of the disastrous handling of Cyprus; the decision to make deposit holders pay a share of the bailout has been accompanied by a fall in the value of the euro against the dollar. That's hardly surprising; savings in US banks are perceived as rock solid whereas those in eurozone banks are not. A third core belief was that the euro would lead to economic convergence, with the weaker and poorer countries raising their performance to the level of the rich nations at the monetary union's core. This has looked increasingly absurd against a backdrop of bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, and the chronic lack of competitiveness displayed by Italy, Spain and \u2013 more recently \u2013 France. So Cyprus has put two myths to bed. One is the myth of convergence; the other is that the debt crisis is over. A new chapter has opened, that's all.",

      "bodyText": "Energy bosses at Centrica, owners of British Gas, have come under fire for sharing out a \u00a316.4m pay pot in 2012, after consumers' energy bills jumped during a bitterly cold winter. Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw earned a basic salary of \u00a3950,000 in 2012, but bonuses pushed his take-home pay to almost \u00a35m. Phil Bentley, managing director of British Gas, who is stepping down later this year, pocketed \u00a33.1 million in total pay and bonuses in 2012, while fellow executives Mark Hanafin, Nick Luff and Chris Weston, shared \u00a38.5m between them, the company reported, after a cold snap when British Gas consumer gas prices jumped 6%. The storm over Centrica's pay \u2013 a 6% rise on last year between the five executives \u2013 comes as local authority pension funds seek to curb lavish rewards among bosses at the UK's largest 350 companies. The Centrica pay bonanza was condemned by Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary. \"British Gas customers will be astonished at these bumper payouts. When hard-pressed families have seen their bills go up by \u00a3100 this winter there are serious questions to answer about how they can justify paying millions to their executives,\" she said. Deborah Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: \"When people are struggling to pay their fuel bills they might wonder why Sam Laidlaw is taking home \u00a35m. Many people wonder why their bills go up so quickly when wholesale prices rise, but do not fall when the market prices go in the other direction.\" Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary said: \"At a time when the poorest households are struggling to make ends meet and are spending over a quarter of their incomes on fuel bills, these huge payouts are insensitive beyond belief. We keep being told that bills have to rise to pay for investment in our future energy supply. However, these figures suggest that the price rises are in fact being used to fund exorbitant pay hikes.\" Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said: \"Customers have every right to be totally outraged at the greed of these directors and their obscene bonuses.\" But a Centrica spokesman defended the rewards as \"squarely on performance\". \"In 2012, we delivered another year of consistent earnings growth and invested \u00a32.7bn to secure energy supplies for our customers, as we continued to improve service levels both in the UK and North America,\" he said. The payouts could anger investors one year after the so-called 'shareholder spring' triggered a wave of boardroom resignations amid fury over high pay. Hargreaves said: \"It is about time shareholders started holding companies to account over pay and the closed shop that runs our top businesses.\"",

      "body": "<p>Merlin Entertainments, the owner of Madame Tussauds, Legoland and Alton Towers, is hoping to take a ride on a stock market flotation after revenues topped \u00a31bn last year.</p> <p>Analysts said the company could list with a valuation of up to \u00a33.5bn, three years after it walked away from a planned \u00a3bn initial public offering (IPO).</p> <p>Expansion in the US and Asia helped offset tougher times in Europe last year \u2013 where it was hit by miserable weather and competition from the London Olympics \u2013 lifting revenues by 15% to \u00a31.07bn in the year to December. Operating profits rose 16.5% to \u00a3258m as visitor numbers to the group's 94 international theme parks and attractions rose 16% to 54m.</p> <p>Nick Varney, the chief executive, said: \"We are currently giving active consideration to potential options for an IPO which preferably, but not definitely, would be in the UK.\"</p> <p>He said Merlin, which pulled plans for a public listing in 2010, was talking to potential investors and weighing up whether to list in London or the US some time in this year or next. \"We are well invested with a strong brand, world-class quality product and the City is familiar with us as a company,\" he said.</p> <p>Analysts agreed that Merlin would be an attractive proposition for investors, if priced correctly. They said they would like the level of debt, which is about 3.5 times underlying earnings, to come down slightly but that would not stand in the way of a successful flotation. Merlin ended 2012 with \u00a31.27bn of debt, broadly the same as a year before, after spending \u00a392m on improving its existing sites and \u00a371m on new businesses.</p> <p>\"IPO markets are open again in the UK and Merlin is a very good business that has been well run. Despite the recession, people continue to spend money on leisure and Merlin has some great assets that it would be difficult to replicate,\" said Nick Batram, an analyst at Peel Hunt.</p> <p>Visitor numbers at Merlin's UK attractions were flat last year as the weather hit outdoor parks such as Alton Towers but benefited indoor attractions such as the London Dungeon.

      "bodyText": "Merlin Entertainments, the owner of Madame Tussauds, Legoland and Alton Towers, is hoping to take a ride on a stock market flotation after revenues topped \u00a31bn last year. Analysts said the company could list with a valuation of up to \u00a33.5bn, three years after it walked away from a planned \u00a3bn initial public offering (IPO). Expansion in the US and Asia helped offset tougher times in Europe last year \u2013 where it was hit by miserable weather and competition from the London Olympics \u2013 lifting revenues by 15% to \u00a31.07bn in the year to December. Operating profits rose 16.5% to \u00a3258m as visitor numbers to the group's 94 international theme parks and attractions rose 16% to 54m. Nick Varney, the chief executive, said: \"We are currently giving active consideration to potential options for an IPO which preferably, but not definitely, would be in the UK.\" He said Merlin, which pulled plans for a public listing in 2010, was talking to potential investors and weighing up whether to list in London or the US some time in this year or next. \"We are well invested with a strong brand, world-class quality product and the City is familiar with us as a company,\" he said. Analysts agreed that Merlin would be an attractive proposition for investors, if priced correctly. They said they would like the level of debt, which is about 3.5 times underlying earnings, to come down slightly but that would not stand in the way of a successful flotation. Merlin ended 2012 with \u00a31.27bn of debt, broadly the same as a year before, after spending \u00a392m on improving its existing sites and \u00a371m on new businesses. \"IPO markets are open again in the UK and Merlin is a very good business that has been well run. Despite the recession, people continue to spend money on leisure and Merlin has some great assets that it would be difficult to replicate,\" said Nick Batram, an analyst at Peel Hunt. Visitor numbers at Merlin's UK attractions were flat last year as the weather hit outdoor parks such as Alton Towers but benefited indoor attractions such as the London Dungeon. Legoland Windsor, boasting a new themed hotel, was one of the few outdoor parks to see a rise. The group's top performers were overseas ventures such as its Madame Tussauds attractions in Asia and Legoland in California. A fifth of turnover now comes from North America and 14% from Asia and the Pacific region, which accounted for just 2% of sales two years ago. Varney said he expected a bounce back in the UK this year as there would be no competition from the Olympics, which drew 10m visitors away from alternative days out. Elsewhere, Merlin is opening Legoland Discovery Centres in Canada, Germany and Westchester, New York; a new Madame Tussauds in Tokyo; a Dungeon in Berlin and a Sea Life Centre in Manchester. It will also open a 250-bedroom Legoland hotel at its California park, as it continues its strategy of adding themed accommodation at its parks. The scariest new ride will be The Smiler at Alton Towers, which is still under construction. \"It's the first ride I've looked at and wondered if I could go on it,\" said Varney. \"It's a spaghetti of twists and turns and loops and we've been adding psychological tricks that make you feel like you've been hypnotised.\" Merlin worldwide: Numbers of attractions \u2022 44 Sea Life centres, including the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and Germany \u2022 14 Madame Tussauds, including Bangkok, Shanghai and Las Vegas \u2022 10 Legoland discovery centres, including Manchester, Tokyo and Chicago \u2022 8 Dungeons, including The London Dungeon and Hamburg Dungeon \u2022 6 Legoland parks, including Windsor and California \u2022 5 theme parks, including Alton Towers and Chessington World of Adventures \u2022 It also owns two ski resorts, The London Eye, Blackpool Tower \u2022 Tree Top adventure parks based in Australia and Warwick Castle",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, a central bank official has announced tonight that capital controls will be imposed, but initially for just four days. Reuters has the story: Cyprus will limit the use of cheques to businesses, cap cash withdrawals to 300 euros per day and scrutinise all commercial transactions over 5,000 euros when banks reopen on Thursday, a Central Bank official said. Yiangos Demetriou, head of internal audit at the Central Bank, said the controls would allow unlimited use of credit cards within Cyprus, but set a limit of 5,000 euros ($6,400) per month abroad. He said the measures would remain in place for four days, contradicting an earlier report by the Athens newspaper Kathimerini that the controls would last seven days. \"That doesn't mean it cannot be reviewed in the meantime depending on developments,\" Demetriou told the Cypriot state broadcaster. \"The rationale is that these measures will be reviewed on a daily basis, so if there is the possibility of relaxing them we will,\" he said. The central bank says banks will reopen at midday (1000 GMT) on Thursday, ten days after they closed their doors on the orders of the government to avert a run on deposits as the island negotiated a bailout deal with the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Demetriou said the central bank would review all commercial transactions between 5,000 and 200,000 euros, and scrutinise any larger transactions on a case-by-case basis. Keep watching the website for more developments tonight. Otherwise I'll be back tomorrow to cover the re-opening of the Cyprus banks. Could be quite a day. Thanks, and goodnight! Cyprus State TV reported tonight that the European Central Bank had sent containerloads of euros to the Cyprus central bank. No official confirmation, but these two photos (and one tweet) show a large convoy which drove from Larnaca Airport to the central bank in Nicosia, accompanied by armed police officers. Guess they might have been carrying something else.... More from Helena on that Athens bomb: Am hearing that the makeshift explosive devise was hidden in a bag and planted outside the front door of the home, not office, of a ship owner living in the Acropolis district in central Athens. It erupted 20 minutes after a warning call to a local newspaper. People have been evacuated from the area. Afxendis Afxendiou, Cyprus' Central Bank's esteemed former governor, says he is not fearful of a run on banks when they finally re-open tomorrow. \" He told our correspondent in Nicosia, Helena Smith that: I don't expect a run on the banks My latest information is that there will be some restrictions regarding moving money abroad. There will be an upper limit of 5,000 euro on credit card withdrawals. Banks needed to re-open urgently said Afxendiou who held the post for 20 years. \"They have been closed for so many days and this closure is being felt by the market,\" he said. Supplies of food are being exhausted and there are cases of raw materials like iron and timber being held up in customs because importers don't have the cash to pay for them ... no one expected, myself included, that the EU, ECB md IMF, would behave like this. Cyprus has been treated very badly ... where is the solidarity principle that is supposed to underline Europe? Afxendiou argued that the haircut was not just wrong but unconstitutional. 'I know of many instances of Cypriot depositors [with more than 100,000 euro] who will challenge the measure before the Supreme court,\" he said, adding that he expected the country's highest legal body to issue a judgment \"in the next year or so.\" Update: the explosion in Athens is reported to be outside the offices of Tsakou shipping magnate. No sign of injuries that this stage. Meanwhile over in Athens, there are multiple reports of an explosion in the Acropolis area tonight: Twitter user karima_elkhoury is in the Greek capital, and can see that the police have turned up: A decent turnout at tonight's rally outside the presidential palace in Cyprus, with Angela Merkel the target for some protesters: Sounds like we'll get the official details of the capital controls in around an hour's time, at 9.15pm Cyprus time, or 7.15pm GMT. That'll give people time to sleep on the plan, and ponder whether to head to the bank in the morning. Cyprus's central bank has announced that the country's banks will reopen on Thursday, at midday, and operate until 6pm local time. That's 10am GMT to 4pm GMT. Just in: A spokesperson for the Cyprus Central bank has announced that the basic capital control measures will be released within the next 60 minutes. So we'll soon know if the version which leaked this afternoon is accurate. And as flagged up earlier, cash withdrawal limits will be raised to around \u20ac300 (with thanks to Janine Louloudi) Around 2,000 protestors have converged on the presidential palace, confirms our correspondent in Nicosia, Helena Smith. Helena (veteran of many an Athens anti-austerity protest) writes: Unlike Greeks who take to the streets with alacrity, Cypriots are a different breed with protests often being emotional but almost never violent. Tonight's demonstration, organized by the communist party AKEL and Citizens Initiative against austerity, was no different. At least 2000 people are now shouting themselves hoarse, many young, many old, against the \"murderous\" compromise they say president Nicos Anastasiades has made in accepting the terms of Cyprus \u20ac10bn EU-IMF bailout deal. The mood by the standards of laid back Cyprus is fairly electric with much anger in the air. The protesters are now gathered outside the presidential palace: Hundreds of people* gathered at the EU headquarters in Nicosia this afternoon, before marching towards the presidential palace to protest against the bailout deal agreed last weekend. The protesters changed \"I'll pay nothing; I owe nothing.\" and carried flags and banners with slogans such as \"Troika out of Cyprus\". * - Reuters reckons 500. These photos were all taken during the protest outside the European Union House, partly organised by the communist Akel party (as reported at 10.06am). Heads-up: Government officials are briefing that the degree on capital controls may not be the final version. Certainly there's still no official announcement.. and the clock is ticking if Cyprus is really going to get its banks open tomorrow morning. According to AP, the Cypriot authorities are also looking to increase the amount that people can withdraw at a bank to \u20ac300 per day, from \u20ac100, as part of the capital controls. A banking official said Wednesday that new controls will include restrictions on large-scale transfers from the country's two largest and most troubled lenders, Bank of Cyprus and Laiki, when they reopen Thursday. Both are being restructured and big depositors face losses of as much as 40 percent. Authorities are looking to increase the daily withdrawal limit from 100 euros to 300 euros (from $130 to $386), while payroll payments will be allowed in order to help businesses, which have taken a huge hit as people cut down on their spending amid the uncertainty swirling about the banks. The restrictions will be kept for at least a week until the situation stabilizes, said the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because the measures have yet to be officially announced. We're still waiting for an official announcement from the Cypriot government on the capital controls. In the meantime, Greek newspaper Kathimerini (which broke the news of the decree alongside the WSJ/Dow Jones this afternoon) has this report: Cyprus decides on capital controls, including ban on checks being cashed. And here's more reaction: Hats off to Janine Louloudi, a freelance journalist working in Nicosia, for translating the government decree on capital controls into English (you can download it here). Nathan Morley, reporter at the Cyprus Mail, explains how the ban on cashing cheques will hurt people: The instant reaction to Cyprus's capital controls splits into two camps -- one warning that the new measures will have a chilling effect on its economy, and the other predicting that the measures will last much longer than seven days. There's no information about restrictions on ATM machines (although here may be more details still to leak). But, of course, people are already limited to taking out just \u20ac100 per day. Details of Cyprus's capital controls are now hitting the newswires. Here are the key points (mainly via Dow Jones and Reuters). \u2022 All savings accounts must run until their expiry date - with no early withdrawals allowed. \u2022 Cashing of cheques will be suspended, but 'cheque deposits' will be allowed. \u2022 Payments out of the country are suspended, with certain exemptions: a) Individuals will only be allowed to take \u20ac3,000 in cash on each trip out of the country. b) Import payments will be allowed when 'the relevant documents' are provided to the authorities. c) Cypriots will only be allowed to transfer up to \u20ac10,000 per quarter for fellow citizens who are studying abroad. \u2022 All credit/debit card transactions abroad will be capped at \u20ac5,000 per person, per month. \u2022 The measures will apply to all accounts, regardless of the currency it uses. \u2022 They will run for seven days Reaction to follow We're running a poll today, on how long it will take for the restrictions on Cyprus's financial system to be lifted: \u2022 How long will the capital controls in Cyprus last? These photos from Cyprus today show how customers at at petrol station in Nicosia are only allowed to pay by cash. Capital controls to be imposed in Cyprus will limit foreign transactions and capital outflows but not movements of money within the country itself, according to the head of its chamber of commerce. Phidias Pelides made the comments to reporters after meeting government officials, saying: We have been assured that limitations will not affect transactions within Cyprus at all. Where there will be limitations is on what we spend abroad and also on capital outflows. (via Reuters) That would prevent the threat of capital racing out of Cyprus, draining its banks and creating a deeper liquidity crisis. We still don't have confirmation that the banks will definitely open on Thursday.... Over on Twitter, Economist Hulk is explaining the nitty-gritty of economics to the masses (once HULK gets his follower count-up, anyway): Another distinguished fund manager with too much time on his hands? Or perhaps a journalist desperate to throw off the chains of impartiality and shout what s/he really thinks. Malta and Luxembourg have both denied claims that they could suffer the same fate as Cyprus as they both operate outsized banking sectors. Malta's banking sector is eight times its GDP -- even more that Cyprus's is was. But the governor of the Central Bank of Malta, Josef Bonnici, insists that it's in much better shape. Speaking to Reuters, Bonnini said Malta's banks weren't carrying the foreign sovereign debt that helped cause Cyprus's crisis: The problems facing Cypriot banks include losses made on their holdings of Greek bonds, whereas Maltese domestic banks have limited exposure to securities issued by the (euro zone bailout) programme countries. Luxembourg's banking sector is about 20 times its annual GDP, and is understandably worried by recent comments from Brussels. Its government said it is: concerned about recent statements and declarations\" on the alleged risks of outsized financial sectors. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, wrote on Monday evening that Cyprus's fate has alarmed Malta and Luxembourg: Malta's finance minister sat next to his German and Cypriot counterparts at the first Cyprus bailout meeting in Brussels 10 days ago and was extremely chastened by what he witnessed. After experiencing Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, up close, he wrote an article in the Malta Times saying God help his country if it encounters similar problems in the eurozone. Then there is Luxembourg, which along with Austria, is the eurozone's biggest champion of banking secrecy. Cyprus's banks have been tamed \u2013 are Malta and Luxembourg next? The central bank of Cyprus has confirmed in the last few minutes that the draft capital controls are ready. A spokesperson for the bank said it hopes to brief the public on the situation by the end of the day, and repeated the line that they will be kept flexible, if possible. Banks to reopen tomorrow, then?.... Economic confidence across the eurozone and the EU was already low, by historical terms, before this month's drop: Economic confidence across the eurozone has fallen this month, reversing four months of gains and sending the euro sliding further. The data suggests the Cyprus crisis has alarmed business leaders across the region, undermining efforts to bring the eurozone out of recession. Economic sentiment slumped by 1.1 points to 90.0, according to the EC's monthly measure, driven by falling optimism among manufacturers. Protests are mounting in Cyprus as the full extent of Monday's EU-IMF bailout sinks in. The communist Akel party, in collaboration with a group of private citizens, is planning a mass demonstration at 5.30pm local time, or 3.30 GMT, outside the offices of the European commission. They will protest against policies that many fear have put the tiny nation state on the Greek path of economic self-destruction. From Nicosia, my colleague Helena Smith reports: \"There is a lot of fury and growing fury,\" said Giorgos Doulouka, the party's spokesman. \"We all know what awaits us, that these polices are going to lead to a huge decrease in the GDP of our country, recession and cuts in pensions and benefits because the government won't be able to meet budget targets.\" The protest, which is expected to draw thousands, will move onto the presidential palace. Anger has been underscored by panic among employees over what awaits the Bank of Cyprus, following the Greek Cypriot finance minister's announcement Tuesday that the lender will undergo restructuring and internal recapitalisation. Helena has also just spoken to the former central bank governor Afxendis Afxendiou who says he thinks the banks, closed for the past 11 days, will re-open tomorrow. Back in Nicosia, it appears that the chief executive of the Bank of Cyprus (BoC) has been dramatically fired. Local media are reporting that Yiannis Kypri was ousted by the country's central bank, following the appointment of a special administrator to run BoC. Reuters's Nicosia bureau has the details: Cyprus's central bank has fired the chief executive officer of the Bank of Cyprus, an official at the island's largest commercial lender said on Wednesday.It follows the appointment of a special administrator to run the bank, which was saved from collapse this week under a painful European Union bailout for Cyprus. The bank's chairman, Andreas Artemis, submitted his resignation on Tuesday.An official at the bank, who declined to be named, said local media reports that CEO Yiannis Kypri had been removed from the post were \"valid\". The source was unable to confirm reports that the central bank had demanded the resignation of the entire board. The reaction of BoC's staff will be interesting. Yesterday, hundreds of employees held a demonstration at the bank's HQ and were clearly furious with the actions of the central bank. A gobbet of economic news.... Britain's economy only grew by a measly 0.2% during 2012, not 0.3% as previously thought. That's according to new data from the Office for National Statistics, which also confirmed that GDP shrank by 0.3% in the last three months of 2012, France's economy also shrank by 0.3% in the last three months of 2012, separate data from Paris showed. Europe's larger economies ended last year on a low. Here's a video clip of Paul Mason, Newsnight's economics editor, holding a draft copy of the capital controls that should be announced in Cyprus today. The document is littered with 'xx's, showing that bank managers (as of last night) didn't have any clear idea what the capital controls would be. That doesn't bolster confidence that they'll all be ready to reopen tomorrow morning.... Eurozone leaders and top officials may be kidding themselves if they reckon they've prevented the Cyprus bailout causing damage to other countries, a senior executive at Moody's warned today. Bart Oosterveld, managing director of sovereign risk at Moody's, told Reuters that policymakers are overestimating their ability to contain the crisis. Here's the key quotes: Policymakers appear very confident that market conditions are benign enough and that they have the tools to avoid contagion to other peripheral economies and their banking systems. We think that that confidence may well be misplaced. So far, Cyprus has remained largely a local difficulty - with the bond yields of Spain and Italy unaffected (so far). OK, the euro has lost ground - but that won't cause alarm in Brussels (and will please countries with a strong export sector.... ) The euro fell to a new four-month low against the US dollar this morning, to $1.2818. Traders blamed the aftermath of the Cyprus bailout. Confusion reigns over whether Europe is moving towards a system where large depositors and bond holders, rather than taxpayers, will be tapped when a bank fails. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale explains: Anger at the treatment of Cypriot depositors won\u2019t abate and the damage to confidence in Europe's financial system and leadership is done. The government of Cyprus said yesterday that capital controls could be lifted in a few weeks. But in the past, these restrictions have lasted much longer. Here's Bloomberg's take: Cyprus Capital Controls First in EU Could Last Years Cyprus is on the verge of an unprecedented financial experiment: imposing controls on money transfers in an economy that doesn\u2019t have its own currency.... \u201cThanks to political mismanagement, we now have a first: capital controls in the euro zone,\u201d said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel in Brussels and a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cHow long is temporary? It could turn out like Iceland, extending to many years.\u201d The BBC has a handy explainer: Cyprus crisis: What are capital controls and why does it need them? And there's a good Q&amp;A on the Wall Street Journal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the crisis in Cyprus following its bailout. A historic day looms, as Cyprus prepares to become the first member of the eurozone to impose restrictions on the flow of money in its economy. Finance minister Michalis Sarris says the new capital controls should be ready by noon Cyprus time, or 10am GMT. He's already defended them in a TV interview saying: I think they will be within the realms of reason Banks will open on Thursday ... We will look at the best way to limit the possibility of large sums of money leaving, and not imposing punitive conditions on the economy, businesses and individuals. The capital controls are meant to prevent hordes of savers descending on Cyprus's bank branches and cleaning the vaults out. So what might they be? Based on the legislation passed by the Cyprus parliament, and a report by the BBC's Paul Mason (who's seen a draft version), it will probably include: * Limits on cash withdrawals (currently \u20ac100 at ATM machine), * restrictions on access to savings accounts, * limits on paying by cheques (possibly a ban), * restrictions on the use of credit and debit cards, * and a ban on taking large sums of money out of Cyprus. We'll get the details soon, along with other developments through the day.....",

      "bodyText": "It is a pitch that might draw snorts from the hard-headed judges on Dragons' Den: invest in the resurrection of a high-street retailer extinguished by rampant e-commerce competitors. But the proposal comes from arch-dragon Peter Jones, who believes he can revive the failed camera chain Jessops by reopening 30 high street stores, creating 500 jobs in the process. The entrepreneur is so confident in the chain's success that he will run the business as chairman and chief executive, investing \u00a35m of his personal fortune to revamp the brand. He has also re-employed more than 300 former Jessops staff who lost their jobs when the company went bust in January. But he warned that the venture could mean walking away from the BBC show he is famous for if Jessops becomes a big success again. \"I'll struggle to do both this and Dragons' Den.

When you make a mistake you lose $10m, $50m, $100m, but when you make a mistake of $200m to $500m, or $1bn, that's a blunder \u2026 It's no way a blunder when we are back on track.\" I get it. Actually, I don't. Shall we move on? Yes, let's. Does anyone benefit from his vast wealth besides him? Women, apparently. Lucky them. How? Alwaleed beneficently employs the country's first female pilot. Does he? Yup. He hired pilot Hanadi Zakariya Hindi in 2004 to pilot his privtae jets, saying \"I am in full support of Saudi ladies working in all fields.\" Do say: \"What a moustache.\" Don't say: \"Weren't you 26th in the Forbes Rich list?\"",

    "webTitle": "Prudential boss Tidjane Thiam censured by FSA over ill-fated AIA bid", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tidjane Thiam, the head of Prudential, has become one of the highest profile chief executives to be personally censured by the financial regulator, following an investigation into the insurer's ill-fated bid for AIA three years ago. The Pru was also fined \u00a330m by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) for failing to be \"open\" and \"co-operative\" with the watchdog over the proposed \u00a321bn takeover, which the FSA only found out about through the media. The Pru would have needed to pull off the largest cash call in British corporate history \u2013 \u00a314.5bn \u2013 if the deal for the Asian arm of the US insurer AIG had succeeded. Censuring Thiam, the regulator said it was \"necessary to send a clear message to directors of firms as to the fundamental importance of behaving openly and co-operatively towards the FSA\". The FSA is in its last week of existence before being closed down and replaced by the Financial Conduct Authority, which is expected to impose greater scrutiny on the role of senior executives. Some City sources said on Wednesday that the FSA's action represented the start of this new approach and was too heavy handed. Attention may turn to the pay of Thiam, who had \u00a350,000 docked from his bonus for 2010 \u2013 when his remuneration totalled \u00a35m \u2013 as a penalty for the botched deal, which left angry investors with a \u00a3377m bill for fees to advisers. His bonus in the subsequent year was deferred and it is understood that the regulatory action will not have any impact on his pay for 2012, likely to be announced next week. While investors credit Thiam with a doubling in the Pru's stock market value since the ill-fated deal, they were also said to be keeping an eye on his payout. \"If his bonus isn't significantly reduced, there could be an issue,\" one said. Thiam and the Pru had been disputing the FSA's action but the insurer's chairman, Paul Manduca, said it was time to \"draw a line under the matter\". There was no discount on the fine \u2013 something usually given to those who settle early. Tracey McDermott, the FSA's director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \"Prudential, led by Thiam as CEO, failed to give due consideration to its obligation to inform the FSA of this transaction, which would have had a huge impact on the group had it gone through. That was a serious error of judgment for which Prudential is paying the price. \"Thiam has also been censured in relation to his role in this matter. This case should send a clear message to all board members of their collective and individual responsibility for the decisions they make on behalf of their companies.\" The FSA said the Pru's advisers at Credit Suisse had told it to disclose the potential deal, but that the Pru had been concerned, as it was not certain that the deal would proceed and feared news might leak out. The deal was formally announced on 1 March 2010 but had leaked on 27 February. It collapsed in June in the face of resistance from shareholders. But the FSA felt it should have been informed about the deal at a private meeting with Pru executives on 12 February, when it was already under negotiation. \"The proposed transaction's size and scale would have transformed the group's financial position, strategy and risk profile \u2026 and involved a planned rights issue of \u00a314.5bn, which would have been the biggest ever in the UK. The transaction had the potential to impact upon the stability and confidence of the financial system in the UK and abroad,\" the FSA said. The regulator said Thiam had \"played a significant role\" in not revealing the deal until it was leaked, and that his concern about a leak had \"materially influenced\" his judgment. But some City figures expressed surprise that Thiam had been publicly rebuked when many top bankers have not received similar treatment. The FSA stressed that the investigation was into \"past events and does not concern the current conduct of the management of the Prudential group\". Thiam is a leading figure in the insurance industry and chairs the the Association of British Insurers, which said it had no intention of asking him to resign. Manduca said the chief executive \"acted at all times in the interests of the company and with the full knowledge and authority of the board\", adding: \"The board wishes to express its satisfaction that all parties have agreed to this settlement. \"Over the past three years, our successful business strategy, led by Tidjane, and fully supported by the board, has delivered excellent results for customers, shareholders and employees. This was most recently demonstrated by our strong annual results for 2012.\"",

      "bodyText": "A collapse in overseas income has pushed the UK's 2012 current account deficit \u2013 the gap between imports and exports \u2013 spiralling to its worst level for more than 20 years, according to official figures. The worsening situation in the eurozone helped Britain to a \u00a357.7bn current account deficit, amounting to 3.7% of GDP, the biggest shortfall as a proportion of national income since 1989. The Office for National Statistics said 2012 ended on a low note after Britain registered a \u00a314bn deficit in the last quarter, coming on top of a \u00a315bn deficit in the previous quarter. Analysts warned that a long-running sequence of balance of payments deficits, which goes back to 1984, had worsened with few signs of an upturn. The figures will prove a huge disappointment to the coalition government, and especially business secretary Vince Cable, who pledged to rebalance the economy away from consumer spending and banking towards exports. A fall in the value of sterling by a quarter over the last four years was expected to boost exports and allow manufacturers to become a larger slice of the UK economy. In separate figures, the ONS confirmed that GDP contracted 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with the previous three months, putting the UK on course for a triple-dip recession. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics, said: \"The figures are a reminder of how much progress still needs to be made towards getting the economy back to a sustainable path \u2013 progress that might require a further drop in the pound.\" While the export of goods has held up over the last year, imports have soared, especially of oil and gas, to leave a \u00a327bn deficit in goods in the last quarter alone.

Reflecting a decline in old colonial ties and weaker investment income from the US, the surplus with non-EU countries almost halved from \u00a323.4bn in 2011 to \u00a312.9bn last year. A positive balance of \u00a317bn in services offset some of the loss on goods, though earnings by UK banks on foreign loans, which is counted as income, have dived. Financial services exports have fallen from \u00a352bn at their peak in 2008 to \u00a344bn last year. A collapse in sales to the eurozone was blamed for much of the higher than expected shortfalls in export income. Phil Shaw, UK economist at fund manager Investec said persistent deficits undermined the strength of the UK economy and would be harder to turn around the longer it went on. The immediate impact of balance of payments deficits was felt almost immediately in the 1960s when the pound was fixed in value against other currencies. But the need for UK businesses to sell pounds to buy foreign goods in their own currency stil puts pressure on the value of the pound. Shaw said the impact was likely to be significant over the longer term, as UK firms found they had a diminishing number of assets to sell to buy foreign goods and services. \"When you are forced to sell assets to buy foreign goods it weakens your ability to earn money from UK assets. there simply are not as many as before. They are in foreign hands,\" he said. \"This means that barring another significant drop in the exchange rate it will become more and more difficult for the UK to get closer to a position of external balance.\"",

      "bodyText": "So much for rebalancing. So much for George Osborne's \"march of the makers\". So much for the idea that a more competitive pound would make the UK less dependent on consumer spending and the state for its growth. The balance of payments figures for 2012 make dismal reading. They show that the UK ran a deficit of \u00a357bn last year compared with just \u00a320bn in 2011. As a share of the economy, the shortfall was 3.7% \u2013 the highest since 1989. More worrying still, on the three previous occasions since the second world war that the deficit has been higher as a proportion of GDP, a booming economy was sucking in imports. This time there is no such excuse. Two big factors explain the deterioration in the balance of payments last year. Firstly, there has been a worsening in UK performance in trade in goods and services. The deficit on goods rose from \u00a3100bn to \u00a3106bn last year, while the surplus in services dropped from \u00a376bn to \u00a370bn. That left a trade deficit of \u00a336bn up by 50% on 2011. The situation in the eurozone \u2013 Britain's trading partner \u2013 has clearly not helped matters. It is not, however, the whole story. Britain's manufacturing base has been hollowed out by the three big recessions since the early 1980s, and that has resulted in a reduced capacity to take advantage of a falling currency. What's more, part of the competitive advantage from the 25% drop in the value of the pound from its pre-crisis level has been eroded by the UK's poor productivity record in recent years. In the first half of the 2000s, the steady worsening of Britain's trade balance was masked by a strong investment performance. Put simply, foreign investors make money on UK assets, and UK investors make money on their overseas assets. In 2011, the return on UK assets held overseas exceeded the return on foreign assets held in the UK by \u00a326bn. Last year, this had dropped to just less than \u00a32bn. There seems no obvious reason why the UK should continue to make large surpluses on investment income. As the Office for National Statistics noted, the UK has a large negative investment position \u2013 \u00a3544bn at the end of 2012 \u2013 which means that foreigners own a bigger slice of Britain than UK investors own of foreign countries. So, Britain can only continue to make a surplus on investment income if a) the quality of its overseas assets is higher than the quality of the assets held here b) UK investors are intrinsically gifted at sweating their assets or c) Britain is prepared to take punts on riskier investments that offer higher returns. In reality, there seems no reason to expect the big surpluses on investment income to return any time soon, exposing the structural deterioration in trade in goods and services. The latest data shows that the UK has not one but two serious deficits to tackle, and neither of them is getting any better. Progress on reducing the budget deficit has stalled, while Britain is finding that the speculative activities of the City can no longer disguise big deficits in manufactured goods, food and oil. There was a time when ministers used to wait anxiously for the latest balance of payments figures. Those days may be a distant memory, but the UK's inability to pay its way in the world should be setting off warning bells in Whitehall.",

      "body": "<p>So much for rebalancing. So much for George Osborne's \"march of the makers\". So much for the idea that a more competitive pound would make the UK less dependent on consumer spending and the state for its growth.</p> <p>The balance of payments figures for 2012 make dismal reading. They show that the UK ran a deficit of \u00a357bn last year compared with just \u00a320bn in 2011. As a share of the economy, the shortfall was 3.7% \u2013 the highest since 1989. More worrying still, on the three previous occasions since the second world war that the deficit has been higher as a proportion of GDP, a booming economy was sucking in imports. This time there is no such excuse.</p> <p>Two big factors explain the deterioration in the balance of payments last year. Firstly, there has been a worsening in UK performance in trade in goods and services. The deficit on goods rose from \u00a3100bn to \u00a3106bn last year, while the surplus in services dropped from \u00a376bn to \u00a370bn. That left a trade deficit of \u00a336bn up by 50% on 2011.</p> <p>The situation in the eurozone \u2013 Britain's trading partner \u2013 has clearly not helped matters. It is not, however, the whole story. Britain's manufacturing base has been hollowed out by the three big recessions since the early 1980s, and that has resulted in a reduced capacity to take advantage of a falling currency. What's more, part of the competitive advantage from the 25% drop in the value of the pound from its pre-crisis level has been eroded by the UK's poor productivity record in recent years.</p> <p>In the first half of the 2000s, the steady worsening of Britain's trade balance was masked by a strong investment performance. Put simply, foreign investors make money on UK assets, and UK investors make money on their overseas assets. In 2011, the return on UK assets held overseas exceeded the return on foreign assets held in the UK by \u00a326bn. Last year, this had dropped to just less than \u00a32bn.</p> <p>There seems no obvious reason why the UK should continue to make large surpluses on investment income. As the Office for National Statistics noted, the UK has a large negative investment position \u2013 \u00a3544bn at the end of 2012 \u2013 which means that foreigners own a bigger slice of Britain than UK investors own of foreign countries. So, Britain can only continue to make a surplus on investment income if a) the quality of its overseas assets is higher than the quality of the assets held here b) UK investors are intrinsically gifted at sweating their assets or c) Britain is prepared to take punts on riskier investments that offer higher returns.</p> <p>In reality, there seems no reason to expect the big surpluses on investment income to return any time soon, exposing the structural deterioration in trade in goods and services. The latest data shows that the UK has not one but two serious deficits to tackle, and neither of them is getting any better. Progress on reducing the budget deficit has stalled, while Britain is finding that the speculative activities of the City can no longer disguise big deficits in manufactured goods, food and oil. There was a time when ministers used to wait anxiously for the latest balance of payments figures. Those days may be a distant memory, but the UK's inability to pay its way in the world should be setting off warning bells in Whitehall.</p>",
