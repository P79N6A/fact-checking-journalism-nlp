      "bodyText": "A Hermes delivery driver will on Monday tell MPs how the company cut his \u201cgig economy\u201d job after he struggled to hit targets while trying to juggle work with caring for his wife, who was dying of cancer. Peter Jamieson, 33, a former lorry driver, is one of seven workers who will give evidence to an inquiry into self-employment and the gig economy, which was prompted by a Guardian investigation that revealed some Hermes couriers were paid rates equivalent to less than the minimum wage and others felt forced to work through illness and bereavement. Frank Field, the chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said thousands of people like Jamieson felt they had been \u201ctricked and maltreated\u201d by big businesses exploiting workers\u2019 flexibility but often not giving them rights or flexibility in return. The workers giving evidence on Monday were \u201cincredibly brave\u201d, Field explained, as many of them are still currently working for gig economy employers. \u201cThey don\u2019t get the national living wage,\u201d he said. \u201cThey often just get pushed around told to \u2018do this, do that, stay here, wait there\u2019, but then when they want some of the real advantages of flexible working they are told they can\u2019t have it.\u201d \u201cThe employers say \u2018if you can\u2019t find someone to cover your round you\u2019re out\u2019. They are just bullied,\u201d Field said. Jamieson said Hermes, which delivers packages for Amazon and John Lewis, stopped offering him work after he requested to swap shifts so he could hold his wife\u2019s hand at chemotherapy and radiotherapy hospital appointments. Hermes denied his request, instead piling him up with more shifts, before withdrawing all work. \u201cThey told me everyone has problems at Hermes and I would never work for Hermes again \u2026 there was no compassion,\u201d Jamieson told the Guardian last year. Jamieson will tell the work and pensions select committee that he pleaded with Carole Woodhead, chief executive of Hermes UK, to give him his job back. \u201cWe have an eight-year-old son called Brandon, who is finding his mum\u2019s illness hard to deal with, and is upset about Tricia losing her hair and having little energy to do as much with him as she used to,\u201d Jamieson told Woodhead in a letter. His wife, Tricia, who was in her mid 20s, had recently been told she had inoperable cancer and just months left to live. Jamieson\u2019s patchwork earnings amounted to as little as \u00a3500 a month after expenses, but the money was essential to help support his Tricia and their young son. \u201cTricia was really upset and panicking about the future for me and our son Brandon when she\u2019s gone,\u201d Jamieson said. \u201cIt was really uncalled for. It let us know what type of company Hermes is. I couldn\u2019t even buy a bunch of flowers for Tricia. I was asking for help, but I was told the work was my responsibility.\u201d Jamieson told Woodhead that her company \u201cwas aware I was struggling and going through a tough time personally\u201d, but \u201cinstead of lessening the burden, [Hermes] increased the volume against my wishes, which was really the last thing I needed\u201d. Jamieson asked Hermes, which turned over \u00a3443m in 2014-15 and made a profit of \u00a329m after tax, to restore even some of his work, saying he \u201cwould not let you down again\u201d. Woodhead did not reply to the letter. The company has since apologised and said: \u201cThis kind of behaviour has absolutely no place in Hermes and we are appalled by these claims.\u201d Two other Hermes delivery drivers, a Deliveroo bike rider and two Uber drivers will also give evidence on Monday. David Dunn, an Uber driver from Glasgow, will tell the inquiry that more than 1,000 Uber drivers in Scotland had their pay delayed by the company. Field has told Theresa May that the government should listen to workers\u2019 horror stories and guarantee the minimum wage for self-employed workers for companies such as Hermes and Uber. Field, who has led campaigns in parliament against what he claims is the \u201csulphurous effect\u201d of the fast-growing gig economy, has proposed a new \u201cnational standard of fair work in the gig economy\u201d. He said his fair work proposal would \u201cgive the prime minister the tools she needs to craft basic humanity, decency and fairness into the bottom of Britain\u2019s labour market\u201d. He said an additional 900,000 self-employed positions had been added to the UK workforce since 2010.",

    "webTitle": "New homes warranty firm pays millions to leading homebuilders", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The organisation that provides warranties for most of the new homes in Britain is paying millions of pounds to the leading housebuilders every year, raising questions about its independence and credibility amid a wave of complaints about the quality of new-build properties. NHBC, the standard-setting body and main home construction warranty provider for new builds in the UK, is paying around \u00a310m to \u00a315m every year to housebuilders through what is effectively a profit-share agreement. The largest firms can receive as much as \u00a32m from the scheme, because it rewards the developers who registered the most homes with NHBC. Campaigners said the revelation shows that NHBC is on the side of developers rather than consumers and that the lack of protection for buyers of new homes is a \u201cscandal\u201d. A senior industry source said the annual payment to the housebuilders was a way to keep them \u201csweet\u201d and ensure they remained NHBC customers. The source also said that the system is open to abuse, and there were at least two occasions since 2010 when a major housebuilder asked for an extra or increased payment which was approved by NHBC. The questions about the credibility of NHBC, which claims to have an 80% share of the warranties market, will also be a headache for the government, which is poised to launch its housing white paper this week. There have been an increasing number of complaints about problems with new homes and the lack of protection and compensation for consumers from NHBC\u2019s warranties. Last month it was revealed that Bovis had paid the purchasers of new homes to move in early only for the buyers to find the property unfinished. The NHBC warranty is a form of insurance that is supposed to compensate home buyers or fix any faults in the new property if there are problems within the first 10 years. Paula Higgins, co-founder and chief executive of the campaign group HomeOwners Alliance, said: \u201cAs we have more houses being built and the government encouraging people to buy new homes, we are seeing more and more issues with quality. \u201cThe government is more concerned with numbers than homes for the future and there is a real danger that we are building the wrong sort of home.\u201d Higgins said NHBC was \u201ctoo much of a monopoly\u201d in the warranties market and described its relationship with housebuilders as \u201ccosy\u201d. \u201cI think NHBC is acting on behalf of the developers and its members. I don\u2019t think they are acting on behalf of consumers,\u201d said Higgins. \u201cThe quality of new homes \u2013 it is a scandal.\u201d The potential conflict of interest between NHBC paying compensation to consumers and returning cash to housebuilders will lead to more calls for the government to introduce an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints about new homes or for the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate NHBC\u2019s dominance of the market. Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP who chair an all-party parliamentary group on new-build properties, said he had great concern about the independence of NHBC. He called for an ombudsman to be introduced and for homebuyers to be allowed to inspect their new home before they purchase it. \u201cI think what needs to happen is that the government needs to look at this seriously. This is a consumer rights issue,\u201d he said. \u201cLets put the consumer on top of the list. I want to see action on this issue.\u201d NHBC has faced questions about its independence before because it is paid a membership fee by housebuilders, meaning they effectively fund it. However, this is the first time it has been revealed that NHBC pays millions back to developers. The payment is referred to as a \u201cpremium refund\u201d in the financial accounts of NHBC. However, it is only mentioned in the notes to the accounts and the amount paid out is not disclosed. A letter seen by the Guardian from NHBC to a housebuilder shows the payment is based on a complex calculation that takes into account the number of homes registered by the developer 15 years ago, the cost of claims paid out on these homes and the investment return earned by the NHBC. The 15-year period allows time for the property to be built, sold and the warranty to expire. However, on top of this formula, each year the NHBC also determines the size of the total pot of cash that is available to be shared out with the housebuilders. NHBC defended the payments but refused to confirm how much it had paid out to housebuilders or comment on the extra payments to the two housebuilders. The NHBC said: \u201cNHBC provides a market-leading warranty, which currently protects 1.6 million UK consumers. \u201cLast year we paid \u00a390m in respect of claims in addition to providing assistance to homeowners through our resolution service, which mediates between homeowners and their builder and last year found in favour of homeowners in 70% of cases. \u201cAs is standard practice, we do not discuss our commercial transactions or our underwriting terms. \u201cIt is common practice in the insurance industry to recognise good claims history in a number of ways such as no-claim bonuses, and this is what our premium refund system, established in the 1990s and disclosed in our accounts, is designed to achieve. \u201cThe system is consistently applied and is based on clear rules and processes. As this refund recognises long-term good claims history, the rules state that builders do not need to be current NHBC customers to receive it. \u201cThe sum paid in refunds is a very small proportion of NHBC\u2019s annual turnover.\u201d",

The source also said that the system is open to abuse, and there were at least two occasions since 2010 when a major housebuilder asked for an extra or increased payment which was approved by NHBC.</p> <p>The questions about the credibility of NHBC, which claims to have an 80% share of the warranties market, will also be a headache for the government, which is poised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/04/may-abandons-home-owning-democracy-thatcher-tories\">launch its housing white paper this week</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/06/new-homes-warranty-nhbc-uk\">Directors of new homes warranty firm criticised for lack of independence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There have been an increasing number of complaints about problems with new homes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/15/new-build-home-affordable-housing-industry-compromising-quality\">the lack of protection and compensation for consumers from NHBC\u2019s warranties</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/28/bovis-home-hundreds-of-snags-angry-buyers-unfinished-homes\">Last month it was revealed that Bovis had paid the purchasers of new homes to move in early only for the buyers to find the property unfinished</a>.</p> <p>The NHBC warranty is a form of insurance that is supposed to compensate home buyers or fix any faults in the new property if there are problems within the first 10 years.</p> <p>Paula Higgins, co-founder and chief executive of the campaign group HomeOwners Alliance, said: \u201cAs we have more houses being built and the government encouraging people to buy new homes, we are seeing more and more issues with quality.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe government is more concerned with numbers than homes for the future and there is a real danger that we are building the wrong sort of home.\u201d</p> <p>Higgins said NHBC was \u201ctoo much of a monopoly\u201d in the warranties market and described its relationship with housebuilders as \u201ccosy\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/28/bovis-home-hundreds-of-snags-angry-buyers-unfinished-homes\">How buying a Bovis home came with hundreds of snags</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think NHBC is acting on behalf of the developers and its members. I don\u2019t think they are acting on behalf of consumers,\u201d said Higgins. \u201cThe quality of new homes \u2013 it is a scandal.\u201d</p> <p>The potential conflict of interest between NHBC paying compensation to consumers and returning cash to housebuilders will lead to more calls for the government to introduce an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints about new homes or for the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate NHBC\u2019s dominance of the market.</p> <p>Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP who chair an all-party parliamentary group on new-build properties, said he had great concern about the independence of NHBC. He called for an ombudsman to be introduced and for homebuyers to be allowed to inspect their new home before they purchase it.</p> <p>\u201cI think what needs to happen is that the government needs to look at this seriously. This is a consumer rights issue,\u201d he said. \u201cLets put the consumer on top of the list. I want to see action on this issue.\u201d</p> <p>NHBC has faced questions about its independence before because it is paid a membership fee by housebuilders, meaning they effectively fund it. However, this is the first time it has been revealed that NHBC pays millions back to developers.</p> <p>The payment is referred to as a \u201cpremium refund\u201d in the financial accounts of NHBC. However, it is only mentioned in the notes to the accounts and the amount paid out is not disclosed.</p> <p>A letter seen by the Guardian from NHBC to a housebuilder shows the payment is based on a complex calculation that takes into account the number of homes registered by the developer 15 years ago, the cost of claims paid out on these homes and the investment return earned by the NHBC. The 15-year period allows time for the property to be built, sold and the warranty to expire. However, on top of this formula, each year the NHBC also determines the size of the total pot of cash that is available to be shared out with the housebuilders. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"268a29fc1431ef6998b58b5496b452c7853c32aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/268a29fc1431ef6998b58b5496b452c7853c32aa/0_0_778_1106/703.jpg\" alt=\"NHBC letter\" width=\"703\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NHBC letter to a housebuilder</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>NHBC defended the payments but refused to confirm how much it had paid out to housebuilders or comment on the extra payments to the two housebuilders.<br></p> <p>The NHBC said: \u201cNHBC provides a market-leading warranty, which currently protects 1.6 million UK consumers. </p> <p>\u201cLast year we paid \u00a390m in respect of claims in addition to providing assistance to homeowners through our resolution service, which mediates between homeowners and their builder and last year found in favour of homeowners in 70% of cases.</p> <p>\u201cAs is standard practice, we do not discuss our commercial transactions or our underwriting terms.</p> <p>\u201cIt is common practice in the insurance industry to recognise good claims history in a number of ways such as no-claim bonuses, and this is what our premium refund system, established in the 1990s and disclosed in our accounts, is designed to achieve. </p> <p>\u201cThe system is consistently applied and is based on clear rules and processes.

    "webTitle": "Rolls-Royce faces civil service inquiry over UK state funding", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Civil servants are carrying out an internal inquiry to establish whether the engineering giant Rolls-Royce fraudulently obtained financial support worth hundreds of millions of pounds from the government. The inquiry was launched after the multinational manufacturer admitted last month it had used multimillion-pound bribes to secure export orders across the world over four decades. Rolls-Royce has apologised and is paying \u00a3671m in penalties after the endemic corruption, implicating senior employees, was exposed by anti-corruption investigators in the UK, US and Brazil. The internal review is being conducted by officials at the UK Export Finance (UKEF), the government\u2019s credit agency which gives financial support to British exporters to help them win contracts around the world. Rolls-Royce is one of the biggest customers of UKEF which extends loans to purchasers and their banks, and guarantees to step in and pay outstanding debts if buyers default on export contracts. The inquiry is understood to be scrutinising whether Rolls-Royce complied with UKEF\u2019s anti-bribery rules when it received financial support from the credit agency. UKEF has the power in certain circumstances to force firms to repay money if they have broken the anti-bribery rules. Rolls-Royce said it did not anticipate having to repay money. These rules require firms applying for financial backing to declare that they have not used corrupt payments to win export orders, or channelled payments through agents. Sue Hawley, the policy director of Corruption Watch, said: \u201cThis is a key test of how robust UKEF\u2019s anti-corruption procedures are and how willing UKEF is to enforce them. \u201cUKEF must get to the bottom of how much Rolls-Royce lied to them and look seriously at whether Rolls-Royce has defrauded the taxpayer.\u201d She added that Rolls-Royce should be blocked from receiving any support from UKEF for three years after confessing to the bribery. Rolls-Royce struck deals with the Serious Fraud Office and prosecutors in the US and Brazil last month to end long-running investigations. As part of the deals, which included paying the penalties, Rolls-Royce admitted that it had used a variety of corrupt schemes and cover-ups in 12 countries between 1989 and 2013 in what amounted to \u201cegregious criminality\u201d. In four of these countries, Rolls-Royce had won contracts that were given financial support by the UKEF or its predecessor agency. Rolls-Royce has told the Guardian that in three of these cases, it had declared to UKEF at the time it applied for financial support that it had not used corrupt methods to secure the orders. UKEF backed a \u00a3330m contract for Rolls-Royce to supply the Russian state-owned company Gazprom with gas compression equipment in 2008. Rolls-Royce paid an \u00a38m bribe to a Gazprom official to win the contract. UKEF had also supported a \u00a354m contract in 2004 to supply engines to Thai Airways which was won through a $7m bribe to middlemen. Bribes were also paid to land a \u00a332m contract in 2005 to supply power generation equipment to Brazil. Rolls-Royce also received financial support from the British government\u2019s credit agency when it paid a $2m bribe to win a contract to supply aircraft engines to Indonesia in 1991. In this case, it was working in conjunction with another firm which had the responsibility of applying for support and making any necessary declarations. Rolls-Royce said: \u201cThe behaviour uncovered in the course of the investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and other authorities is completely unacceptable and we have apologised unreservedly for it. \u201cThe past practices that were uncovered do not reflect the manner in which Rolls-Royce does business today. \u201cWe have taken extensive action to strengthen our ethics and compliance procedures so that high standards of business conduct are embedded as an essential part of the way we do business. We have co-operated fully with the authorities and will continue to do so.\u201d Anti-corruption campaigners have long argued that the government is allowing bribery to flourish by failing to uncover potentially improper payments when it gives financial backing to exporters. Details of the corruption were published in legal documents when the settlements bringing an end to the investigations were announced in January. The documents, which are being examined by UKEF officials, did not identify who had organised the illicit payments, nor who had received them. The SFO is still deciding whether to prosecute individuals over the corruption. A UKEF official said:\u201cWhile UKEF is not a law enforcement agency and has no statutory investigatory powers, we rigorously follow Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standards and take all possible precautions to avoid supporting transactions that may be tainted by corruption.\u201d \u2022 If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian\u2019s SecureDrop service (see how here).",

      "bodyText": "Ross McEwan, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, is preparing to unveil further cost cutting measures after receiving pay of around \u00a33m in 2016. The cost-reduction measures \u2013 which will be unveiled alongside the bank\u2019s ninth consecutive annual loss later this month \u2013 are expected to coincide with confirmation of his pay deal for the 2016 financial year. McEwan could be paid more than \u00a33m after \u00a32.7m of salary and allowances are topped up with bonuses. He has already admitted he will miss his target to cut the bank\u2019s cost-income ratio \u2013 a key measure of efficiency \u2013 by 2019 because of the vote for Brexit. He had wanted to hit 50% in two years\u2019 time, cutting the ratio from above 60%. Analysts now expect him to announce measures to take more costs out of the business. Speculation that jobs could be at risk have risen since the New Zealander indicated he needed to spell out ways to shed more costs from the bailed-out bank when the 2016 results are published on 24 February. The bank will also unveil its bonus pool for the loss-making year. The pot is reported to stand at \u00a3340m. In 2008, the year the bank was bailed out, the pool stood at \u00a31.4bn. Lloyds Banking Group, where the government stake has fallen to below 5%, is expected to have a larger bonus pool. When RBS failed its annual health check in November it said a cost-cutting programme, along with efforts to reduce the size of the business, would help bolster its financial strength. RBS would not comment before the results but analysts say new technology could be used to cut costs, and reduce the bank\u2019s headcount. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said he expected the bank to embark on a more aggressive cost-cutting programme. \u201cThe costs lever could be pulled harder ... [by] rolling out IT and making best use of digital channels ... to some extent [job cuts] come with that.\u201d McEwan has already taken out almost \u00a33bn of costs since taking over from Stephen Hester three years ago. He is tryingto reach a settlement with the US Department of Justice over a toxic bond mis-selling scandal(RBS said last month would take a \u00a33.1bn hit towards the bill). He also needs to spin out 315 branches to meet the terms imposed by the EU at the time of RBS\u2019s bailout. Analysts at Barclays said that cutting costs would remain a key focus across most of its retail and commercial businesses. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 February 2017. An earlier version said RBS shared among its bonus pool among staff, who also work in NatWest branches. RBS has scrapped sales bonuses for staff working at its retail banks.",

      "bodyText": "Low-paid cabin crew at British Airways have begun six days of industrial action, as the airline takes an increasingly hard line on strikes by employees. Members of the mixed fleet at Heathrow were set to walk out for most of this week from Sunday in a dispute over what the union, Unite, describes as poverty pay. But BA anticipates that many of the 2,900 crew involved will report for work, and has increased sanctions on strikers by threatening to dock two years of bonuses and removing all staff travel discounts for the next year from anyone joining industrial action. Crew in the mixed fleet earn a basic salary of \u00a312,000, but most earn a minimum of \u00a321,000, according to BA, after bonuses and flying time. Unite estimates the sanctions will cost strikers an average of \u00a3850 each. The airline said all passengers should reach their destinations, with cancellations limited to routes with multiple services, and crew and planes from other airlines including Titan and Thomson Airways hired to operate some services on BA\u2019s behalf. Two previous walkouts over five days led to 68 cancellations, according to BA. The Unite national officer, Oliver Richardson, said crew were showing courage in taking a stand against BA. \u201cRather than issuing threats and wasting huge amounts of cash on chartering aircraft to cover striking cabin crew, British Airways should start valuing staff who contribute massively to the billions of pounds in profits the airline generates.\u201d A BA spokeswoman said: \u201cOur pay offer for mixed fleet cabin crew is consistent with deals agreed with more than 90% of British Airways colleagues, including many Unite members. More than 9,000 cabin crew, represented by a different Unite branch, today voted overwhelmingly to accept the deal. \u201cThe offer also reflects pay awards given by other companies in the UK and will ensure that rewards for mixed fleet remain in line with those for cabin crew at our airline competitors.\u201d The mixed fleet, which all recruits now join, operates both long- and short-haul flights and was set up in 2010 during the cabin crew strikes on inferior terms and conditions to those of existing crew. The first phase of the latest strike will run until Tuesday 7 February, followed by a further three days from Thursday to Saturday 11 February.",

      "bodyText": "Put three people in a room who can\u2019t get on with each other. Condemn them to stay there for all eternity while they torture each other. Sit and watch as the gruesome story plays out. And what do you have? One answer is the 1944 existentialist play by Jean-Paul Sartre, Huis Clos. Another is the story of the neverending Greek debt crisis in which the three main characters are Alexis Tsipras, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Christine Lagarde. The plot is as follows. Greece has been through a terrible slump. Its economy has shrunk by more than a quarter, equivalent to the Great Depression in the US. Its financial position has become so parlous and its credit-rating so poor that it needs financial help to get by. It is currently on its third bailout. Up until now the money has been provided by Europe and the International Monetary Fund and it has come with strings attached. The money for Athens is disbursed in tranches and can be stopped if Greece fails to go ahead with promised reforms. Athens is balking at inflicting further pain on its population, which has led to the threat that no more assistance will be forthcoming. To complicate matters, the Europeans and the IMF have fallen out. Put simply, the Greeks say the conditions on them are too severe. They want debt relief but are resisting demands at pension reform and for \u201chire and fire\u201d labour market reform. The IMF agrees that Greece\u2019s debt burden is far too high and the stipulation that the country should run an underlying budget surplus of 3.5% a year is unrealistic. The Fund is warning that the debt could become \u201chighly explosive\u201d and will not financially back the latest rescue attempt without meaningful debt relief. But it is also insisting that Greece sticks to a reform programme that the Fund believes will improve growth prospects. Europe, for its part, is less hardline when it comes to Greece\u2019s reform programme and would be inclined to ignore any backsliding. But it thinks Greece should stick to its budget plan and is resistant to the idea of deeper debt relief. These are seemingly irreconcilable positions but unless they are reconciled Greece faces another period of turmoil. Politics is part of the problem. Tsipras plays one of the three lead parts in the play. Elected as a leftwing firebrand two years ago, Tsipras has had a rapid fall from grace. He caved in when pressure was put on him by the Europeans in the summer of 2015 and having run for office on an anti-austerity programme eventually agreed to even more draconian bailout terms than the previous centrist governments. For an increasing number of Greeks, Tsipras is no longer an iconoclast; he is just another man in a suit. With public support waning, Tsipras is once again hanging tough. He aroused the ire of the Europeans by giving a Christmas bonus to pensioners and free school meals to poverty-stricken families. Europe responded by suspending the limited debt relief it has previously granted. Tsipras says Greece has already done enough and will suffer no more. Europe is played by Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister. He too is facing political pressures. The German public thinks enough aid has already been given to Greece, a country it considers is not doing enough to help itself. Opposition to further debt relief is strong and a general election is looming. The third cast member is Lagarde, a former French finance minister and now managing director of the IMF. Under its own rules, the IMF is forbidden from putting money into a bailout if it thinks debt is unsustainable. There have been reports coming out of Washington that the Fund believes Greece\u2019s debt will rise to 275% of national income by 2060, which would undoubtedly put it into the \u201cunsustainable\u201d category. The latest act in this play takes place in Washington this week when the IMF\u2019s governing executive board discusses Greece. One factor complicating the issue is that time is running out to get matters sorted before the first in a series of European elections kicks off in in the Netherlands in March. A second is that the drama has a new character in the form of Donald Trump. There is little evidence that the US president gives a fig about whether Greece gets debt relief but he may have more than a walk-on role because the US is the biggest shareholder at the Fund and has the power to veto any decision it doesn\u2019t like. Trump has expressed strong \u2013 and not exactly positive \u2013 views about the European Union in general and Germany in particular. Causing consternation in Brussels, the new American president has said the EU has become a vehicle for German interests. His trade adviser Peter Navarro has accused Germany of being a currency manipulator, using a \u201dgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to run up a massive current account surplus. Navarro\u2019s specific criticism about currency manipulation is wide of the mark. Germany is part of the eurozone and doesn\u2019t always agree with the monetary policy decisions taken by the European Central Bank. The euro\u2019s recent weakness has nothing to do with a deliberate attempt by the Germans to reduce its value and everything to do with the fact that Europe has been loosening monetary policy at a time when the US has started to raise interest rates. But Navarro is right about Germany\u2019s current account surplus, which is running at almost 9% of GDP. This is not simply excessive but also in flagrant breach of EU rules. Berlin has refused entreaties from the IMF, the European commission and the G20 group of developed and developing nations to run down its surplus by importing more. That would benefit both powerful countries such as the US and the weaker bits of the eurozone such as Greece, but Germany has steadfastly refused to change its approach. The Europeans have said they would like Greece to be sorted at the meeting of finance ministers planned for 20 February. This could still happen if Tsipras decides that the only alternative to liberalising redundancy rules and pension reform would be to hold a \u201cwho runs Greece?\u201d election that he would almost certainly lose. The situation could also be resolved if Germany decided to support the IMF\u2019s call for much more generous debt relief for Greece, or if Berlin bowed to pressure from Trump and boosted domestic spending. But the ingredients are there for the neverending crisis to rumble on into the summer, when Greece will eventually run out of money and will not be able to pay its creditors. If there is no swift resolution, bond yields will rise and talk of Grexit will resurface. Huis Clos is known in English as No Exit. For Greece, if life becomes even more intolerable, there is one way out.",

      "bodyText": "On the face of it, the Bank of England\u2019s freshly minted forecast for this year looked rosy. A glance at the headline figure of 2% growth in the quarterly inflation report was much better than the Bank\u2019s gloomy forecast last year of 0.8%. A 2% growth rate will again put the UK in the top rank of developed world nations and have City analysts scratching their heads over the apparent strength of the UK economy. How, they ask, with uncertainty clouding the horizon, can the great British consumer be so confident about prospects and merrily carry on spending? These analysts should know better. Firstly, the 2% figure is the child of 2016, when growth was much better than expected following the referendum vote. That momentum has carried on into 2017, yielding a more optimistic forecast. Secondly, the idea Britain has entered a new benign period of growth ignores the prospects for higher wages \u2013 which are less bright than Threadneedle Street thinks. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has spent his entire time in office predicting a return to wage increases of 3.5% to 4%. At each quarterly inflation report he informs the nation\u2019s 31 million workers that the 2.5% average of the last few years will soon be history. He was at it again last week, though with a slightly more modest prediction of a 3.25% rise next year and the year after. But it is clear from his manner, and the tone of the Bank\u2019s report, that there is little conviction behind this forecast. Maybe that\u2019s because the monetary policy committee (MPC) he chairs appears to be even more split than usual on the subject of wages. The MPC has nine members who gather round the economic figures eight times a year and, rather like car mechanics, try to determine how fast the UK economy will go, given its ailing motor and worn-out bearings. Last year saw the exit of Martin Weale, to teach macroeconomics at King\u2019s College London, to be replaced by City banker Michael Saunders. In a surprising role reversal, it is the academic who has been more hawkish, believing rising numbers of vacancies and higher employment levels would soon spur a wave of sky-high wage demands. Weale even voted for interest rate rises in 2014, based on his fear that rampant wage demands would trigger an inflation shock. Saunders has taken a different view. In a speech last year, the former Citibank economist set out how the labour market had changed following the rise of self-employment, zero-hour contracts and the gig economy, meaning workers now had more limited powers to bid up their wages. The last few months have seen a sharp slowdown in employment growth and a rise in numbers of people who have stopped paid employment. The fact that thousands have quit the labour market and haven\u2019t signed on for jobseeker\u2019s allowance shows they see little profit in searching for another job. Business investment is another post-referendum victim. Those who believe it will improve point to the benefits for trade this year of an improving global economy, the steadying of Europe\u2019s position after successive crises and the potential for a Trump boom. A decline in the savings rate looks like it will propel spending for a little while longer, as will a rise in consumer credit. But unless the boost to wages takes effect, rising inflation will squeeze disposable incomes more than we\u2019ve seen in the last three years and bring the economy down with a bump. That means Britain needs a budget next month that puts a rocket under industry with extra support for investment and education. Without it, ailing coastal towns and left-behind places in the Midlands and north face the prospect, not of a bump, but of a slump that sets them back before Brexit has even taken effect. Snap needs to empower its shareholders too It is obligatory for social network pioneers to boast that their inventions \u201cempower people\u201d and, sure enough, that Facebookish phrase can be found in the IPO document filed last week by Snap Inc, the owner of Snapchat. But the commitment to empowerment and openness usually finds its limit when it comes to new shareholders\u2019 rights. Mark Zuckerberg kept control at Facebook by writing a rule that the shares held by insiders such as himself would have 10 times the voting power of the version offered to outsiders. That was arrogant and unfair but it has nothing on Snap\u2019s wheeze. The company says its newly issued shares will have no votes whatsoever. What\u2019s the problem, some might ask. Nobody is obliged to buy a slice of Snap and become a third-class investor in this loss-making company whose backers think it could be worth $25bn. Unfortunately, however, some people are obliged to buy. They are the index funds who are forced to own every component of a stock market index. Such a style of investing is popular because it is cheap. But why should index investors be deprived of even a small voice in the affairs of the company, like the election of directors? Snap\u2019s answer, like Facebook\u2019s, is that long-term success is most likely to be achieved if the founders are free to take risks. This point of view is not universally shared. US pension funds are protesting about Snap\u2019s governance outrage. So they should. Dual-voting structures are an abuse of the principle that equal voting rights go hand-in-hand with equal economic risk. In a sane world, companies like Snap would be excluded from major stock market indices, but that is not going to happen \u2013 or not soon. Instead, let\u2019s hope big US investors \u2013 like BlackRock and Vanguard \u2013 organise a boycott of this IPO in its current form. One share, one vote, is a principle worth defending. If demand for the non-voting stock evaporated, Snap chief Evan Spiegel would quickly understand that empowerment is meant to be more than a marketing slogan. Not a great connection Mike Ashley and Stephen Marks are not a match made in heaven. Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, is seen in the City as being taciturn, having poor standards of corporate governance, and overseeing a company that is underperforming. Marks, the founder of French Connection, is seen as being, well, exactly the same. It emerged last week that Sports Direct has bought an 11% stake in French Connection. This was welcomed by other shareholders, who have become frustrated with Marks\u2019s dominance within the company as chairman and chief executive. It has been a downward spiral for French Connection since interest in the revival of its FCUK branding died out a year ago. Quite how Ashley can help is a mystery. His skill is in piling it high and selling it cheap. In fact, Nike and Adidas have limited the products they supply to Sports Direct, fearing damage to their brands. The share purchase looks like another attempt by Ashley to make some money after similar investments in Debenhams, Tesco and House of Fraser. Given the problems facing Sports Direct, shareholders must wish he would focus on the day job.",

The MPC has nine members who gather round the economic figures eight times a year and, rather like car mechanics, try to determine how fast the UK economy will go, given its ailing motor and worn-out bearings.</p> <p>Last year saw the exit of Martin Weale, to teach macroeconomics at King\u2019s College London, to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/15/bank-of-england-appoints-michael-saunders-to-mpc\" title=\"\">replaced by City banker Michael Saunders</a>.</p> <p>In a surprising role reversal, it is the academic who has been more hawkish, believing rising numbers of vacancies and higher employment levels would soon spur a wave of sky-high wage demands. Weale even voted for interest rate rises in 2014, based on his fear that rampant wage demands would trigger an inflation shock.</p> <p>Saunders has taken a different view. In a speech last year, the former Citibank economist set out how the labour market had changed following the rise of self-employment, zero-hour contracts and the gig economy, meaning workers now had more limited powers to bid up their wages.</p> <p>The last few months have seen a sharp slowdown in employment growth and a rise in numbers of people who have stopped paid employment. The fact that thousands have quit the labour market and haven\u2019t signed on for jobseeker\u2019s allowance shows they see little profit in searching for another job.</p> <p>Business investment is another post-referendum victim. Those who believe it will improve point to the benefits for trade this year of an improving global economy, the steadying of Europe\u2019s position after successive crises and the potential for a Trump boom.</p> <p>A decline in the savings rate looks like it will propel spending for a little while longer, as will a rise in consumer credit. But unless the boost to wages takes effect, rising inflation will squeeze disposable incomes more than we\u2019ve seen in the last three years and bring the economy down with a bump.</p> <p>That means Britain needs a budget next month that puts a rocket under industry with extra support for investment and education. Without it, ailing coastal towns and left-behind places in the Midlands and north face the prospect, not of a bump, but of a slump that sets them back before Brexit has even taken effect.</p> <h2>Snap needs to empower its shareholders too</h2> <p>It is obligatory for social network pioneers to boast that their inventions \u201cempower people\u201d and, sure enough, that Facebookish phrase can be found in the IPO document filed last week by Snap Inc, the owner of Snapchat. But the commitment to empowerment and openness usually finds its limit when it comes to new shareholders\u2019 rights.</p> <p>Mark Zuckerberg kept control at Facebook by writing a rule that the shares held by insiders such as himself would have 10 times the voting power of the version offered to outsiders. That was arrogant and unfair but it has nothing on Snap\u2019s wheeze. The company says its newly issued shares will have no votes whatsoever.</p> <p>What\u2019s the problem, some might ask. Nobody is obliged to buy a slice of Snap and become a third-class investor in this loss-making company whose backers think it could be worth $25bn.</p> <p>Unfortunately, however, some people are obliged to buy. They are the index funds who are forced to own every component of a stock market index. Such a style of investing is popular because it is cheap. But why should index investors be deprived of even a small voice in the affairs of the company, like the election of directors?</p> <p>Snap\u2019s answer, like Facebook\u2019s, is that long-term success is most likely to be achieved if the founders are free to take risks. This point of view is not universally shared. US pension funds are protesting about Snap\u2019s governance outrage. So they should. Dual-voting structures are an abuse of the principle that equal voting rights go hand-in-hand with equal economic risk.</p> <p>In a sane world, companies like Snap would be excluded from major stock market indices, but that is not going to happen \u2013 or not soon. Instead, let\u2019s hope big US investors \u2013 like BlackRock and Vanguard \u2013 organise a boycott of this IPO in its current form. One share, one vote, is a principle worth defending. If demand for the non-voting stock evaporated, Snap chief Evan Spiegel would quickly understand that empowerment is meant to be more than a marketing slogan.</p> <h2>Not a great connection</h2> <p>Mike Ashley and Stephen Marks are not a match made in heaven. Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, is seen in the City as being taciturn, having poor standards of corporate governance, and overseeing a company that is underperforming. Marks, the founder of French Connection, is seen as being, well, exactly the same.</p> <p>It emerged last week that Sports Direct has bought an 11% stake in French Connection. This was welcomed by other shareholders, who have become frustrated with Marks\u2019s dominance within the company as chairman and chief executive.</p> <p>It has been a downward spiral for French Connection since interest in the revival of its FCUK branding died out a year ago. Quite how Ashley can help is a mystery. His skill is in piling it high and selling it cheap. In fact, Nike and Adidas have limited the products they supply to Sports Direct, fearing damage to their brands.</p> <p>The share purchase looks like another attempt by Ashley to make some money after similar investments in Debenhams, Tesco and House of Fraser. Given the problems facing Sports Direct, shareholders must wish he would focus on the day job.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So it\u2019s farewell to Sir Andrew Witty, the boss of pharma group GlaxoSmithKline and one of the few businesses knights who hasn\u2019t disgraced himself enough to have a campaign to strip him of his title. He\u2019s been on one of those long City goodbyes where he announces he\u2019s off but then stays for a lap of honour, and this week is the final time we will hear Glaxo\u2019s full-year results with Witty at the helm. It may be a decent time to wean himself off the attractions of the boardroom, too. Analysts at Berenberg muse: \u201cOutside of the HIV business, the rest of the pharmaceuticals business is not expected to deliver much growth. However, GSK does have a deep pipeline, albeit at relatively early stages of development.\u201d So what will Witty be remembered for? Well, in development circles it will surely be his lauded decision to slash GSK\u2019s prices in the poorest countries to no more than 25% of the UK price. Yet others may recollect different events, including the company getting whacked with a \u00a31.9bn fine in the US in 2012, after admitting bribing doctors \u2013 plus that memorable scandal shortly afterwards involving a GSK executive in Asia, a sex tape and favours given to Chinese doctors for using GSK products. Witty described the latter as \u201ca disappointment\u201d. Three-decade fortune-telling? Thanks, PwC There\u2019s an old City joke about a long-term investment merely being a short-term one that went wrong. It may be a bit of a stretch to adapt that crack to economic forecasting, but no matter: the dismal scientists are hardly in a position to complain about a touch of cavalier extrapolation. Anyway, last week saw the latest press conference at which the Bank of England\u2019s finest had to admit that Threadneedle Street had made a complete Horlicks of its economic predictions. (For what it\u2019s worth, UK growth is now expected to be 2% this year rather than 1.4%.) Undeterred, another bunch of economists at the accountancy firm PwC will this week publish an even more ambitious piece of economic crystal-ball gazing, when they publish research that attempts to predict the GDPs of the world\u2019s richest nations, er, 33 years from now. Their report, The World in 2050, could be one of three things: (a) an incredible triumph of hope over experience (confidence ranking high); (b) a fantastic piece of self-satire (less probable); or (c) a forlorn attempt to guess economic conditions that evening at 10 minutes to nine. Respect, integrity, and another day in court It\u2019s a controversial thought, but sometimes you do have to love Barclays \u2013 the lender that routinely tells gags that make itself the butt of the joke. It called itself the \u201cgo to\u201d bank \u2013 and then became the place that financial regulators would go to when they needed to trouser a large fine. It then memorably placed in the foyer of its headquarters a series of perspex blocks emblazoned with the words \u201crespect, integrity, service, excellence, stewardship\u201d \u2013 so, say what you want about them, but Barclays bankers do not want for a sense of irony. Anyway, if those ridiculous blocks aren\u2019t good enough for you, Barclays has others it can deploy. It was called to the high court on Friday because it had blocked access to documents relating to its legal battle with financier Amanda Staveley. (She\u2019s arguing the many millions she was paid for helping save the bank from a taxpayer bailout should have been more. They say she\u2019s talking nonsense.) Mr Justice Leggatt was called in to referee, and he took the view that Barclays was being \u201cwholly unreasonable and obstructive\u201d to make Staveley wait, when it was demanding other documents itself.
