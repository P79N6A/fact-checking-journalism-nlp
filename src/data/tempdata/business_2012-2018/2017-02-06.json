      "bodyText": "Uber drivers have told MPs they felt trapped in a job that forced them to work long hours just to cover costs including the purchase of their cars. The drivers told the Commons work and pensions select committee they were locked into their jobs after paying for expensive cars in order to get higher-paying customers. \u201cI made an investment in this business on the promise I would make good money,\u201d said David Dunn, who works for Uber in Glasgow. But he said he was forced to work more than 60 hours a week to make money after Uber\u2019s commission, insurance and other costs. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive for us and cheap for the public and those two don\u2019t match very well,\u201d Dunn said. Syed Khalil, who drives for Uber in London, said it was usual practice for drivers to work as long as 100 hours a week and claimed the company did not prevent drivers from logging on to do so. After paying about \u00a3500 a month on insurance and towards the purchase of his car, Khalil said he was still on such a low income that he needed to claim housing benefit. He said after a \u201choneymoon period\u201d when he was first employed, Uber had upped the amount of commission it was taking from each fare and had brought in lots more drivers so it was difficult to get enough work. Asked if they earn the equivalent of the national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour, Khalil and Dunn both said they did not after costs. Uber said on Monday that on average in the UK, drivers using its app make about \u00a316 an hour after Uber\u2019s fee and are logged in for about 27 hours a week. \u201cTens of thousands of people in the UK drive with Uber precisely because they want to be self-employed and their own boss. The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want,\u201d the company said in a statement. A former driver for delivery firm Hermes also told the committee he did not earn the equivalent of the national living wage and that drivers working there saw their self-employed status as a way for the company to save money. Marc Ramsden said: \u201cNo sick benefit, no holiday entitlement. If they sack you or stop your work or whatever there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. You are self-employed. You work one day they don\u2019t want you the next day, there\u2019s nowhere to go. It doesn\u2019t matter how long you have been there.\u201d Hermes told the Guardian: \u201cWe remain confident in the legitimacy of our self-employed courier model, which facilitates flexible working and earnings well in excess of the national minimum wage.\u201d The evidence to MPs comes amid a flurry of legal cases about the legal status of workers in the so-called gig economy. An employment tribunal in October found in favour of drivers for the Uber who argued they were not self-employed and should be classed as workers \u2013 meaning they are entitled to holiday pay and other benefits. A cycle courier working for the delivery firm CitySprint last month won the right to be classed as a worker. The inquiry was prompted by a Guardian investigation that revealed some Hermes couriers were paid rates equivalent to less than the minimum wage and others felt forced to work through illness and bereavement.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe last thing we want at this point in time is a relaxation of regulation,\u201d said Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank on Monday. He is right to worry. Relaxation of financial regulation is exactly what Donald Trump has in mind and the effects could be felt around the world. The US president seems to have accepted the half-baked idea that US banks are somehow so tied down by international regulations that they are obliged to hoard capital that could be used for lending to the American economy. \u201cI have so many people, friends of mine, who have nice businesses who can\u2019t borrow money,\u201d said Trump when he signed an executive order last week. There is little evidence that banks are refusing to lend to creditworthy borrowers in the US. In fact, the reverse seems more likely: credit availability in the US is strong, which is exactly what you\u2019d expect given the healthy returns being reported by US banks. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the new administration from trying to blame the Dodd-Frank regulations, the country\u2019s response to the financial crisis of 2008-09, for all manner of ills. Others have gone further. Republican congressman Patrick McHenry, vice-chairman of the financial services committee, last week suggested that the US should pull out of international bodies such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel committee that agrees standards for banks\u2019 capital and supervision. McHenry\u2019s argument is that US banks have been \u201cunfairly penalised\u201d by these \u201csecretive\u201d international forums. It\u2019s astonishing that a legislator from the country that inflicted Lehman Brothers on the world could be so critical of international efforts, with the US in the vanguard, to improve banking safety. But, even in its own terms, his argument is nonsense. US banks have been relative winners from reform. Their dominance of international financial markets is greater even than it was in 2008-09 and the explanation, in part, is surely that they were faster and more determined in raising the extra capital that the FSB and Basel committees requested. JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs et al got back to the races years ago. By contrast, too many big European banks \u2013 think Deutsche Bank and Italy\u2019s Unicredit \u2013 remain mired in crisis. The alarming part of McHenry-style complaints is that they are a direct attack on the one part of the international reform agenda that appeared to have been settled \u2013 bank capital rules. Work in other areas, covering financial derivatives and central counterparties, is less advanced but also critical. \u201cThe ongoing support of G20 leaders is required to implement reforms fully, consistently and promptly,\u201d FSB chair Mark Carney, our own governor of the Bank of England, reminded everyone last August. He was merely spelling out the facts. The FSB, formed in 2009, has few formal powers and instead relies on national regulations to implement standards all its members agree. Without the US, work would grind to a halt. Draghi\u2019s concern about timing is also powerful. The world is digesting eight years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing and the after-effects are unknown. But a combination of loose monetary policy and financial deregulation has been a disaster in the past, with 2008-09 being only the most recent spectacular example. No doubt there are parts of Dodd-Frank that would benefit from a minor tweak or two \u2013 even former congressman Barney Frank, one of the architects of the legislation, accepts that small US banks spend too much time complying with rules that weren\u2019t designed for them. But a major bonfire of capital rules and regulations, under a Trumpist \u201cAmerica first\u201d banner, would be an appalling prospect. Even many senior UK bankers are astonished by the apparent power of Wall Street\u2019s lobbying machine. Ryanair hits turbulence but stays on course Michael O\u2019Leary at Ryanair has a characteristically long list of complaints about current market conditions: the fall in sterling; Brexit-inspired uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future in the European open-skies system; over-capacity; charter rivals switching capacity from Turkey, Egypt and North Africa into Spain and Portugal; and various supposed German stitch-ups including a \u201cmonopoly\u201d at Berlin airport and a \u201cduopoly\u201d between Lufthansa and Air Berlin. A casual listener might think Ryanair was struggling to cope with so many dastardly developments. Not at all. Average fares fell by 17% to \u20ac33 in the third quarter but it is clear that Ryanair is inflicting more pain on the competition than it is suffering itself. It is the lowest cost operator by some distance, traffic was up 16% and full-year profit guidance was maintained at \u20ac1.30bn (\u00a31.1bn) to \u20ac1.35bn barring \u201cunforeseen security events.\u201d The share price fell by 4% but, unlike easyJet\u2019s, it has had an excellent run. Next year will bring \u20ac65m of savings from hedging on fuel prices and, one suspects, more gains in market share, especially in Germany where O\u2019Leary sounds like a man who will enjoy milking his allegation of cartel behaviour for all it is worth.",

But a combination of loose monetary policy and financial deregulation has been a disaster in the past, with 2008-09 being only the most recent spectacular example.</p> <p>No doubt there are parts of Dodd-Frank that would benefit from a minor tweak or two \u2013 even former congressman Barney Frank, one of the architects of the legislation, accepts that small US banks spend too much time complying with rules that weren\u2019t designed for them. But a major bonfire of capital rules and regulations, under a Trumpist \u201cAmerica first\u201d banner, would be an appalling prospect. Even many senior UK bankers are astonished by the apparent power of Wall Street\u2019s lobbying machine.</p> <h2>Ryanair hits turbulence but stays on course<br></h2> <p>Michael O\u2019Leary at Ryanair has a characteristically long list of complaints about current market conditions: the fall in sterling; Brexit-inspired uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future in the European open-skies system; over-capacity; charter rivals switching capacity from Turkey, Egypt and North Africa into Spain and Portugal; and various supposed German stitch-ups including a \u201cmonopoly\u201d at Berlin airport and a \u201cduopoly\u201d between Lufthansa and Air Berlin.</p> <p>A casual listener might think Ryanair was struggling to cope with so many dastardly developments. Not at all. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/ryanair-boss-michael-oleary-says-air-fares-fall-brexit\">Average fares fell</a> by 17% to \u20ac33 in the third quarter but it is clear that Ryanair is inflicting more pain on the competition than it is suffering itself. It is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/26/free-air-travel-from-low-fare-to-no-fare-ryanair\">lowest cost operator by some distance</a>, traffic was up 16% and full-year profit guidance was maintained at \u20ac1.30bn (\u00a31.1bn) to \u20ac1.35bn barring \u201cunforeseen security events.\u201d The share price fell by 4% but, unlike easyJet\u2019s, it has had an excellent run.</p> <p>Next year will bring \u20ac65m of savings from hedging on fuel prices and, one suspects, more gains in market share, especially in Germany where O\u2019Leary sounds like a man who will enjoy milking his allegation of cartel behaviour for all it is worth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Worries about the forthcoming elections in France and Germany helped send European markets lower, with ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s dovish comments on monetary policy dented the euro. The FTSE 100 outperformed, helped by the performance of precious metal miners as investors sought havens such as gold. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.22% or 16.15 points at 7172.15 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.22% to 11,509.84 as chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party fell into second place in a new poll France\u2019s Cac closed 0.98% lower at 4778.08 after Marine Le Pen launched her presidential campaign Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.21% to 18,693.65 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.11% at 9357.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.3% to 620.75 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 29 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u2019s time to shut for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. ECB president Mario Draghi used his latest appearance at the European parliament to maintain that, contrary to US claims, Germany and the central bank were not currency manipulators. He also said the idea of rowing back on financial regulation - another proposal from the Trump administration - was \u201cworrisome.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s take on it: Mario Draghi took the Trump administration to task, rebutting recent assertions that Germany is a currency manipulator and warning against the rollback of post-crisis financial regulation. Speaking at a hearing of European lawmakers in Brussels on Monday, the European Central Bank president responded to the charge by U.S. National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro and others that Germany is using a \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to gain an unfair trade advantage. \u201cThe ECB has not intervened in the foreign exchange markets since 2011,\u201d Draghi said, adding that Germany\u2019s trade surplus was the result of productivity gains. \u201cGermany has a significant bilateral trade surplus with the U.S., a material current account surplus, but it has not engaged in persistent one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market.\u201d In a question-and-answer session punctuated with lawmakers\u2019 concerns over the shifts in global economic and financial policy brought about by the change of government in Washington, Draghi also hit out at Trump\u2019s moves to begin dismantling the Dodd-Frank Act. Rolling back the compendium of financial rules intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis would be \u201cvery worrisome,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing we need at this point in time is a relaxation in regulation,\u201d Draghi said. \u201cFrankly I don\u2019t see any reason to relax the present regulatory stance which has produced a stronger banking and financial services industry than before the crisis.\u201d Commenting on Mario Draghi\u2019s appearance at the European parliament Howard Archer, chief European and UK cconomist at IHS Global Insight, said: Mario Draghi does not look like a man intending to change tack on monetary policy any time soon. He stuck like glue to the current ECB script.Indeed, the ECB seemingly retains an easing bias in its policy stance despite the recent jump in Eurozone inflation to 1.8% in January (and improved GDP growth of 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016). The only potential change of ECB monetary policy that Mr. Draghi mentioned in his testimony to the European parliament was that the size and/or duration of the bank\u2019s monthly asset purchase program could be increased if inflation developments become less favourable or monetary conditions less helpful to a sustainable achievement of the inflation target. There was no mention of the ECB reducing its asset purchase programme following December\u2019s adjustments.... Mr. Draghi\u2019s testimony fuels belief that the ECB will not be making any changes to its monetary policy for some time to come, following its December manoeuvres. The ECB clearly wants to see sustained, decisive evidence that underling inflationary pressures are picking up. And while the ECB is relatively upbeat on Eurozone growth prospects, it is very aware that there are appreciable uncertainties ahead, especially political ones (elections in Netherlands, France and Germany, the Brexit process starting and Trump\u2019s presidency in the US)... We suspect the ECB will end up extending its monthly asset purchases into 2018, but at a reducing rate. On Greece, Draghi said there had been many changes made in Greece, significant progress had been made. He added that the conclusion of the second review depended on a number of factors: for a positive assessment of debt sustainability, there should be a 3.5% primary surplus for a long period of time, that is one point of negotiation; the second point concerns the closing of fiscal gap for 2018; the third point concerns a certain set of structural reforms - labour market reform, judiciary, energy. I would add one, the non performing loan handling, to give renewed strength of the banking system. And with that Draghi\u2019s testimony is at an end. For inflation to be 2%, it will have to be higher in Germany (since it will be lower elsewhere). So what level would you like to see? Inflation differentials are not a new thing. Our objective is defined as the inflation rate for whole eurozone not individual countries. On Greece, Draghi said: Back with Draghi at the European Parliament. Question on when the ECB will exit its current monetary policy programme. Draghi effectively repeats previous answers, saying our objective is an inflation rate close but below 2% in medium term. We have to be convinced of a durable convergence to that objective. And it has to be for the whole of the eurozone, these are the questions we look at for changing monetary policy. And another on the Trump administration\u2019s comments on financial regulation. Draghi says we have to see what exactly US wants to do, but I repeat, the combination of easy money and financial deregulation was exactly the ground on whch the financial crisis developed. I don\u2019t see any reason to relax the present regulatory stance. Speaking of the euro, analysts at JP Morgan have said the single currency could fall by up to 10% if Marine Le Pen wins the French presidential election. On the euro\u2019s moves during Draghi\u2019s testimony, financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: The ECB chief reiterated that while the Eurozone\u2019s headline inflation may have picked up, the underlying CPI readings remains muted, meaning that for the time being the region is still in need of the stimulus being pumped into it every month. This was received poorly by the euro, which sank by half a percent against the dollar, giving up much of the growth it managed at the end of January; against the pound, however, the currency actually saw its losses shrink to just 0.1%, down from the 0.3% it had seen earlier in the session. Interestingly it wasn\u2019t just the euro perturbed by Draghi\u2019s statement; both the DAX and CAC fell around 1% as the day went on, though admittedly the German and, especially, French indices may also be troubled by the launch of Marine Le Pen\u2019s presidential campaign. Question about the future of clearing post-Brexit. Draghi says its too early to take a stance on the regulatory framework necessary [for clearing] when the UK leaves the EU. The US Federal Reserve has raised rates, should it be a model for others? What is the situation with relations with the Federal Reserve and the US (in the light of the letter from the new US administration to the Fed about putting America first)? Draghi says he cannot comment on other regulators but adds, if I was sent a similar letter, I would say we all benefit from having a central bank, and regulators, with the input of public consultations. This has produced extremely valuable results, with much more robust financial system. Given such interlinkage today we especially need this. But are the central banks, the supervisors etc the ones who have the final say. No, it is always the legislators who have ultimate say. In a question about the future of the euro and whether it is reversible, Draghi says it is not. Question referring to whether the euro is being manipulated, as Donald Trump\u2019s trade advisor last week accused Germany of doing. Draghi responds by quoting a US document: In 2016, the US treasury said Germany does not manipulate its currency, since it does not fit the criteria. Question from Netherlands: is ECB monetary policy data driven not date driven (similar to the Fed)? Draghi says we need an inflation rate which satisfies the four conditions needed. Suppose we withdraw our support, what will happen. Will inflation drop or continue its convergence to target. If second, we can start withdrawing support. Is cyber security high enough up on agenda? We definitely need to step up our efforts, says Draghi. In all sectors we\u2019ve been severely underprepared. A quantum leap is needed in all sectors, including in financial sector. And there is no set benchmark, since progress of cyber crime is always moving. We have to work hard to develop safer and better standards. What should be Europe\u2019s strategy in light of US comments last week (ie, the proposal from Donald Trump to row back Dodd-Frank banking regulations). Draghi says again, it is still early to say. But looking at the historical experience, what were the main reasons for the financial crisis? ....A combination of too expansive monetary policy and a dismantling of financial regulations. Now we have expansive monetary policy, so the last thing we need at this point is a relaxation of regulations. The fact we are not seeing significant financial stability risks is the reward of the actions that regulators and legislators have been undertaking since the financial crisis erupted. Financial intermediaries are now stronger, so the idea of repeating the situation in place before crisis is very worrisome. And after a little applause, the questions. There are signs of global trade moving from liberalism to protectionism in some important countries, how do you see these risks? Draghi says it is too early to say, we would look with worry about potential announcements about protectionist measures. The EU was created on the foundation of free trade, on the four freedoms. We will judge when we see what has been announced. Draghi says he sees no signs of asset bubbles: Currently, we do not see compelling evidence at the euro area level of stretched asset valuations. Both corporate bond spreads and equity prices appear to be broadly in line with fundamentals. Similarly, real estate price growth remains moderate in the area as a whole, although significant cross-country heterogeneity is observable. This assessment is corroborated by the fact that credit growth is still modest, which suggests that asset price developments are not accompanied by increasing leverage. Nevertheless, the longer the accommodative measures need to be kept in place, the greater the risks of unwarranted side effects on the financial system become. For instance, asset prices may increase to levels that are not in line with fundamentals because investors might be tempted to take on more risk during times of low yields. Such developments are best addressed by enacting appropriate macro and micro prudential policies. Following the release of Draghi\u2019s comments, the euro has hit a one week low against the dollar. Draghi noted that the ECB was prepared to increase its asset purchase programme if necessary in terms of both size and duration. Draghi concludes by repeating his call for political reforms: As I argued last week in Ljubljana, and as the crisis has shown, the benefits of the single currency can only be fully reaped if we have policies and institutions at national and European level that ensure it works for everyone. In the run-up to the launch of the euro, there was a strong commitment to advancing along the path of institutional and economic convergence. The crisis showed that this commitment cannot be relaxed. In fact, it remains fully relevant today as we seek to strengthen EMU and the EU in the face of current uncertainties and in preparation for future challenges. The euro area\u2019s resilience in 2016 despite a range of negative shocks shows that we are on the right track. It also suggests that reforms at national and European level are paying off in terms of economic growth. As the economic situation improves, and even though challenges in other policy realms have understandably been the recent focus of our attention, we should not stop our efforts to make EMU more resilient and prosperous. We can and should address the remaining, well-identified fragilities at national and European level. On the latter point, I look forward to the continued support of the European Parliament in the second half of this legislative term. There have been signs of inflationary pressures in the eurozone, prompting speculation that the ECB might have to rein in its stimulus measures. But Draghi said: Our December decisions strike a balance between our growing confidence that the euro area\u2019s economic prospects are firming up, and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 the lack of a clear sign of sustained convergence of inflation rates towards the desired level. On the one hand, the evidence suggests that the acute deflation risks have disappeared and that inflation is set to pick up over the coming years. And contrary to a widespread perception, euro area economic conditions have also been steadily improving. Euro area GDP growth has been solid in every quarter since the beginning of 2015, averaging 1.9 percent in annualised terms. Compared to 2013, there are 3.5 million fewer unemployed in the euro area, a decrease by more than 18%. And in the last quarter, the recovery has been broadening across sectors and across countries. Indeed, the dispersion of value added growth across euro area countries and sectors has declined sharply and stands close to its lowest level since the introduction of the euro. But support from our monetary policy measures is still needed if inflation rates are to converge towards our objective with sufficient confidence and in a sustained manner. The pickup in headline inflation in December and in January largely reflects sizeable upward base effects and recent increases in energy prices. So far underlying inflation pressures remain very subdued and are expected to pick up only gradually as we go on. This lack of momentum in underlying inflation reflects largely weak domestic cost pressures. The still significant degree of labour market slack and weak productivity developments are weighing down on wage growth. As I have argued before, our monetary policy strategy prescribes that we should not react to individual data points and short-lived increases in inflation. Our relevant policy horizon is the medium term. We therefore continue to look through changes in HICP {headline] inflation if we believe they do not durably affect the medium-term outlook for price stability. He added: Looking ahead, risks to the euro area outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. Our current monetary policy stance foresees that, if the inflation outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council is prepared to increase the asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. As European Bank president Mario Draghi appears before the European parliament, his speech has been released here. Time for a quick recap. More than half of UK business leaders have reported that Brexit is already hurting their businesses, even before article 50 is triggered. IPSOS Mori found that 58% of top executives at Britain\u2019s largest companies have experienced a negative impact, with most 65% expecting things to be worse in five years. Ben Page, CEO of Ipsos MORI, says: Unfortunately, it looks like business in this country is already feeling the pain of the economic upheaval of leaving the EU, with 58% of Captains of Industry stating that their business has suffered negatively since the referendum. According to respondents there is no sign that this is likely to ease this year, with two thirds saying they thought their business situation would get worse in the next 12 months. More encouragingly, almost all business leaders are confident they\u2019ll adapt to Brexit. Here are the key slides: In a Monday morning blizzard of Brexit-related news, we\u2019ve also learned that Many companies are planning to raise their prices this year Analysts at Hermes believe a good deal can\u2019t be achieved in two years Consultancy firm Mercer fears Britain faces a shortage of skilled labour Labour MP Hilary Benn has warned that government attacks on foreign workers are hurting Britain\u2019s image Brits abroad will be hit by mobile roaming charges after Brexit Ryanair\u2019s profits are being hit by the weak pound But UK car sales kept climbing in January And in Europe: German factory orders jumped at the fastest rate since mid-2014 in December. Economists say the figures suggest Europe\u2019s largest economy began 2017 in good shape. But French government bonds are weakening, as the presidential election approaches. Firms are right to worry that the Brexit vote will hurt their businesses over the next couple of years, argues Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, a wealth manager. He says: Though it is a little disheartening, the reality is that Brexit is already having a filtered down effect on the UK market. While we are yet to receive clarity on the long term effect, businesses appear worried about the changing landscape ahead primarily on concerns over access to skilled labour and the single market. The weakening pound has benefited British exports and the stocks of those companies where exports are significant part of earnings. However, the other side of this is costlier imports and therefore higher inflationary pressures, businesses and consumers will have a tough time finding common ground until further clarity emerges on the market dynamics.\u201d The possibility of a Brexit or Trump-style shock in France\u2019s presidential elections this spring are reverberating through the financial markets today. Investors are selling French government debt, and seeking safety in German bonds instead. The moves aren\u2019t massive -- French 10-year borrowing costs are up from 1.08% to 1.12%, while the German equivalent is down from 0.41% to 0.38%. But that widens the gap between Berlin and Paris\u2019s borrowing costs to the widest level in almost four years, and means investors see French debt as riskier. The moves come after Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Front party, launched her presidential bid with promises to leave the eurozone, tax imports, raise benefits and enforce a \u201cFrench first\u201d policy on jobs and social housing. The polls currently suggest Le Pen might win the first round of voting, before being defeated by in the head-to-head second round (most likely by centrist Emmanuel Macron, who also held a rally over the weekend). Back to Hilary Benn\u2019s Brexit discussion....where the Labour MP criticised government ministers for undermining the UK\u2019s standing through their divisive rhetoric. My colleague Rajeev Syal reports that Benn singled out comments on overseas students and doctors: The former shadow foreign secretary said the Conservative party\u2019s annual conference was an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d because senior politicians portrayed an image of the UK that was insular and aggressive towards foreigners. Indicating that such language could influence negotiations with the EU, Benn said making pronouncements about what the government would achieve from its discussions would harden attitudes towards the UK among European politicians and officials. Speaking at the Institute for Government\u2019s headquarters in central London, Benn said: \u201cWhen I reflect upon a certain week in Birmingham in the autumn, where people of a particular political party gathered and made speeches, I thought that was a disastrous week for Britain\u2019s reputation in the world. Absolutely disastrous.\u201d More here: I mentioned earlier that many UK business leaders see securing a free trade deal with Europe as a top priority. The best option might be a deal that gives Britain tariff-free access to the customs union, but not full membership, argues Neil Williams, chief economist at Hermes Investment Management. He writes: Turkey and Canada have enjoyed customs-union access with the EU without membership. Canada\u2019s in 2016 came after seven years of negotiation. And, needing sign-off by all EU states, it was stalled by the Belgian region of Wallonia! Chancellor Hammond\u2019s threat that without access, much lower UK corporate tax rates will be needed to maintain FDI and competitiveness (which risks a European \u2018chase to the bottom\u2019) looks an early stick to achieving similar privileges. But getting such a deal within two years -- the window created by Article 50 -- will be very tough, Williams adds: First, the deal when struck will need Parliamentary approval, and then be subject to a \u2018phasing in\u2019 period (Mr Hammond has suggested two years) to allow firms, consumers and officials to adjust to the new arrangements. A second independence referendum in pro-EU Scotland, though not precluding Brexit, could also provide an extra hurdle to completing it before the General Election scheduled for May 2020. Second, the UK is relying on a cooperative sign-off by its 27 EU peers. The only real precedent we have is Greenland\u2019s exit in 1985. This was a \u2018soft\u2019 exit, but it took three years. We, larger and 44 years entwined in the EU, will need longer. We\u2019re opening the \u2018trapdoor\u2019 in a highly-charged political year. Voters facing national elections in Germany, France, The Netherlands and probably Italy may want to approach it as protest to six years of euro-zone austerity. In the \u2018peripheral\u2019 economies, reform fatigue and populist parties are building. Therefore, incumbents may be reluctant to condone an easy UK exit that puts its economy ahead of their own. UK MPs will get down to the nitty-gritty of Brexit today, as they debate the government\u2019s bill allowing ministers to trigger article 50. Our political correspondent Peter Walker explains: This is the period when amendments are debated, and there are many dozens of them tabled. Today is more focused on amendments connected to process, with the more fundamental ones \u2013 notably on the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and whether parliament gets a final say over the eventual Brexit deal \u2013 coming tomorrow. But today should see signs of whether any Conservative MPs are mustering a rebellion on either of those issues, especially now the government has indicated it is not minded to back down unilaterally. Peter is tracking all the action in Politics Live: Meanwhile, the government is taking a tough line on any attempts to derail Brexit.... The 5.2% surge in German factory orders in December shows that Europe\u2019s economy entered this year in good spirits, argues Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services: This underlines that domestic demand in Germany and the Eurozone as a whole looks considerably more robust than many forecasters are assuming, and with such solid momentum going into Q1, the consensus 1.4% y/y forecast for 2017 German GDP looks to be under-clubbed, 1.7%/1.8% looks more likely and 2.0% is a distinct possibility. That would be good news for UK exporters too, as Germany is the second largest export market for British firms (after the US). The slide in the pound since the Brexit vote has been a blow to Britain\u2019s beer industry. Craft brewers, for example, are worried that imported hops and malt will simply be too expensive, while some big brewers have been hiking prices. Now Camra, which represents beer lovers, is pushing the government to cut the duty on a pint; 1p may not make a big difference, though. More here: A leaked report has shown that Britons won\u2019t benefit from a new clampdown on mobile phone roaming costs within the EU once Brexit has been implemented. Our Brussels bureau chief Daniel Boffey explains: British tourists will have to pay mobile phone operators\u2019 roaming charges when they travel in the EU after Brexit, according to the European parliament committee that helped pioneer the legislation. Despite a ban on the practice, holidaymakers and business travellers will face hefty bills if they use their phone within the EU from 2019, unless the British government strikes a favourable deal with the union. Last week the European commission announced that, from June this year, \u201cconsumers will be able to call, send SMS or surf on their mobile at the same price they pay at home\u201d when travelling in the EU. The move, which has been years in the making, would significantly reduce travel costs. However, a leaked analysis on UK withdrawal from the EU confirmed this would not apply to Britons post-Brexit.... More here: Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs parliament\u2019s Brexit select committee, has been discussing Britain\u2019s exit for the EU at an event organised by the Institute for Government. Sophie Gaston of Demos has been tweeting: Lucy Campbell of the IFG is also there: Britain\u2019s auto industry didn\u2019t suffer any obvious Brexit impact last month, but a slowdown may be coming. Car sales jumped 2.9% year-on-year in January to 174,564, the best performance in any January since 2005. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also reports that electric car sales were particularly strong during the month. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, says: After record growth in 2016, some cooling is anticipated over the coming months, but provided interest rates remain low and the economy stable, the market is in a good position to withstand its short-term challenges.\u201d Economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight fears a difficult year for the industry -- with the cost of imported cars likely to rise. Consumers seem certain to find their purchasing power being increasingly diluted during 2017. Furthermore, a likely weakening economy and more uncertain outlook may well make businesses more circumspect in their car purchases \u2013 perhaps taking longer to replace fleets. Meanwhile, the sharp weakening of the pound makes it more difficult for car dealers to offer attractive deals on imported cars \u2013 with the result that some car manufacturers have raised prices and more increases seem inevitable during 2017 . Michael O\u2019Leary was one of the loudest business voices backing the Remain campaign (in vain) last year. And today, the boss of Ryanair has blamed the impact of the Brexit vote for a 17% tumble in average fares in the last quarter of 2016. O\u2019Leary said the \u201csharp decline in Sterling following the Brexit vote\u201d had eaten into profit margins, eroding the benefits of a 16% rise in customers. The airline is also fears disruption as the Brexit negotiations unfold, telling the City that: While it appears that we are heading for a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, there is still significant uncertainty in relation to what exactly this will entail. This uncertainty will continue to represent a challenge for our business for the remainder of the 2017 financial year, and 2018. We expect Sterling to remain volatile for some time and we may see a slowdown in economic growth in both the UK and Europe as we move closer to Brexit. Here\u2019s some reaction to this morning\u2019s survey showing that more than half UK firms are suffering from the Brexit vote, from Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit: And here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: More than half of British business leaders believe the vote to leave the European Union has had a negative impact on their companies but most firms are confident they can survive the change, according to a survey on Monday. Britain\u2019s economy has performed more strongly than expected since the Brexit vote last June, but an Ipsos Mori survey of more than 100 of the country\u2019s top 500 firms found that 58 percent felt the vote to leave had taken a toll. Management consultancy firm Bain and Company has put out an interesting report on Brexit today. It predicts that Britain\u2019s pharmaceutical and aerospace sectors could get a \u00a3200m boost from leaving the EU, as WTO rules protect them from tariffs. That would allow them to get the benefit of the weak pound, without also suffering new export penalties. However... Bain also warns that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d could cut the profits of UK manufacturers by 30%. Bain partner Michael Garstka is on Bloomberg TV now, explaining that Britain\u2019s exit from the EU will cause significant disruption. Supply chains between Britain, Europe and the US have been built around a certain set of rules for the last 40 years; that is now \u2018up in the air\u2019, he says. Brexit, whether hard or soft, will have a significant effect on supply chain decisions, Garstka warns. UK firms could struggle to find enough skilled workers after Brexit, according to a report from consultancy firm Mercer. It has found that Britain\u2019s working population will grow slowly from 2020, or even contract, due to the ageing population and the prospect of fewer migrants entering the UK. Mercer has modelled several scenarios, depending whether the UK cuts net migration to 100,000 per year, 40,000 year, or an actual an outflow of EU-born and Non-EU born workers caused by \u201can unwelcome social environment in the UK\u201d. The base case scenario is that net migration will fall from 335,000 per year to 185,000 from 2020, as the government forecasts. Even that would create a growing divide between the population total (in green, above) and the number of workers (in blue): Gary Simmons, partner at Mercer, says businesses need to wake up to looming labour shortages now -- by doing more to help people into work, and considering whether some tasks can be automated. \u201cBoth the government and businesses have a Herculean task ahead of them in determining how we respond to the changing shape of our society. We hope that our modelling is a wake-up call to the business community. There is a tremendous opportunity for far-sighted organisations to begin determining and implementing clear plans in response. If they do not act now, they could potentially find they do not have their share of the people and skills they need in future. The solution lies in analysis, automation and accessibility. Companies should analyse and understand the make-up of their workforce. They should look to increase retention of current staff and be accessible: employing sectors of UK society that might be under-represented in the workforce - women, disabled, the long-term unemployed. They should also be investing heavily in automation where possible as well as improving employee productivity, through training and skills.\u201d There\u2019s no sign of Brexit damage in the latest manufacturing figures from Germany. German factory orders, released this morning, have smashed forecasts by growing by a whopping 5.2% in December. That\u2019s the best result since July 2014, and crushing the 0.5% expected by economists. The economy ministry reports that domestic orders jumped by 6.7% during the month, while foreign orders rallied by 3.9%. Demand from eurozone countries was particularly robust, soaring by 10%. However..November\u2019s figures have been revised down to a 3.6% fall, from 2.5% previously. The Brexit vote is also going to drive up prices in the shops this year. A majority of firms surveyed by the British Chambers of Commerce are planning to hike prices in 2017, due to the slump in the pound last year. The survey also punctures the idea that weaker sterling is a pure boost to exporters; instead, many are also having to pay higher prices for raw materials from abroad. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), explains: \u201cThe depreciation of Sterling in recent months has been the main tangible impact that firms have had to grapple with since the EU referendum vote. \u201cOur research shows that the falling pound has been a double-edged sword for many UK businesses. Nearly as many exporters say the low pound is damaging them as benefiting them. For firms that import, it\u2019s now more expensive, and companies may find themselves locked into contracts with suppliers and unable to be responsive to currency fluctuations. More than half of Britain\u2019s biggest companies are now suffering from the public vote to leave the European Union last June. A new survey of business leaders found that 58% said the Brexit vote was already having a negative impact on their firm. Just 11% said it had helped business. And stormclouds also appear to be gathering over the economy, with two-third of corporate chiefs leaders predicting that their business situation will be more negative once Britain leaves the EU. In the long term.... 32% predict a positive impact on their business in five years\u2019 time and 45% expected to feel a negative impact. The survey was conducted by Ipsos Mori, who polled 114 chairmen, CEOs, managing directors and finance chiefs from Britain\u2019s largest 500 firms Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos Mori, says that the survey shows that businesses are already feeling the pain of the economic upheaval of leaving the EU,. Page added: According to respondents there is no sign that this is likely to ease this year, with two thirds saying they thought their business situation would get worse in the next 12 months. The survey also found that business leaders are particularly worried about losing access to skilled workers. Asked what Britain\u2019s priorities should be in the Brexit negotiations, the business chiefs said: Movement/access of skilled labour (54%), securing free trade/single market (47%), passporting rights (16%), controlled/clarity on immigration (13%), continuing being a trading partner with Europe (9%), tariff agreement (9%) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The new week kicks off with lots of economic data, two important UK select committee hearings, and the prospect of more drama in Europe. On the data front, we\u2019re finding out how German manufacturers and UK car sellers fared last month, and getting a gauge on investor confidence across the region: 07:00 GMT German Factory Orders 9am GMT: New UK Car Registrations 9:30am GMT: Euro-Zone Sentix Investor Confidence Over in parliament, MPs on the Work and Pensions committee are holding a hearing into Britain\u2019s Gig economy, from 3.45pm. They\u2019ll hear from seven workers, including a Hermes driver who lost work after seeking time off to take his terminally ill wife to hospital. Committee chairman Frank Field tells us the seven workers are all \u201cincredibly brave\u201d, given some still work for the likes of Uber, Deliveroo and Hermes. Down the corridor, the Transport select committee will be investigating problems with Vauxhall Zafira cars, which have a nasty habit of overheating and catching fire. According to the Daily Telegraph, Vauxhall executives will face a grilling (not literally, we trust) over the problems. On the eurozone front, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi testifying in Brussels from 2pm GMT. He\u2019s likely to face calls from German MEPs to slow his stimulus programme, now that inflation is finally headint upwards. We\u2019ll also have an eye on the eurozone, where Greece\u2019s bailout talks are still deadlocked and France is rattling towards its presidential elections.",

There was no mention of the ECB reducing its asset purchase programme following December\u2019s adjustments....</p> <p>Mr. Draghi\u2019s testimony fuels belief that the ECB will not be making any changes to its monetary policy for some time to come, following its December manoeuvres. The ECB clearly wants to see sustained, decisive evidence that underling inflationary pressures are picking up.

The crisis showed that this commitment cannot be relaxed. In fact, it remains fully relevant today as we seek to strengthen EMU and the EU in the face of current uncertainties and in preparation for future challenges.</p> <p>The euro area\u2019s resilience in 2016 despite a range of negative shocks shows that we are on the right track. It also suggests that reforms at national and European level are paying off in terms of economic growth.</p> <p>As the economic situation improves, and even though challenges in other policy realms have understandably been the recent focus of our attention, we should not stop our efforts to make EMU more resilient and prosperous. We can and should address the remaining, well-identified fragilities at national and European level.

But Draghi said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our December decisions strike a balance between our growing confidence that the euro area\u2019s economic prospects are firming up, and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 the lack of a clear sign of sustained convergence of inflation rates towards the desired level. </p> <p>On the one hand, the evidence suggests that the acute deflation risks have disappeared and that inflation is set to pick up over the coming years. And contrary to a widespread perception, euro area economic conditions have also been steadily improving. Euro area GDP growth has been solid in every quarter since the beginning of 2015, averaging 1.9 percent in annualised terms. Compared to 2013, there are 3.5 million fewer unemployed in the euro area, a decrease by more than 18%. And in the last quarter, the recovery has been broadening across sectors and across countries. Indeed, the dispersion of value added growth across euro area countries and sectors has declined sharply and stands close to its lowest level since the introduction of the euro.</p> <p>But support from our monetary policy measures is still needed if inflation rates are to converge towards our objective with sufficient confidence and in a sustained manner. The pickup in headline inflation in December and in January largely reflects sizeable upward base effects and recent increases in energy prices. So far underlying inflation pressures remain very subdued and are expected to pick up only gradually as we go on. This lack of momentum in underlying inflation reflects largely weak domestic cost pressures. The still significant degree of labour market slack and weak productivity developments are weighing down on wage growth. </p> <p>As I have argued before, our monetary policy strategy prescribes that we should not react to individual data points and short-lived increases in inflation. Our relevant policy horizon is the medium term. We therefore continue to look through changes in HICP {headline] inflation if we believe they do not durably affect the medium-term outlook for price stability.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking ahead, risks to the euro area outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. Our current monetary policy stance foresees that, if the inflation outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council is prepared to increase the asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-06T14:20:44.475Z\">at 2.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-589881ace4b06d9b044c0ffd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-06T14:01:50.391Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As European Bank president Mario Draghi appears before the European parliament, <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2017/html/sp170206.en.html\">his speech has been released here.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58987c6be4b0127a514cd2ed\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-06T13:57:00.839Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a quick recap.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/feb/06/british-bosses-brexit-german-factory-orders-draghi-gig-economy-live?page=with:block-58982adee4b0e481c6e4b167#block-58982adee4b0e481c6e4b167\">More than half of UK business leaders have reported that Brexit is already hurting their businesses, even before article 50 is triggered</a>.</strong></p> <p>IPSOS Mori found that 58% of top executives at Britain\u2019s largest companies have experienced a negative impact, with most 65% expecting things to be worse in five years. </p> <p><strong>Ben Page, CEO of Ipsos MORI, says</strong>: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unfortunately, it looks like business in this country is already feeling the pain of the economic upheaval of leaving the EU, with 58% of Captains of Industry stating that their business has suffered negatively since the referendum.

Canada\u2019s in 2016 came after seven years of negotiation. And, needing sign-off by all EU states, it was stalled by the Belgian region of Wallonia!</p> <p>Chancellor Hammond\u2019s threat that without access, much lower UK corporate tax rates will be needed to maintain FDI and competitiveness (which risks a European \u2018chase to the bottom\u2019) looks an early stick to achieving similar privileges.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But getting such a deal within two years -- the window created by Article 50 -- will be very tough, Williams adds:</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> First, the deal when struck will need Parliamentary approval, and then be subject to a \u2018phasing in\u2019 period (Mr Hammond has suggested two years) to allow firms, consumers and officials to adjust to the new arrangements. A second independence referendum in pro-EU Scotland, though not precluding Brexit, could also provide an extra hurdle to completing it before the General Election scheduled for May 2020.</p> <p>Second, the UK is relying on a cooperative sign-off by its 27 EU peers. The only real precedent we have is Greenland\u2019s exit in 1985. This was a \u2018soft\u2019 exit, but it took three years. We, larger and 44 years entwined in the EU, will need longer.</p> <p>We\u2019re opening the \u2018trapdoor\u2019 in a highly-charged political year. Voters facing national elections in Germany, France, The Netherlands and probably Italy may want to approach it as protest to six years of euro-zone austerity. In the \u2018peripheral\u2019 economies, reform fatigue and populist parties are building. Therefore, incumbents may be reluctant to condone an easy UK exit that puts its economy ahead of their own.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58985fa4e4b0e664e3b3933c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-06T11:39:53.636Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>UK MPs will get down to the nitty-gritty of Brexit today, as they debate the government\u2019s bill allowing ministers to trigger article 50.</strong></p> <p>Our political correspondent Peter Walker explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is the period when amendments are debated, and there are many dozens of them tabled.

      "bodyText": "The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) is stepping up its push to keep the price of a pint down for millions of UK pub-goers, calling on the Treasury to reduce beer duty by 1p a pint in next month\u2019s budget. With inflation expected to rise in the next year, Camra said the cut would help to cap the price of beer, helping consumers\u2019 cash to go further while boosting the pubs and brewing sector. Beer drinkers are already being hit in the pocket, with Heineken and Carlsberg last month becoming the latest brewers to raise prices, following MolsonCoors \u2013 maker of the UK\u2019s most popular beer, Carling \u2013 and ABInBev. The weak pound has also driven up the cost of imported raw materials such as hops, which could threaten Britain\u2019s craft beer industry. Beer duty campaigners have had some success in recent years with three consecutive penny cuts to duty and a subsequent freeze, but Camra points out that the UK is still paying among the highest rates of beer duty in Europe at 52.2p on a pint. This compares to other big brewing nations such as Germany and Spain, who enjoy their beer at under 5p of duty on a pint. The brewing and pubs sector now supports nearly 900,000 UK jobs, and contributes \u00a323.6bn to the economy every year. Camra is also calling for a reduction of up to \u00a35,000 in business rates for pubs in England. \u201cIt is clear that previous cuts to beer duty have benefited beer drinkers and supported significant growth in the brewing industry,\u201d said Colin Valentine, Camra\u2019s national chairman. \u201cHowever, we as a nation are still paying a notable amount \u2013 especially in comparison with our European neighbours. At the same time, pubs are confronted with higher taxation and costs.\u201d The Wine and Spirits Association is calling on the chancellor to cut wine and spirits duty by 2% as another way to help pubs. Wine and spirit sales in UK pubs accounted for 36% of the takings and were worth \u00a35.7bn last year, it said. Miles Beale, WSTA\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWhile the government has focused on beer cuts previously to support British pubs, this is only a job half done.

      "bodyText": "The government of Bermuda has hit back at British efforts to end offshore financial secrecy, claiming the UK itself is a \u201ctax haven\u201d. Speaking ahead of a meeting on Wednesday between Theresa May and the leaders of Britain\u2019s overseas territories, Bermuda\u2019s deputy premier and finance minister, Bob Richards, pushed back against proposed legislation that would create public registers naming the owners of offshore companies. Richards said the UK should get its own house in order before making demands from its dependencies. \u201cThe UK is a tax haven,\u201d he said, citing non-dom laws that allow foreign nationals to live in Britain without paying tax on overseas income. \u201cYou have more billionaires resident in London than any place on earth. They are not here for the weather, they are here for the tax climate. We have a double standard going on here. \u201cWe have a much more transparent, much cleaner system than the countries that promulgate these rules in the first place. The popular notion that somehow there is something nefarious going on in a small island that is relatively successful is false.\u201d From April 2017, however, non-doms will lose some of their advantages and foreign nationals will no longer be able to enjoy tax breaks indefinitely in the UK. Those resident in the UK for 15 out of the previous 20 years will be liable for inheritance, capital gains and income tax on their worldwide assets. A cross-party group of 88 MPs, led by the tax campaigner Margaret Hodge, is backing an amendment to the government\u2019s criminal finances bill that would force British territories to follow the UK in making public their company ownership registers by 2020. \u201cThere is a thing in this world called privacy and at least in my island privacy still exists,\u201d added Richards. \u201cThere is no public right to know anybody\u2019s private business.\u201d The Panama Papers exposed how thousands of offshore companies have been used to help hide the proceeds of fraud, political corruption and tax evasion. Unlike most tax havens, Bermuda does keep a central government record of who owns its offshore entities. This information is available to other governments on request, but not to the general public. Richards told the Guardian he would resist calls, first made by David Cameron in 2013, to open up the register. \u201cThe register in Bermuda is there to protect the government\u2019s reputation ... It is not the public\u2019s business. We are not here to tell you who is doing business in Bermuda,\u201d he said. Bermuda has just been named chair of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories Association and is leading the push against Hodge\u2019s proposed amendment. Richards said there was no obligation for Bermuda to lift the veil of secrecy when the US states of Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada continued to keep ownership information from the public. \u201cWe cannot move to a standard that our major trading partner has not adopted,\u201d said Richards. \u201cWe may very well lose business. Would you take that chance?\u201d Bermuda is among the most prosperous of Britain\u2019s 14 offshore territories. Along with London and New York, it is one of the top three centres for the insurance industry globally. But the financial crisis led to an exodus of the best-trained workers and a reduction in financial services income from which Bermuda is only just beginning to recover. While Bermudian companies did not feature heavily in the Panama Papers, they have played a role in other financial scandals including Bernie Madoff\u2019s notorious Ponzi scheme and more recently in fraudulent public offerings on the Singapore stock exchange. The mid-Atlantic nation is a major centre of tax avoidance, with Google and other multinationals attracted by a zero corporation tax rate. Oxfam found that US corporations reported $80bn (\u00a364bn) in profits in Bermuda in 2012 \u2013 more than their combined reported profits in Japan, China, Germany and France. \u201cPeople are pressuring overseas territories because they feel we are defenceless, in some way easy pickings,\u201d said Richards. \u201cThey are moving the goalposts on us almost every three weeks.\u201d The Bermudian premier, Michael Dunkley, has joined Richards in London this week for a series of briefings with UK ministers, with Brexit top of the agenda. Richards said his government was in listening mode but, if pushed, it would not hesitate to protect its interests. He said last year he \u201cwould not hesitate to go for independence\u201d if his country were threatened by Brexit. Bermuda\u2019s last push for independence was in a 1995 referendum. Richards said: \u201cAt the moment our interests are aligned but if that changes then we will have to think of ourselves. We must protect Bermuda\u2019s interests. This amendment being proposed [by Hodge] is not in the interests of Bermuda.\u201d",

They are not here for the weather, they are here for the tax climate. We have a double standard going on here.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a much more transparent, much cleaner system than the countries that promulgate these rules in the first place. The popular notion that somehow there is something nefarious going on in a small island that is relatively successful is false.\u201d</p> <p>From April 2017, however, non-doms will lose some of their advantages and foreign nationals will no longer be able to enjoy tax breaks indefinitely in the UK. Those resident in the UK for 15 out of the previous 20 years will be liable for inheritance, capital gains and income tax on their worldwide assets.</p> <p>A cross-party group of 88 MPs, led by the tax campaigner Margaret Hodge, is backing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/20/uk-mps-tax-havens-criminal-finances-bill-overseas-territories\">amendment to the government\u2019s criminal finances bill</a> that would force British territories to follow the UK in making public their company ownership registers by 2020.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere is a thing in this world called privacy and at least in my island privacy still exists,\u201d added Richards. \u201cThere is no public right to know anybody\u2019s private business.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a> exposed how thousands of offshore companies have been used to help hide the proceeds of fraud, political corruption and tax evasion. </p> <p>Unlike most tax havens, Bermuda does keep a central government record of who owns its offshore entities. This information is available to other governments on request, but not to the general public.</p> <p>Richards told the Guardian he would resist calls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/14/tax-secrecy-central-register-cameron\">first made by David Cameron in 2013</a>, to open up the register. \u201cThe register in Bermuda is there to protect the government\u2019s reputation ... It is not the public\u2019s business. We are not here to tell you who is doing business in Bermuda,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bermuda has just been named chair of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories Association and is leading the push against Hodge\u2019s proposed amendment. Richards said there was no obligation for Bermuda to lift the veil of secrecy when the US states of Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada continued to keep ownership information from the public.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot move to a standard that our major trading partner has not adopted,\u201d said Richards. \u201cWe may very well lose business. Would you take that chance?\u201d</p> <p>Bermuda is among the most prosperous of Britain\u2019s 14 offshore territories. Along with London and New York, it is one of the top three centres for the insurance industry globally. But the financial crisis led to an exodus of the best-trained workers and a reduction in financial services income from which Bermuda is only just beginning to recover.</p> <p>While Bermudian companies did not feature heavily in the Panama Papers, they have played a role in other financial scandals including <a href=\"http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20110706/BUSINESS02/707069936\">Bernie Madoff\u2019s notorious Ponzi scheme</a> and more recently in fraudulent public offerings on the Singapore stock exchange.</p> <p>The mid-Atlantic nation is a major centre of tax avoidance, with Google and other multinationals attracted by a zero corporation tax rate. Oxfam found that US corporations reported $80bn (\u00a364bn) in profits in Bermuda in 2012 \u2013 more than their combined reported profits in Japan, China, Germany and France.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are pressuring overseas territories because they feel we are defenceless, in some way easy pickings,\u201d said Richards. \u201cThey are moving the goalposts on us almost every three weeks.\u201d</p> <p>The Bermudian premier, Michael Dunkley, has joined Richards in London this week for a series of briefings with UK ministers, with Brexit top of the agenda. Richards said his government was in listening mode but, if pushed, it would not hesitate to protect its interests.<br></p> <p>He said last year he \u201c<a href=\"http://www.royalgazette.com/politics/article/20160916/independence-idea-revived-amid-brexit\">would not hesitate to go for independence</a>\u201d if his country were threatened by Brexit. Bermuda\u2019s last push for independence was in a 1995 referendum. </p> <p>Richards said: \u201cAt the moment our interests are aligned but if that changes then we will have to think of ourselves. We must protect Bermuda\u2019s interests. This amendment being proposed [by Hodge] is not in the interests of Bermuda.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Despite claims that Britain is on the brink of blackouts and amid forecasts of a looming cold snap, all is calm inside the room where a score of engineers and analysts work to ensure the lights stay on. Below a huge, illuminated map of the UK\u2019s electricity network and myriad displays, a gentle hubbub of conversation washes over the desks of the control centre in Berkshire, the chief site of three run by National Grid. \u201cIt should look like a swan paddling across the pond,\u201d says Nick Easton, one of the grid\u2019s power system managers who sit at the back of the windowless room with six screens of their own, overseeing three teams around the clock in eight- and 12-hour shifts. The day is a relatively easy one for the team. For every 1C the temperature falls, electricity demand goes up 0.5 gigawatts, and on this evening \u2013 in the first week of February \u2013 demand is expected to peak at 48GW compared with a typical 52GW on a winter evening. However, the calm on show belies the huge changes in the energy market that serves the grid. The way that the UK maintains its electricity reserves is evolving, with a new system for subsidising backup power being brought in next winter. Last Friday \u00a3378m worth of contracts were awarded for the capacity market, most of which will be paid to old gas, coal and biomass power stations that will be ready to provide power at short notice if there is a surge in demand or dip in supply. But the sources of the UK\u2019s power are changing fast, from a small number of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants to a greater reliance on renewable providers such as windfarms, backed up by gas power plants and undersea power lines connected to continental Europe and Ireland. The grid says the transformation does not make its job harder \u2013 just different. \u201cThe summer of 2015 was the last time we ran the grid in the summer the way we had done for the last 70 years, with large generation churning out our everyday power,\u201d says Duncan Burt, who manages the operation of the grid from day to day. \u201cThe growth in solar and the continuing reduction in demand meant 2016 really was fundamentally different, the first year of the new power grid.\u201d Solar power has grown from a tiny presence before 2010 to more than 11GW out of the UK\u2019s total capacity of about 80GW, driven by subsidies for householders and the construction of large solar farms. Burt says the intermittent and sometimes unpredictable power from all those solar panels has not increased the cost of fine-tuning electricity supply and demand. The grid spends \u00a3850m each year to keep the two in balance, paying power generators to fire up in the face of an unexpected event or a large power user such as a factory to switch off. An increasing amount of that power is also coming from windfarms, in particular from Scotland. Two transmission lines running alongside the M6 and M1 have been upgraded in recent years to export wind power to England, and capacity will leap again when a new undersea cable carrying more Scottish renewable energy comes ashore on the Wirral, Merseyside, later this year. \u201cIt\u2019s huge, a tripling in the capability in the network\u2019s capacity [from 10 years ago], and that\u2019s because of the enormous amount of wind in Scotland,\u201d says Burt. The other big swing last year was away from coal, as three major power stations closed in the face of lower gas prices and a carbon tax. For the first time, there were several days without coal power, and gas and solar took up much of the slack. \u201cThe grid was fine. Gas or coal doesn\u2019t necessarily feel any different, but it\u2019s a big moment, a watermark. We\u2019re really comfortable about coal going,\u201d says Burt, referring to the UK government\u2019s pledge to phase out coal by 2025. What does worry him is the threat of Britain\u2019s ageing network of nuclear power stations closing down from the middle of next decade as it reaches the end of its life. \u201cThat\u2019s very much something we\u2019ll watch closely. If nuclear went for safety [inspection] reasons, we would get weeks rather than years of notice,\u201d he said, pointing to the nuclear outages in France this winter because of safety checks. The changing way the UK generates electricity is throwing up some unusual market quirks too. On weekends last year when electricity demand was low and solar generated a lot of power, wholesale electricity prices went negative. Under this scenario, instead of power station owners selling their electricity to the energy companies who supply UK homes and businesses, the generators actually paid the suppliers to take their power. It is not an an attractive situation for generators. \u201cWe think that if solar keeps growing, by 2020 [negative prices] will be a very regular occurrence in the summer and we want the market to be ready to balance that,\u201d says Burt. His answer to that balancing challenge is to persuade big industrial and commercial energy users \u2013 water companies, supermarkets, the NHS \u2013 to shift their power consumption to the times of day when the sun is shining, the wind is blowing and demand is lower. \u201cWhat you really want to do is consume power when the renewables are there, and you need to price to signal that.,\u201d he says. But while Burt must juggle those longer-term concerns, the control centre has more pressing problems right now: balancing the supply and demand of electricity, second by second. The grid has not called on any of its emergency 3.5GW of capacity this winter, which has seen temperatures on a par with the long-term average. But the Met Office expects south-easterly winds later this week to bring drier, colder weather, with the possibility of snow on the east coast. Half of the UK\u2019s electricity interconnector \u2013 or sub-sea cable \u2013 to France is also out of action and being repaired following storm damage last year, adding extra pressure. Easton, who is not on shift and looks more relaxed than the control centre manager, admits the job carries a lot of responsibility. \u201cSometimes you stop and think: \u2018I\u2019ve got the nation\u2019s transmission systems in my hand\u2019 \u2013 and the implications of a blackout are quite profound. But you don\u2019t necessarily stop to think about that. You have a role to do, and you\u2019re surrounded by knowledgeable people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The number of new cars registered in the UK hit a 12-year high in January, with electric vehicles taking a record share of the market, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The industry body had warned of a slowdown in the motor trade in 2017 because of the impact of the weak pound, but there was no sign of deceleration in the first monthly numbers of the year. Drivers registered 174,564 cars in January, up 2.9% on last year, to reach the highest monthly level since 2005, the trade body said. Alternative fuel vehicles, mainly electric cars, such as the Nissan Leaf, increased by a fifth to reach a record 4.2% share of new vehicle registrations, beating a previous high of 3.6% in November last year. Petrol cars were also up strongly, gaining 8.9%, with diesel car registrations down 4.3%, continuing the fall seen in December, amid suggestions of higher taxes to curb emissions. The SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said he expected some \u201ccooling\u201d in the car market as the year progressed. However, he adopted a more upbeat tone than at the end of 2016, when he warned of a \u201cchallenging\u201d 2017, with the weakness of the pound likely to increase the cost of imported parts, pushing up car prices. He said January\u2019s numbers were \u201cbuoyed by a great range of new models which are safer and cleaner than ever before\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see alternatively fuelled vehicles benefiting from this positive growth, reaching a record market share. \u201cAfter record growth in 2016, some cooling is anticipated over the coming months, but provided interest rates remain low and the economy stable, the market is in a good position to withstand its short-term challenges.\u201d The Ford Fiesta remains the UK\u2019s most popular car, followed by the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus.",

    "webTitle": "Shell begins huge task of decommissioning Brent oil rigs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell will this week unveil a plan to dismantle four enormous oil rigs in the North Sea, kicking off a vast and controversial decommissioning project. The Brent field rigs were built in the 1970s and produced around a tenth of the UK\u2019s North Sea oil. But three of the four \u2013 Alpha, Bravo and Delta \u2013 have now shut down, and this summer the company will embark on a multibillion-pound eight- to 10-year project to remove the vast drilling and accommodation structures. The plan being submitted to the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has been a decade in the making, as the group has consulted community groups, academics, fishermen and environmentalists in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the Brent Spar debacle. When the company proposed sinking the Spar oil storage buoy in 1995, it prompted protests by Greenpeace, petrol boycotts in Germany and a falling share price. Shell was eventually forced to back down and find a more environmentally-friendly plan. Duncan Manning, who spent 19 years with the Royal Marines and is now one of the team charged by Shell with overseeing the decommissioning of Brent, is confident the group won\u2019t repeat the mistakes of the past. \u201cI think there have been a number of lessons from Brent Spar \u2013 lessons we have learned, and also the [regulatory] environment has changed,\u201d said Manning, Shell\u2019s business opportunity manager for Brent. Once Shell is past the 60-day consultation beginning this week, it will switch to an engineering task Manning sums up as \u201clarge, complex and challenging\u201d. Brent, which started pumping in 1976, is not the first field to be decommissioned in the North Sea, but it is one of the biggest. And the remote nature of the rigs \u2013 more than 100 miles north of Shetland in deep, hostile waters \u2013 together with the unusual concrete construction of three of the rigs pose a unique challenge. Shell\u2019s answer is a vast ship currently moored in Rotterdam, which will attempt to lift the entire 24,000-tonne topside of the Delta platform \u2013 in one go, possibly as soon as May. It will be the heaviest ever single lift, and only the second for the Pioneering Spirit vessel after it removed a topside half the weight off Norway last year. To prepare the rig for lift-off around 1,500 people were working last year to reinforce the Delta platform, welding steel to strengthen it, so the topside did not disintegrate when lifted. \u201cThat has been a change in the industry. In the past platforms have been removed a small piece at a time,\u201d said Manning. Removing platforms in a single lift was a \u201clarge swing\u201d, he added. The platform will then be taken by ship to a former shipyard in Hartlepool, where most of the steel will be recycled and sold off. But under Shell\u2019s plan, plenty of Brent\u2019s manmade structures will stay in the North Sea. The company is applying for an exemption from international rules that require everything is removed. Since the outcry over Brent Spar, the Ospar treaty has banned the dumping of old installations, or leaving them wholly or partly in place. Shell\u2019s argument is that Brent platforms were built in haste and, unlike later rigs, were never designed to be removed. It insists the safest and most environmentally-friendly option is to leave the 300,000-tonne concrete bases beneath three of the platforms, with the concrete legs left to poke out of the water as a navigational aid for fishermen. Oil will also be left in huge storage cells, entombed in metre-thick concrete, as will oil mixed up with broken material on the seabed from when the wells were drilled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Shell and [joint partner] Exxon making up science to suit our purposes,\u201d said Manning, pointing to independent research commissioned by the company. While green groups agree with the principle that some elements would be best untouched, they disagree on just how much Shell plans to leave behind and believe the oil company is watching costs. \u201cThe oil within the cells and some of the drill cuttings are above limits that internationally agreed standards recommend. Those standards say they should be removed in order to prevent damage to the environment,\u201d said Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland. \u201cThe main thing preventing this from being done in this particular case is the cost. Shell should do the right thing and remove these potentially polluting materials.\u201d If the company is granted an exemption \u2013 as expected \u2013 it won\u2019t be the first but it would become one of a select group. Just five exemptions have been issued by Ospar for 124 installations decommissioned since the rules came into force in 1998. \u201cThis is a test case, so we want to see that expression of international law enforced, and not at the first point of challenge for there to be backtracking,\u201d said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace. Parr said the group would make a judgment on the environmental impact once the plan is published, and refused to rule out taking direct action, as the group did when it occupied Brent Spar for weeks. Some people, however, think Shell should leave the entire rig structures to be swallowed up by the waters. Ed Davey, the former Liberal Democrat energy minister, argued last month that the platforms should just be left, to one day become a reef for marine life, on environmental and cost grounds. That won\u2019t be Shell\u2019s approach for Brent. But it is a view voiced at the company\u2019s senior levels, perhaps with an eye both on saving money and any scrutiny of the 70% tax relief the company will enjoy against the cost of decommissioning. \u201cAround Brent Spar, the offshore disposal was acknowledged even by Greenpeace, albeit in small print after they had taken quite violent action against Shell assets, as the best environmental outcome,\u201d said Simon Henry, the group\u2019s outgoing chief financial officer. \u201cI do think, this is for the industry as a whole, there needs to be a sensible discussion of cost. Because at the end of the day the government is supporting a lot of the cost through the tax regime, and that means voters are paying for it. And it is not a time to be spending money unnecessarily, just because of the principle.\u201d Manning defended the tax relief arrangements as \u201cnothing unusual\u201d and pointed out the field had contributed \u00a320bn in tax to the Treasury over its lifetime. \u201cIt is tax relief, not a subsidy,\u201d he said. Taxpayers may think differently. Oil companies get between 40% and 75% tax relief on their clean-up costs, and analysts Wood Mackenzie estimated that will land the UK government with a \u00a324bn bill, or 45% of the total future decommissioning cost for the North Sea. Shell estimates the cost of dismantling Brent alone will be in single digit billions of pounds, a big hit even for a company that reported $3.5bn in profit last year. But critics think the tax regime is unjust. \u201cThe massive tax breaks being offered to the oil and gas industry to clean up its toxic legacy amount to yet another subsidy to the fossil fuel industry,\u201d said Banks. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly a big ask for the companies to pack up and clean up when they\u2019re finished,\u201d said Greg Muttitt, a campaigner at Oil Change International. \u201cWhy should the taxpayer carry the tab for most of the decommissioning costs, when oil revenues have gone disproportionately to the companies?\u201d Brent in numbers Four platforms.
