And one rather confusing one:</p> <p>First the important bits:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Cyprus will introduce \"more progressivity\" to the levy, compared to the original, widely criticised plan.</strong></p> <p>What does that mean? Presumably that savers with smaller deposits will be forced to pay less. This fits with the rumours that the rate for accounts under \u20ac100k would be cut to 3% from 6.75%.</p> <p>A sign that the public anger has been heard.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Cyprus still needs to raise \u20ac5.8bn from its savers.</strong></p> <p>The eurogroup is clear that it won't provide more than \u20ac10bn. Cyprus needs around \u20ac17bn. Savers must still plug the gap -- unless, of course, Russia was to offer additional help? (but right now, it's not even clear if Russia will ease the terms of its loan to Cyprus).</p> <p>So that means higher charges on the largest depositors.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The Eurogroup won't admit it made a mistake</strong></p> <p>Dijsselbloen, who only took the leadership of the Eurogroup in February, was clear that the bailout was the only way to avoid chaos in Cyprus.</p> <p>****</p> <p>And the confusing point?<strong> The statement that the Eurogroup \"reaffirms the importance of fully guaranteeing deposits below \u20ac100,000\".</strong></p> <p>I think that means \"<strong>...in the event of a bank collapse</strong>\" and is designed to reassure people who think that deposit insurance is badly discredited by the Cyprus debacle. </p> <p>But there is also speculation tonight that it could mean blanket protection for Cypriot savers with less than \u20ac100k. <em>I think we'll only know the truth tomorrow....</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51477ca095cb3037f5c82a52\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-18T20:44:16.280Z\">8.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Read the official statement from the Eurogroup</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-89655891-af04-412d-a7ce-61c1e108e53e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/18/1363639341536/d3e79799-2e9d-4dd1-84f6-a9c2eff96829-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dutch Finance Minister and Eurogroup Chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dutch Finance Minister and Eurogroup Chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Photograph: ERIC VIDAL/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here's the official statement from Eurogroup president, <strong>Jeroen Dijsselbloem</strong>, following tonight's teleconference call.</p> <h2>Statement by the Eurogroup President on Cyprus</h2> <p>The Eurogroup held a teleconference this evening to take stock of the situation in Cyprus.</p> <p>I recall that the political agreement reached on 16 March on the cornerstones of the adjustment programme and the financing envelope for Cyprus reflects the consensus reached by the Cypriot government with the Eurogroup. The implementation of the reform measures included in the draft programme is the best guarantee for a more prosperous future for Cyprus and its citizens, through a viable financial sector, sound public finances and sustainable economic growth.</p> <p>I reiterate that the stability levy on deposits is a one-off measure. This measure will - together with the international financial support - be used to restore the viability of the Cypriot banking system and hence, safeguard financial stability in Cyprus. In the absence of this measure, Cyprus would have faced scenarios that would have left deposit holders significantly worse off.</p> <p>The Eurogroup continues to be of the view that small depositors should be treated differently from large depositors and reaffirms the importance of fully guaranteeing deposits below \u20ac100,000. The Cypriot authorities will introduce more progressivity in the one-off levy compared to what was agreed on 16 March, provided that it continues yielding the targeted reduction of the financing envelope and, hence, not impact the overall amount of financial assistance up to \u20ac10bn.</p> <p>The Eurogroup takes note of the authorities' decision to declare a temporary bank holiday in Cyprus on 19-20 March 2013 to safeguard the stability of the financial sector, and urges a swift decision by the Cypriot authorities and parliament to rapidly implement the agreed measures.</p> <p>The euro area Member States stand ready to assist Cyprus in its reform efforts on the basis of the agreed adjustment programme.</p> <p>---------------</p> <p><em><strong>Reaction and analysis to follow!</strong></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-514777ce95cb3037f5c82a50\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-18T20:23:42.455Z\">8.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurogroup gives Cyprus 'leeway' over savings tax</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking: Eurozone finance ministers have ended their video conference call on the Cyprus crisis.</strong></p> <p>And the big news is that the Eurogroup have apparently agreed to give Cyprus more flexibility on its bank levy.

Russian influence is Cyprus is considerable; and statements from President Putin indicate that he would be extremely hostile to such an approach. There is some possibility that Russia would respond to a larger haircut by refusing to roll its existing \u20ac2.5bn loan to Cyprus; meaning that this option would still leave a significant shortfall. In such a scenario, either the haircut on uninsured deposits would need to be around 21.8%, or further Troika funding would need to be found.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Option B could be to go straight to requesting additional support from the Troika.</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Eurogroup is holding a further conference call this evening, which is likely to investigate the near-term implications of the Cypriot agreement. In our view, a significant amendment of the terms of the deals (which calls for \u20ac5.8bn to be found from deposit haircuts) is unlikely.<br> Politically, it could be very difficult for Germany in particular to make any kind of U-turn (especially since part of the purpose of the whole exercise has been to demonstrate the Government's hard-line to domestic voters). The Eurogroup could propose looking at different parts of the capital structure, but this could risk compounding the existing error by creating additional uncertainties. Finance Ministers may look for other<br> forms of funding, but their task looks difficult (it is possible that Cyprus will revisit the idea of securitising future gas revenues, which we were surprised was not utilised in the initial proposal).</p> </blockquote> <h2>Option C could be to tweak the current pain distribution so that less of the burden falls on the insureds.</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Government has already proposed staggering the burden so that depositors with less than ?100,000 pay 3%,those with less than \u20ac500,000 pay 10% and those with more than \u20ac500,000 pay 15%. To our mind, this looks like shifting deckchairs.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in the long term...

To raise funds, Cyprus should impose a special levy on deposits, taxing accounts of less than \u20ac100,000 at 3%, those up to \u20ac500,000 at 5% and those above at 7%. Such a \"solidarity levy \"\u2014the brainchild of Thomas Wieser, an Austrian who chairs technical discussion among euro-zone finance officials, and Mr. Asmussen\u2014 could avoid a straight \"haircut\" on deposits, which they feared could be too destabilizing for Cyprus and the rest of Europe. The tax would be applied to all Cypriot banks, not just the two in deep trouble.</p> <p>But Ms. Lagarde had something else in mind. The IMF chief presented a much more radical plan, in which deposits above \u20ac100,000 in Laiki and Bank of Cyprus would have been cut by between 30% and 40%. The owners of senior bonds in the two banks would also have faced losses\u2014a step that was ultimately rejected. That plan would have limited the international bailout to \u20ac10 billion and raise some \u20ac7.5 billion from depositors.</p> </blockquote> <p>Anastasiades fought for a smaller levy, but was bounced into accepting the plan by the threat of the ECB pulling the plug on Cyprus's banking sector.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51470abbb5799f28f712f8db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-18T12:38:19.216Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The calmer mood in the financial markets reflects optimism that Cyprus will manage to reshape its savings levy in a way that is less painful for small shareholders.</p> <p>Veteran economist <strong>Anatole Kaletsky</strong> is certainly hopeful:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Kaletsky/status/313624462568353793\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>New delay to Cyprus vote good news.

      "bodyText": "What. A. Day. Here's a brief closing summary of the main events in Cyprus today (check out tonight's news story for a more polished read). \u2022 Cyprus's banks have been shut until Thursday as the confusion created by its controversial bailout swirled. The move is meant to avoid a run on the country's bank accounts until the bailout deal, and its controversial levy on bank accounts, has been approved. See 3.25pm for details \u2022 The Cyprus parliament is due to vote on the deal on Tuesday afternoon. The vote was scheduled for today, but was cancelled after it became clear that the government could not win. The vote will be closely watched -- as the eurozone crisis could erupt if MPs reject the deal. \u2022 The terms of the savings levy are being reworked, after widespread public anger and concern that the decision to tax savers undermined support in the Eurozone banking sector. Late tonight the Eurogroup announced that Cyprus would change the terms to make them more progressive. (the statement is here) (reaction here) There are reports tonight that savers with less than \u20ac20,000 in the bank could be spared. \u2022 Protesters voiced their unhappiness over the bailout terms outside the Cyprus parliament. Hundreds marched carrying banners attacking the government, Germany, and the banking sector. We have a report from the scene, and also photos of the demo. \u2022 Russia is also concerned - with president Vladimir Putin blasting the savings raid as unfair, unprofessional and dangerous (see here) \u2022 World stock markets fell, but became less concerned about Cyprus as the day went on. There were heavy losses in Asia, but smaller falls in Europe (closing prices) and on Wall Street (where the Dow fell by 60 points) \u2022 In the UK, MPs lined up to criticise the bailout plan. The government confirmed it will compensate armed forces who are hit by the savings tax, and is suspending pension payments to pensioners with Cypriot bank accounts until the situation is clearer (see here onwards) Thanks for reading, and commenting. I'll be back tomorrow (or later today, if you're reading in Cyprus!). Goodnight! Late news from Cyprus: State TV are reporting that the government is planning to spare savers with less than \u20ac20,000 in the bank from the deposit levy: And finally -- our full news story about the events in Cyprus has just launched: Cyprus closes banks to stop run amid fury over bailout We've also got the inside story on how Cyprus's president suffered a disastrous debut at the EU summit last weekend, from Ian Traynor and Helena Smith. The centre-right Cypriot leader was given a 12-hour stay of execution until the early hours of Saturday on what, highly conveniently, was a Cyprus bank holiday weekend. He went home with a \u20ac10bn eurobailout and a eurozone taboo-busting obligation to expropriate every saver in every bank in Cyprus. Cypriot participants describe the experience of those two days with rancour as chastening and brutal, an unforgettably unhappy debut on the European stage. \"It was clear blackmail. We were told either you accept this or on Tuesday your banks will not open,\" said George Sklavos, a senior Cypriot finance ministry official present at the meetings. By the time he got home to Nicosia on Saturday, Anastasiades was preparing to go on national television to announce the worst moment in his country since the Turks invaded in 1974 and forced a partition that continues to this day. Cyprus bailout: how Nicos walked straight into a German sucker punch My colleague Angelique Chrisafis met with some of the protesters in Nicosia today, and reports: Behind the banners reading \"Hang the banksters, hands off our savings\", \"Who is next Spain or Italy?\" or simply \"Fuck Europe\", Andreas Constantinou stood outside the Cyprus parliament, with a grim look on his face. \"It's just unfair,\" he said. He had cut short his family lunch to mark the first Monday of Orthodox lent, a bank holiday when Cypriots usually descend on parks to picnic, fly kites and celebrate. Instead, as Cypriot politicians held emergency talks before Tuesday's parliamentary vote on the controversial levy of up to 10% on all bank deposits, hundreds joined the street protest against the seizure of a chunk of everyone's savings to satisfy an EU rescue plan. \"This is going to affect everyone, savings or not, because no matter how the politicians tweak it, the damage has been done. Trust in our banks has evaporated, people will take out their money, investors will flee, the economy will be hugely hit and things can only get worse,\" said Constantinou, 29. Here's the full story: Cyprus bailout: 'Trust in our banks has evaporated. It can only get worse' Here's some early reaction to the Eurogroup's statement on Cyprus (see 8.44pm), which rather sums up the confusion I alluded to before. There appear to be three key points from the eurogroup's new statement on Cyprus tonight (see previous post). And one rather confusing one: First the important bits: \u2022 Cyprus will introduce \"more progressivity\" to the levy, compared to the original, widely criticised plan. What does that mean? Presumably that savers with smaller deposits will be forced to pay less. This fits with the rumours that the rate for accounts under \u20ac100k would be cut to 3% from 6.75%. A sign that the public anger has been heard. \u2022 Cyprus still needs to raise \u20ac5.8bn from its savers. The eurogroup is clear that it won't provide more than \u20ac10bn. Cyprus needs around \u20ac17bn. Savers must still plug the gap -- unless, of course, Russia was to offer additional help? (but right now, it's not even clear if Russia will ease the terms of its loan to Cyprus). So that means higher charges on the largest depositors. \u2022 The Eurogroup won't admit it made a mistake Dijsselbloen, who only took the leadership of the Eurogroup in February, was clear that the bailout was the only way to avoid chaos in Cyprus. **** And the confusing point? The statement that the Eurogroup \"reaffirms the importance of fully guaranteeing deposits below \u20ac100,000\". I think that means \"...in the event of a bank collapse\" and is designed to reassure people who think that deposit insurance is badly discredited by the Cyprus debacle. But there is also speculation tonight that it could mean blanket protection for Cypriot savers with less than \u20ac100k. I think we'll only know the truth tomorrow.... Here's the official statement from Eurogroup president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, following tonight's teleconference call. Statement by the Eurogroup President on Cyprus The Eurogroup held a teleconference this evening to take stock of the situation in Cyprus. I recall that the political agreement reached on 16 March on the cornerstones of the adjustment programme and the financing envelope for Cyprus reflects the consensus reached by the Cypriot government with the Eurogroup. The implementation of the reform measures included in the draft programme is the best guarantee for a more prosperous future for Cyprus and its citizens, through a viable financial sector, sound public finances and sustainable economic growth. I reiterate that the stability levy on deposits is a one-off measure. This measure will - together with the international financial support - be used to restore the viability of the Cypriot banking system and hence, safeguard financial stability in Cyprus. In the absence of this measure, Cyprus would have faced scenarios that would have left deposit holders significantly worse off. The Eurogroup continues to be of the view that small depositors should be treated differently from large depositors and reaffirms the importance of fully guaranteeing deposits below \u20ac100,000. The Cypriot authorities will introduce more progressivity in the one-off levy compared to what was agreed on 16 March, provided that it continues yielding the targeted reduction of the financing envelope and, hence, not impact the overall amount of financial assistance up to \u20ac10bn. The Eurogroup takes note of the authorities' decision to declare a temporary bank holiday in Cyprus on 19-20 March 2013 to safeguard the stability of the financial sector, and urges a swift decision by the Cypriot authorities and parliament to rapidly implement the agreed measures. The euro area Member States stand ready to assist Cyprus in its reform efforts on the basis of the agreed adjustment programme. --------------- Reaction and analysis to follow! Breaking: Eurozone finance ministers have ended their video conference call on the Cyprus crisis. And the big news is that the Eurogroup have apparently agreed to give Cyprus more flexibility on its bank levy. As long as it hits the \u20ac5.8bn target. And it appears that tomorrow's vote in parliament still goes ahead. That's according to a source in the Greek finance minister, interviewed by Reuters. Here are the latest snaps off the Reuters terminal: \u2022 EUROGROUP MEETING ON CYPRUS OVER, EUROGROUP GIVES CYPRUS MORE FLEXIBILITY ON BANK LEVY - GREEK FINMIN SOURCE \u2022 EUROGROUP TO SAY THAT CYPRUS SHOULD SAFEGUARD PROTECTION OF DEPOSITORS BELOW 100,000 EUROS - GREEK FINMIN SOURCE \u2022 CYPRUS PARLIAMENTARY VOTE ON BANK LEVY TO TAKE PLACE ON TUESDAY, AS PLANNED - GREEK FIN MIN SOURCE \u2022 CYPRUS SHOULD STILL RAISE 5.8 BILLION EUROS FROM THE BANK LEVY AS PLANNED - GREEK FINANCE MINISTRY SOURCE The closing bell just rang on Wall Street, and shares have finished the day lower as US traders fret over the eurozone crisis again. Here are the provisional closing prices: Dow Jones Industrial Average: down 59.8 points, or -0.41% S&amp;P 500: down 8.42 points, or -0.5% Nasdaq: down 11.63 points, or -0.36% The risk of bank runs in Europe alarming some investors and analysts, despite there being no evidence of panicking shareholders in either Spain or Italy (as reported earlier today here and also here). Analysts at JP Morgan have just published a new research note, warning that the financial markets have underestimated the risks posed by Cyprus. They suggest that investors could be wrong to think the current deadlock over the bailout will be resolved, or that the eurozone's long-term \"crisis management framework\" remains intact. With Cyprus, the rest of the eurozone, and Moscow all at odds over the plan, the near-term risks are 'material', JP Morgan warned. Cyprus's fundamental problem, the bank says, is that it is \"politically impossible to impose the extent of losses on insured depositors [those with less than \u20ac100,000 in the bank] that the weekend agreement envisaged\". This leaves Cyprus with three options, none very pleasant: Option A could be to recalibrate the pain so that insured depositors do not need to pay anything, while uninsured depositors pay around 15.4% of their deposits. The difficulty (and the main reason why this approach was not tried initially) is that the burden would fall disproportionately on Russian institutions and individuals. Russian influence is Cyprus is considerable; and statements from President Putin indicate that he would be extremely hostile to such an approach. There is some possibility that Russia would respond to a larger haircut by refusing to roll its existing \u20ac2.5bn loan to Cyprus; meaning that this option would still leave a significant shortfall. In such a scenario, either the haircut on uninsured deposits would need to be around 21.8%, or further Troika funding would need to be found. Option B could be to go straight to requesting additional support from the Troika. The Eurogroup is holding a further conference call this evening, which is likely to investigate the near-term implications of the Cypriot agreement. In our view, a significant amendment of the terms of the deals (which calls for \u20ac5.8bn to be found from deposit haircuts) is unlikely. Politically, it could be very difficult for Germany in particular to make any kind of U-turn (especially since part of the purpose of the whole exercise has been to demonstrate the Government's hard-line to domestic voters). The Eurogroup could propose looking at different parts of the capital structure, but this could risk compounding the existing error by creating additional uncertainties. Finance Ministers may look for other forms of funding, but their task looks difficult (it is possible that Cyprus will revisit the idea of securitising future gas revenues, which we were surprised was not utilised in the initial proposal). Option C could be to tweak the current pain distribution so that less of the burden falls on the insureds. The Government has already proposed staggering the burden so that depositors with less than ?100,000 pay 3%,those with less than \u20ac500,000 pay 10% and those with more than \u20ac500,000 pay 15%. To our mind, this looks like shifting deckchairs. And in the long term... JP Morgan argues that the \"breach of faith between Euro area policymakers and regional depositors\" will remain. News that the Cypriot bailout vote might not take place tomorrow has sent shares lower in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 64 points at 14450, a fall of 0.4% (it had briefly burst into positive territory). There's around 20 minutes trading left, enough time for traders to fret over the eurozone. The euro is also dropping again, down at $1.293. The Greek TV station Antenna is reporting that Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades was planing to tell the Eurogroup tonight that he doesn't have enough support to get the bailout deal approved by parliament. That won't come as a shock to anyone - especially with his own coalition partner, DIKO, demanding changes (see 7.17pm). Eurozone finance ministers were due to start holding a videoconference call to discuss Cyprus an hour ago. No news flashes yet.... UPDATE: Antenna is also reporting that Anastasiades will postpone tomorrow's vote until later in the week - as suggested in our previous post. Crumbs... the latest rumour is that tomorrow's parliamentary vote might have been postponed again. That's via the Financial Times's well-connected Peter Spiegel: Developing The junior coalition partner in the Cyprus government, DIKO, has warned tonight that the savings levy must be changed. The party's president, Marios Karoyian, has reportedly described the deal as a 'catastrophe' for the Cypriot economy . DIKO says it has made several suggestions to improve the package... and says the situation is fluid and fast moving (according to state TV station CyBC). No argument there Around 12,000 UK pensioners in Cyprus have had their pension payments into a local bank temporarily paused while the British government assesses the situation (as I reported at 3.42pm) The UK Department of Work and Pensions has said tonight that British pensioners in Cyprus should not panic over the move: A DWP spokesperson said: UK citizens in Cyprus can be assured that their pension payments are being held safely and a normal service will resume as soon as the situation in Cyprus has become clear. \"People can switch the bank account into which payments are made with immediate effect by contacting the International Pensions Centre. There are over 18,100 UK pensioners resident in Cyprus, according to official figures, with around a third already using a UK bank account for their payments (so they aren't affected by the move). From Rome, our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, reports that fears of a bank run in Italy proved unfounded today (as in Spain, see 4.45pm) John writes: There were no signs of panic among Italians, more concerned by a political deadlock at home that also has the potential to send the euro tumbling. The Milan bourse halved its early losses to close the day 0.85% down \u2014 a far rosier performance than that of the Madrid bolsa. Investors appeared to be taking at face value assurances from both the stock exchange regulator and bankers. The president of Consob, the Italy\u2019s stock exchange regulatory authority, Giuseppe Vegas, said: \u201cThere is no similarity between Cyprus and Italy. Our public finances are solid. There is no worry about contagion. Italy is a manufacturing country, whereas Cyprus is a financial one. Indeed, in some people\u2019s opinion, it is a tax haven.\u201d The bankers\u2019 association also did its best to allay fears, citing figures from the Bank for International Settlements to show that Italy\u2019s institutions had an exposure to Cypriot securities that was under a billion euros. A note of alarm was, however, sounded by a consumers\u2019 association, Adusbef. Its national secretary, Mauro Novelli said \u201cThe problem is not the size, industrial structure of GDP [of Cyprus] but the principle of imposing on a member state a mandatory levy on bank deposits\u201d. He said the bail-out terms could cause \u201calarm and a capital flight, especially in Italy which has Europe\u2019s highest banking charges and sub-zero interest rates on deposits.\u201d Italy\u2019s politics present a threat of their own to the stability of the euro zone. A general election last month gave the balance of power in the legislature to the Five Star Movement, led by a comedian Beppe Grillo. President Giorgio Napolitano is due to start talks on the formation of a new government on Wednesday. But Grillo\u2019s refusal to join a coalition could stymie his efforts. This video clip appears to show a protester in Cyprus removing the German flag from its embassy this afternoon: Earlier today I grabbed a few minutes on the phone with Yiannis Mouzakis, who blogs as The Prodigal Greek (and who tweeted photos of Cypriot bank machines out of action over the weekend). Yiannis explained that there was still a sense of shock and \"numbness\" in Cyprus, rather than deep anger, as people really hadn't expected their deposits to be used to fund the country's bailout. Cyprus doesn't have the same tradition of public protests as Greece, he explained (it's a much smaller country, for one thing). And, of course, people didn't expect to be able to use their banks today because of the scheduled bank holiday. But with the banks officially closed until Thursday (and who knows how long it will take to get back to normality), people's patience will be tested: Yiannis said: Tomorrow, people will return to their businesses and find that their banks are closed, meaning there will be problems dealing with their suppliers. If that continues, numbness can change into frustration, and perhaps anger. Yiannis also fears that Cyprus will suffer a capital flight once the banks open - with people determined to withdraw their savings when they get the chance. And that would damage its banking sector, making it harder for the country to hit the targets set as part of the bailout deal. It could be another vicious spiral, as we've seen in Greece.... Protesters with 'no' written on their hands have demonstrated outside the Cyprus parliament in Nicosia, in the biggest display of public opposition to the bailout plan, and the decision to tax savers. Slogans included \"If they won't let us dream, we won't let them sleep\" - and attacks on bankers. Here are the latest photos from the scene: The Cyprus bailout is big news in America as well as Europe. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the US is watching the situation closely, but declined to comment much further. Carney told a press briefing in Washington: We're obviously monitoring the situation right now We believe it's very important for Europe to take steps necessary, as they have been, to both grow and deal with sovereign debt issues. Here's fresh video footage of Cyprus's president, and Cypriot citizens, discussing the bailout today: European stock markets have closed for the day -- in the red, but with rather smaller losses than we feared 12 hours ago. FTSE 100: down 31 points at 6457, - 0.5% German DAX: down 32 points at 8010, - 0.4% French CAC: down 17 points at 3826, -0.45% Spanish IBEX: down 111 points at 8507, -1.3% Italian FTSE MIB: down 137 points at 15924, -0.85% Traders have become less nervous of bank runs breaking out across Europe, and more convinced that the hugely unpopular savings levy could be rejigged before the Cypriot parliament votes tomorrow. From Madrid, my colleague Giles Tremlett reports that there is no sign of a bank run in Spain. Giles writes: A public holiday in Spain on Monday prevented savers worried by the Cypriot bailout from rushing to their banks, but there were no queues at cash machines and few signs of nervousness from investors. \"I don't think there is any chance of contagion because Spain has already confronted this situation, like Ireland and other member states,\" said Agriculture minister Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete. \"The process of cleaning up [banks] has already been done here, and the situation is not the same because the conditions are different to the Cypriot case.\" The government's calm at the news that, for the first time in the euro crisis, bank deposits would be raided to help finance a bailout, contrasted with warnings from commentators that a dangerous precedent had been set which might one day provoke a run on Spanish banks. \"This could bring contagion to other banking systems with problems,\" warned Columbia business school professor Tano Santos on the Nadaesgratis blog run by Spanish economists. \"Bank deposits were a red line, but that has now been crossed - even if they try to call it a tax on wealth. We shall see how savers in other countries react.\" \"There are parallels to the Spanish case, but the big difference as far as savers are concerned is that the conditions for Spain were established last year and did not involve any levy on savings,\" said Carlos Segovia, of El Mundo newspaper. El Mundo reported that Spanish finance minister Luis de Guindos had argued against raiding bank deposits in Cyprus during a meeting of euro zone finance ministers at the weekend. Today, De Guindos has been insisting that the deposit levy could not be repeated in Spain. Open Europe, the think tank, has also rounded up the press reaction in both Spain and Italy, here: While everyone is speculating about contagion to other eurozone countries: What are the Italian and Spanish press actually saying about the Cypriot bailout? UK pensioners who want to switch their payments to another bank account can do so at this site: International Pension Centre. As reported at 3.42pm, the British government has decided to temporarily suspend payments to Cyprus banks until the situation becomes clearer. Conservative MP Brooks Newmark suggests that the UK government should be doing more to protect UK pensioners, particularly those who have savings of less than \u20ac100,000 (and who would thus be protected by deposit protection insurance if Cyprus's banks had actually gone bust). Labour's Chris Bryant is also deeply concerned about the savings levy, saying it was wrong that ordinary savers are pilfered while the people who caused the crisis, Cyprus's politicans and bankers, are spared. Several MPs have also argued that the Cyprus crisis shows the perils of joining a single currency union and surrendering control of your own economy. Greg Clark didn't disagree.... The House of Commons then moved onto press regulation (rolling coverage here in Politics Live), but it was clear that many MPs are deeply concerned, and indeed outraged, by the terms of the Cyprus bailout. (highlights from 3.42pm) Green MP Caroline Lucas says the UK government is taking too soft a line with Cyprus's savings levy. It is immoral and unfair to pilfer the savings of the people of Cyprus. Greg Clark replies that the decision to tax savings was taken by the Cyprus government - he isn't keen to defend it personally. Another Conservative MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, asks Greg Clark whether he would advise UK citizens in Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy to repatriate their funds. Clark replies that it is clear that the situation in Cyprus is unique. MPs are asking Greg Clark why the UK government will not cover all losses suffered by military personal, rather than simply \"reasonable losses\". Clark says that the principle is that soldiers should not lose out because they have been sent to Cyprus, and points out that the situation is still fast-moving and fluid. Tory MP Andrew Tyrie warned parliament that the Cyprus bailout plan risks \"triggering a run on the banks\", and criticised it as \"badly thought through and dangerously slow\". Opposition minister Chris Leslie responds to Greg Clark, and is very critical of the Cypriot bailout scheme. Leslie calls the plan \"extremely concerning\", and suggests the initial market reaction \"may just be the start\". Leslie adds that the decision to force a levy on savers risks causing severe damage to confidence in the banking sector. It is never a good sign to savers that they would be better putting their savings under the mattress than in a bank. Minister Greg Clark adds: This is a worrying situation not just for the people of Cyprus, but for many of our constituents in the House. Government minister Greg Clark is addressing parliament now about the Cyprus crisis. Clark, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, confirms that members of the UK armed services will be compensated \"reasonable losses\" suffered because of the savings levy. He then says that the Government is suspending payments to UK pensioners in Cyprus with Cypriot bank accounts until \"at least tomorrow\". Clark adds that pensioners could switch payments to another bank account. We're looking for stories from people affected by the Cyprus bailout - if you can help, please visit this Open Thread: Cyprus bailout: how will it affect you? Open thread. It's official: Cyprus's central bank has decided to keep its commercial banks closed until Thursday (news which broke a few minutes ago). Associated Press's Menelaos Hadjicostis reports: Cyprus banks will remain closed until Thursday as lawmakers try to amend a measure to raid bank accounts in the country. Aliki Stylianou, a spokeswoman for Cyprus' central bank, says Monday's bank holiday has been extended by two days. The extension comes after a proposal to seize a percentage of all bank deposits in Cyprus, a move that was demanded as a condition for a 10 billion ($13.09 billion) international rescue package. Cypriot lawmakers are now in talks to soften the blow for small savers before they approve the bailout. The parliamentary approval vote has been postponed from Monday until Tuesday evening. And here's AFP's take: Cyprus banks will remain closed until Thursday, a Central Bank official told AFP, amid fears of a run on accounts by customers hit by a levy on their deposits imposed under a EU bailout deal. \"The banks will remain closed on Tuesday and Wednesday,\" the official told AFP. With Monday a public holiday, banks have not re-opened since the stringent terms of the EU deal were announced on Saturday. Another photo from the demonstration taking place in Nicosia: Another big development: According to Associated Press, the Central Bank of Cyprus has decided that the country's banks will remain closed until Thursday. They were originally meant to open tomorrow, after today's scheduled bank holiday. Nothing official on the Central Bank's website.... , and I'm afraid i can't get through on the phone. But Reuters is also quoting a government source saying the banks will be shut on Tuesday and Wednesday. Just in: The eurogroup (of eurozone finance ministers) are going to hold a teleconference call tonight to discuss the situation in Cyprus. That will allow them to discuss potential changes to the savings levy, ahead of tomorrow's parliamentary vote, delayed from today (which was delayed from yesterday). Bloomberg's David Tweet flags up that junior finance ministers will be crunching the numbers first: Here's a new photo from Nicosia, of a demonstrator holding a sign calling for a referendum: In Britain, a Treasury minister will make a statement to MPs on the Cyprus bank deposit tax later this afternoon. The Speaker's Office said a minister will make a statement to the House of Commons about the proposed levy at 3.30pm GMT. Yesterday, George Osborne announced that the UK government will compensate members of the armed forces based in Cyprus, whose bank accounts would be subject to the levy. The Dow Jones index has fallen in early trading in New York. But, as in Europe this lunchtime, it's nothing to panic about. The Dow is currently down 71 points at 14443, a fall of around 0.5%. France's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, has now stated that it is happy for Cyprus to change the terms of its savings levy, as long as the deposit tax raises the target of \u20ac5.8bn. Cyprus's government has hit back against reports that it decided to impose the savings tax on those with less than \u20ac100,000 in the bank. Greece's Kathimerini has the story: In a strongly-worded statement issued by spokesman Christos Stylianides about an hour after the postponement of the vote of the measures in Parliament in order to amend the measures, Nicosia rejected claims attributed to German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that Cyprus turned down the idea of a 40% levy on accounts in excess of \u20ac100,000 and said that the plan was imposed on the Cypriot government. The statement cites President Nicos Anastasiades as saying that \"he categorically denies he was ever given the option of exemption of guaranteed deposits, i.e. deposits up to \u20ac100,000 euros.\" Meanwhile, two authoritative reports have outlined how the levy was agreed in the early hours of Saturday. Peter Spiegel of the Financial Times reported: Backed into a corner, the only thing the Cypriots could do was mitigate the damage. Several officials suggested putting all of the burden on deposits over \u20ac100,000. Berlin was agnostic about where the axe fell. But Cypriot officials, with the backing of the commission, felt anything over 10 per cent would appear so onerous that it would make the situation even worse. \u201cThe Cypriot president did not want to agree to a levy higher than 10 per cent,\u201d said one top negotiator. \u201cPeople were joking that he has only rich friends.\u201d The Wall Street Journal has even more detail: Mr [Olli] Rehn was the first to make a specific proposal. To raise funds, Cyprus should impose a special levy on deposits, taxing accounts of less than \u20ac100,000 at 3%, those up to \u20ac500,000 at 5% and those above at 7%. Such a \"solidarity levy \"\u2014the brainchild of Thomas Wieser, an Austrian who chairs technical discussion among euro-zone finance officials, and Mr. Asmussen\u2014 could avoid a straight \"haircut\" on deposits, which they feared could be too destabilizing for Cyprus and the rest of Europe. The tax would be applied to all Cypriot banks, not just the two in deep trouble. But Ms. Lagarde had something else in mind. The IMF chief presented a much more radical plan, in which deposits above \u20ac100,000 in Laiki and Bank of Cyprus would have been cut by between 30% and 40%. The owners of senior bonds in the two banks would also have faced losses\u2014a step that was ultimately rejected. That plan would have limited the international bailout to \u20ac10 billion and raise some \u20ac7.5 billion from depositors. Anastasiades fought for a smaller levy, but was bounced into accepting the plan by the threat of the ECB pulling the plug on Cyprus's banking sector. The calmer mood in the financial markets reflects optimism that Cyprus will manage to reshape its savings levy in a way that is less painful for small shareholders. Veteran economist Anatole Kaletsky is certainly hopeful: The U-turn (should it happen) follows shock and anger across Europe during the weekend. A failure of democracy, or democracy in action? @Pawelmorski, incidentally, wrote two excellent posts on the Cyprus bailout over the weekend (the first before many people even realised what had happened): Saturday morning: Cyprus: A Brutal Lesson in RealPolitik Sunday night: Cyprus: What Were They Thinking? and some other notes While things are calmer, do check out Joris Luyendijk's banking blog, where a former JP Morgan banker is explaining why he swapped his City career for a new job at Oxfam: The bankers who traded the City for Oxfam Here's a flavour: My Damascene conversion, if you will, came during the financial crisis when Bear Stearns fell. There were a number of trades outstanding between JP Morgan and Bear Stearns and we went over to price them up. Now, usually when there's a trade of the kind I was in, if I am 5 million up, you must be 5 million down. It's zero sum. But when we looked at it up-close, it turned out that while our models said that we were say 3.5 million up, their models stated that they were up, too, by 2.5 million! That drove home the point for me how flimsy risk management structures really were. Europe's financial markets have calmed down after this morning's early wobbles, despite the news that the Cyprus bailout vote has been delayed until tomorrow. Spain and Italy remain the biggest fallers: FTSE 100: down 44 points at 6447, -0.66% German DAX: down 83 points at 7959, -1% French CAC: down 50 points at 3793, -1.3% Spanish IBEX: down 168 points at 8450, -1.9% Italian FTSE MIB: down 325 points at 15736, -2% Here's market analysts RanSquawk's midday summary: The euro is still down one cent against the US dollar (compared with Friday night), at $1.2945. Yiannakis Omirou, the speaker of the Cyprus parliament, has confirmed that the debate and vote on the country's bailout package has been delayed until Tuesday, with a vote penciled in for 6pm local time or 4pm GMT. Cyprus's president, Nicos Anastasiades, saw the public's anger this morning as he arrived at parliament to discuss the crisis. A group of demonstrators had gathered outside the building, carrying placards with slogans such as \"hands off Cyprus\". Here are the latest photos: Heads-up, a demonstration against the Cypriot bailout deal is scheduled to start at 3pm local time, or 1pm GMT. On Cypriot-Russian relations: CyBC, the state TV station in Cyprus, is now reporting that today's vote has been postponed until 4pm local time, or 2pm GMT. And an EU official has told Reuters in Brussels that the vote was been put off until Tuesday to allow 'more time for negotiation'. It makes sense, given the ongoing chatter that the terms of the deposit levy will be changed. But it's also hard to see how the country's banks could reopen until the situation is resolved. Cypriot state TV news are reporting that this afternoon's vote on the bailout has been cancelled, and that the country's banks could remain closed for longer than expected. Trying to get confirmation from Cyprus.... In the meantime: German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has denied that Berlin is to blame for the decision to tax deposit holders in Cyprus. Sch\u00e4uble also confirmed that Germany would not have any objections to the terms of the savings levy being rejigged, as appears to be happening today. Sch\u00e4uble told reporters in Berlin that: The levy on deposits below 100,000 euros was not the creation of the German government...If one reached another solution we would not have the slightest problem. That's a green light for Nicosia to reduce the impact on poorer savers, and increase the burden on the rich (see 9.09am for the latest) Here's a video clip of Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades addressing the nation last night: (full transcript online in English here) Today's vote in Cyprus on the bailout terms is a real nail-biter, because president Nicos Anastasiades does not actually hold a parliamentary majority. His coalition controls 28 of the 56 seats in the Nicosia parliament, suggesting a significant chance that the bailout deal could be voted down this afternoon. Here's the breakdown: Anastasiades party \u0394\u0397\u03a3\u03a5: 20 seats \u0394\u0397\u039a\u039f (DIKO) (coalition party): 8 \u0391\u039a\u0395\u039b (AKEL): 19 \u0395\u0394\u0395\u039a (EDEK): 5 Greens: 1 \u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u03a9\u039a\u039f (EUROKO): 2 Independent: 1 That's via the invaluable Yiannis Mouzakis, who blogs as The Prodigal Greek. He reports that one of Anastasiades's MPs is racing back from Argentina for the vote, but that some opposition MPs could support Anastasiades. But whatever happens, Cyprus's banking system will never be the same again, Yiannis argues: If Germany\u2019s intention was to reduce the size of it \u2013 closer to the eurozone average \u2013 they managed to achieve that with a masterful stroke in just one weekend. Deposits flight combined with the sale of the Greek operations will probably leave the Cypriot banking system half the size it was on Friday night, even left with one systemic bank after restructuring. Cannot see a smooth transition period without some form of capital controls. By the time the dust settles, the Cypriot economy will sink and PIMCO\u2019s adverse scenario [see here] will materialise. Many people did their best to make this a reality. Here's the full article: Cyprus, current state of play Vladimir Putin's interjection into the Cyprus crisis has caused some eyebrow-raising this morning: Vladimir Putin's attack on the Cypriot savers' tax (see 8.56am) comes hours before the Cyprus parliament was due to vote on the bailout measures. But the news this morning that the levy could still be renegotiated to limit the impact on smaller savers has brought some calm. To recap: the latest proposal would (apparently) see savers with less than \u20ac100,000 in the bank lose 3% of their deposits (down from 6.75% originally). Those with between \u20ac100,000 and \u20ac500,000 would lose 10%, as before. But if you've got more than \u20ac500,000 in the bank, the Cyprus government would take 15%. The WSJ, which broke the news this morning, says this would still raise almost \u20ac6bn, as originally demanded by eurozone. One official told them: As long as the sum remains \u20ac5.8 billion, I think it will be backed by everyone, but of course the ministers and the troika will need to hear exact figures and proof that this will work. The Cyprus parliament is still expected to start debating the bailout at 2pm GMT (4pm local time), with a vote at 4pm GMT. The Russian government has just blasted Cyprus's bank levy, piling more pressure on Nicosia ahead of this afternoon's vote on the bailout. Vladimir Putin's official spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters in Moscow that the president is very concerned about the tax on savers. Peskov said Putin had held a meeting on the situation in Cyprus this morning, where he was deeply critical of the plan: Assessing the possible decision of imposing additional tax by Cyprus on deposits Putin said that this decision, if taken, would be unfair, unprofessional and dangerous. Wealthy Russians own a substantial chunk of total deposits in Cyprus -- and eurozone officials were determined to make them share the pain of the bailout (given their concerns over money-laundering within the Cypriot banking system). As mentioned at 7.53am, Russia has not decided yet whether it will extend its existing loan to Cyprus - giving Moscow plenty of leverage over the situation. This might cause some jitters in Brussels - the cost of insuring Cyprus's government debt against default has jumped this morning. The benchmark credit default swap contract for Cyprus has jumped to 768 basis points, up 113 from Friday. In practice, that means it would cost \u20ac768,000 per year to insure \u20ac10m of Cypriot sovereign debt. Last night, Cyprus's president Nicos Anastasiades addressed the nation, warning of dire consequences unless the bailout deal was agreed. Here's the official translation into English: Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades' nationally televised speech And here's what Anastasiades claimed would happen without the deal: 1. One bank would instantly cease operation. Following that the other major bank would suspend operations and we would finally be led to the collapse of the banking sector. 2. As a result, depositors would lose direct access to their deposits, while a large number of depositors would be subject to significant losses. 3. Thousands of SMEs and other businesses would risk bankruptcy. 4. Equally important, however, would be the direct loss of thousands of jobs in the banking sector. I cannot also ignore the consequent loss of thousands of other jobs related to banking activities. 5. The culmination of disorderly bankruptcy would be our potential coercion to exit the eurozone. A similar development would doubtless lead to a significant devaluation of our currency and our national wealth, with all that that would entail. Lex van Dam, hedge fund manager at Hampstead Capital, reckons investors would be wrong to dump shares in the face of the Cyprus crisis: He said: The whole Cyprus situation feels to me like a storm in a tea cup and weakness should be bought. This is a message from Europe to Cyprus to stop misbehaving. (via Reuters) Cyprus might be stunned by the suggestion that it is misbehaving; but I think van Dam is referring to the decision to cancel the parliamentary vote on the bailout yesterday (it's now scheduled for this afternoon). And shares are recovering slightly, with the FTSE 100 now down 67 points (1.05%)..... Here's more details of the sell-off in Europe's banks this morning: Barclays: - 3.1% Lloyds Banking Group: - 2.8% Standard Chartered: -2.1% BNP Paribas: -4% Credit Agricole: -3.2% Credit Suisse: -4.2% Julius Baer: -2.04% UBS -2.75% Deutsche Bank: -3.3% Unicredit -4.8% European stock markets are open, and as feared shares are in retreat. The FTSE 100 is down 99 points at 6390, a fall of 1.5% The French CAC is down 2.1%, the German DAX opened 1.7% lower, and Spain and Italy have fallen almost 3%. Banks are leading the fallers, with Barclays and Lloyds down around 3% in London. Across Europe, Unicredit has tumbled by 5.2% and Societe Generale is down by 5.5%. Breaking news: there are reports that Cyprus's government is rethinking the terms of the savings levy. According to the Wall Street Journal's Matina Stevis, this would lower the impact on smaller savers to just 3% of their deposits: My colleague Angelique Chrisafis is in Cyprus, and wrote last night that people are stunned by the news that their deposits are being tapped as part of the country's bailout: Under the palm trees of Larnaca's waterfront promenade, George Kyprou was staring out to sea and scratching his head. \"I don't know what to do,\" he said. Like most Cypriots, he was astonished to wake up one bank holiday weekend morning to discover the government had seized up to 10% of everyone's savings from their bank accounts without warning. Kyprou, 62, born in Larnaca, had worked most of his life as a chauffeur and driver in England, proudly buying his London council flat and scrimping to put aside money in Cyprus for when he returned for holidays and eventually to retire. \"I'd put aside \u00a350 here, \u00a320 there, all my life,\" he said. Over decades, he had built up around \u20ac6,000 (\u00a35,200) in a Larnaca account. \"It was a state building society; I assumed it was safe.\" But now, as depositors holding less than \u20ac100,000 are made to pay 6.75% and those with more than \u20ac100,000 9.9% as part of a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.7bn) bailout agreed in Brussels, Kyprou stands to lose \u20ac400 overnight. \"That's a lot for someone like me,\" he said. More here: Cyprus bailout: 'people are panicking, they're afraid of losing their money' Over in Russia, the Moscow stock market fell by 2.7% in early trading. Russia is a key player in the Cyprus bailout -- with eurozone officials hoping that it will extend its existing \u20ac2.5bn loan to the country, and lower the interest payments. However, the Russian government hasn't yet said whether it will do this. One government source told Reuters this morning: There's been no decision yet. The FTSE 100 is expected to tumble by 120 points when trading begins at 8am GMT, as traders balk at the unfolding crisis in Cyprus. Here's the latest forecasts from IG Index: FTSE 100, down 121 points at 6368 German DAX, down 166 points at 7926 French CAC, down 72 points at 3772, Spanish IBEX, down 218 points at 8401 This follows the 2.7% drop in Japan's Nikkei, and the euro's tumble below $1.29: Chris West, IG's chief market strategist, commented, said news of the \"Cypriot stability levy\" had caused alarm in Asia: It\u2019s been a good old fashioned risk-off day in Asia, with the EUR predictably at the epicentre of the sell-off. While depositors from other sovereigns with fiscal issue such as Portugal, Spain and Greece will be looking at the levy with great interest, we are confident they are not going to flee local banks, which is ultimately the key concern here. Good morning. The eurozone faces a new crisis, as the botched bailout of Cyprus sparks panic and alarm across the country, and sends stock markets falling sharply. The hugely controversial decision to force all savers in Cyprus to contribute to the bailout package by removing up to 10% of their deposits has been savaged all weekend. The latest reports from Cyprus are that the government could adjust the levy, reducing the impact on poorest savers, ahead of a crucial vote on the bailout this afternoon. Some commentators are predicting that savers in other troubled eurozone countries could start withdrawing their savings, but several City analysts believe this is unlikely. There's widespread agreement, though, that savers' trust in the banking sector has been badly hurt by the decision to impose losses on savers - trampling over the principle that depositors should be protected in such circumstances. Cypriot banks are still closed for a bank holiday today, and could remain shuttered for several days until the situation is resolved. What's certain is that the crisis has jolted the financial markets. In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei has fallen by 2.7%, its biggest drop since last May. The euro has also fallen sharply, dropping almost two cents against the US dollar to $1.2885 - its lowest level of 2013. European stock markets are expected to share in the sell-off when trading begins at 8am, with traders predicting losses of around 2%. We'll be covering all the latest developments through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer shares hit a 28-month high on rumours of an \u00a38bn takeover by the Qatar Investment Authority, reaching prices last seen in November 2010. Despite attempts by sources close to Qatar Holdings to play down the speculation, shares in the high-street business closed up nearly 7%. However, neither M&amp;S nor the Qataris issued a statement denying the rumours, and both could come under pressure from the stock market authorities to clarify their positions if the share price continues to rise. The Qatar Investment Authority, of which Qatar Holdings is a subsidiary, already has significant interests in retailing. It has a 26% stake in Sainsbury's, owns the department store Harrods, and has small shareholdings in the luxury brands Louis Vuitton and Tiffany &amp; Co. It is the latest takeover rumour for M&amp;S, which is recovering from a difficult year that has included several boardroom shakeups. Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, said: \"M&amp;S may have to say something, even if it is just to confirm that it has had no approaches. From a tactical perspective, we think that M&amp;S is certainly vulnerable to a bid, as trading and profits are under pressure, with nothing to show yet for the big investments made in online systems and warehousing and the changes in the clothing team ahead of the key autumn season.\" The speculation stems from a Sunday Times report that the Gulf state's sovereign wealth fund had approached several large private equity firms to gauge their interest and spoken to banks about financing an offer, citing senior City sources. The shares rose throughout last week, and on Monday night closed up 6.9% at 398.1p, peaking at 407.1p in morning trading. M&amp;S could be attractive to the Qataris thanks to its \u00a38bn property portfolio. It owns 65% of its stores. If the value is realised, a sale and leaseback programme could see any investor make a quick return, it was suggested. However, many of the sites have been described as unattractive to landlords and the M&amp;S pension fund holds \u00a31.5bn of freeholds as part of a plan to reduce the pension deficit by \u00a31bn in 2009. Bubb added: \"The question is what anybody thinks could be done with a declining brand like M&amp;S.\" It is not the first time M&amp;S has come under the scrutiny of a possible all-out takeover. Last summer, the US private equity group CVC Capital Partners was said to have eyed up a possible bid for the company, speaking to banks and investors to line up funding. Some investors are beginning to lose faith in the ability of the chief executive, Marc Bolland, to revive the 128-year-old chain. The retailer reported its first decline in profits for three years last May, followed by disastrous autumn sales due to stock problems and mismanagement. It led to the long-serving clothing supremo Kate Bostock leaving, and the former chief executive of Debenhams, Belinda Earl, coming in as a style director. John Dixon, former head of food, has stepped in to become head of general merchandise, which includes its most important area: womenswear. At its annual results, Bolland rowed back on a three-year plan to boost UK group sales by up to \u00a32.5bn, and put the brakes on plans to open more stores. Problems persisted and in January, David Cumming of Standard Life Investments, a top 10 shareholder in M&amp;S, said Bolland had until September to turn around the company's fortunes if he wanted to keep his job. The last time M&amp;S faced a possible takeover was in 2004, when Topshop owner Sir Philip Green made a second attempt to buy the business.

The firm says it is not responsible for the sudden glut of Qatar stories \u2013 and it is difficult to see an obvious motive for the blitz. Other theories include a rival to Qatar (or its advisers) looking to score points; the Qataris mischievously suggesting that they are targeting various UK companies in order to smooth the way for another major takeover; or, indeed, that the tales will eventually turn out to be true after all. Whatever the reason, the concentration of stories \u2013 coupled with the uncharacteristic denials \u2013 has caused the odd City eyebrow to arch.",

      "bodyText": "The lives of thousands of children are under threat unless the UK maintains its aid spending, more than 100 economists said in a letter to George Osborne ahead of the budget. Life-saving projects funded through UK aid will be come to an end should the chancellor cave in to demands for cuts to the Department for International Development (DfID), said the group, which includes UN adviser and director of the Columbia University Earth Institute, Jeffrey Sachs. The call came as a group of 170 aid charities stepped up their If campaign against hunger, which asks rich countries to invest more in agriculture across the developing world. The If group said the UK, which is playing host to the G8 group of rich nations this year, must act following a fall in the proportion of aid spent on agriculture from 17% in the 1980s to 4% in 2011. \"In 2011 the UK spent just 1.9% of aid on agriculture despite the fact that two million children die from malnutrition every year,\" it said. Business leaders from many of the UK's largest firms wrote to the Financial Times last week in support of the UK's aid budget. Bosses, including Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, and Sir Michael Rake, chairman of BT and easyJet, said: \"One reason these economies are doing better (Africa contains many of the fastest-growing economies in the world) is because of the impact of development assistance.

The coalition government's decision to stick to Labour's pledge of meeting the UN target has angered many Tories, who believe DfID's budget should not be spared cuts faced by other departments. Oxfam, which wrote the letter to Osborne on behalf of 100 economists, said it was concerned the chancellor's resolve may be weakened by the persistent campaigning by some MPs to reduce the aid budget. A report by a committee of MPs said this year it was concerned DfID's growing commitments would overwhelm civil servants and lead to poor spending decisions. \"We are worried that pressure to meet targets to increase overseas development aid could lead to DfID making poor spending decisions,\" said Malcolm Bruce, chair of the international development committee, following publication of its report on DfID's annual report and accounts 2011-12. \"The department should be prepared to miss aid targets where there are delays or cancellations to its planned projects and it does not have good value alternatives,\" he said. British and Japanese officials will hold a conference in London later this week to discuss joint projects in Africa and how to overcome corruption, threats of kidnapping and violence in some parts of the continent. Japan is keen to increase its influence in Africa following a surge in investment by China over the last decade. Sachs said the UK should maintain its commitment to development aid. He said: \"The bravery of George Osborne and the UK government in sticking to this historic promise will save millions of lives. It is something all British people should be proud of.\" The letter said: \"Aid not only protects people from the worst effects of poverty, it also increases the options available to them and encourages enterprise both directly and indirectly. \"By providing farmers with seeds and equipment, for example, aid can make the difference between them growing just enough to feed their families and having a surplus to sell at market.

      "bodyText": "The last chief executive of AstraZeneca, bundled out during last year's so-called shareholder spring, cut jobs by the thousand. The new chief executive, Pascal Soriot, has started his reign by chopping 700, including 550 in chancellor George Osborne's constituency in Cheshire, with 1,600 more moving from Cheshire to Cambridge. Has anything really changed at AstraZeneca? Actually, yes. We await Soriot's full presentation of his strategy on Thursday but Monday's organisational overhaul certainly looks different. For a start, it's not meant purely to be about hacking away at the cost base to protect the research budget; in the corporate jargon, it's about \"putting science at the heart of everything we do\". That may sound gloriously superficial for a pharmaceutical company but, in AstraZeneca's case, there is a fair argument that complexity and corporate sprawl has got in the way of doing the basics well. The drug development industry increasingly operates via collaboration (40% of AstraZeneca's own pipeline are partnerships of some form) and it makes sense to focus activities in the UK on a new \u00a3330m facility in Cambridge. The decision is tough on Alderley Park in Cheshire and will inevitably create a political storm over the loss of skilled research jobs in north-west England. But AstraZeneca's investors are likely to support any measure that the management thinks will improve productivity in the labs. That, after all, is the best hope of revival for a company that has messed up on the acquisition front, notably via the $15.6bn gamble on Medimmune in 2007, and now finds itself facing huge hits as patents expire. Self-help is a better approach (or perhaps the only remaining credible strategy) and it inevitably means trusting the scientists to deliver the goods. Deals are not off Soriot's menu entirely, but they are likely to be much smaller. The open question is, how long the rejig will take to bear fruit? Reorganisation will take three years and drug development always takes time. What shareholders want to know is what it all means for budgets, cashflows and the dividend.

      "body": "<p>Whatever George Osborne may say in his budget speech on Wednesday, he cannot extricate himself from the wreckage that now surrounds him. He may be just about the last person in Britain to believe that austerity offers a credible path to recovery from recession \u2013 and it may be doubted that even he remains a true believer.</p> <p>The repeated fall back into recession, a government deficit that goes on rising and the loss of the country's top credit rating are surely enough to shake the confidence of even the most arrogant and obtuse practitioner of the dismal science.</p> <p>The chancellor's continued commitment to austerity has made a significant personal contribution to the digging of an economic hole from which there now seems no discernible path to recovery. Perhaps his only saving grace is that he should not be left to bear the burden of that responsibility alone.</p> <p>As a long-time critic of British economic policy under successive governments, I hear the flapping wings of chickens coming home to roost; for the truth is that the current difficulties \u2013 and the imminent prospect of long-term economic decline \u2013 are the inevitable consequences of decades of mistaken policy choices and the worship of false gods.</p> <p>It is hard to grasp, even now, just how thoroughly and comprehensively the favoured nostrums of the last four decades \u2013 those nostrums that have guided our fortunes over the whole of that period \u2013 have now been disproved and discredited. Let us look at some of them in turn.</p> <p>Take the propositions that the market (and especially financial markets) can be accurately predicted on the basis of mathematical models, that they are self-correcting and do not therefore need regulation, and that any intervention in unregulated markets will automatically produce results that will be worse than if they had been left alone. As Keynes warned, and experience in the form of the global financial crisis has confirmed, markets \u2013 and financial markets in particular \u2013 are all too likely, if unregulated, to lead to excess and collapse.</p> <p>Or, what about the belief \u2013 maintained for more than three decades \u2013 that macroeconomic policy is not a matter for government but is a simple matter of restraining inflation \u2013 an essentially technical task through setting interest rates that can safely be entrusted to unaccountable bankers? Do we still believe that monetary policy is all that is needed for a healthy economy? Or that it is any more effective than pushing on a piece of string as a means of escaping from recession? Or \u2013 when we look to more successful economies overseas \u2013 that there is no role for government?</p> <p>And what about the related confidence displayed in the expertise and objectivity of bankers in running our economy? Do we still believe that bankers have the common interest at heart and do not make decisions to suit themselves? Are we happy that they continue to enjoy the astonishing privilege, as private monopolies, of creating money out of nothing, thereby exercising hugely more power over our fortunes than do elected governments?</p> <p>What do we think of the faith placed by successive governments, not least by New Labour, in the financial services industry as the means of paying our way in the world?

      "bodyText": "Whatever George Osborne may say in his budget speech on Wednesday, he cannot extricate himself from the wreckage that now surrounds him. He may be just about the last person in Britain to believe that austerity offers a credible path to recovery from recession \u2013 and it may be doubted that even he remains a true believer. The repeated fall back into recession, a government deficit that goes on rising and the loss of the country's top credit rating are surely enough to shake the confidence of even the most arrogant and obtuse practitioner of the dismal science. The chancellor's continued commitment to austerity has made a significant personal contribution to the digging of an economic hole from which there now seems no discernible path to recovery. Perhaps his only saving grace is that he should not be left to bear the burden of that responsibility alone. As a long-time critic of British economic policy under successive governments, I hear the flapping wings of chickens coming home to roost; for the truth is that the current difficulties \u2013 and the imminent prospect of long-term economic decline \u2013 are the inevitable consequences of decades of mistaken policy choices and the worship of false gods. It is hard to grasp, even now, just how thoroughly and comprehensively the favoured nostrums of the last four decades \u2013 those nostrums that have guided our fortunes over the whole of that period \u2013 have now been disproved and discredited. Let us look at some of them in turn. Take the propositions that the market (and especially financial markets) can be accurately predicted on the basis of mathematical models, that they are self-correcting and do not therefore need regulation, and that any intervention in unregulated markets will automatically produce results that will be worse than if they had been left alone. As Keynes warned, and experience in the form of the global financial crisis has confirmed, markets \u2013 and financial markets in particular \u2013 are all too likely, if unregulated, to lead to excess and collapse. Or, what about the belief \u2013 maintained for more than three decades \u2013 that macroeconomic policy is not a matter for government but is a simple matter of restraining inflation \u2013 an essentially technical task through setting interest rates that can safely be entrusted to unaccountable bankers? Do we still believe that monetary policy is all that is needed for a healthy economy? Or that it is any more effective than pushing on a piece of string as a means of escaping from recession? Or \u2013 when we look to more successful economies overseas \u2013 that there is no role for government? And what about the related confidence displayed in the expertise and objectivity of bankers in running our economy? Do we still believe that bankers have the common interest at heart and do not make decisions to suit themselves? Are we happy that they continue to enjoy the astonishing privilege, as private monopolies, of creating money out of nothing, thereby exercising hugely more power over our fortunes than do elected governments? What do we think of the faith placed by successive governments, not least by New Labour, in the financial services industry as the means of paying our way in the world? Do we still accept that the huge fortunes made by a few in a largely unregulated City represented real and sustainable wealth-creation in which the rest of us would share? Even more importantly, what do we think of the careless assumption that focusing on financial services made it unnecessary to concern ourselves with our manufacturing base? Do we now understand that the loss of manufacturing means \u2013 now that the chips are down \u2013 that we are denied the most reliable way of maintaining our standard of living, the most important source of innovation, the most substantial creator of new jobs, the most effective stimulus to improved productivity and the provider of the quickest return on investment? Do we understand that globalisation has meant, with the removal of exchange controls, that major global investors can now move huge volumes of money \u2013 totalling as much in a single day as the total annual production of most economies \u2013 from one country to another, and have thereby disabled democratic governments from doing anything to protect us? And do we understand that the combined effect of all these policies has been to create a huge mechanism for shifting wealth and resource from the poor to the rich, and that it is that which is responsible, rather than any great ability or virtue on the part of the rich, for the widening inequality that weakens and disfigures our society? Underpinning all of this is a fundamental failure \u2013 an obstinate refusal to recognise that the world has changed and that, with the rise of newly efficient economies around the globe, we have no innate right to have a privileged standard of living delivered to us on a plate. The fact is that the UK has been a fundamentally uncompetitive economy ever since the 1970s, but we have preferred to avert our gaze from this uncomfortable truth. The issue of competitiveness is not recognised, let alone discussed in Britain; yet much more successful economies use measures of competitiveness as their guide to what is required from macro-economic policy. We, on the other hand, have preferred to take refuge in a range of nostrums that we can now see have little merit.

      "bodyText": "Consumers could race to George Osborne's rescue following the first rise in incomes from employment in two-and-a-half years. The Markit survey of household incomes found that a three-year high in workplace activity translated into higher incomes and a sharp turnaround in confidence, pushing its Household Index higher after two months of falls. A return to growth in wages will send a positive message to the Treasury only two days before the chancellor is expected to concede in his third budget that he expects debt payments to be higher and growth lower this year than expected. Previous forecasts of a 1.2% rise in GDP this year are likely to be scaled back more in line with academic and City predictions that put growth nearer to 0.7%. Osborne, under pressure to kickstart the economy after two years of flat growth, is also understood to be preparing a raft of measures to boost investment, especially in areas where the UK already has expertise, in what is likely to be seen as a clear victory for lobbying by the business secretary, Vince Cable. Surveys of manufacturing and construction have shown these crucial sectors suffering severe falls in demand while the services sector remains largely flat. The gloomy feedback from industry has raised the prospect of a triple-dip recession and a further worsening of the government's finances. However, high street shops have reported more people coming through their doors while online stores have enjoyed a strong start to the year.

      "bodyText": "Ministers have welcomed the introduction of low-cost flights between London and Moscow as a boost to trade and investment, as the first easyJet service for the Russian capital departed on Monday. EasyJet started its no-frills flights between London Gatwick and Moscow on the day it made its debut on the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest companies, after its shares more than doubled in the last year. The airline, which beat off competition from Virgin Atlantic to secure the limited rights to the route, expects to fly more than a quarter of a million passengers between London and Moscow annually. Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of easyJet, said: \"Moscow is a landmark route and one we are delighted to be able to serve. Russia is the world's largest country with a growing economy. Offering frequent and affordable flights enables easyJet to play a key role to aid trade links between the two countries.\" EasyJet started officially trading on the FTSE 100 on Monday after its entry was confirmed earlier this month, less than 20 years after the airline with its distinctive orange-liveried aircraft was founded by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou with two borrowed planes. McCall said the soaring share price was down to the \"strategy of sustainable growth and returns and our disciplined approach to capital allocation\" \u2013 a strategy that Haji-Ioannou, now the largest single shareholder, has attributed to his broadsides against the board and \"always being on their case\". McCall said bookings for both of easyJet's Russian routes \u2013 direct flights from Manchester start on 28 March \u2013 had surpassed expectations, particularly from the Russian end. \"We are already well known to Muscovites\". A trade mission was on board the first flight, with representatives from UK companies in sectors including food, technology and manufacturing.
