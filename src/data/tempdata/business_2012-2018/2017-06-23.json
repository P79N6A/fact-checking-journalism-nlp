      "bodyText": "Independent shopkeepers in the Nisa convenience chain are mobilising in an attempt to block a potential \u00a3130m takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s. Britain\u2019s second largest supermarket group has started due diligence on member-owned Nisa, which sources groceries for 2,500 small shops, all owned by families and entrepreneurs. But many Nisa members, 75% of whom must approve the deal for it to go ahead, are unhappy at the prospect of joining a big corporate rival. \u201cThe members are in shock,\u201d said one. \u201cMembers joined Nisa because of what it stands for \u2013 the I is for \u2018independents\u2019.\u201d Influential member groupings in the Midlands, Ireland and London, some of which are able to pool votes under a proxy voting system, are planning to oppose the Sainbury\u2019s deal even though they are yet to see how the numbers stack up. The potential takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s comes after Tesco\u2019s takeover of Booker, the wholesaler behind the Londis and Budgens chains, raised expectations of a wave of consolidation in a market where about 80% of the UK\u2019s 41,000-plus convenience stores are independent or belong to buying groups such as Nisa or Costcutter. Only Nisa remains owned by its shopkeeper members, who have a say over its running, including executive pay, rules governing the proportion of stock that members must buy centrally, and the price of goods. Its 1,400 member shareholders own between one and 250 shares out of almost 60,000 in total. Only about 30 people are thought to own the maximum; most own less than 100. Under the terms of the Sainsbury\u2019s deal, shareholders are thought to be in line to receive \u00a32,500 per share. One long-term Nisa member said: \u201cThe deal for one share is not going to get people excited. The devil will be in the detail, but giving up our sovereignty is a big issue for independents. There might be fresh bread today, but tomorrow it could be very stale and hard.\u201d Another says: \u201cIf we take our independence away, we are inadvertently creating a cartel. There will be nobody else there but the big four \u2026 Every single supply route will be corporately owned.\u201d One shopkeeper said a comparison with the \u00a33.7bn that Tesco had agreed to pay for Booker suggested Sainsbury\u2019s bid seriously undervalued Nisa. Stephen Jempson, a Nisa member whose family has 14 outlets in East Sussex, said he would back a deal only if it offered members an element of independence and suggested that the mooted \u00a3130m price tag looked too low. He said: \u201cAny suitor needs to remember Nisa shouldn\u2019t be valued by its profitability or asset base,\u201d he said. \u201cThe value to members is its lean route to market and the added benefit to the retailer bottom line.\u201d Another long-term member agreed: \u201cPotentially, this deal undervalues Nisa. This is the only distributor owned by retailers, and I don\u2019t know how it can get any better than that. Under Sainsbury\u2019s, we are likely to be told what to do and what not to.\u201d But Harj Dhasee, who owns a store in Mickleton, Gloucestershire, said a tie-up with Sainsbury\u2019s could offer opportunities: \u201cOn a personal level, running a Sainsbury\u2019s Local franchise would be a game changer for me, because for consumers it\u2019s all about brand loyalty and recognition. If the Tesco/Booker merger happens, they will have all the volume, and the whole industry works on sales volumes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, and this week A quick reminder of the key points. France\u2019s growth rate in the first quarter of the year has been revised up to 0.5%. It\u2019s the latest sign that the eurozone recovery continues. European companies have posted their fastest quarterly growth since the debt crisis began six years ago. But growth dipped this month, suggesting a slight slowdown. A similar survey showed that America\u2019s economic growth may have slowed this month too. US manufacturing output expanded at the slowest rate in nine months. European stock markets closed lower, with the FTSE posting its third weekly decline in a row. Worries over Brexit, and deflation, loomed over the City after a week of oil price falls. The decline in the oil price helped to push Canada\u2019s inflation rate down. The annual CPI rate fell by more than expected last month, to just 1.3% last month. The British pound has marked the first anniversary of the Brexit vote with a small rally, up 0.35% to $1.2725. City experts, though, have shown that sterling has had a pretty awful year. The European Central Bank has launched a bid to wrestle control of London\u2019s euro-clearing market. In Greece, unions are vowing to step up their protests unless the government grants better rights to thousands of short-term workers. The tensions come as rubbish piles up in Athens, as a refuse workers\u2019 strike continues. The Greek government, though, is trying to rally investor confidence now it has secured its latest bailout funds. That\u2019s all from us until next week. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The FTSE 100 has now fallen for three weeks in a row; that\u2019s the worst run since the Brexit vote, points out Tara Cunningham in the Daily Telegraph tonight. David Madden of CMC Markets says growth fears weighed on the markets today, despite French GDP being revised up early this morning: Stock markets have fallen yet again as the disinflation fear is still doing the rounds. Oil may have recouped some of its losses today but the commodity has dropped a considerable amount since the start of the year and dealers are worried take it will put downward pressure on inflation. The cost of living in the eurozone and the US is softening already, and when you factor the recent losses in the oil market its points to a continuation of weaker inflation. Traders are anxious it could turn into weaker growth rates, and the high hopes that they had for 2017 may not be met. After another subdued day, the FTSE 100 has closed down 15.16 points at 7424. Worries over disinflation, following the oil price slump this week, weighed on shares. European issues also cast a shadow, as EU leaders in Brussels seemed unimpressed with Theresa May\u2019s offer to EU citizens after Brexit. Other markets also fell: Here\u2019s proof that the London stock market has underperformed since the Brexit vote, when measured in US dollars: Back in Greece, protests are set to intensify over the weekend as unions step up calls on Athens\u2019 leftist-led government to grant better employment rights \u2013 not least extension of short term contracts that could say protestors put up to 10,000 out of work. Announcing that walkouts by rubbish collectors and other municipal workers would continue until Monday, Nikos Trakas, who heads the union representing municipal employees, said the government couldn\u2019t hide behind legal argument in its refusal to put contract workers, now facing joblessness, in permanent positions. \u201cA government \u2026 can\u2019t come back two and a half years later and say there is a problem with constitutionality,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018We are talking about ten thousand people and if they leave, local government in its entirety will dissolve.\u201d Piles of refuse have collected across Athens and with temperatures set to climb to 36 degrees Celsius by Sunday the strike is causing mounting concerns at a time of rising tourism. Constantine Michalos, president of the Athens chamber of commerce, which represents over 100,000 businesses, issued an urgent appeal this afternoon for both workers and the government to return to the negotiating table. \u201cEveryone has to try to limit the obstacles that diminish the growth prospects of the country by limiting claims to rights,\u201d he said adding that it made no sense that \u201cvested interests\u201d should prevail at such a critical time. Just in: America\u2019s private sector is slowing this month. Factory activity across the US rose at its slowest rate in nine months, according to data firm Markit. Companies reported that output and new business growth both slowed compared to May. This dragged Markit\u2019s \u2018composite PMI\u2019, which measures activity across the private sector, down to a three month low of 53.0, from 53.6. That shows slower growth. But on the upside, job creation picked up and new orders hit a five-month high. Businesses also restocked their inventories, suggesting more optimism about the future. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says America\u2019s economy is ending the current quarter on \u201ca softer note\u201d. That may mean that growth isn\u2019t as strong as hoped, after a weak start to 2017. \u201cThe average expansion seen in the second quarter is down on that seen in the first three months of the year, indicating a slowing in the underlying pace of economic growth. While official GDP data are expected to turn higher in the second quarter after an especially weak start to the year (our recent GDP tracker based on various official and survey data points to 3.0% growth), the relatively subdued PMI readings suggest there are some downside risks to the extent to which GDP will rebound. Back in the UK, the Serious Fraud Office has closed a probe into whether the Bank of England broke the law during the financial crisis. After a two-year investigation, the SFO has concluded there is \u201cno evidence of criminality\u201d related to the emerging lending measures that the BoE took, to prevent the financial markets seizing up. This all relates to the liquidity auctions which the BoE ran in 2007 and 2008, which gave UK banks access to desperately needed capital following the credit crunch, and the subsequent collapse of Lehman Brothers. The SFO had been looking into whether any assistance was given to certain financial institutions to enable them to bid successfully for the available funding, to the possible detriment of other institutions. Surprise inflation data from Canada have sent the Canadian dollar sliding. Consumer prices across Canada fell by 0.2% during May (on a seasonally adjusted basis0) due to falling goods and energy prices. That dragged the annual inflation rate down to just 1.3%, down from 1.6% in April (and much weaker than Britain\u2019s 2.9% inflation rate). Economists had expected a smaller fall, to 1.5%. The Canadian dollar promptly fell to 75.23 cents against the US dollar, from 75.6, as traders concluded that this creates less pressure to raise interest rates. \u201cTaking back control\u201d was a key message for the campaign to leave the EU last year. And today, the European Central Bank has launched a new bid to take control of the euro clearing market, currently centred in London. The clearing market is the point in the system where derivatives contracts are settled. It is meant to reduce financial risk, by using central counterparties who can prevent one default triggering a wave of forced sales and margin calls. The ECB has proposed adjusting its statute, to give it authority to oversee the clearing of euro-demominated securities. That could be the prelude to moving the market into the eurozone, or more control over activities in London. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: London is facing renewed pressure over its dominance of the \u20ac1tn (\u00a3880bn) a day euro clearing market after the European Central Bank set out proposals aimed at giving it more oversight of the lucrative business. The move by the Frankfurt-based ECB - the central bank for the 19 countries using the euro - follows a report by the European commission which called for the EU to have more powers over clearing of financial products denominated in euros after Brexit. The City dominates the market of clearing, a process which is supposed to reduce the risks of complex financial transactions by matching buyers and sellers as well as reduce the cost of trading, through so-called central counterparties (CCPs)..... Meanwhile, the Greek government has dispatched two top ministers abroad on an investment drive. It\u2019s an attempt to capitalise on the momentum of last week\u2019s euro group decision to throw the country a fresh financial credit line. Helena Smith reports from Athens Both the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and the economics and development minister Dimitris Papadimitriou have flown to London and the US respectively in a bid to attract investors. Tsakalotos, who was raised in Britain, is, say officials, on a mission to persuade interlocutors that Greece is now on a path of recovery, with a clear stretch ahead of it, following last week\u2019s crucial decision to disburse a further \u20ac8.5bn euro in rescue funds to avert default. Papadimitiou, long-time economics professor at Bard College, has been in New York with leading businessmen and Geoffrey Pyatt, the US ambassador to Greece, attending the sixth Greek investment programme whose working title is \u201cGreece at a turning point.\u201d It is hoped that both visits will increase appetite for bonds now that yields have dropped markedly since the euro group decision. Foreign investment, though once a dirty word for prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government, is seen as imperative for kick-starting the economy \u2013 and tackling an unemployment rate of 23%. Economists say that budget cut savings are simply not enough after eight years of gruelling austerity to spur growth. Just in: the UK public\u2019s inflation expectations have risen slightly, as the Bank of England argues over whether to raise interest rates or not. The public now expect inflation to average 3.1% in the long term, up from 3.0% a month ago. Expectations for the year ahead have inched a little higher too, to 2.62%. Inflation actually hit 2.9% last month, and some economists see it heading higher. But Christian Schulz, economist at Citi, says the survey doesn\u2019t suggest the BoE should aggressively hike interest rates: \u201cExpectations are close to long-run averages, but strong upward momentum that would call for urgent monetary tightening is absent in our view\u201d Outgoing BoE policymaker Kristin Forbes may not agree. Last night, she gave a speech arguing that the Bank is \u2018behind the curve\u2019 and suggesting that some policymakers were too hesitant to raise borrowing costs. The price of copper has jumped to a two-month high, helped by this morning\u2019s strong eurozone data. One tonne of copper jumped by 1.5% to $5,827, the highest level since early April. Banske Bank analyst Jens Pedersen says (via Reuters): \u201cPositive sentiment around China and a rise in manufacturing PMIs out of Europe are supporting base metals prices.\u201d Attention, eurozone crisis watchers. The BBC World Service covering the Greek debt crisis, looking at this month\u2019s bailout and the long-term cost of austerity It includes contributions from our Athens correspondent Helena Smith, and is being streamed here: Greece: a Long Road to Recovery Here\u2019s the pitch: Greece has been through dark economic times over the past decade. Last week a European Union loan of 8.5bn Euros enabled Greece to meet its latest debt payments. The IMF says this deal will help Greece stand on its own feet again over the course of the next year. But after the years of austerity and hardship, do the Greek people believe this will do anything to improve their lives? For Newshour Extra this week, Owen Bennett Jones is in Athens to discuss the consequences of living with long-term austerity and the prognosis for economic recovery. Back on the Brexit anniversary....analysts are pointing out that there\u2019s a notable shift between the fortunes of UK-focused companies, and those with an international outlook. Those multinational firms have enjoyed a real surge in their value, up 28% in the last year, as the weak pound boosts the value of their overseas earning. But UK-centric firms have actually fallen in value, by 5% in sterling terms, due to worries over the UK economy Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG in the UK, has crunched the numbers: \u201cThe KPMG Non-UK 50, which represents the largest companies with more than 70% of their market outside the UK, is up a remarkable 28% since the EU referendum - significantly outperforming the world\u2019s largest indices, while the FTSE 100 climbed 17% over the same period. In contrast, the KPMG UK50, which represents the largest FTSE companies with over 70% of their market in the UK, is down 5%. Put in pounds and pence, this equates to a \u00a3330 billion rise in the value of the KPMG Non-UK50 and a \u00a319 billion loss for their domestic equivalent. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital has shown how mining companies (Glencore and Antofagasta), consumer giants (Unilever and Diageo) and banks (HSBC) have driven the rally. Over in parliament, a delicious battle is brewing over the top job on the Treasury select committee, one of the most powerful oversight roles in Westminster. Several MPs have a burning desire to succeed Andrew Tyrie, the former chair, who stepped down as an MP at the general election. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the eurosceptic, old-school Tory, is keen, and had been seen as a front-runner. But he\u2019s now facing a challenge from former minister Nicky Morgan, a fellow Conservative, who has thrown her hat into the ring this morning: Rees-Mogg is one of those politicians who divides opinions, and there are signs that some MPs are determined to thwart him. The Financial Times reports this morning that a Stop Mogg campaign is underway. Some Labour MPs are organising to thwart Mr Rees-Mogg, although they have not yet decided who to support. \u201cThe idea is to simply stop Mogg,\u201d said one Labour MP. \u201cIt almost doesn\u2019t matter who the candidate is, we just don\u2019t want him.\u201d They argue that his role at Somerset Capital Management could pose a conflict of interests. Many also believe that as an ardent supporter of the UK leaving the EU he may not pursue sufficient scrutiny of the government\u2019s Brexit plans. Wes Streeting, who has served on the TSC for the last couple of years (alongside Rees-Mogg), says he\u2019s backing Morgan.. Sterling is marking the first anniversary of the EU referendum with a small rally. The pound is up half a cent against the US dollar at $1.2728. That means it\u2019s still worth 14% less than before the Brexit vote, after a year of heightened volatility. And with Brexit talks getting underway in Brussels, the pound still looks exposed to further twists and turns. Graham Bishop, Investment Director at Heartwood Investment Management explains: \u201cSterling\u2019s devaluation in response to the shock UK referendum result has been the most significant market event in recent years. It has yet to materially recover from its post-referendum low and now remains vulnerable to even more political and economic uncertainty. Paul McNamara of asset management firm GAM shows how the UK has been the worst-performing major currency over the last year: Katie Martin of the FT has dug deep into the Bloomberg terminal, and found a couple of currencies who did even worst than the pound (the Congolese franc and the Uzbekistan soum) Tara Cunningham of the Telegraph shows how the FTSE has benefitted from the pound\u2019s weakness: Eurozone stock markets are all down this morning, as the PMIs fail to spark much enthusiasm in the City. The FTSE 100 has shed 30 points, or 0.4%, to 7410. That means the Footsie is on track for its third weekly loss in a row for the first time this year, after energy stocks and mining stocks slipped. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: It\u2019s been a pretty bleak week for the UK index, shedding around 150 points from Tuesday\u2019s intraday peak as the latest oil crisis drew focus from the sterling-sapping/FTSE-boosting political uncertainty that was the main market driver in the previous fortnight. Here\u2019s Julien Lafargue, european equities strategist at the J.P. Morgan Private Bank, on today\u2019s eurozone PMI report: The macroeconomic momentum appears to have eased somewhat in June, in particular in the Services sector. In light of the sharp improvement we have witnessed in the past 9 months, this pause is not really a surprise and, in our opinion, should not be interpreted as an indication that the economy is about to roll over. Activity in the Eurozone remains at very healthy levels and consumer confidence is at its highest level in 16 years. In addition, despite the recent drop in commodity prices, inflation dynamics remain supported by a large backlog and supplier delivery delays worsening to the greatest extent for just over six years. As such, we believe the ECB could adopt a relatively more hawkish stance in the coming months. The eurozone\u2019s private sector has recorded its strongest quarterly growth since the debt crisis began, although growth has slowed a little this month. That\u2019s the upshot from Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck on factories and service sector firms across the euro area. Markit\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 eurozone PMI for June has dropped to 55.7, down from 56.8 in May, and weaker than the City had expected. But still, the average PMI over the last three months is the strongest quarter since 2011 [this includes this morning\u2019s figures from Germany and France] Markit says: Although the rate of growth waned to a five-month low, high order book inflows and elevated levels of business confidence meant job creation remained one of the strongest recorded over the past decade as firms continued to expand capacity to meet rising demand. Price pressures eased, however, largely reflecting lower global commodity prices. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson says the figures suggest eurozone growth has accelerated to a robust 0.7% in the current quarter, up from 0.6% in Q1. He adds: The upturn is also broad-based, with the surveys signalling an acceleration of GDP growth in both France and Germany in the second quarter, as well as across the rest of the region as a whole, albeit with some loss of momentum seen across the board in June. \u201cJob creation continued to run at one of the highest rates seen over the past decade as firms expanded capacity to meet demand. Factory jobs growth remained particularly buoyant, thanks in part to production requirements surging higher on the back of rising exports. Germany \u2018flash PMI\u2019 is just out, and it shows that private sector growth in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy is slowing a little. The German composite PMI has dropped to a four-month low of 56.1 this month. That\u2019s down from 57.4 in May, but it still signals solid growth (the 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction). Firms reported that output grew sharply, but new export orders slowed to the slowest growth rate since February. Trevor Balchin, senior economist at IHS Markit, says the figures suggest Germany is still enjoying \u201cstrong economic growth\u201d, although the service sector is falling behind manufacturing. \u201cThe latest data signalled a growing performance gap between manufacturing and services, however. The goods-producing sector continued to outperform, with the headline PMI little-changed from May\u2019s 73-month record. Although growth of manufacturing output, exports and jobs all eased slightly since May, expansions in backlogs and total new orders gathered pace and supply bottlenecks intensified. Another boost for France! French companies are creating jobs at the fastest rate since the financial crisis. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, whose \u2018flash\u2019 purchasing managers report for June, just released, shows that private sector employment has jumped at the fastest rate in almost 10 years. Markit says: Buoyed by strong client demand, private sector firms in France raised their staffing numbers for an eighth successive month in June. Furthermore, the rate of job creation was the most marked in just under ten years. The increase was broad-based across both the manufacturing and service sectors. The PMI report shows that French factories picked up this month, pushing the Manufacturing PMI up to 55.0 from 53.8 in May. But services sector growth slowed, pulling the Services PMI down to 55.3 from 57.2 in May. That\u2019s a five-month low, but still shows steady growth. Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit says: \u201cA particularly upbeat talking point highlighted in the latest data was the sharpest rise in employment for almost ten years. This is welcome news for the newly elected government which has made reducing unemployment one of the main aims of its administration. The slowdown in the rate of accumulation in unfinished work poses a slight concern however, and may slow employment growth in the short-term. Howard Archer of EY Item Club is also impressed by France\u2019s GDP: Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi is encouraged by the upgraded French growth figures: Newsflash: France\u2019s economy grew faster than previously thought in the first three months of this year. French Q1 GDP has just been revised, to show that the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy expanded by 0.5% in the quarter. That\u2019s up from a previous estimate of 0.4%, and means France comfortably outpaced Britain (which grew by 0.2%) and wasn\u2019t far behind Germany ( which posted 0.6% growth). France\u2019s growth was driven by business investment - or gross fixed capital formation - which jumped by 1.2% in the quarter. Inventory changes also added 0.7% to growth, as companies restocked their warehouses. But net trade was a drag, though, as exports fell 0.7% during the quarter while imports rose by 1.2%. And household consumption was flat. But still, it shows that this spring\u2019s presidential election didn\u2019t spook the economy, and it gives Emmanuel Macron a decent starting point to build on. Reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll learn whether European companies are enjoying a blistering June, as data firm Markit releases its latest \u2018flash\u2019 purchasing managers indexes. These PMIs track activity, output and job creation among private companies, and are expected to show another month of decent growth as Europe\u2019s recovery continues. The overall eurozone composite PMI is expected to come in at 56.6, down a little on May\u2019s 56.8, but still a strong number -- anything over 50 shows growth. Inflation is also on everyone\u2019s mind; this afternoon, Canada will release its consumer prices index. Economists expect it to drop to 1.5%, from 1.6%, as the recent oil price falls feed through to the real economy. We\u2019ll also be tracking reaction to a damning official report into the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. It warns that Britain will be locked into subsidising the \u201crisky and expensive\u201d project for decades My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: The National Audit Office said the contract sealed by ministers last September with EDF to construct the country\u2019s first new atomic reactors in two decades would provide \u201cuncertain strategic and economic benefits\u201d. Further, Brexit and Theresa May\u2019s decision to quit an EU nuclear treaty could make the situation even worse, by triggering taxpayer compensation for EDF or a more generous deal for the French state-controlled company. It\u2019s not been the most thrilling week in the markets, and I fear that the European bourses may be rather quiet again today. Britain\u2019s FTSE is expected to dip by around 0.1% in early trading.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London is facing renewed pressure over its dominance of the \u20ac1tn (\u00a3880bn)-a-day euro clearing market after the European Central Bank set out proposals aimed at giving it more oversight of the lucrative business. The move by the Frankfurt-based ECB \u2013 the central bank for the 19 countries using the euro \u2013 follows a report by the European commission that called for the EU to have more powers over clearing of financial products denominated in euros after Brexit. The City dominates the market in clearing, a process which is supposed to reduce the risks in complex financial transactions by matching buyers and sellers as well as reducing the cost of trading, through the use of clearing houses. The business has been hotly contested since the EU referendum a year ago, when Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, warned that 100,000 jobs across the UK were at risk if the City lost the ability to process euro-denominated transactions. In an announcement on Friday, the ECB said its governing council was setting out a recommendation to have more oversight of the business. Using the technical term for clearing houses \u2013 central counterparties \u2013 the ECB made clear that London was in its regulatory sights, as it demanded \u201cclear legal competence in the area of central clearing\u201d. The bank said: \u201cThese powers include a significantly enhanced role for central banks of issue in the supervisory system of central counterparties, in particular with regard to the recognition and supervision of systemically important third-country CCPs clearing significant amounts of euro-denominated transactions.\u201d It builds upon the report from the European commission earlier this month which fell short of forcing the relocation of euro clearing after Brexit but would allow tougher regulation of \u201csystemically\u201d important amounts of trade being conducted by clearing houses outside the remaining 27 members of the EU. In a speech this week, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, outlined the scale of the clearing market. He said the London Clearing House (LCH) clears swaps \u2013 a form of financial instrument \u2013 in 18 currencies for companies in 55 jurisdictions, handling more than 90% of cleared interest rate swaps globally and 98% of all cleared swaps in euros. He argued that pushing business through clearing houses reduced the risks in the markets. \u201cPrior to the crisis, derivative transactions created a complex, opaque \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 web of exposures that helped turn a shock into a panic,\u201d Carney said the speech to an audience at the Mansion House. He said clearing houses also reduced the cost of business. \u201cAny development which prevented EU27 firms from continuing to clear trades in the UK would split liquidity between a less liquid onshore market for EU firms and a more liquid offshore market for everyone else,\u201d he added, warning that the costs would be passed on to households and businesses. The argument about where euro clearing should take place raged even before the referendum. George Osborne, when he was chancellor, had taken the matter to the court to fight an attempt by the ECB to argue that clearing houses \u2013 such as the LCH \u2013 should be based in the eurozone when they handle trades in euros. In 2015, the general court of the EU had ruled that the ECB did not have the power to demand such a move. The euro clearing issue is one of many competitive threats to the City in the wake of the Brexit vote. Europe\u2019s pre-eminent financial centre is also battling to retain major investment banks \u2013 from Goldman Sachs to UBS \u2013 that are openly considering moving British-based operations to the EU.",

    "webTitle": "Risk of air accidents up after CAA cost-cutting, leaked report warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Cost-cutting and an overstretched workforce at the Civil Aviation Authority have increased the risk of air accidents in Britain, according to a leaked internal report drafted by the air safety regulator but never released. Inspectors at the CAA, which oversees flight safety, warned bosses that they did not have the resources to do their job properly, the draft report shows. There were \u201csignificant weaknesses\u201d in the CAA\u2019s safety division, including the monitoring of flight training and the licensing of pilots, the report said. The provisional report \u2013 produced by the CAA\u2019s head of strategy and safety assurance at the request of senior directors but never published \u2013 warned that the problems it identified were \u201cthose most likely to feature as contributory causal factors in aircraft accidents\u201d. A staff survey detailed within the report showed that fewer than 10% of employees believed their colleagues had time to undertake important safety activities to an acceptable standard. Fewer than 20% of staff agreed that all of the organisation\u2019s important safety functions were adequately covered and that activities were \u201csufficient to assure ourselves that we are protecting the safety of the public\u201d. Damning findings in the safety assurance review included: \u2022 A large number of licences issued to pilots contained errors. \u2022 The CAA was failing to properly oversee flight training organisations. \u2022 \u201cSignificant staff reductions \u2026 have led in some cases to insufficient access to expertise.\u201d \u2022 Important safety activities required by the European Aviation Safety Agency (the EU regulator) were \u201csignificantly behind schedule\u201d. \u2022 The CAA\u2019s \u201ccapability does not match the true demands\u201d. The review and survey was proposed by the CAA\u2019s safety action group and commissioned by safety director Mark Swan, amid a shakeup of the CAA. The group proposed the review \u201cto ensure that the organisation continued to be fit for purpose to deliver effective safety oversight\u201d. While the review rated the overall fitness for purpose of the safety division as \u201cadequate\u201d, it found that \u201cin all areas reviewed, there is evidence that the resources available \u2026 are at minimum levels. There is a general lack of resilience.\u201d It added: \u201cThe areas that appear to be currently suffering the most are those most critical to protect public safety.\u201d Questions had been raised about the CAA regime by accident investigators in the wake of the Shoreham airshow crash in August 2015, in which 11 people were killed after a plane crashed while attempting a stunt. The official report by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) revealed that the CAA had inspected just 2.8% of the airshows it approved in 2014, and did not require to see or approve risk assessments before permitting the Shoreham show to go ahead. Although the CAA was not directly affected by government cuts, it was pressured by ministers to embrace more \u201clight-touch regulation\u201d, especially with regards to general aviation, which includes airshows. Grant Shapps, at the time a minister without portfolio, had demanded the \u201cminimum necessary burden\u201d for private flying in a so-called red-tape challenge to the CAA in 2013. The chief executive of the CAA, Andrew Haines, was appointed in 2009 with a brief to modernise the agency, and was incentivised to complete a transformation programme that saw the wage bill slashed. The regulator is funded by the airlines and operators it regulates, which have lobbied to lower the charges. The CAA pledged to freeze all its fees and charges, the source of its revenues, for three years in 2011 and by 2013 said it would be saving the equivalent of 120 full-time jobs. Insiders claim that pressure to run the authority as a commercial enterprise has diminished the CAA\u2019s capacity to monitor safety. A significant number of highly trained and experienced staff in the safety division have left the CAA in recent years. The union representing safety inspectors said a significant number of its members had left the CAA. Steve Jary, national secretary, aviation, at Prospect, said: \u201cPut simply, they are no longer confident that they can do their job \u2013 keeping the public safe. But they can\u2019t speak out: about 30 have left with confidentiality agreements in their exit packages.\u201d A spokesperson for the CAA said: \u201cThe UK has one of the best air safety records in the world, and the CAA is recognised as one of the world\u2019s leading aviation regulators. \u201cWe are subject to rigorous independent safety audits by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). \u201cTheir audits show the CAA is consistently performing to a very high standard, in compliance with our regulatory duties, and often provides best practice guidance for Europe and other parts of the world \u2013 helping to protect UK citizens wherever they are travelling. \u201cIn addition, we assess our own performance. The 2014 safety assurance review was commissioned to ensure our regulatory oversight was responding to both current and emerging safety risks. The results helped to inform changes in how we organise our work and how we communicate within the organisation. \u201cWe have consistently protected frontline safety roles at a time when other parts of the public sector have had to undertake drastic cuts.\u201d",

There is a general lack of resilience.\u201d </p> <p>It added: \u201cThe areas that appear to be currently suffering the most are those most critical to protect public safety.\u201d<br></p> <p>Questions had been raised about the CAA regime by accident investigators in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shoreham-air-show-crash\">Shoreham airshow crash in August 2015</a>, in which 11 people were killed after a plane crashed while attempting a stunt. </p> <p>The official report by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) revealed that the CAA had inspected just 2.8% of the airshows it approved in 2014, and did not require to see or approve risk assessments before permitting the Shoreham show to go ahead. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2015/aug/24/shoreham-airshow-crash-everything-we-know-so-far\">What happened at the Shoreham airshow crash?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the CAA was not directly affected by government cuts, it was pressured by ministers to embrace more \u201clight-touch regulation\u201d, especially with regards to general aviation, which includes airshows. </p> <p>Grant Shapps, at the time a minister without portfolio, had demanded the \u201cminimum necessary burden\u201d for private flying in a so-called <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/red-tape-to-be-slashed-for-aviation-sector\">red-tape challenge</a> to the CAA in 2013.</p> <p>The chief executive of the CAA, Andrew Haines, was appointed in 2009 with a brief to modernise the agency, and was incentivised to complete a transformation programme that saw the wage bill slashed. </p> <p>The regulator is funded by the airlines and operators it regulates, which have lobbied to lower the charges. The CAA pledged to freeze all its fees and charges, the source of its revenues, for three years in 2011 and by 2013 said it would be saving the equivalent of 120 full-time jobs.</p> <p>Insiders claim that pressure to run the authority as a commercial enterprise has diminished the CAA\u2019s capacity to monitor safety. A significant number of highly trained and experienced staff in the safety division have left the CAA in recent years. <br></p> <p>The union representing safety inspectors said a significant number of its members had left the CAA. </p> <p>Steve Jary, national secretary, aviation, at Prospect, said: \u201cPut simply, they are no longer confident that they can do their job \u2013 keeping the public safe. But they can\u2019t speak out: about 30 have left with confidentiality agreements in their exit packages.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the CAA said: \u201cThe UK has one of the best air safety records in the world, and the CAA is recognised as one of the world\u2019s leading aviation regulators. </p> <p>\u201cWe are subject to rigorous independent safety audits by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). </p> <p>\u201cTheir audits show the CAA is consistently performing to a very high standard, in compliance with our regulatory duties, and often provides best practice guidance for Europe and other parts of the world \u2013 helping to protect UK citizens wherever they are travelling.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition, we assess our own performance. The 2014 safety assurance review was commissioned to ensure our regulatory oversight was responding to both current and emerging safety risks. The results helped to inform changes in how we organise our work and how we communicate within the organisation. </p> <p>\u201cWe have consistently protected frontline safety roles at a time when other parts of the public sector have had to undertake drastic cuts.\u201d</p>",

The monthly snapshot from the CBI found that export and total order books were both at their highest for decades \u2013 providing some hope that a stronger manufacturing sector would cushion the effect of higher inflation on consumer spending. The employers\u2019 organisation said that particularly strong performances by the food, drink, tobacco and chemicals industries had spearheaded a pick-up in orders in 13 of the 17 industrial sub-sectors tracked each month. As a result, the balance of companies reporting that order books were above normal rose from +9 percentage points in May to +16 points in June \u2013 the highest since the height of the late 1980s boom in August 1988. The balance for export orders rose from +10 points to +13 points \u2013 the joint highest in 22 years. But the CBI warned that manufacturers were still being affected by rising prices. The balance of companies expecting prices to rise in the coming months remained unchanged at +23 points between May and June, but was up from +1 point a year ago. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s manufacturers are continuing to see demand for \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 goods rise with the temperature. Total and export order books are at highs not seen for decades, and output growth remains robust. \u201cNevertheless, with cost pressures remaining elevated, it\u2019s no surprise to see that manufacturers continue to have high expectations for the prices they plan to charge. \u201cTo build the right future for Britain\u2019s economy, manufacturers and workers, the government must put the economy first as it negotiates the country\u2019s departure from the EU. This approach will deliver a deal that supports growth and raises living standards across the UK.\u201d Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said UK manufacturing was poised to record a strong performance in the second quarter of 2017. \u201cToday\u2019s strong survey supports our view that solid manufacturing and export growth will help to offset the slowdown in consumer spending growth this year,\u201d he said.",
