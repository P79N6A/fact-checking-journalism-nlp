      "bodyText": "An Albany-area Walmart employee fired from his job for redeeming $2 worth of cans he collected while gathering shopping carts in the store\u2019s parking lot has drawn widespread sympathy and support on social media. Thomas Smith, 52, told the Albany Times Union that he was fired in early November for redeeming a total of $5.10 worth of cans and bottles on two occasions, and said he was unaware that doing so violated store policy. Support for Smith grew after a story on his termination from the Albany Times Union. A GoFundMe drive for Smith set up by Dounya Hamdan, of Chicago, has nearly reached the $5,000 goal as of Friday afternoon. On the day he was fired, Smith, a formerly homeless ex-convict who has a learning disability, had stayed three hours past the normal end of his shift, having agreed to work extra time on a day when the East Greenbush, New York, store was short-staffed. A Walmart spokesperson said the store did not take issue with the $3.10 worth of empty beer cans he took after a man discarded them in the parking lot, but with the $2 he redeemed from cans and bottles left in a shopping cart just inside the store\u2019s entryway. Smith said he was fired after signing a statement and undergoing an interrogation by three security managers in the store\u2019s security office. He said that he did not have his glasses at the time and could not read the statement, but signed it to avoid any parole violation. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t take empties left behind. They were garbage,\u201d Smith told the Albany Times Union. \u201cI didn\u2019t even get a chance to explain myself. They told me to turn in my badge.\u201d The $2 worth of bottles and cans were Walmart property, the spokesperson said. Smith was guilty of \u201cgross misconduct\u201d by redeeming them. Smith, who is black, has since contacted prisoner advocate Alice Green at the Center for Law and Justice in Albany, who took up his cause, citing issues of race as reasons for Smith\u2019s termination.",

With the big Paris department stores, Printemps and Galeries Lafayette, reporting footfall down by between 30% and 50%, Draghi all but confirmed that the ECB would step up its efforts to stimulate growth and lower unemployment. Analysts believe that the attacks on Paris removed any lingering doubts that the central bank would act on 3 December. Draghi is expected to announce that the ECB will increase its quantitative easing programme from \u20ac60bn (\u00a342bn) to \u20ac80bn a month, with the additional possibility of cuts in interest rates. Draghi told a banking conference in Frankfurt that the recovery in the eurozone was the weakest since 1998, the year before the single currency was launched. He added that it took between five and eight quarters for the countries now making up the eurozone to recover their pre-recession level of real output after the slumps of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, but it would take until early 2016 - 31 quarters - before it returned to the levels of output before the global recession of 2008. \u201cPutting the whole picture together, we have a situation where we cannot yet say with confidence that the process of economic repair in the euro area is complete.\u201d Consumer confidence in the eurozone picked up between October and November, but the survey was almost complete before the Paris attacks. Didier Chenet, president of the national union of hoteliers, restaurateurs and cafe-owners, told Le Figaro his members had seen \u201can avalanche of cancellations\u201d since Saturday. Paris hotels in particular have been badly hit: \u201cThey are spending their days picking up the phone to hear customers saying they are no longer coming.\u201d Georges Panayotis of the specialist MKG Group consultancy said: \u201cThings are going to be very difficult for the tourism industry in the coming days and weeks. The sector is going to suffer. I think it could be worse than after Charlie Hebdo. What happened is huge; the whole world\u2019s eyes are on Paris.\u201d Luxury hotels like the Georges V or Plaza Athenee could be hardest hit since their clientele is very sensitive to security. \u201cTourist flows to Europe are likely to fall sharply in the coming weeks, in the crucial period running up to Christmas,\u201d analysts at investment firm Bryan, Garnier said in a note. The CDF traders\u2019 confederation described \u201ca significant falloff in sales\u201d of around 10% for smaller, mainly local firms and as much as 50% for big stores.",

      "bodyText": "Nationwide is predicting a correction in the London housing market after the British property boom helped it post a 34% increase in first half profits. The UK\u2019s second largest mortgage lender said it did not expect a price shock in the capital, which has driven a surge in the wider housing market, but pointed to a likely price \u201cmoderation\u201d in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a natural correction in prices in London,\u201d said Graham Beale, Nationwide chief executive. Beale said house price growth in London was unsustainable because it is outstripping wages. According to Nationwide, the average London house price at the end of September was \u00a3443,399, up 10.6% on the previous year, more than three times the rate of national pay growth. For the UK as a whole, prices averaged \u00a3195,733, 3.8% up on the previous year. \u201cNationally we\u2019ve got wages going up around 3% and prices going up by around the same amount but in London the appreciation is significantly ahead of the national average. It\u2019s in low double digits. There will be a point where people can not afford to buy at these levels. There will be a natural dampening.\u201d Beale said he expected prices in the rest of the country to remain stable, with demand outstripping the supply of new homes and keeping price rises at up to 4%. \u201cWhereas last year we had the uncertainty of the vote in Scotland and the general election, this year there\u2019s a lot more certainty.\u201d He said he did not expect the run-up to the referendum on Europe to affect housing sentiment. \u201cWhether we vote in or out, I think the UK housing market is largely a domestic one.\u201d Nationwide\u2019s first-half figures were helped by a \u00a31.8bn (14%) increase in its residential mortgage lending, taking the total amount lent to customers to a record \u00a314.9bn. The announcement comes a day after the Council of Mortgage Lenders said borrowing by British homeowners had reached its highest level since 2008. Earlier this week, Nationwide revealed that the BT Openreach chief executive, Joe Garner, would become its new chief executive next year in place of Beale, who had announced his intention to step down in May. After what will probably be his last set of results, Beale took the opportunity to look back at the way the market has changed since the 1990s, and in particular lamented the demise of much of the mutual building society network. \u201cIf you look at all those institutions that converted in the first half of the 1990s, such as Halifax, Abbey, Woolwich, Bradford &amp; Bingley, not one of them has been successful as a bank. In fact there have been some spectacular failures. \u201cI would argue that we serve a social purpose to provide a safe home for savers and we do not engage in high risk activities.\u201d Given Nationwide\u2019s status as a mutual, Beale said he was disappointed with the chancellor\u2019s decision to include it in the introduction of the tax surcharge on banking companies announced in the budget. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make noises,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we all know that the chancellor has limited capacity to vary the budget. But at some point in the future I do hope that he can differentiate between mutuals and non-mutuals.\u201d Nationwide reckons the tax could cost it \u00a3300m over 5 years. \u201cNationwide is not a bank and serves a social purpose of facilitating home ownership and promoting a savings culture,\u201d says Beale. \u201cThe tax surcharge will have a disproportionate effect on building societies and we believe that it represents a missed opportunity to support diversity in UK financial services.\u201d Beale, who has been chief executive for nine years, says he will start to look seriously at what he does next soon. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be looking at non-executive positions but I need to rebalance the work and life components of my life.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never felt as confident or optimistic for the future of this organisation. It\u2019s a great place to be.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain is poised for its biggest ever day of shopping next week, with consumers set to mark the Black Friday sales spree by spending as much as \u00a32bn in a single day. Retailers across the country will cut prices on 27 November, as a shopping tradition launched in the US becomes a fixture in the British high street calendar. Spending nearly \u00a32bn in a single day is equivalent to \u00a383m every hour, \u00a31.4m every minute and more than \u00a323,000 every second. It would mean that every person in UK spends an average of \u00a331 on shopping on Black Friday. Last year British shoppers spent \u00a31.75bn, according to Visa. The retailers involved in Black Friday stretch from Amazon, John Lewis and Currys PC World, who all offered deals last year, to Starbucks, Dyson and Johnsons Dry Cleaning. However, some companies are scaling back the promotions they offer on Black Friday after chaotic scenes at stores last year and concerns that the event is simply dragging Christmas sales forward, thereby hurting profits as goods are sold at a discount rather than at full price. Argos has tried to spread its deals throughout November with \u201cred, white and blue Fridays\u201d and a \u201c12 days of amazing deals\u201d promotion leading up to Black Friday. However, its website has already crashed twice under the weight of demand. On Friday, Argos was forced to issue an apology on Twitter after its website went down on the first day it began promoting its Black Friday deals. Andy Clarke, the chief executive of Asda, said that customers had told the supermarket chain \u201cloud and clear that they don\u2019t want to be held hostage to a day or two of sales\u201d. Instead of focusing on Black Friday, Asda says it will invest \u00a326m in cutting the price of food and drink through the festive period. Tesco will delay opening times for its biggest supermarkets on Black Friday to try to prevent a repeat of chaotic scenes last year when police were called to more than a dozen stores. Its shops will open at 5am rather than midnight, with its chief executive, Dave Lewis, saying he wanted to take the \u201cfrenzy\u201d out of the occasion. Nonetheless, Visa Europe has predicted that spending will rise 17% online on Black Friday compared with last year, and 4% in stores. This would result in a record \u00a31.91bn being spent in total, including \u00a31.19bn face-to-face and \u00a3721m online. However, the \u00a32bn level could be breached if the event repeats last year\u2019s buying surge, which smashed all forecasts. Google Trends data shows the number of searches for Black Friday is 3.4 times ahead of 2014. Kevin Jenkins, managing director of UK and Ireland at Visa Europe, said: \u201cThis is shaping up to be a huge weekend, online and in-store, for retailers. \u201cIt will be a tale of two different golden hours on the day. On the high street, we\u2019ll see a huge lunchtime rush. Online, the commuter hour will see the highest levels of buying, confirming the growing number of people who think mobile first for shopping.\u201d According to Visa, a further \u00a3629m will be spent online on Monday 30 November as shoppers use their last pay cheque before Christmas to buy presents. This day is known as Cyber Monday because it was the biggest online shopping day of the year until Black Friday overtook it last year. Amazon is offering 7,000 deals on Black Friday, more than double last year, when it generated 5.5m orders in a single day. The US online retailer was the first company to officially bring Black Friday to the UK in 2010, before Asda, which is owned by Walmart, started offering deals within stores in 2013. Black Friday takes place the day after Thanksgiving in the US. The discounts are used in the US to encourage households to get back into shops after the holidays, and it kickstarts the Christmas shopping period. However, critics say Black Friday serves no purpose in the UK. Evidence suggests that rather than generating extra sales, shoppers simply delay spending in October or bring forward planned purchases from December. Retail sales in October were down 0.2% on a like-for-like basis compared with the same month last year, according to the British Retail Consortium\u2019s retail sales monitor. Meanwhile, online sales rose just 8.9%, the lowest growth recorded in October since monitoring of internet retailing began 15 years ago. Analysts at Panmure Gordon pointed out that although footfall on the high street rose 10.6% on the week of Black Friday last year, it then dropped 3.3% the week after. The Boxing Day sales also suffered, with a 12.6% year-on-year decline in footfall on the high street. Martin Summerscales, head of retail consultancy at CBRE, said this year could see Black Friday reach its peak in the UK. He said: \u201cThis year could mark a turning point on strategy for Black Friday in the UK. Until now, retailers have followed a model popularised in the US, predicated around deep discounting on a small number of lines. \u201cThis has shone the focus on the negative aspects of the phenomenon, failing to make significant enough financial gain to counter the expense. Retailers are seriously reassessing their approach. For instance, we may see stores scale back on the bigger ticket discounts but spreading these across a wider range.\u201d However, retailers may find it is too late to row back on offering Black Friday deals. Around 8.6% of consumers plan to do all their Christmas shopping on Black Friday, including 18% of 18-to-34 year olds, while 8.1% plan to take the day off to snap up discounts. Almost one in 10 shoppers fear they will spend more that they can afford on Black Friday, a survey by consultancy firm Conlumino found. Greg Bromley at Conlumino said: \u201cThe consumer appetite for Black Friday bargains is evident ahead of the big day at the end of November. \u201cThe fact that nearly one in10 consumers fears they will spend more than they can afford on Black Friday suggests the more serious side to this type of shopping event, with cut-price promotions still tempting to consumers that may still be finding disposable incomes squeezed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is at risk of breaching his self-imposed ceiling on welfare spending if he makes concessions on plans to curb tax credits to hard-pressed families, Britain\u2019s leading thinktank on the public finances has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said unless the chancellor could find savings from elsewhere in the benefits bill, it looked likely that he would have to ask parliament to raise the welfare cap announced in the summer budget. Osborne is expected to use his autumn statement and spending review on Wednesday to revisit the decision to save \u00a34.5bn a year by limiting the tax credits that help those on low incomes. After Osborne announced his plans, the IFS said 3m households would lose an average of \u00a31,000 a year. But since the House of Lords voted to delay the cuts and to compensate those affected in full, the chancellor has been forced to think again. The IFS said, however, that watering down the planned changes would make it impossible for the chancellor to keep welfare spending below the cap of just over \u00a3115bn in 2016-17 unless the independent Office for Budget Responsibility unexpectedly changed its forecasts for the economy and the public finances. \u201cIf the OBR\u2019s forecasts were to remain unchanged but the chancellor had to unwind (or compensate for) some of his planned cuts to tax credits, then \u2013 without commensurate cuts elsewhere \u2013 he would breach his cap. Doing so would force him to go to parliament for a vote to raise the cap.\u201d The IFS said there were only two ways that Osborne might avoid the embarrassment of breaching his own cap next week. \u201cThe first is for him to find some alternative cuts to other spending within the welfare cap. This comprises mainly working-age benefit spending \u2013 such as child benefit, housing benefit and disability benefits \u2013 though does also include some benefits paid to pensioners, such as pension credit and the winter fuel allowance. Such cuts would presumably be ones that were considered but rejected in favour of the tax credit cuts in July.\u201d The only other way to avoid a Commons vote would be if the OBR reduced their forecast for welfare spending, since that would give the chancellor a \u201clittle more wiggle room under the cap\u201d. The thinktank added: \u201cIt will be interesting to watch next week how Mr Osborne navigates these treacherous waters and avoids the obstacles he constructed for himself.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "We are wrapping up for the day. It has been a quiet day on stock markets, but they are up and heading for their best week in a month \u2013 despite last Friday\u2019s terror attacks in Paris. The highlight in the eurozone was a speech in Frankfurt from ECB president Mario Draghi, who dropped strong hints that the central bank would cut its deposit rate and announce more economic stimulus through its asset purchase programme at its 3 December meeting. Over here in London, official figures showed the worst October for government borrowing in six years \u2013 a severe blow to George Osborne\u2019s deficit-cutting drive ahead of next Wednesday\u2019s spending review and autumn statement. Many thanks for all your comments. Have a great weekend. We\u2019ll be back on Monday. Indeed, this is what the European Commission says on its website: Only a tiny fraction of the underlying consumer interviews were carried out after the Paris terror attacks of Friday 13.\u201d Consumer sentiment improved more than expected this month, according to the flash estimate from the European Commission. Its indicator rose to -6 from -7.6 in October. In the EU as a whole, sentiment rose 1.3 points to -4.4. Stock markets are trading higher but it\u2019s a quiet day. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is 0.8% ahead while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.6% and the Nasdaq is up 0.5%. In London, the FTSE 100 index has gained 0.38%, while the Dax in Frankfurt is up 0.46% and the CAC in Paris has edged up 0.1%. Markets are on track for their best week in a month, despite last Friday\u2019s terror attacks in Paris. The Greek parliament passed a reform bill last night to secure the release of more bailout funds, but a final decision on the next tranche of loans may not come until Monday. Eurozone deputy finance ministers will discuss whether to disburse \u20ac2bn to pay state arrears and up to \u20ac10bn to recapitalise Greece\u2019s top four banks, and might hold a teleconference on Sunday, Reuters reported. Even though a compliance report from the European Commission was positive, it listed one reform as pending while three need to be followed up. A senior eurozone official told Reuters: I guess it\u2019s a done deal that they will get the 2+10 billion, but some of the milestones are still not yet completed today, so a couple more days are needed.\u201d Greece has published its final budget plan for 2016, in which the government is projecting a smaller contraction than previously forecast. The economy is now expected to shrink by 0.7% next year rather than 1.3%, after an estimate of zero growth this year, revised higher from a 2.3% decline. The budget, submitted by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos to parliament this morning, stuck to a primary surplus target of 0.5% of GDP in 2016, and pencilled in privatisation revenues of \u20ac1.9bn \u2013 lower than the \u20ac3.7bn target under its bailout. The government expects to tap bond markets in the second half of next year. Public debt is projected to rise to 187.8% of GDP in 2016, from 180.2% this year. Parliament will vote on the budget on 5 December, after it has been debated by the parliamentary finance committee in four sessions. The first one happens next Wednesday, and a general debate in parliament is scheduled for 1 December. It\u2019s a quiet day on the markets. Connor Campbell, financials analyst at spread-betting firm Spreadex, says: Things may change this afternoon with the flash eurozone consumer confidence figure likely to provide insight into the impact of last Friday\u2019s attacks in Paris. The one white market knight remaining this Friday is the US open; the Dow Jones is currently looking at a 50 to 60 point jump when the bell rings on Wall Street, something that may inspire a bit more vigour in the European indices. However, there is nothing, beyond a speech from New York Fed President William Dudley, this afternoon to help sustain (or impede) the Dow\u2019s current growth, meaning a quiet end to a complicated week may be on the cards.\u201d The euro is now down nearly half a percent against the dollar at $1.0679, after ECB president Mario Draghi strongly hinted at rate and QE action at the 3 December meeting. He used language reminiscent of his July 2012 pledge \u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. Today he said the ECB would \u201cdo what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible\u201d and pointed to the eurozone\u2019s slow economic recovery. It will take 31 quarters for economic output to get back to pre-crisis levels, and he expects this to happen early next year. Here is our full story on Britain\u2019s dire government borrowing figures. Katie Allen writes: George Osborne\u2019s deficit-cutting drive has been dealt a blow ahead of his spending review next week after official figures showed the worst October for the public finances in six years... The chancellor wants to eliminate the deficit on the public finances by the end of the decade. As part of that push, he will unveil plans in his spending review on 25 November to cut government department spending by around \u00a320bn over the next four years. Economists said the latest public finances suggest Osborne will miss his deficit-cutting goals for this year and that he will redouble austerity measures in next week\u2019s spending review and accompanying budget update, known as the autumn statement. Greece\u2019s two-year government bond yields have risen sharply, after Alexis Tsipras\u2019 coalition government\u2019s slim parliamentary majority shrank, sparking fears about political instability. The government lost two seats and can now only count on 153 votes in the 300-seat chamber. Two dissenters were expelled when Greece approved a reform bill last night to secure further bailout funds from its international lenders. Two-year yields rose 60 basis points earlier this morning and are now up 46 bps at 5.66%. While European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said this morning that the central bank stood ready to act on deposit rates and asset purchases to breathe life into the slowest economic recovery the eurozone has seen since 1998, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann \u2013 who spoke at the same event in Frankfurt \u2013 urged caution. He thinks the ECB should wait and see. I see no reason to talk down the economic outlook and paint a gloomy picture. We should also not forget that the monetary policy measures already taken still need time to fully feed into the economy.\u201d Ross Campbell, director for public policy at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, says: The government is seeing a lack of significant progress on reducing the deficit ahead of the autumn statement next week. This current trend could prove more problematic ahead for the chancellor. Our recent business confidence monitor suggests the economic recovery is slowing which could have an impact on tax revenues, which have been slowing and actually fell back year-on-year in October. At a time of constrained public finances, impending cuts and tight departmental budgets, the UK government still needs to modernise its approach to financial management. With further austerity measures due to be announced, a comprehensive financial review would ensure sustainability is at the heart of long-term decision making. What is needed is a modern finance ministry to ensure all aspects of financial management \u2013 income, expenditure, liabilities, and assets \u2013 are taken into account, not just spending.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says the figures were \u201ca little disappointing\u201d for the chancellor, and could mean some tough decisions at next week\u2019s spending review and autumn statement. Monthly data can be volatile, but the cumulative public borrowing total for the first seven months of the financial year was also only \u00a36.6 billion lower than a year earlier, as compared to an OBR forecast in July that borrowing for 2015/16 as a whole will be around \u00a320 billion lower than in 2014/15. Central government tax receipts have grown by 3% so far this financial year as compared to an OBR forecast of 3.6% for 2015/16 as a whole. Our estimates based on simple extrapolation from these data suggest that public borrowing could overshoot the OBR target by around \u00a35 billion this year. But we think there is still room for the Chancellor to make up this gap if self-assessment income tax receipts come in strongly in January and the Treasury pulls some levers to keep departmental spending under tighter control for the rest of the year. But it will be an uphill struggle. Overall, these figures show that the chancellor still has a long way to go to achieve his target of eliminating the budget deficit by 2019/20. They are likely to stiffen his resolve to take some tough decisions in his spending review and autumn statement next week, offsetting any softening of planned tax credit cuts through tax rises or additional spending cuts elsewhere.\u201d Ruth Miller, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the poor public finance figures limit the chancellor\u2019s room for manoeuvre in next Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement. Borrowing is still set to come in below last year\u2019s level, totaling \u00a354.3bn in the fiscal year so far, compared to \u00a360.9bn at the same stage last year. But, the OBR expected a faster decline than this. Indeed, assuming the trend so far this fiscal year continues, borrowing in 2015/16 as a whole looks set to come in at about \u00a380.4bn (from \u00a390.1bn in 2014/15), about \u00a310bn above the OBR\u2019s July\u2019s forecast. This higher starting point and a slightly weaker outlook for nominal GDP growth could well erode much of the \u00a310bn surplus in 2019/20 which was forecast back in July. So any money the Chancellor gives back to those losing tax credits is just likely to be offset by extra cuts elsewhere, tax rises or deeper departmental spending cuts.\u201d Here is a chart from Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics: The terrible borrowing figures provide a grim backdrop to autumn statement, says Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. October\u2019s poor borrowing numbers extinguish any lingering hope that the chancellor will be able to soften his austerity plans materially in next week\u2019s autumn statement. Borrowing was 16% higher year-over-year in October; the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2014OBR\u2014predicted in July\u2019s Budget that full-year borrowing would be a hefty 23% lower this year. And high borrowing prior to October means that borrowing in the first seven months of this fiscal year has totalled \u00a354.3B, only 10.9% less than in the previous year. Barring revisions, borrowing would have to be an implausible 48% lower year-over-year in the second half of this fiscal year in order for the current official forecast to be met. Admittedly, about one third of the overshoot reflects extra borrowing by local authorities, and those data often are revised significantly. In addition, the recent fall in gilt yields means the OBR can revise down its forecast for debt interest payments, freeing up funds for the chancellor to spend. What\u2019s more, the chancellor\u2019s fiscal rule only requires him to balance the books by the end of the parliament, with no major constraints on borrowing until then. But with the budget deficit equal to 4% of GDP and the OBR deeming most of it to be structural, any loosening now would require even more austerity in the run-up to the next election. Accordingly, the chancellor probably will make only modest alterations to the overall spending plans, with any lessening of the cuts to tax credits likely being financed by deeper cuts to other areas of spending. This means borrowing is now on track to total \u00a380.3bn this fiscal year and therefore overshoot the OBR\u2019s July Budget forecast of \u00a369.5bn by nearly \u00a311bn, according to the economist. The figures come ahead of next Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement (a mini budget) and spending review. The \u00a38.2bn deficit was the highest for the month of October since 2009 and higher than all forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted borrowing would fall to \u00a36bn. The government spent more last month: other current spending, which comprises mainly departmental spending, was up \u00a31.4bn compared with October 2014. Debt interest payments were also higher, by \u00a3300m. In the first six months of the tax year, the government borrowed 10.9% less than in the same period last year, a total of \u00a354.3bn. But given the higher than expected deficit in October, it seems likely that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will raise its prediction for government borrowing in the current financial year. Britain has had its worst October for government borrowing since 2009, according to official figures just out. Public borrowing rose to \u00a38.2bn from \u00a37.1bn a year earlier. A Treasury spokesperson said the figures show \u201cthe job is not yet done and government borrowing remains too high\u201d. In recent weeks we\u2019ve had good news showing our plan is working \u2013 real median wages are growing at their fastest in a decade, employment is at an all-time high and our economy is growing strongly. But as today\u2019s public sector finance figures show the job is not yet done and government borrowing remains too high. We\u2019ve learned there\u2019s no shortcut to fixing the public finances to provide economic security for working people \u2013 that\u2019s why in the Spending Review next week we\u2019ll continue the hard work of identifying savings and making reforms necessary to build a resilient economy.\u201d Draghi\u2019s comments sent the euro down half a percent to below $1.07 after two days of gains. It is now trading at $1.0681. The Dutch bank ABN Amro has returned to the Amsterdam stock market after seven years of government ownership following its costly bailout during the financial crisis. It is the biggest European bank IPO since the financial crisis. The shares rose nearly 3% to \u20ac18.27 in early trading and are now at \u20ac18.24, after being priced at \u20ac17.75 each. A phoenix rises, says Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. Much water has flown under the bridge since the mayhem of 2008-09, and it is a strong financial institution returning to public markets. We see a lot of value in ABN Amro. ABN Amro was an aggressive European financial institution leading up to the financial crisis, expanding its commercial and investment banking operations in various European markets. In 2007 a bidding war emerged for the Dutch bank, with Barclays fighting against a consortium of RBS, Fortis and Banco Santander. The consortium won the battle, but the acquisition and financial crisis proved too much for Fortis which went to its knees. The Dutch government had to launch a rescue operation to take over Fortis\u2019 assets in the Netherlands. After many years of state ownership, cost restructuring, asset divestment, boosting Tier 1 capital as well as navigating the European debt crisis, ABN Amro is ready to re-enter public markets. Investors will be pleased to see the strength of the bank compared with its peers.\u201d Staying with Greece for the moment, the country\u2019s current account surplus increased in September from the same month in 2014, the Bank of Greece said. This was mainly due to a smaller trade in goods deficit because the country imported less. The central bank said: A decline in the balance of goods deficit... offset a fall in the surplus of the services balance.\u201d The current account surplus widened to \u20ac838m from \u20ac61m a year earlier. Last year, Greece posted a surplus of \u20ac1.66bn, up from \u20ac1.09bn in 2013, on the back of higher tourism revenues. Greek bond yields are heading back towards their lowest levels in a year, below 7%, after the Athens parliament approved a reform bill to secure further bailout funds from international lenders. DZ Bank strategist Felix Herrmann told Reuters: It was not easy for the Greek government to pass this legislation. It is an important step that paves the way for the next tranche of aid and a positive factor for Greek government bonds. The yield on the Greek benchmark 10-year government bond fell 6 basis points to 6.98% \u2013 below the psychologically significant 7% level (the level at which several eurozone countries had to ask for bailouts during the financial crisis). And Mario Dragh\u2019s dovish comments bolstered expectations for ECB action in a fortnight, underpinning the eurozone bond market. The euro has weakened on the Draghi comments, which hinted strongly at ECB action as soon as the December meeting. Downside risks have increased in recent months, Draghi says, pointing to emerging markets (but without mentioning China). The outlook for global demand, especially in emerging markets, has notably worsened, while uncertainty in financial markets has increased. Global growth this year will be the weakest since 2009. Global growth this year will be the weakest since 2009. Even factoring in those headwinds, the strength of the underlying recovery is modest. Taking the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, the present upswing which started in 2013 is the weakest euro area rebound since 1998. That is striking considering that we are in the early phase of a recovery, where one would expect to see a much more vigorous pickup. He concludes: We have a situation where we cannot yet say with confidence that the process of economic repair in the euro area is complete.\u201d Draghi says that the eurozone\u2019s recovery remains \u201cvery protracted\u201d by historical standards. It took between five and eight quarters for the countries now making up the euro area to recover their pre-recession level of real output after the slumps of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. During the recent recession \u2013 which was admittedly the worst since the 1930s \u2013 it took the US economy 14 quarters to reach its pre-crisis peak. If our current assessment is correct, it will take the euro area 31 quarters to return to its pre-crisis level of output \u2013 that is, in 2016 Q1\u201d. Draghi says that ECB policy has already helped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in most countries, with the notable exception of Greece. In the most recent October round of our survey, the number of SMEs reporting an increase in revenues was almost 20% larger than those which reported the opposite.\u201d Do we need to do more? asks Draghi, highlighting changes to its asset-purchase programme and deposit rates as possible tools. We consider the asset purchase programme to be a powerful and flexible instrument, as it can be adjusted in terms of size, composition or duration to achieve a more expansionary stance. The level of the deposit facility rate can also empower the transmission of APP, not least by increasing the velocity of circulation of bank reserves.\u201d Draghi is now delivering the speech in Frankfurt. The text of Draghi\u2019s speech has been released on the ECB\u2019s website. Draghi will tell the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt: If we decide that the current trajectory of our policy is not sufficient to achieve our objective, we will do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible. That is what our price stability mandate requires of us.\u201d You can read the full speech on the ECB\u2019s website. ECB chief Mario Draghi says the central bank will do what it must to raise inflation quickly. French drugmaker Sanofi and Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca have agreed to exchange 210,000 chemical compounds to speed up the development of new medicines. No money will change hands and both companies will be free to use the compounds without restrictions. The companies explain: Chemical structures and synthetic procedures will be shared to facilitate the use of these compounds. The compounds will be exchanged in sufficient quantity to enable the receiving company to carry out high throughput screening for several years to determine whether they are active against specific biological targets. If a compound matches a target (a \u201chit\u201d), it may go through several modifications to optimise its structure before being classified as a \u201clead compound\u201d and potentially taken forward through development. Elias Zerhouni, president of global R&amp;D at Sanofi, says: We are happy to work with other companies if it will speed the discovery of new life-saving or life-enhancing therapies for patients. We believe that this collaboration will increase our capacity to deliver innovative solutions that have the potential to add significant medical value and transform lives.\u201d Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of innovative medicines &amp; early development at AstraZeneca, added: This is a highly innovative agreement which speaks to our open innovation approach. We have worked hard to enrich our compound library in recent years and this exchange, which is by far the largest we have achieved, enables us to significantly increase its diversity. Most importantly, it will accelerate our ability to identify unique starting points that could become new medicines for patients.\u201d European stock markets have opened higher: UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 0.3% Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.4% France\u2019s CAC up 0.3% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 0.1% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.2% The European Commission\u2019s flash estimate of eurozone consumer confidence in November should provide a first indication of the impact on household sentiment from last Friday\u2019s Paris terror attacks. Economists at Daiwa say this measure of confidence has been declining gradually since March, but the current consensus expectation is for a flat reading today. They say that today\u2019s ECB speakers will all be worth watching for further insight into what specific measures next month might bring. Given the dovish tone of the account as well as the additional downside risks to the economic outlook associated with the Paris attacks, we now expect the asset purchase programme to be extended beyond September 2016 by at least one year; the asset purchase programme to be increased in scope and size (perhaps by \u20ac20bn per month to \u20ac80bn); and the deposit rate to be cut by 10bps to -0.30%. It\u2019s going to be a quiet end to the week with a rather bare economic calendar today. Apart from the UK public finance figures, the only other big releases are Canadian retail sales and inflation data at 13.30 GMT and eurozone consumer confidence for November at 15.00. Simon Smith, chief economist at online broker FXPro, says: As a result markets are calm going into the week end following a quiet Asian session overnight that had a positive bias to it. Investors seem to be more accepting of a possible Fed rate hike next month but for now the dollar\u2019s strength has been put on pause.\u201d In Athens, Alexis Tsipras\u2019 coalition government has been weakened as it pushed through another round of controversial EU-mandated reforms. He saw his slim parliamentary majority shrink to two seats in the 300-member House after dissidents refused to endorse the measures. You can read the full story here. The reform bill was necessary to unlock \u20ac2bn of bailout funds for Greece and up to \u20ac10bn for the recapitalisation of its banks. At 9.30, we are getting the UK public finance data for October. In September tax receipts for income tax, VAT and corporation tax were the highest on record, so George Osborne will be hoping that trend continues ahead of next week\u2019s autumn statement and comprehensive spending review. Hewson says: One thing is sure, in light of the shocking events in Paris he will have to find extra money to address the heightened security threats now facing the UK, which is likely to change the way he looks at next week\u2019s spending review.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There is a raft of European Central Bank speakers today and anything other than dovish rhetoric would be a surprise. The central bank\u2019s president Mario Draghi is speaking at Euro Finance Week at 8.00 GMT, followed by Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a member of the ECB\u2019s executive board at 8.15. Peter Praet , the ECB\u2019s chief economist, is speaking in Frankfurt at 10.00, followed by V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, the bank\u2019s vice president at 13.00. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann is also speaking this morning. Earlier this week, Praet cited concerns surrounding China and the downward pull of falling oil prices on core inflation as key risks, laying the ground for further policy easing at the ECB\u2019s 3 December meeting. At the last meeting, Draghi hinted that a rate cut could be on cards. Over in the US, interest rates are expected to move in the opposite direction in December. Two Federal Reserve officials could shed more light on the US central bank\u2019s thinking: James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who is due to speak on the economy in Arkansas at 14.00 GMT and William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Listening to the comments from the number of Fed speakers this week, not least the New York Fed\u2019s Bill Dudley, the markets have come to the conclusion that we will see a move on rates next month, though how the tone of it will be communicated is far from clear. Yesterday\u2019s sell-off in the US dollar would appear to suggest that investors belief that the pace of any increases are likely to be slow, but how do you communicate a dovish hike, it\u2019s a complete oxymoron.\u201d",

Borrowing was 16% <em>higher </em>year-over-year in October; the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2014OBR\u2014predicted in July\u2019s Budget that full-year borrowing would be a hefty 23% <em>lower</em> this year. And high borrowing prior to October means that borrowing in the first seven months of this fiscal year has totalled \u00a354.3B, only 10.9% less than in the previous year. Barring revisions, borrowing would have to be an implausible 48% lower year-over-year in the second half of this fiscal year in order for the current official forecast to be met.</p> <p>Admittedly, about one third of the overshoot reflects extra borrowing by local authorities, and those data often are revised significantly. In addition, the recent fall in gilt yields means the OBR can revise down its forecast for debt interest payments, freeing up funds for the chancellor to spend. What\u2019s more, the chancellor\u2019s fiscal rule only requires him to balance the books by the end of the parliament, with no major constraints on borrowing until then. But with the budget deficit equal to 4% of GDP and the OBR deeming most of it to be structural, any loosening now would require even more austerity in the run-up to the next election. </p> <p>Accordingly, the chancellor probably will make only modest alterations to the overall spending plans, with any lessening of the cuts to tax credits likely being financed by deeper cuts to other areas of spending.</p> </blockquote> <p>This means borrowing is now on track to total \u00a380.3bn this fiscal year and therefore overshoot the OBR\u2019s July Budget forecast of \u00a369.5bn by nearly \u00a311bn, according to the economist.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-564eeba8e4b062d400968615\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-20T09:52:18.288Z\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The figures come ahead of next Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/autumn-statement-and-spending-review-2015\">autumn statement (a mini budget) and spending review</a>.</p> <p>The \u00a38.2bn deficit was the highest for the month of October since 2009 and higher than all forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted borrowing would fall to \u00a36bn. </p> <p>The government spent more last month: other current spending, which comprises mainly departmental spending, was up \u00a31.4bn compared with October 2014.

Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann is also speaking this morning.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Praet cited concerns surrounding China and the downward pull of falling oil prices on core inflation as key risks, laying the ground for further policy easing at the ECB\u2019s 3 December meeting. At the last meeting, Draghi hinted that a rate cut could be on cards.</p> <p><strong>Over in the US, interest rates are expected to move in the opposite direction in December. </strong>Two Federal Reserve officials could shed more light on the US central bank\u2019s thinking: James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who is due to speak on the economy in Arkansas at 14.00 GMT and William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. </p> <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Listening to the comments from the number of Fed speakers this week, not least the New York Fed\u2019s Bill Dudley, the markets have come to the conclusion that we will see a move on rates next month<strong>,</strong> though how the tone of it will be communicated is far from clear. Yesterday\u2019s sell-off in the US dollar would appear to suggest that investors belief that the pace of any increases are likely to be slow, but how do you communicate a dovish hike, it\u2019s a complete oxymoron.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-11-20T08:34:46.209Z\">at 8.34am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "On the surface, the figures are bad. Government borrowing was 16% higher in October than the same month last year. The deficit was supposed to be going down \u2013 and quickly. Forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility, which assesses the government\u2019s spending plans, predicted growing tax receipts and lower spending would generate a 23% cut in borrowing over the financial year. It is currently only 11% lower. As Samual Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in his assessment: \u201cBarring revisions, borrowing would have to be an implausible 48% lower year-over-year in the second half of this fiscal year in order for the current official forecast to be met.\u201d Furthermore, the business environment has worsened, which means more pressure on tax revenues. Most surveys of sentiment among senior managers show they are nervous about next year and the prospects for sales and profits. That means 2014 was a high-water mark for economic growth and the slip backwards this year to a gentler expansion in output is the new normal. Maybe that\u2019s why corporation tax receipts dropped \u00a3100m month-on-month after solid growth earlier in the year. However, George Osborne is not going to take these figures as a sign his austerity cuts need to be moderated. He has already handed the problem of supporting industry and consumer spending to the Bank of England, via low interest rates. So he is still going to talk tough on the need for spending cuts. Equally, he will want to avoid a bigger battle with his backbenchers after his inept handling of planned tax credit cuts. His pre-election autumn statement last December predicted a rush of self-assessment tax returns in the next spring to bail out his flagging finances. Looking back to February and March, the forecast came good in part. Next week, we are likely to see a similar conjuring trick. It is not hard to create an illusion when dealing with the public finances, which are notoriously full of spending based on estimates of future inflation rates and interest rates that are by their nature unknowable. That said, the OBR will need to make clear Osborne must find \u00a311bn from somewhere to generate a \u00a310bn surplus at the end of the parliament in 2020. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, \u00a311bn is the likely overshoot by next April on the OBR\u2019s current borrowing projections if the current trend continues. And that spells doom for local authority spending on mental health services, child health, libraries and parks \u2013 if these services haven\u2019t already been cut. School spending on all but teachers will also face a squeeze, while the health service will, no doubt, be forced to take on extra responsibilities to preserve its \u00a38bn of extra spending.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s deficit-cutting drive has been dealt a blow ahead of next week\u2019s spending review after official figures showed the worst October for the public finances in six years. The deficit, or the gap between what the government spends and takes in, swelled by 16% from a year earlier to \u00a38.2bn in October, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It was a larger shortfall than the \u00a36bn forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. The chancellor wants to eliminate the deficit on the public finances by the end of the decade. As part of that push, he will unveil plans in his spending review on 25 November to cut government department spending by around \u00a320bn over the next four years. Economists said the latest public finances suggest Osborne will miss his deficit-cutting goals for this year and that he will redouble austerity measures in next week\u2019s spending review and accompanying budget update, known as the autumn statement. \u201cOctober\u2019s poor borrowing numbers extinguish any lingering hope that the chancellor will be able to soften his austerity plans materially in next week\u2019s autumn statement,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast a deficit of \u00a369.5bn in the fiscal year to April 2016. In order for the chancellor to meet that target, borrowing in the second half of the fiscal year would have to fall an \u201cimplausible\u201d 48% on the same period a year ago, said Tombs. The ONS figures showed that in the financial year so far, public sector net borrowing was already \u00a354.3bn. The OBR publishes new forecasts at the time of the autumn statement next week and is widely expected to raise its forecast for the deficit for this full financial year. The deficit for the financial year starting in April until October was smaller than a year earlier but not down by as much as the government would have liked at this stage, economists said. The decrease of \u00a36.6bn, or 10.9% compared with the same period a year earlier, was mainly driven by a drop in central government net borrowing but partially offset by an increase in local government net borrowing, the ONS said. \u201cThe big picture here is that the government deficit is closing ... But that decline in borrowing is not as rapid as the OBR predicted at the time of the budget in July,\u201d said Chris Hare, economist at banking group Investec. Reacting to the last public finances update before the spending review, a Treasury spokeswoman said rising employment and wages showed the government\u2019s economic plan \u201cis working\u201d. \u201cBut as today\u2019s public sector finance figures show the job is not yet done and government borrowing remains too high,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned there\u2019s no shortcut to fixing the public finances to provide economic security for working people \u2013 that\u2019s why in the spending review next week we\u2019ll continue the hard work of identifying savings and making reforms necessary to build a resilient economy.\u201d The prolonged squeeze on wage growth since the recession has repeatedly led to disappointing tax receipts. But with the latest official figures showing pay increasing at an annual rate of 3%, income-related taxes are recovering. However, economists warn that a recent slowdown in economic growth could bode ill for future government income. Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, described the latest figures as \u201cvery disappointing and difficult news for Chancellor George Osborne to digest\u201d. \u201cFurthermore, with the economy seeing GDP growth slow in the third quarter, there is the risk that tax receipts could undershoot going forward. The chancellor will obviously be hoping that the economy can kick on and is not hampered by global growth being held back by a marked slowdown in China and emerging markets,\u201d said Archer. \u201cHe will also be hoping that the economy is not handicapped significantly by heightened uncertainty in the run-up to the referendum on UK membership of the European Union.\u201d Net debt With the government still running deficits each month, the UK\u2019s total debt pile is still increasing, according to the ONS. In total, the UK now owes more than \u00a31.5tn, equivalent to 80.5% of GDP. That compares with 69% in 2010/11, Osborne\u2019s first year as chancellor under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A damning report by MPs into Network Rail\u2019s aborted five-year investment plan has warned that the public will foot the bill for \u201cstaggering and unacceptable\u201d cost increases after the government and industry agreed to pay for work that could never have been delivered in time and on budget. In an assessment that will put the future of the rail regulator further in doubt, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said it had serious concerns over rail investment following the admission of further delays and overspending in the \u00a338.3bn programme of rail works. MPs on the committee said the track and signalling operator Network Rail had \u201clost its grip\u201d and demanded clearer accountability for project costs and management. They also questioned if the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), the regulator that signed off the \u201cunrealistic\u201d programme, was fit for purpose. It said that even after the planning and budgeting failures, there remained far too much uncertainty over the costs and delivery of major rail electrification works on the TransPennine route and the Midland Main Line, and that more projects could be delayed to balance the books. Electrifying the Great Western Main Line from London to Cardiff is now expected to cost \u00a32.8bn, rather than the \u00a31.6bn estimated a year ago, the committee found. The PAC called for a fundamental review of the regulator\u2019s role and effectiveness in planning rail infrastructure, noting: \u201cWe are concerned that the ORR lacks the capability to robustly scrutinise Network Rail\u2019s plans.\u201d Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC, said: \u201cNetwork Rail has lost its grip on managing large infrastructure projects. The result is a twofold blow to taxpayers: delays in the delivery of promised improvements, and a vastly bigger bill for delivering them. \u201cThe government has identified rail infrastructure as a vital part of its economic plans, for example in establishing what it describes as a \u2018Northern powerhouse\u2019. It is alarming that, in planning work intended to support these plans, its judgment should be so flawed. \u201cOur inquiry has found that the agreed work could never have been delivered within the agreed budget and timeframe. Yet Network Rail, the Department for Transport and the regulator \u2013 the Office of Rail and Road \u2013 signed up to the plans anyway. \u201cPassengers and the public are paying a heavy price and we must question whether the ORR is fit for purpose.\u201d The first public admission from the government that the \u00a338.3bn plan was going off the rails came in June, when the government replaced the chairman of Network Rail and announced three reviews into its investment plan and structures. The first, Sir Peter Hendy\u2019s assessment of how much work can realistically now be conducted by 2019 for the budget provided, is expected to be published next week. Responding to the report, Network Rail said it had now made significant changes to planning and budgeting. A spokesperson said: \u201cIt is clear that we, as an industry, have been overly ambitious about what could be accomplished with the funds and resources available. Network Rail has successfully delivered over 5,000 projects over the past five years, but our understanding of how best to plan and deliver major new electrification schemes was not good enough.\u201d A transport department spokesperson said: \u201cWe are proud to have a hugely ambitious investment programme, but agree that lessons should be learned on all sides. We are committed to seeing the \u00a338bn programme through and delivering the railway that passengers deserve.\u201d The ORR said it welcomed the report. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe need to learn the lessons, and agree with PAC\u2019s recommendations that uncertainties in key projects need to be addressed differently. \u201cWith the changes to Network Rail\u2019s ownership and finances since it became a public sector company, ORR agrees that a review of its own role in major projects is appropriate.\u201d Electrification of three major routes was at the heart of rail upgrades described as vital by Network Rail and promised in the Conservative party manifesto. But just weeks after the election two of the three schemes were paused by the government, while the Great Western scheme will be delayed, potentially incurring further costs associated with new trains on order from Hitachi.",

      "body": "<p>A damning report by MPs into Network Rail\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/24/network-rail-funding-gap-scuppers-five-year-investment-plan\">aborted five-year investment plan</a> has warned that the public will foot the bill for \u201cstaggering and unacceptable\u201d cost increases after the government and industry agreed to pay for work that could never have been delivered in time and on budget. </p> <p>In an assessment that will put the future of the rail regulator further in doubt, the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/\">Public Accounts Committee</a> (PAC) said it had serious concerns over rail investment following the admission of further delays and overspending in the <a href=\"http://www.networkrail.co.uk/publications/delivery-plans/control-period-5/cp5-delivery-plan/\">\u00a338.3bn programme of rail works</a>. </p> <p>MPs on the committee said the track and signalling operator Network Rail had \u201clost its grip\u201d and demanded clearer accountability for project costs and management. They also questioned if the <a href=\"http://orr.gov.uk/\">Office of Rail and Road</a> (ORR), the regulator that signed off the \u201cunrealistic\u201d programme, was fit for purpose.</p> <p>It said that even after the planning and budgeting failures, there remained far too much uncertainty over the costs and delivery of major rail electrification works on the TransPennine route and the Midland Main Line, and that more projects could be delayed to balance the books. Electrifying the Great Western Main Line from London to Cardiff is now expected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/21/cost-to-electrify-great-western-mainline-triples-to-28bn-risking-other-schemes\">to cost \u00a32.8bn, rather than the \u00a31.6bn</a> estimated a year ago, the committee found.</p> <p>The PAC called for a fundamental review of the regulator\u2019s role and effectiveness in planning rail infrastructure, noting: \u201cWe are concerned that the ORR lacks the capability to robustly scrutinise Network Rail\u2019s plans.\u201d</p> <p>Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC, said: \u201cNetwork Rail has lost its grip on managing large infrastructure projects. The result is a twofold blow to taxpayers: delays in the delivery of promised improvements, and a vastly bigger bill for delivering them.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has identified rail infrastructure as a vital part of its economic plans, for example in establishing what it describes as a \u2018Northern powerhouse\u2019. It is alarming that, in planning work intended to support these plans, its judgment should be so flawed.</p> <p>\u201cOur inquiry has found that the agreed work could never have been delivered within the agreed budget and timeframe. Yet Network Rail, the Department for Transport and the regulator \u2013 the Office of Rail and Road \u2013 signed up to the plans anyway. </p> <p>\u201cPassengers and the public are paying a heavy price and we must question whether the ORR is fit for purpose.\u201d</p> <p>The first public admission from the government that the \u00a338.3bn plan was going off the rails <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/24/network-rail-funding-gap-scuppers-five-year-investment-plan\">came in June</a>, when the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/25/network-rail-chief-to-step-down-as-385bn-upgrades-are-delayed\">replaced the chairman of Network Rail</a> and announced three reviews into its investment plan and structures. The first, Sir Peter Hendy\u2019s assessment of how much work can realistically now be conducted by 2019 for the budget provided, is expected to be published next week.</p> <p>Responding to the report, Network Rail said it had now made significant changes to planning and budgeting. A spokesperson said: \u201cIt is clear that we, as an industry, have been overly ambitious about what could be accomplished with the funds and resources available. Network Rail has successfully delivered over 5,000 projects over the past five years, but our understanding of how best to plan and deliver major new electrification schemes was not good enough.\u201d</p> <p>A transport department spokesperson said: \u201cWe are proud to have a hugely ambitious investment programme, but agree that lessons should be learned on all sides. We are committed to seeing the \u00a338bn programme through and delivering the railway that passengers deserve.\u201d</p> <p>The ORR said it welcomed the report. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe need to learn the lessons, and agree with PAC\u2019s recommendations that uncertainties in key projects need to be addressed differently. </p> <p>\u201cWith the changes to Network Rail\u2019s ownership and finances since it became a public sector company, ORR agrees that a review of its own role in major projects is appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Electrification of three major routes was at the heart of rail upgrades described as vital by Network Rail and promised in the Conservative party manifesto. But just weeks after the election two of the three schemes were paused by the government, while the Great Western scheme will be delayed, potentially incurring further costs associated with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/03/hitachi-factory-george-osborne-northern-powerhouse\">new trains on order from Hitachi</a>.</p>",
