      "bodyText": "The possibility of a major British oil company regaining access to one of the world\u2019s great hydrocarbon markets rose on Friday with officials in Tehran saying Shell would be allowed to build 100 petrol stations in Iran. In a separate move, BP confirmed that it had sent a team of managers to a country which has been out of bounds since western sanctions were imposed over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. These developments coincided with the arrival of a 30-member delegation of UK businesses in the Iranian capital for a four-day visit to meet officials. Despite an agreement in July between Iran and the west over the curbing of Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme, European Union sanctions are still in place but Iran is pushing to get them lifted as soon as possible. Iran is one of the world\u2019s biggest hydrocarbon producers but is struggling in a world of low oil prices. It has been traditionally wary of foreign firms but would like western technology and knowhow to raise oil and gas production. With relations between Washington and Tehran thawing fast, a race is on among the large US and European oil companies to position themselves positively with Iran before sanctions are formally dropped so that concrete deals can be done. Bijan Haj Mohammadreza, the head of Iran\u2019s filling stations union, was quoted prominently by the state-run Press TV as saying that the country had shown the green light to Shell and Total of France to each build 100 service stations. Shell, which went on a visit to Tehran with a British government mission to open the UK embassy there in August, said it was unaware of any further developments there. A Shell spokesman in London said: \u201cWe have not sought, or been granted, any licences to operate retail sites in Iran. We remain in full compliance with all international sanctions.\u201d But if any such deal were to be agreed, it would mark the first time Iran would overcome its previous reluctance to allow foreign companies access to its retail energy market. Trade union officials have significant influence in the signing of such agreements. BP, which started life as the Anglo-Persian Oil company through its assets in the Middle East country, sent technical and commercial managers on a fact-finding mission to the country last month. A spokesman for the company said: \u201cBP has met with oil industry officials in Iran recently. The details of those discussions are confidential. We have said for some time that we would be interested in reviewing opportunities in Iran once sanctions permit it. We are fully in compliance with the current sanctions regimes in place.\u201d Iran has some of the largest oil and gas reserves in the world which can be accessed at a relatively cheap cost. The oil industry was nationalised in the late 1970s, ending BP\u2019s involvement in production from Iran. The British company traded crude and products with Iran more recently until western sanctions put an end to this too in 2011. Shell re-entered Iran in the 1990s but withdrew again when sanctions were introduced. Abbas Beyad, international business development executive at the drilling support company, Britannia Petroleum, said his firm had visited Iran several times this year and was hoping to be part of another trade mission expected to be led by the chancellor George Osborne early next year. \u201cThe nuclear agreement with Iran has effectively opened up a sleeping giant and the last major untapped emerging market economy,\u201d he said. \u201cA $400bn (\u00a3263bn) economy even with the most crippling and extensive sanctions imposed on any country, Iran has the potential to become a G20 country within a short space of time once the sanctions are removed after implementation day.\u201d Shaistah Akhtar, partner at law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons, said it was important to remember that sanctions remained in place and the EU and US authorities were committed to their enforcement. \u201cRoadblocks remain for a number of reasons \u2013 ultimately, all of the existing restrictive measures can be reinstated \u2013 the so-called \u2018snap back\u2019 provisions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is this possibility that is making businesses tread carefully with respect to Iran and include full and robust contractual protections in the event that sanctions are reimposed. Iran also remains a high-risk jurisdiction. \u201cBanks and other financial institutions, which have spent recent years \u2018de-risking\u2019 and stopping all business with certain high-risk/sanctions countries, are likely to remain reluctant to handle Iran-related transactions, especially while US sanctions remain in force. Indeed, it may be a breach of strict banking/finance covenants to enter into any sort of Iranian business.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A slump in world trade and a slowdown in China took their toll on the US economy last month as surveys revealed that firms delayed hiring and factory orders contracted. US businesses created only 142,000 jobs in September, according to official figures, about 64,000 fewer than expected by analysts. The report by the US Labor department also found that employers kept average pay rises at zero and thousands of workers quit the labour market, taking the participation rate back to levels last seen in the 1970s. The much anticipated data was widely seen as ending any expectations of an interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve before Christmas. The lack of any pressure on wages is likely to be the biggest factor persuading Fed officials against a rise from the current rate of near zero, which was anticipated last month until it became obvious that the slowing Chinese economy and the panic it caused on global markets formed a powerful case against a rate rise. Separate surveys added to the gloomy picture, showing that US factory orders fell 1.7% in August, compared with expectations of a 1.3% decline, and business activity in New York contracted for the first time in eight months in September. The Dow Jones fell more than 200 points on the news. By midday, Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 had recovered from their initial shock and were back in green. The Dow Jones closed with a 200 point gain. The FTSE 100 shrugged off the news as investors welcomed the prospect of ultra-low interest rates until at least next year. The index of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies closed up nearly 1% at 6,129 points. James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank, said: \u201cThe weakness in the global economy is washing on to American shores.\u201d Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at stockbroker PNC, said he was not taking much solace from the US unemployment rate remaining at 5.1% when it was only because the US labour force participation declined to 62.4%, from 62.6%, during the past three months. This is the lowest labour force participation rate since 1977. \u201cThere is no question that this is a disappointing report. Normally, if you get this kind of a report, you might find some silver linings in it. There is nothing here that I would point to as a silver lining,\u201d Faucher said on Friday. \u201cUnemployment rate was steady but we still had big declines in the labour force. Average hourly earnings were flat. We got downward revisions to July and August and pretty substantial ones.\u201d Last month, the non-farm payroll figures for June and July were revised up, causing the unemployment rate to drop to 5.1%. August\u2019s numbers were lower than expected, although many economists pointed out that the figures for August are usually revised up. However, in Friday\u2019s report, the figures for both July and August were revised down. July\u2019s figure was revised from 245,000 to 223,000, and the change for August was revised from 173,000 to 136,000, meaning that 59,000 fewer jobs were created than previously reported. Over the last three months, job gains have averaged 167,000 per month. Last month, that figure was reported to be 221,000. So far in 2015, job growth has averaged 198,000 per month, compared with an average monthly gain of 260,000 in 2014, according to the US Labor department. Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, said in September that continued job growth and 2% inflation would indicate that the US economy was ready for a hike in interest rates. Yellen has said she expected that interest rates would be raised before the end of the year if the US economy continued to show signs of improvement. The US markets have been on a wild ride during the last couple of months thanks to China\u2019s market turmoil, Greece\u2019s debt crisis and the uncertainty about the interest rate hike. In her press conference announcing that the Fed would not raise interest rates in September, Yellen said the slowing of China\u2019s economy had long been expected and that it was not the Fed\u2019s policy to respond to ups and downs in the markets. \u201cWe are not going to see a rate increase in October \u2013 we haven\u2019t been expecting one but I think this kind of rules that out,\u201d said Faucher. \u201cThat being said, I think that the December rate hike is still on the table. It\u2019s looking certainly more iffy than it did even just a few days ago. If I were on the federal open market committee [of the Federal Reserve], I\u2019d be looking very closely at this report and thinking very hard about whether I want to raise rates in December.\u201d Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, agreed that the Fed will hold steady this month, but said there are two more jobs reports before it meets again in December. Faucher said September\u2019s weak jobs report is only a temporary weakness. \u201cThe thing that puzzles me is that other indicators have looked very solid in late September. Housing market, generally, is looking good. Consumer spending is good. We had a great number on auto sales yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there seems to be a disconnect between what we are seeing in the economy and what we are seeing in the labour market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our updated report on the US jobs data, by Jana Kasperkevic in New York and Phillip Inman: A slump in world trade and a slowdown in China took their toll on the US economy last month as surveys revealed that firms delayed hiring and factory orders contracted. US businesses created only 142,000 jobs in September, according to official figures, about 64,000 fewer than expected by analysts. The report by the US Labor department also found that employers kept average pay rises at zero and thousands of workers quit the labour market, taking the participation rate back to levels last seen in the 1970s. The much anticipated data was widely seen as ending any expectations of an interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve before Christmas. The lack of any pressure on wages is likely to be the biggest factor persuading Fed officials against a rise from the current rate of near zero, which was anticipated last month until it became obvious that the slowing Chinese economy and the panic it caused on global markets formed a powerful case against a rate rise. Separate surveys added to the gloomy picture, showing that US factory orders fell 1.7% in August, compared with expectations of a 1.3% decline, and business activity in New York contracted for the first time in eight months in September. The Dow Jones fell more than 200 points on the news, only to recover to a 27 point loss by 1700 BST. The FTSE 100 shrugged off the news as investors welcomed the prospect of ultra low interest rates until at least next year. the index of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies closed up nearly 1% at 6,129 points. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. And with the jobs data pushing back the estimates of when the US Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, here\u2019s the effect on currencies: It was a rollercoaster day for investors, with early market gains wiped out after the worse than expected US non-farm payroll numbers, but an attempted recovery by the time European markets closed. Traders said that, after the initial jobs report suggested the US economy was much weaker than feared, there was a revival of sorts on the basis that the Federal Reserve was now unlikely to raise interest rates this year. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 57.51 points or 0.95% higher at 6129.98 having climbed as high as 6176 and fallen as low as 6051 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.46% to 9553.07 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.73% better at 4458.88 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.19% to 21,395.29 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.27% to 640.99 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which lost nearly 260 points after the jobs data - is now down just 29 points or 0.18%. Markets have recovered some of the immediate losses after the US jobs data: Good news for Spain. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has raised the country\u2019s sovereign credit rating from BBB to BBB+ with a stable outlook. It said it now projected Spain\u2019s nominal GDP to grow at about 4% over the next few years and said a broad based economic recovery and budgetary consolidation should balance the risks from its large net external debt. But it warned that Spain\u2019s creditworthiness would weaken if Catalonia were no longer part of the country. Over the weekend separatists took control of Catalonia\u2019s regional government. Over to the Greek situation for a moment, and ahead of a Eurogroup meeting on Monday, junior ministers have been working on the list of bailout measures Greece must take in return for its next loan payment: Markets would benefit from the Fed getting a rate rise out of the way, says Julian Jessop at Capital Economics: The disappointing US jobs report for September will clearly do little to improve investor confidence in the global economy. Yes, it will probably delay the first interest rate hike from the Fed until early next year. However, our view remains that the prices of equities, other emerging market assets and industrial commodities would benefit more from the lifting of uncertainty once lift-off does finally take place. In the meantime, the few winners include safe-haven bonds \u2013 and gold. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off its lows but still down more than 1% on the day so far. And those US factory orders have also disappointed. New orders fell 1.7% in August, compared to expectations of a 1.3% decline. July\u2019s rise of 0.4% has also been revised downwards to an increase of 0.2%. More disappointing economic news from the US. Business activity in New York contracted for the first time in eight months in September, with the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s index falling from 51.1 in August to 44.5. A weak US economy - as evidenced by the weak job numbers - will also hit emerging market exporters. Sanjiv Shah at emerging markets specialist Sun Global Investments said: The weaker than expected NFP data today suggests that the US Economy, which is the largest export market for many EM countries, is slowing down much more than was previously expected. These numbers probably rule out a Fed interest rate increase for the rest of 2015 and, indeed, we worry that the Fed\u2019s decision not to raise interest rates earlier this month was a missed opportunity. It is without doubt that a weak US economy will negatively affect EM exporters but we expect lower bond yields to help EM bonds and EM equities. If a rate rise in October is pretty much off the table, some analysts do believe a move higher in December is still possible. Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said: Today\u2019s employment report has most likely removed even the last small chance for a rate hike as early as this month. But we continue to expect the first move at the mid-December meeting. Various Federal Reserve Open Market Committee members have over the past couple of weeks verbally teed up for a rate hike this year. The latest being Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said in a TV interview this morning (admittedly before the employment report) that \u201craising rates in 2015 is a \u2018reasonable forecast\u2019\u201d. What makes his statement so important is that he is one of the more dovish FOMC members. Yesterday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams (centrist FOMC member and a voter this year) said that the decision to not raise rates in September was \u201ca very close call\u201d, which means that \u201cit doesn\u2019t take a lot of information to tip the balance.\u201d Mr. Williams added that job gains of \u201cabove 100,000 or 150,000 would be good to me\u201d, as the slower pace of job gains was \u201cjust a sign that the labor market was closer to being completely healed.\u201d Along the same lines Chair Yellen acknowledged last week that \u201cthe labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years.\u201d In other words: The Fed is very pleased with the development of the labor market, and we doubt that two weaker months will alter this assessment. Before the December FOMC meeting we will be getting two more employment reports. In addition to possible upward revisions to the past numbers, they will likely show again faster job gains and an unemployment rate of 5.0% - or less. That, in turn would be good enough for the Fed to finally pull the trigger. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Jana Kasperkevic\u2019s early take on the disappointing Jobs Report Our rolling coverage with full details and reaction starts here. Wall Street has opened sharply lower after the much weaker than expected US jobs figures, which have cast new doubts on the strength of the US economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 214 points or 1.3% while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 1%. Nasdaq has fallen 1.2%. An early contender for sarcastic tweet of the day: The Federal Reserve simply cannot raise interest rates this month, says Marvin Loh of Bank of New York Mellon: While recent Fed speakers have put on a brave face in saying that October is a live meeting, we don\u2019t see how that is possible after this repot and the likely volatility that it will generate. So, December? Perhaps not, as Washington politicians could be wrangling over a possible government shutdown in three months time. Loh adds: The debt ceiling is also in play, and it will now influence both the October and December FOMC meetings. We maintain our March, 2016 first hike view. The non-farm payroll report could be the worst since the one which preceeded the second round of US quantitative easing, says Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX: It might be time to put a pin in hopes for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in 2015. With the US labor market having been the sole pillar of fundamental strength supporting the US dollar over the last year, the strongest talking point for a rate hike just took a significant hit. The September US labor market report was disappointing all around, arguably the worst report in recent memory \u2013 the worst perhaps since the May 2012 report that paved the way for QE2. The US economy endured the second consecutive month of jobs growth below 200,000, all but erasing the potential for a Fed rate hike this year. Earlier this week, there was over a 42% chance of a rate hike in December, per the Fed funds futures contracts. After the report today, that probability dipped to 30% (and falling). It\u2019s always important not to over-react to one single data release, but Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, is making an exception this time. The chances of a rate hike by the Fed this year just went way down. He reckons that the US economy is still in fairish shape, with unemployment claims down and consumer spending up. Accordingly, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the economy had a stronger fourth quarter. But that isn\u2019t going to show up in the published data for another few months, which means the Fed won\u2019t be raising rates until early 2016. Something is heading higher after the jobs data - precious metals. Today\u2019s jobs report has created a lot of angst in the financial world; the FT\u2019s Katie Martin is rounding it up: Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says the Fed would still like to raise borrowing costs. However today\u2019s data, and the state of the global economy, doesn\u2019t justify it. \u201cThe US economy seems fairly resilient but, with employment data particularly disappointing for a second month running, enthusiasm for a rate hike in the short term will surely be tempered. \u201cThe Federal Reserve don\u2019t want to sit on their hands for too much longer, yet with significant global issues continuing to affect the US economy, now would not be the wisest time to press the button. \u201cWe\u2019re surely not too far away from a first hike in seven years, although both US and global economic data will have to improve if it\u2019s to happen before the end of the year.\u201d This is a \u201cuniformly dreadful\u201d report, says Rob Carnell of ING, with just 142,000 new jobs being created across the American economy. He agrees that it will prevent the Fed raising rates this month, and possibly not until 2016. The other disappointment in the data was from hourly wages growth, which only needed to show a 0.2% month-on-month increase to take its annualized growth rate into new territory. But instead, it was unchanged, and the annual rate remains stuck at 2.2% YoY. Not enough to get the Fed doves vote for a hike, at least not yet...... For once, these labour market numbers gave an unambiguous result. The problem is that it was unambiguously negative. No rate hike this month then it seems. But it raises doubts too about the probability of a December hike, unless the Fed changes the basis upon which it decided policy rates. That fits with the instant market reaction. More on when the US may raise rates, in the wake of these latest jobs figures: The full non-farms report can be found at the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. Economists are united -- this is a grim jobs report, showing the US economy is in worse shape than hoped. It also vindicates the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to not raise interest rates last month. But a weak US labor market is not good news, and traders are reacting accordingly: And here\u2019s the unemployment rate: Here are the changes in non-farm payrolls since September 2013: And so much for a rate rise this year: More gloom - the US labor force participation rate has fallen to just 62.4%, down from 62.6 in August. That\u2019s the lowest since the mid-1970s, showing that more Americans are simply dropping out of the labor market. The wage data is bad too -- average hourly earnings were unchanged month-on-month. Economists had expected that wages grew 0.2% last month. US bond yields are also on the way down: The much weaker than expected US jobs data has sent the dollar falling, on the basis that a US interest rate rise this year - already in some doubt - was now less likely. Against the pound, the US currency has fallen from $1.5162 before the data to $1.5200. Stock markets have moved lower, since the jobs numbers show the US economy is nowhere near as strong as expected. The FTSE 100, up 94 points ahead of the release, is now up 50 points, while US futures are now down 0.7%. The US unemployment rate is unchanged at 5.1%, dashing hopes that it might have dipped again to 5%. Here we go! Just 142,000 new jobs were created in America last month. That is a big miss - much way less than the 201,000 that economists had expected. And August\u2019s reading has been revised DOWN - to 135,000, from the original 173,000 polled last month. At first glance, it\u2019s a poor show. Lots more to follow.... You can almost taste the tension, even though today\u2019s NFP report is a little less exciting than usual. There are five key things to watch out for when the Jobs Report lands in 15 minutes time. 1) Was September a good month for job creation? The consensus is that 201,000 new jobs were created last month. That\u2019s close to this year\u2019s average of 218,000. Anything north of that would be a good sign. 2) Could the jobless rate fall again? Last month it dipped to 5.1%, which is pretty much \u2018full employment\u2019 in the Federal Reserve\u2019s book. Another fall to 5.0% can\u2019t be ruled out. 3) Any progress on wages? Average earnings growth has been stubbornly weak in the financial crisis, helping to keep inflation pegged. 4) Was August really so bad? A month ago, the NFP rose by just 173,000, but August\u2019s data is typically revised higher. 5) The nitty-gritty. Economists will be looking at the under-employment rate, showing how many Americans wanted to work longer hours, and the labour force participation rate, which measures people who drop out of the market altogether. Alan Krueger, Professor of Economics at Princeton University, is concerned that the benefits of the US jobs recovery aren\u2019t being shared fairly. Krueger, who used to chair Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, told Bloomberg TV\u2019s Tom Keene that: We\u2019re continuing to see polarisation of the work force. Job growth at the bottom and the top, but not so much in the middle. What we need in the near term is a stronger economy overall to help lift wagers. In the longer term we need more of a rebalance in favour of workers. You can see the interview here. A month ago, there was genuine excitement ahead of the Non-Farm Payroll because there was a good chance that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at September\u2019s meeting (they didn\u2019t). Today\u2019s report does not have the same drama, as the Fed isn\u2019t likely to hike before December. But still, it will show how America\u2019s labour market is faring this autumn. Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Weisenthal reckons a decisively strong US unemployment report would be welcomed by investors, even if it means interest rates are likely to rise in December. Investors are ending the week in positive mood as they anticipate the final data release of the week, the US jobs report. In London the FTSE 100 is up 100 points, or 1.7%, at 6172 points. Banking shares are still rallying, after the Financial Conduct Authority proposed a deadline for PPI compensation claims. Over in Paris, the France\u2019s CAC has gained almost 2%. And the Dow Jones is is expected to gain around 0.5%, or 80 points, when Wall Street opens. The Non-Farm Payroll could potentially drive shares even higher, if it calms fears about the world economy. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: At the moment it seems that fears over global growth are outweighing concerns about a US rate-hike. A jobs number that beats expectations and gives the Fed ammunition to signal its confidence in the US and even global economy by hiking interest rates this year, may well trigger a rally in equities. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, predicts the dollar could spike if America\u2019s labour market is stronger than expected: \u201cThe implications of an upbeat outcome for the US Dollar seem relatively straight-forward. If traders walk away from the jobs report thinking a Fed rate hike seems more likely than previously, the currency will probably strengthen. Such a result may likewise help calm global slowdown fears and boost risk appetite, which ought to translate into outsized losses for funding currencies like the Euro and the Japanese Yen. A weaker euro would not upset the European Central Bank, as it is good for exports and inflationary pressure. Paypal is warning that foreign direct investment into Ireland is in danger if rents continue to soar in Dublin. Our correspondent Henry McDonald reports: Louise Phelan, Paypal\u2019s boss of Irish operation, says she is paying \u20ac2,000 in hotel bills to every new employee coming to work in the Republic\u2019s capital. Speaking to the Irish Construction Industry Federation in Dublin today, Phelan says she is resorting to appealing to Paypal staff already in Ireland to offer rooms to new workers arriving there. She warned: \u201cIt\u2019s crisis time for us and for bringing in foreign direct investment overall,\u201d The likes of Paypal and other mainly US multi-nationals has created tens of thousands of jobs over the last 40 years.But economists have warned that the recent spike in rents especially in Dublin could put off future global corporations setting up their European HQs in Ireland. A recent survey found that in 80% of the Republic it is now cheaper to pay a mortgage than rent to a landlord. Here\u2019s Katie Allen on today\u2019s blowout UK building data: Meanwhile in Greece, anti-terror police say they have unearthed detailed plans of kidnappings of prominent figures in what many fear may well be the next stage of the country\u2019s economic crisis. Helena Smith, our correspondent, reports from Athens. As Greece slips ever deeper into recession \u2013 the side effect of implementing fiscal consolidation reforms that have come as the price of being bailed out for a third time \u2013 fears of heightened criminality are also mounting. After a soar in break-ins (with the sale of safe deposit boxes skyrocketing during fraught negotiations with creditors over the latest loan deal), counter-terrorism officials now say they have discovered the makings of a plot that would have involved abductions at the highest echelons of society. A notebook listing suspected targets for kidnapping \u2013 and naming at least 25 leading businessmen, ship-owners and their families \u2013 was discovered alongside a heavy weapons cache in a building in Marathon, eastern Attica earlier this week. Authorities are believed to have been led to the building, described as a storeroom, after a tip off. Although police have not released the names of the individuals, they say they have been left in no doubt that plans were afoot to kidnap them in the coming months. The notebook, which is currently being examined, also contained in-depth details of abduction plans. Almost six years into its worst economic crisis in modern times, Greece has become increasingly divided between rich and poor with fears of kidnappings being openly aired among the more affluent members of society. Over in Portugal, they\u2019re gearing up for a general election. And, despite the country\u2019s deep austerity programme, the current government could well squeak back into power. Our own Angelique Chrisafis reports: Portugal could make history by becoming the first eurozone bailout country to re-elect a government that imposed harsh and unpopular austerity measures when it votes this weekend. Final polls suggest the centre-right ruling coalition is on course to win Sunday\u2019s general election after a close-run campaign, although it appears likely to lose its absolute parliamentary majority. The incumbent prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, who implemented severe austerity measures, including cutting pay and pensions, slashing public services and introducing the largest tax hikes in living memory, argued on the campaign trail that he was the only one to be trusted to protect the fragile economy as it emerges from years of recession. \u201cIf we stay on the path we\u2019ve been following, we won\u2019t need any more bailouts,\u201d he said, as his Social Democratic party ran on a joint ticket with its coalition partner, the smaller, conservative Popular party. Here\u2019s her full story: Shinichiro Kadota, FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo, believes today\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report would need to be remarkably good, or bad, to shake the Federal Reserve. Kadota said (via Reuters) \u201cFed chair Janet Yellen has already mentioned that labour conditions are improving and hinted that developments overseas, notably in China, and prices were chief concerns. \u201cA very bullish report would of course have a big impact. But the Fed may not make its rates decision on employment data alone.\u201d As covered in the introduction, economists expect around 200,000 new jobs were created in September; August\u2019s 173,000 reading could also be revised higher. Concerns that Europe is heading back into deflation have been heightened by new data, showing that prices charged by eurozone producers fell in August: Here\u2019s our take on the latest developments in the emissions scandal, including reports that BMW, Chrysler, General Motors, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz are all being investigated by US officials: Another front has opened up in the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal, with French prosecutors probing the carmaker for potential \u201caggravated deception\u201d. Reuters has the story: The Paris Prosecutor has opened an inquiry into suspected \u201caggravated deception\u201d by Volkswagen, an official from the Prosecutor\u2019s office told Reuters on Friday. The move adds to the legal burden the German carmaker faces after U.S. investigators found that it had rigged vehicle pollution emissions tests. Britain\u2019s construction sector grew at its fastest pace in seven months in September, driven by housebuilding. Markit\u2019s construction PMI, which measures activity across the sector, jumped to 59.9 from 57.3 in August (any reading over 50 shows growth). Builders reported greater workloads, and are more upbeat about the business outlook too. Markit says: House building remained the best performing broad category of construction activity in September. The latest expansion of residential building was the strongest for 12 months which some survey respondents attributed to the launch of development projects that had been delayed earlier in 2015. Apple\u2019s latest smartphone has helped drive sales up 6.9% at John Lewis, a handy barometer of UK consumer confidence. A third Glencore director has given the mining and commodities company a vote of confidence, by buying more shares. William Macaulay spent more than \u00a31.5m buying 1.7 million shares in Glencore at 90p yesterday, as the shares rebounded from their record plunge on Monday. He follows chairman Tony Hayward, who bought 100,000 shares, and fellow director John Mack who snaffled 550,000 at just 80p. With the tourist season over, the Spanish unemployment total is rising again. The number of people out of work across Spain rose by 26,087 in September, the Labour Ministry reported, a rise of 0.64%. That pushes Spain\u2019s jobless total to 4,094,042 million unemployed people. That\u2019s 353,608 fewer than in September 2014, and the lowest since the eurozone debt crisis began: And on a seasonally adjusted basis, Spanish unemployment in September fell by 9,746 people. 2015 has been a bumper year for Spanish tourism, with visitor numbers up 4.2% to a new record high of 29.2m. Here\u2019s confirmation that some traders are losing their enthusiasm for the Non-Farm Payroll circus: Shares in Experian have fallen by 4.5% this morning after the consumer credit monitoring firm announced it had been hacked. The data breach risks exposing personal data of 15 million T-Mobile consumers, including names, addresses, and social security, driver\u2019s license and passport numbers. More here: The end may finally be in sight for Britain\u2019s long-running payments protection insurance saga. The City regulator has announced plans to force consumers to file compensation claims by the spring of 2018, if they believe they were wrongly sold insurance on financial product. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: The regulator had faced pressure from the industry to set a deadline for customers making claims for the insurance sold alongside loans as the bill has already reached more than \u00a325bn in compensation and administration costs. Over \u00a320bn redress has been paid to over 10 million consumers so far, the FCA said. Bank shares have jumped by around 2.5% this morning, on relief that compensation payments might finally be capped. Hopefully it will mean an end to irritating PPI phone calls too \u2013 just in time for Volkswagen compensation claims instead.... European stock markets have jumped over 1% in early trading, ahead of the US jobs report this afternoon: After recent losses, traders will be hoping for a solid but unspectacular NFP reading. However, a strong or weak number could cause some alarm: Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: This number risks either scaring investors off with fears that the US economy is plateauing, or will reaffirm the view that the Federal Reserve needs to hike rates soon to prevent overheating \u2013 if there is a Goldilocks zone here, it\u2019s likely to be rather narrow. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a running joke in financial circles that every US jobs report is the most important ever. That might be a slight exaggeration this month, but today\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report still has the power to shift the markets The September Non-Farm Payroll, due at 1.30pm BST, will show how many new jobs were created in America last month. It\u2019ll also show whether workers benefitted from the recovery with higher wages. Economists predict that just over 200,000 new jobs were created last month, up from a disappointing 173,000 last month. That would put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to take the plunge and raise borrowing costs before the end of 2015.... .... except it\u2019s not quite that simple any more. The Fed is also worried about the state of the global economy, and the impact of China\u2019s slowdown on the financial system. Chris Weston of IG says traders are getting \u201ca bit exhausted\u201d about the steady stream of allegedly \u201cgame-changing\u201d data releases, especially when none of them actually prompt a change of policy. He also reckons the earning data should be interesting: The single most influential issue that should jump out immediately is that forecasters are expecting wages to grow 2.4% (range 2% to 2.5%). This would effectively be the strongest pace of wage growth since late 2009 and should increase the implied probability of a December hike closer, if not above 50%. There\u2019s not much else on the calendar today, alas, apart from UK construction data at 9.30am BST, and new Spanish unemployment data.... And in the eurozone, junior ministers should be working on the list of bailout measures Greece must take in return for its next loan payment, ahead of a full eurogroup meeting on Monday.",

The report by the US Labor department also found that employers kept average pay rises at zero and thousands of workers quit the labour market, taking the participation rate back to levels last seen in the 1970s.</p> <p>The much anticipated data was widely seen as ending any expectations of an <a href=\"http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2015/sep/24/janet-yellen-expects-federal-reserve-raise-interest-rates-by-end-of-year\">interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve before Christmas</a>.</p> <p>The lack of any pressure on wages is likely to be the biggest factor persuading Fed officials against a rise from the current rate of near zero, which was anticipated last month until it became obvious that the slowing Chinese economy and the panic it caused on global markets formed a powerful case against a rate rise.</p> <p>Separate surveys added to the gloomy picture, showing that US factory orders fell 1.7% in August, compared with expectations of a 1.3% decline, and business activity in New York contracted for the first time in eight months in September.</p> <p>The Dow Jones fell more than 200 points on the news, only to recover to a 27 point loss by 1700 BST. The FTSE 100 shrugged off the news as investors welcomed the prospect of ultra low interest rates until at least next year. the index of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies closed up nearly 1% at 6,129 points.</p> </blockquote> <p><em><strong>On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening.

Dr Harm Bandholz,<strong> c</strong>hief US economist at UniCredit Research said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Today\u2019s employment report has most likely removed even the last small chance for a rate hike as early as this month.</p> <p>But we continue to expect the first move at the mid-December meeting. Various Federal Reserve Open Market Committee members have over the past couple of weeks verbally teed up for a rate hike this year. The latest being Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said in a TV interview this morning (admittedly before the employment report) that \u201c<em>raising rates in 2015 is a \u2018reasonable forecast\u2019</em>\u201d. What makes his statement so important is that he is one of the more dovish FOMC members.</p> <p>Yesterday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams (centrist FOMC member and a voter this year) said that the decision to not raise rates in September was \u201c<em>a very close call</em>\u201d, which means that \u201c<em>it doesn\u2019t take a lot of information to tip the balance</em>.\u201d Mr. Williams added that job gains of \u201ca<em>bove 100,000 or 150,000 would be good to me</em>\u201d, as the slower pace of job gains was \u201c<em>just a sign that the labor market was closer to being completely healed</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Along the same lines Chair Yellen acknowledged last week that \u201c<em>the labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years</em>.\u201d In other words: The Fed is very pleased with the development of the labor market, and we doubt that two weaker months will alter this assessment. Before the December FOMC meeting we will be getting two more employment reports. In addition to possible upward revisions to the past numbers, they will likely show again faster job gains and an unemployment rate of 5.0% - or less.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City watchdog is proposing to bring the shutters down on Britain\u2019s biggest ever financial mis-selling scandal \u2013 the payment protection insurance debacle \u2013 by imposing a deadline of spring 2018 for people to submit their claims for compensation. What\u2019s happening? The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants to bring the whole PPI saga \u201cto an orderly conclusion\u201d to rebuild public trust in the financial services industry and reduce uncertainty for banks and other firms worried about the open-ended nature of potential PPI liabilities. It is proposing a deadline for consumers to make their PPI complaints. The exact date has yet to be decided, but it almost certainly won\u2019t be before the spring of 2018. Anyone who has yet to complain will need to do so by the deadline. If they don\u2019t, they will lose the right to have their case investigated by the relevant firm or by the Financial Ombudsman Service. Remind me of the background to all this? Banks and other financial institutions pushed PPI policies alongside loans and other credit deals with the promise that payments would be covered if borrowers found themselves unable to work. But in many cases, exclusions meant customers could never make a claim. The FCA says that, to date, more than \u00a320bn in compensation has been paid to more than 10m consumers. When you add in the amounts set aside that have yet to be paid out or claimed, the estimated total bill is more than \u00a326bn \u2013 and rising. So is this the beginning of the end for the scandal? A final date for claims would clearly draw a line under the debacle. The regulator says a deadline \u2013 backed by an industry-funded marketing campaign \u2013 would \u201cprompt many consumers who want to complain, but have not yet done so, into action, resulting in them potentially getting redress sooner\u201d. So we are likely to see a late flurry of activity as genuine claimants finally get around to submitting their complaints \u2013 and a fair few chancers trying their luck. However, we could be heading for a fresh round of payouts totalling billions of pounds following a court ruling. The supreme court ruled in November 2014 that if a PPI seller failed to disclose to a customer that it had received a large commission from the product provider, the sale was unfair. The FCA, under acting head Tracey McDermott, is proposing that a failure to disclose a commission of 50% or more would amount to an unfair sale, and would require compensation to be awarded. But, crucially, customers who have already received compensation for PPI mis-selling will not be able to claim again. And the proposed deadline would also apply to these complaints. Will this mean an end to those annoying calls and texts from claims firms? Probably not in the short term \u2013 an FCA advertising campaign urging people to get their complaint in as soon as possible is bound to be exploited by claims management firms. However, many of these firms have already switched their attention to \u201cthe next PPI\u201d: packaged bank accounts that charge a monthly fee for a range of benefits. What\u2019s the best way to make a PPI claim? Don\u2019t use a claims firm. Complain directly to the company concerned \u2013 and then to the ombudsman if you are not happy with the response. \u201cMaking a claim for mis-sold PPI is a free, straightforward process that you can do yourself,\u201d says the FCA. PPI claim handlers often keep as much as 30% of any compensation \u2013 so if you receive a \u00a35,000 payout, the claims firm may well pocket \u00a31,500 of that. What was the reaction to the deadline announcement? The banks were happy \u2013 the share prices of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and others rose on the announcement. The Financial Ombudsman Service is likely to be pleased, too \u2013 the costs of dealing with the PPI debacle have hammered its finances. But consumer body Which? says a time limit \u201cmust not reward those banks that have dragged their heels over paying out compensation\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen drivers in Britain whose vehicle was fitted with a device to cheat emissions tests will not have to pay higher taxes to reflect the extra pollution their car causes, the government has pledged. VW has recalled almost 1.2m diesel cars in the UK and halted the sale of 4,000 vehicles because they possess an illegal defeat device which lowers nitrogen oxide emissions in test conditions but allows high emissions on the open road. The UK government launched an investigation into the scandal, as have other countries, and said it would look at whether other carmakers were using defeat devices. However, the transport secretary said UK taxpayers would not incur higher vehicle excise duty on their cars. Under current rules, cars with higher CO2 emissions pay a higher annual road duty - which can reach \u00a3505 a year - while diesel vehicles enjoy significant tax breaks in the belief they are better for the environment. Once on the road, the VW cars with defeat devices produced nitrogen oxide pollutants at up to 40 times the legal standard. Fixing the vehicles could alter their performance and the level of CO2 emissions from the car. Patrick McLoughlin, transport secretary, said: \u201cOur priority is to protect the public and give them full confidence in diesel tests. The government expects VW to support owners of these vehicles already purchased in the UK and we are playing our part by ensuring no one will end up with higher tax costs as a result of this scandal.\u201d The government has written to car manufacturers about the crisis and is to push for an overhaul of emissions testing in Europe. \u201cWe are also starting our testing programme to get to the bottom of what the situation is for VW cars in the UK and understand the wider implications for other car types to give all consumers certainty. \u201cI have been pressing for action at an EU-level to improve emissions tests and will continue to do so. I have also called for a Europe-wide investigation into the use of defeat devices, in parallel to the work we are doing in the UK.\u201d Baker Tilly, the accountancy firm, said HMRC had been \u201ccheated\u201d out of revenue by the VW scandal because of the tax breaks that diesel cars enjoy. Edmund King, president of motoring organisation the AA, however, described the clarification on car tax as \u201ccommon sense\u201d. He said: \u201cWhen customers bought these cars it was in good faith. They bought them based on the details that were available at the time. \u201cTo add to their tax would be grossly unfair. This is a common sense and pragmatic approach and it will put many drivers\u2019 minds at ease.\u201d The emissions scandal facing VW is deepening, with authorities in France and Italy launching investigations into the embattled German carmaker. A US congressional oversight panel has also confirmed that VW\u2019s US boss, Michael Horn, will testify next Thursday in what promises to be a key moment for the company. It also emerged on Friday that Italy\u2019s competition regulator is to investigate whether VW engaged in \u201cimproper commercial practices\u201d by promoting its vehicles as meeting emissions standards which it failed to reach without a defeat device. The inquiry involves Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda diesel vehicles sold between 2009 and 2015. VW has suspended the sale of affected vehicles in Italy, and has said it will recall more than 650,000 vehicles in the country. Meanwhile in France, an official from the prosecutor\u2019s office told Reuters that an inquiry had been opened. The French magazine L\u2019Express said this had been launched at the instigation of Pierre Serne, vice-president of the region \u00cele-de-France responsible for transport. It also emerged on Friday that other car manufacturers \u2013 BMW, Chrysler, General Motors, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz \u2013 are under scrutiny from the US regulator that exposed Volkswagen\u2019s manipulation of emissions tests. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has broadened its investigation to include at least 28 diesel-powered car models made by those companies, according to the Financial Times.",

      "bodyText": "Customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance could be forced to make their claims for compensation by the spring of 2018 under proposals to draw a line under the financial industry\u2019s costliest mis-selling scandal. The industry has already incurred a bill for more than \u00a326bn in compensation and administration costs from the scandal and it has called on the Financial Conduct Authority to put a time bar on claims. The City regulator responded on Friday with proposals to set a 2018 deadline for people to claim redress. More than 10 million customers have already received compensation for policies that were sold alongside loans and credit cards. The move was welcomed by the stock market. Shares in Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 the bank with the biggest PPI claims \u2013 rose 1%. Lloyds has set aside more than \u00a313bn to tackle claims for half of the 16 million customers to whom it sold PPI in the last 15 years. Other bank shares were also higher. However, consumer bodies remained cautious and questioned whether the move was politically motivated given the potential liabilities of bailed-out banks, such as Lloyds, at a time when they are being gradually privatised. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: \u201cThe urgent clarion call to consumers is if you\u2019ve had a loan, credit card or mortgage in the last 10 years you should be checking now whether you had PPI on it and if so, was it mis-sold?\u201d In a two-pronged announcement, the FCA also raised the prospect for claims from customers for another element of PPI which has arisen from a supreme court case brought by customer Susan Plevin, which analysts have forecast could cost as as much as \u00a333bn. This case, known as Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance, means that if a PPI seller failed to disclose to a customer that it had received a large commission from the product provider, the sale was unfair under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. In a closely watched decision, the FCA said it believed 50% commission should be deemed as too high \u2013 relief for the industry which had feared that the 72% in the Plevin case could be set as precedent. To encourage customers to bring forward any remaining claims, the FCA intends to run an advertising campaign. That proposal immediately triggered a backlash from claims management companies (CMCs), which take a fee for pursuing cases. Steven Hulme, legal director at Stanton Fisher, said: \u201cWe do not support the imposition of any deadline that could potentially deny the consumer access to justice.\u201d Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer body Which?, blamed the banks for dragging out the process of paying out claims. \u201cIf a timebar is introduced, the FCA must make sure all banks carry out a complete review of their PPI handling. Efforts must be redoubled to ensure that anyone mis-sold PPI is given fair, speedy compensation so that people get back what they\u2019re rightly owed,\u201d said Lloyd. Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, questioned the decision to set a time bar. \u201cIt will be the regulator\u2019s job to ensure that any decision to set a deadline does not bring detriment to the consumer,\u201d he said. Others were also sceptical about the motivation, citing the privatisation of Lloyds which was bailed out in 2008. \u201cThe question must be asked: is this due to pressure from George Osborne to protect Lloyds Bank which has most to lose from continued payouts?\u201d said Lewis. The consultation will run to the end of the year and look at introducing a deadline by which consumers would need to make their PPI complaints, or else lose their right to have them assessed by firms or by the Financial Ombudsman Service. The proposed deadline would fall two years from the date the proposed rule comes into force, which would give customers until at least spring 2018 to complain. \u201cA potential cut-off date in the spring of 2018 for PPI complaints offers real certainty for businesses which have set aside significant resource to manage the very large number of PPI claims which have hit the UK banking and insurance industry,\u201d said Colin Read a partner at law firm Pinsent Masons.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI would like to see it bailed out,\u201d said Paul Barclay, 57, head barber at Cox\u2019s in the centre of Redcar on Teesside, thoughtful but extrovert in yellow. We are talking about the steelworks \u2013 the plant will be mothballed, announced its Thai owner, SSI, earlier this week. By Friday SSI had applied to wind up the business, after its bid for public money was knocked back by the government \u2013 which instead offered \u00a380m to help 1,700 workers find new jobs. In Brighton, Jeremy Corbyn used his conference speech to call on David Cameron to do more to save the steel industry: the main talking point was whether to pronounce it Redcar or Redke. Sometimes you get the impression that the metropolitan elite does not really care about heavy industry, unless they are complaining that the North isn\u2019t what it used to be. But what do I know? I\u2019m part of it. Back to Paul: \u201cIt\u2019s been so badly run. When they first bought it, they had a workforce there six months that didn\u2019t strike a bat. They took everyone on too early. There\u2019ll be a knock-on effect on other businesses. You don\u2019t need a haircut when you haven\u2019t got a job.\u201d A client across the room, Tony, 50, was made redundant from the plant 15 years ago, after he had been transferred from the blast furnace to the coil plate mill. \u201cBritish steel is like a closed house,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThose skills don\u2019t mean anything anywhere else.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s another kick in the teeth for Teesside, with unemployment as high as it is,\u201d said Rachael, 28, sweeping hair. Tony agreed \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t see anything else coming in to the area\u201d \u2013 then rallied. \u201cI know there isn\u2019t much to go for, but it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d When he was made redundant, he retrained as an HGV driver. It\u2019s not villagey like factory work, but not everybody likes chatting. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t miss [the steelworks] at all.\u201d From a yawning sandy beach on a beautiful day, the works look poetic, a big, imposing structure made vulnerable by invisible forces that people guess at: modernity, globalisation, the conditions of the modern Chinese worker (the current financial difficulties are ascribed to Chinese steel dumping). Redcar has none of the desperation you often sniff at the coast. It has more charity shops than you would want from a prosperous high street, and there are a number of outlets selling things in weird combinations (dresses and milkshakes; bikes and flapjacks), as if clawing for a USP. But it isn\u2019t depressed: which, of course, is because until Tuesday, it had something for a skilled workforce to do. Mark Jevons, 54, has worked in the merchant navy since 1977, so is not threatened by this move, though has had his share of lean spells. They reduce numbers in the navy too, \u201cespecially now I\u2019m getting older\u201d. Overall, he is pessimistic. \u201cI think the economy here\u2019ll get hit hard. They\u2019re scattered all around Cleveland, the men who work there, all the businesses will feel it.\u201d Four men in their 20s and early 30s in the tattoo parlour \u2013 they choose not to be named, and they do not all work in tattoos \u2013 attest to this: there have been cancellations in the shop already., they say. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t much here apart from the steelworks,\u201d sa id one. \u201cI\u2019m a plasterer by trade,\u201d said a second, and another piped up: \u201cI\u2019m in construction, and when something like this happens, it saturates the market with fake builders.\u201d Michael, 30, is out for a walk along the seafront with his three-year-old daughter, Maggie. He has six friends who work at SSI, and said: \u201cThey\u2019re a bit sickened and fed up. It\u2019ll be exactly the same as last time, they won\u2019t get told anything in case they walk off site.\u201d He is a window cleaner, but is not worried that the market will become saturated with ersatz versions. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about things like that. If they all decide to be window cleaners, I\u2019ll do something else. It\u2019s more what it\u2019ll do to the area. Little Hercules, they used to call it here. It\u2019s our identity, really. That and the horse racing.\u201d Ultimately, when Maggie has left home, Michael wants to get on his bike and live off-grid. \u201cI\u2019m sick of the whole society,\u201d he concluded, sounding incongruously upbeat.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader on an unequivocal anti-austerity platform. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s announcement that the party will back George Osborne\u2019s fiscal charter has therefore caused alarm among Corbyn\u2019s supporters. So what is Labour\u2019s position on austerity and the deficit? MPs will vote on Osborne\u2019s fiscal charter later this year. The charter commits the government to eliminate the deficit by the end of this parliament and to run a surplus in all subsequent years unless economic growth falls below 1%. The policy has been widely attacked as economically illiterate by economists and commentators across the political spectrum. History shows there is no chance the commitment will be fulfilled: the government has run a surplus in only eight of the last 60 years. Osborne\u2019s record on cutting the deficit \u2013 his stated overriding policy aim \u2013 is dismal. Why then has Corbyn\u2019s Labour party signed up to this indefensible policy? McDonnell has been sending mixed messages. In the pre-conference announcement, he is quoted as saying: \u201cWe will support the charter on the basis we are going to want to balance the books, we do want to live within our means and we will tackle the deficit.\u201d But in his conference speech McDonnell referred to the charter as \u201ca political stunt. A trap for us to fall into.\u201d It was also reported that McDonnell will sign Labour up to balancing the books on current expenditures only and will exempt borrowing for investment. But Osborne\u2019s fiscal charter explicitly sets targets for the overall government budget. Partial agreement is not an option without amendments to the bill. A balanced current budget is a more realistic proposition than an overall budget surplus. It is certainly a reasonable aim \u2013 but legally committing to such a target makes no sense. It has been achieved in less than 20 of the last 60 years. If economic activity and employment are to be maintained at acceptable levels, it will be missed again. McDonnell\u2019s proposal for a balanced current deficit accompanied by borrowing to fund investment is all but indistinguishable from the \u201causterity-lite\u201d policy put forward by Ed Balls during the general election campaign. Aside from the fact that the proposed targets will inevitably be missed, there is a deeper problem with proposals of this sort. They implicitly accept the false narrative, so carefully cultivated by the Conservatives, that the deficit \u2013 and therefore Labour \u2013 were responsible for the financial crisis. This is the danger of adopting the language of \u201cbalanced books\u201d and \u201cliving within our means\u201d. Winning an argument about \u201cdeficit denial\u201d will then be all but impossible. Corbyn distinguished himself during the leadership campaign by confronting this narrative full-on. It would be a grave error if, having won an overwhelming mandate on this basis, he and his team were now to backtrack. It is obvious why they are tempted to do so. We are repeatedly told that Labour lost the election because they weren\u2019t trusted on the economy. But Labour made no attempt to challenge the Conservative narrative; they effectively conceded the charge of responsibility for the financial crisis. Corbyn \u2013 who we were also told had no chance of winning \u2013 was the first to clearly and explicitly rebut that charge. There is another danger with McDonnell\u2019s current strategy: it involves a change in the meaning of \u201causterity\u201d. The correct definition is a macroeconomic one: refusal to use the debt-issuing power of the government as a tool to achieve full employment. In switching to a story about balanced books, defence of this crucial function of government is abandoned and austerity v anti-austerity becomes a debate purely about the size of government. In opposing Osborne\u2019s fiscal proposals, Labour enjoy the support of much of the economics profession. Even the economists who signed a letter to the Financial Times opposing Corbyn\u2019s economic policies conceded that borrowing to fund \u201cmuch-needed investment\u201d makes sense at a time of low interest rates. Labour should use this support to their advantage and be clear in putting forward an alternative to austerity. They should keep their message clear and frame the debate in their own terms. If not, they fall into Osborne\u2019s trap. \u2022 Jo Michell is a senior lecturer in economics at the University of the West of England",

      "bodyText": "FirstGroup\u2019s shares have moved ahead after the transport group issued a positive trading update, despite a slowdown in growth at its UK bus business and continuing declines at its US Greyhound operation. In a half year statement, the company said trading was in line with expectations and its turnaround plan was progressing despite \u201ca more challenging trading environment in some of our markets.\u201d In its UK bus business, revenue growth of 1.3% is expected in the first half, with continuing weakness in concessionary fares and a slowdown in passenger volumes in line with the rest of the industry. The company is taking a \u00a37m one-off hit to cover the costs of rationalising its depots. In rail, passenger revenues are expected to grow by 7% during the first six months, and after losing several franchises, it has been shortlisted for East Anglia and the TransPennine Express. At Greyhound like for like revenues are expected to fall by 6.2%, with demand across the US coach industry hit by the slump in fuel prices since last Octobe, prompting more consumers to travel by car. It said: We anticipate passenger demand will remain muted if current oil prices are sustained throughout the year. Overall it expected its non-rail businesses to offset the smaller size of its rail business after the franchise losses, and said its performance would be weighted to the second half thanks to the timing of school summer holidays affecting its First Student business. Panmure Gordon analyst Gert Zonneveld said: Net debt levels remain stubbornly high and free cash generation is relatively low (broadly flat in 2015/16 before the remaining \u00a330m cash outflow associated with the end of two rail franchises). We believe it may take longer for the group to lift divisional UK bus and North American school bus margins to double digits than currently planned. Earnings growth is likely to be flattish in the current financial year before picking up pace in 2016/17. While the valuation looks attractive, we see few catalysts in the near term. We maintain our hold recommendation and 120p target price. Jefferies also has a hold recommendation: Group commentary in its...update points to unchanged full year group expectations. But with a more challenging trading environment noted in some markets, the shape of performance seems to point to greater dependence on rail (outperforming group expectations) to get there. That\u2019s a mix dynamic that we always consider to be a deterioration in quality. Shore Capital\u2019s Martin Brown was more positive. In a buy note he said: In our opinion the turnaround remains firmly on track and with free cash flow to build strongly in the year to March 2017 we believe it is only a matter of time before the market begins to take FirstGroup off the naughty step. While the market remains concerned around the balance sheet, we expect the company to return to paying a dividend in the current year and with a free cash flow yield post all capital expenditure of 11.4% in the year to March 2017, rising to 16.1% in2018, those concerns, in our opinion, are misplaced. Investec also keeps its buy recommendation, and points to one reason for rising rail revenues: FirstGroup has delivered first half trading that is in aggregate in line with expectations. On the positive side, 5 bus depots have been cut which should mean bus margins are stronger sooner and rail revenues were better than we anticipated, boosted by passengers travelling West to visit Dismaland. On the negative side, concessionary bus revenues were slightly worse than we expected and in North America, Greyhound and Transit have deteriorated. We make small forecast changes but retain our buy and 125p target price. In the market FirstGroup\u2019s shares have climbed 1p to 100p.",

The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills also said it turned down an unviable request from SSI for funding to keep the factory open. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, attended a meeting of a local taskforce in Redcar on Friday, where he announced the support package, which includes funding for affected workers to train at further education colleges. There will also be money to help workers who want to start a business and for existing small businesses. Javid said: \u201cThis is an extremely difficult time for the workforce at SSI and the local community. The package we are announcing today will provide important support to workers and the local economy. Across government we will continue to focus on providing assistance where we can.\u201d SSI mothballed the plant on Monday, blaming a slump in the price of steel for the decision, which will put 1,700 permanent workers out of jobs. Unions have called on the government to intervene to support Britain\u2019s steel industry. Campaigners in Redcar fear the closure will put thousands more jobs at risk in the local economy.

The company has never made a profit and the board\u2019s proposal would do nothing to address the huge debts outstanding to local suppliers and other parties.\u201d A spokesman for the Community union said SSI was to blame for the closure of Redcar after nearly 100 years in operation, but added that the government needed to do more. \u201cWe have been saying for weeks that SSI is not fit for purpose. It is clear that SSI has yet again put forward a plan to government that lacks credibility. We believe there are alternative plans and parties who could intervene to protect the industrial assets,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment\u2019s responsibility has not ended with the announcement of this support package.

      "bodyText": "A big pick-up in housebuilding helped the UK\u2019s construction sector enjoy its fastest growth for seven months in September and boosted job creation, according to a survey. All parts of the industry from civil engineering to housebuilders saw output rise in September. That lifted the key measure of business activity for the whole construction sector to 59.9 from 57.3 in August, the latest Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI showed. That was higher than the consensus forecast for 57.5 in a Reuters poll of economists and well above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. Housebuilding was the best performing part of the industry in September with the strongest growth for 12 months, as some companies reported a boost from new developments getting underway after delays earlier in the year. There had been reports of construction companies putting off projects before the general election in May as they awaited news on any potential tax and planning changes. \u201cResidential building saw the most decisive momentum shift in September, hitting a one-year high in the process, while commercial development also picked up speed as rising business investment and improving UK economic conditions acted to bolster demand,\u201d said Tim Moore, senior economist at survey compilers Markit. \u201cA growth spurt for civil engineering activity completed the hat-trick of positive news for the main construction sub-sectors in September, helped by robust pipelines of infrastructure work.\u201d But there were renewed warnings from builders about skills shortages as well as signs new business was flowing in at a slower pace. \u201cConstruction companies have recorded a steady slowdown in new business growth from June\u2019s post-election peak and the latest upturn was the second-slowest since mid-2013,\u201d said Moore. Construction companies continued to create jobs for the 28th month running and in September they hired new staff at the fastest pace for three months. Companies said they continued to increase their use of sub-contractors last month and sub-contractor charges \u201ccontinued to rise sharply\u201d, the report said. The pound strengthened on the back of the better than expected construction report, which contrasted with a weaker snapshot from Markit for the manufacturing sector published on Thursday. While construction makes up only around 6% of the economy, the government will be encouraged by the news on housebuilding which it has vowed to boost to address a long-standing shortage of homes.",

      "bodyText": "The Volkswagen emissions-testing scandal is deepening, with authorities in France and Italy launching investigations into the embattled German carmaker. Italy\u2019s competition regulator is to investigate whether VW engaged in \u201cimproper commercial practices\u201d by promoting its vehicles as meeting emissions standards which it failed to reach without a \u201cdefeat device\u201d. The inquiry involves Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda diesel vehicles sold between 2009 and 2015. VW has suspended the sale of affected vehicles in Italy, and has said it will recall more than 650,000 vehicles in the country. In France, an official from the prosecutor\u2019s office told Reuters that an inquiry had been opened. The French magazine L\u2019Express said this had been launched at the instigation of Pierre Serne, vice-president of the region \u00cele-de-France responsible for transport. It also emerged on Friday that other car manufacturers \u2013 BMW, Chrysler, General Motors, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz \u2013 are under scrutiny from the US regulator that exposed Volkswagen\u2019s manipulation of emissions tests. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has broadened its investigation to include at least 28 diesel-powered car models made by those companies, according to the Financial Times. VW has admitted to the US regulator that it fitted up to 11m vehicles worldwide with software that manipulates the tests. Its chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, has stepped down and is facing a criminal investigation in Germany, along with other, unnamed, employees of the carmaker. The EPA will initially test one used vehicle of each model and then widen the enquiry if it finds anything suspicious, a senior agency official close to the investigation told the FT. The investigation will include most of the diesel vehicles on American roads, such as BMW\u2019s X3, Chrysler\u2019s Grand Cherokee, GM\u2019s Chevrolet Colorado, the Range Rover TDV6 and the Mercedes-Benz E250 BlueTec. Diesel engines make up a tiny proportion of the overall car market in the US, but are far more common in Europe. BMW has rejected allegations that it cheated emissions tests. About 2.8m Volkswagen vehicles are affected in Germany, nearly 1.2m in the UK and 482,000 in the US. The software detected when a diesel car was being tested and switched on controls to cut emissions. On the road, cars were found to be emitting up to 40 times the permitted level of nitrogen oxide. Former UK science minister Lord Drayson has admitted that the Labour government\u2019s support for diesel cars was a mistake, and warned that diesels were \u201cliterally killing people\u201d. Luc Simoncini, of Kames Equity Investment, said: \u201cCar manufacturers could be tarnished for some time, irrespective of the individual merit of each company. The scandal currently hurting VW echoes eerily of the scandals which tarnished big banks at the peak of the financial boom.\u201d He advised investors to stay away from the auto sector for the time being, saying there are enough other investment opportunities. \u201cFor the auto industry, it is still unclear what the response of regulators across the world will be, especially around the implementation of new tests. In addition, the long term case for diesel engines for compact cars could be in jeopardy and could impact the fundamental valuation of most players in the sector.\u201d Tax specialists Baker Tilly noted that HMRC, and British taxpayers, could be losers in the scandal. At this stage it is unclear whether the software used by VW to manipulate tests lowered CO2 as well as nitrogen oxide emissions. UK vehicle duty and benefit in kind tax are based on CO2 emissions, so lower emissions mean that less tax is collected from the driver. Bill Longe, of Baker Tilly, said: \u201cIf it is eventually proven that the VW software did lower CO2 ratings, then HMRC \u2013 and ultimately UK taxpayers \u2013 will feel quite rightfully cheated out of much-needed revenue.\u201d The firm also questioned whether a tax break on diesel cars due to be announced in 2016 could be shelved.",

      "bodyText": "Experian, one of the largest credit agency data brokers in the world, has been hacked. Some 15 million people who used the company\u2019s services, among them customers of cellular company T-Mobile who had applied for Experian credit checks, may have had their private information exposed, the company confirmed on Thursday. Information from the hack includes names, addresses, and social security, driver\u2019s license and passport numbers. The license and passport numbers were in an encrypted field, but Experian said that encryption may also have been compromised. Connecticut\u2019s attorney general said he will launch an investigation into the breach. The company said its consumer credit database was not affected and that \u201cno other clients\u2019 data was accessed\u201d, presumably meaning the damage is limited to T-Mobile. Experian did not name the perpetrator but in a statement the company said it had contacted law enforcement. The hack specifically affects \u201cthose who applied for T-Mobile USA postpaid services or device financing from September 1, 2013 through September 16, 2015\u201d, according to Experian. \u201cExperian discovered an unauthorized party accessed T-Mobile data housed in an Experian server,\u201d the company said in a questions page addressed to consumers. Experian is offering consumers affected by the breach free credit monitoring services. T-Mobile said it won\u2019t delete credit check data from the Experian servers because of credit laws that require retention for 25 months. \u201cObviously I am incredibly angry about this data breach and we will institute a thorough review of our relationship with Experian, but right now my top concern and first focus is assisting any and all consumers affected,\u201d wrote T-Mobile\u2019s CEO, John Legere. \u201cI take our customer and prospective customer privacy VERY [sic] seriously. This is no small issue for us. I do want to assure our customers that neither T-Mobile\u2019s systems nor network were part of this intrusion and this did not involve any payment card numbers or bank account information.\u201d Experian\u2019s businesses extend into every area of American life, from customer loyalty cards that track the purchases of everyday necessities to public records including real estate liens and bankruptcy. Its vast database is widely used by automated advertising networks to load ads relevant to a given user, but has many other applications besides. Jon Mandel, whose data firm PrecisionDemand was sold to AOL for an undisclosed sum last year, now works as a consultant in the industry and said that the breach has wide-ranging consequences across any number of industries. Data brokers, Mandel said, are often trusted by other companies to \u201canonymize\u201d personally identifying information so as to keep it from accidentally leading to embarrassing mistakes such as the OfficeMax envelope addressed to \u201cMike Seay \u2013 Daughter Killed in Car Crash\u201d (OfficeMax ultimately blamed an unidentified data broker for that incident). \u201cThe irony is that so many companies have used Experian as a \u2018clean room\u2019 to put your data together with other companies\u2019 data to keep it from being personally identifiable,\u201d Mandel said. \u201cThat very ability can make everything personally identifiable.\u201d Experian has lobbied in support of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, legislation currently being considered in the Senate that would broaden its immunity were it to share its stores of information with the Department of Homeland Security (which in turn would be compelled to share it with law enforcement and the NSA). \u201cCongress has the responsibility to balance the need for facilitating greater information sharing, and thereby enhancing cybersecurity, with important consumer privacy concerns,\u201d an Experian spokesperson wrote last month. \u201cWe encourage and support Congress\u2019s effort in striking this balance.\u201d The Experian hack is the most recent in a series of data breaches affecting organizations from the US government\u2019s Office of Personnel Management to Target, often to the tune of tens of millions of users. The US government has blamed Chinese hackers for the OPM breach and pulled spies from the country because their cover stories could potentially have been blown by the breach. Private, identifying information is frequently reappropriated by data thieves, who have used it to wreak havoc among people from employees of multinational tech and entertainment company Sony and users of married hook-up site Ashley Madison, in the latter case leading to widespread blackmail. With respect to this specific incident, Mandel said: \u201cIt\u2019s like anything else in life. All kinds of things sound good but everything\u2019s good in moderation. Sometimes the best medicine turns out to be poisonous.\u201d The latest incident is the second huge breach linked to Experian. An attack on an Experian subsidiary in 2014 exposed the social security numbers of 200 million Americans and prompted an investigation by at least four states, including Connecticut. A spokeswoman for Connecticut attorney general George Jepsen said on Thursday that it would investigate the latest attack.",
