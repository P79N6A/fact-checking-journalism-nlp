      "bodyText": "The Australian government is fighting to keep secret the amount it paid to fight a legal battle with the tobacco industry over its plain packaging laws. Philip Morris, a tobacco multinational, used a clause in a Hong Kong-Australia trade deal to sue the Australian government over its Gillard-era plain packaging laws. It eventually lost the case, but the Nick Xenophon Team has since attempted to find out how much Australia paid to fight the case in The Hague. NXT is concerned the newly-signed Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 which contains similar clauses to the Hong Kong deal \u2013 could prompt similar actions against the Australian government. Nick Xenophon, while still in the Senate in 2016, lodged a freedom of information request to determine the full amount Australia paid in legal costs. It has been reported to be as high as $50m. The federal government has resisted releasing the information, but was ordered to disclose it by the information commissioner this year. NXT senator Rex Patrick said the Department of Health lodged an appeal in the administrative appeals tribunal this week to prevent the disclosure. He described the position as a \u201cdelaying tactic\u201d. \u201cThe government\u2019s plans may well backfire,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cHiding relevant information from the parliament is not a good tactic. \u201cI\u2019ll be keeping an eye on how much the taxpayer ends up paying for this AAT appeal, too.\u201d Philip Morris lost the case against Australia in The Hague. Last year, it was ordered to pay Australia\u2019s claim for legal costs. Australia successfully argued Philip Morris had to pay its court fees and expenses, the cost of expert witnesses, travel, and solicitors and counsel. Australia had told the court its claim for costs was modest and was a small proportion of what the tobacco giant had sought in damages. But Philip Morris argued that Australia was asking much more than other countries, including Canada and the US, which had never claimed more than US$4.5m and US$3m respectively in costs and fees. Philip Morris argued the plain packaging laws violated the terms of a 1993 trade agreement between Australia and Hong Kong. It argued a ban on trademarks breached foreign investment provisions. The case was launched using so-called investor-state dispute settlement clauses, which are also contained in the new TPP, signed on Friday. The new TPP has specific provisions that prevent tobacco companies from suing Australia over its tobacco control laws. But the Public Health Association of Australia, among others, fears the deal will allow other corporations to sue Australia. PHAA spokeswoman Belinda Townsend said: \u201cWhile there are generalised protections for regulatory measures, and specific measures to prevent tobacco companies from being able to challenge Australia\u2019s tobacco control measures, public health policies in other important areas are not excluded from being challenged.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Economist Paul Johnson: \u2018We are nowhere near out of austerity'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When the chancellor Philip Hammond sits down on Tuesday after delivering his first spring statement \u2013 the streamlined replacement for what we used to call the budget \u2013 one man will be greatly in demand, popping up on every media outlet to tell us what the figures on borrowing levels and the projected deficit really mean. That man is Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). I suggest to him that his official role is to pour a bucket of cold water over Hammond\u2019s head, and he doesn\u2019t disagree. \u201cEconomics is the dismal science, after all,\u201d he says. Happily, 51-year-old Johnson is not at all dismal. He is clever, sparky and down to earth \u2013 probably because he sees life through the lens of a father with four demanding sons going through the education system. He crunches all the numbers, but he also understands the personal stories behind those numbers. He has written about how his dyslexic second son has battled through further education and been disappointed by the threadbare nature of Britain\u2019s vocational training system. That, in turn, informs his critique of a society unduly preoccupied with universities and graduates. Johnson, despite a mildly nerdy manner, is the opposite of the ivory-towered academic. The idea of the spring statement, with the budget now pushed back to autumn, is to tell us where we are financially, and to kickstart consultations about the long-term fiscal challenges facing the UK. That, for Johnson, is the important bit. If the spring statement works, it is an opportunity to counteract the short-termism that bedevils British politics and to start thinking about the issues that really matter \u2013 the ageing population, the buckling health service, the lack of any coherent plan for social care, the fact that soon taxes are going to have to rise or public services will fall to pieces. There comes a point when you can no longer kick the can down the road because the road is no longer usable. The Office for Budget Responsibility numbers cited in the spring statement will be better than those projected last autumn because tax receipts have been higher than anticipated, and Johnson reckons Hammond will indulge in some self-congratulation for having met the government\u2019s austerity targets (albeit two years later than his predecessor George Osborne forecast) and eliminated the deficit on day-to-day spending. But Johnson is ready with his bucket of cold water. \u201cChancellors always talk up the positive numbers,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we\u2019re not out of austerity; we\u2019re nowhere near out of austerity. There are still big spending cuts and big social security cuts to come.\u201d He says the government has done well to get the deficit under control, but thinks the pips are now starting to squeak. \u201cIf you look at the period up to 2013/14, spending came down without big political consequences or things falling apart. But, in a whole range of areas, that is no longer true. If you look at what\u2019s happening in prisons it\u2019s just disastrous. Local government until 2014 was coping fine. It really isn\u2019t any more. Clearly, the health service is struggling in a way that, three or four years ago, it wasn\u2019t. So it feels as if we\u2019ve got to the crunch point. We\u2019re really beginning to feel the cost.\u201d Government borrowing is now back to pre-financial crash levels. \u201cIt is quite an achievement to have got borrowing down from the highest level since the war to pretty much normal kinds of levels,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s come down from about 10% of national income to 2%, so from well over \u00a3150bn to a number somewhere in the low 40s.\u201d That\u2019s annual. It\u2019s an achievement that we are only running up extra debt of \u00a340bn a year. My head is starting to spin. It spins further when he tells me what the national debt is \u2013 approaching \u00a32tn, which equates to around 90% of GDP. When, I ask, do you hit the panic button about the size of the debt? \u201cWho knows?\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not close to that at the moment. Interest rates are still incredibly low, and despite the fact that the debt is twice as big as it was in 2008, we are not paying any more interest because rates are so low. The risk that the Treasury is balancing all the time is that at some point we\u2019ll have another recession and if the debt then goes up by another 40% of national income, can we manage 130% of national income debt? Maybe. Probably. But at the point at which you can\u2019t and people stop lending to you, then you lose control in quite a big way. You\u2019re managing a very small risk of a very bad outcome.\u201d Johnson reckons it is time for politicians to level with the public about the financial challenges facing the UK. Brexit, plus our ageing population and the resultant pressure on health, pensions and social care, means something has to give. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see what\u2019s left to squeeze,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no defence budget to squeeze. There is no industry budget to squeeze, no housing budget to squeeze. Where do you go next? Unless you say, \u2018Well, we are going to have to increase spending as a fraction of national income and increase taxes over the next 10 or 20 years\u2019, which at least until the last Labour manifesto was a conversation that no politician was terribly keen to have.\u201d He says both of the main political parties are living in a fantasy world. \u201cOn the one side you have a party saying you can have all the welfare state we\u2019ve ever had and pay no more tax, which isn\u2019t true. And on the other side, you\u2019ve got them saying we can levy more tax and it\u2019ll be somebody else who pays because it\u2019ll come off companies and the rich, which also isn\u2019t true. Labour\u2019s election manifesto had an awful lot of overestimates about what you can get from companies and the very rich, and didn\u2019t fully balance out. You can\u2019t have European standards of welfare with American-style tax levels. You have to make a choice.\u201d Making choices and being honest with the public is not, as Brexit shows, something politicians are good at. Analysing the shibboleths surrounding the NHS and the lack of progress on developing a system of social care, Johnson has written about the \u201cinfantilisation of public debate\u201d, which he says emerged starkly in both the recent referendums. \u201cIn the Brexit referendum there were strong arguments on both sides, but you didn\u2019t have any sense of the trade-offs. Referendums are a one-shot game and a pure yes/no, so everyone has to make out that everything is good about what they\u2019re suggesting \u2013 the economy is better and immigration is better and sovereignty is better and and, and ... It was exactly the same in the Scottish referendum. There were some entirely sensible and plausible arguments for Scottish independence, but it was absurd to pretend it wouldn\u2019t involve spending cuts or tax rises in Scotland.\u201d I ask him if he ever considered a political career himself \u2013 many of the young alumni of the IFS, which he once was, go into politics. He pauses before giving the definitive reason why he could never have done it: \u201cIf you are working in the party political system, you have to subjugate yourself to such an extent to the party line. Some politicians manage to be independent, but not many successful ones.\u201d That is not, however, to say that he despises politicians for the compromises they have to make and the false claims that are part and parcel of political life. He recognises the nightmarish task they have. \u201cMaking policy is hard. You\u2019re trading off these huge political and ethical issues. You\u2019ve got your own ideology; you\u2019ve got lots of conflicting evidence; whatever you do is going to make some people better off, some people worse off, and you don\u2019t quite know who they\u2019re going to be.\u201d Does he ever doubt the merits of democracy, with its requirement to make a \u201cretail offer\u201d to the public that is inevitably overblown, perhaps even mendacious, to win votes? Might China be on to something with its authoritarian centralism that at least ensures stability and long-term planning? \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that democracy is the right way to do things,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I do doubt some of our institutions. We are in an unusual position at the moment where you\u2019ve got politics pulling to the left and to the right, and you\u2019ve got nothing really filling the middle. That\u2019s partly happening across the world, but it is a reflection of the way first-past-the-post works here.\u201d So does he speak for the technocratic middle? \u201cI don\u2019t know about the middle,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always aware that there is a technocratic bit, which is what I and my colleagues do, but there is also an ideological bit and a democratic bit, and that\u2019s really important. The best we can do \u2013 and the best that civil servants can do \u2013 is to put the evidence before the people who have been elected and then it\u2019s their choice. That creates desirable constraints. It would be a disaster if the country was run by pure technocrats.\u201d But why? That sounds ideal. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be listening to the people,\u201d he counters. \u201cArguably, that\u2019s the lesson of Brussels.\u201d Johnson loves the IFS, and under him it has a pleasing energy and informality \u2013 a 50-strong group of mainly young researchers and economic and social policy experts who can run a slide rule over the more outlandish claims of politicians and point out the pitfalls of their policies. He spent his 20s there after getting a first in philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, then worked at the Cabinet Office, the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury before returning to the IFS as a research fellow in 2007, just in time for the nation-redefining financial crash. He became its director in 2011. His two immediate predecessors, Andrew Dilnot and Robert Chote, did 11 and eight years respectively before going on to grand posts elsewhere (and in Dilnot\u2019s case bagging a knighthood), but Johnson looks nonplussed when I ask him if 10 years will be enough for him. He clearly hasn\u2019t thought about stepping down, or started eyeing up other plum jobs. \u201cI love the IFS,\u201d he once declared. \u201cI love what it does and I love the way it does it.\u201d That love affair shows no sign of abating. One economist told me that if you read Johnson\u2019s weekly articles in the Times carefully, you are filled with despair, because as a nation we refuse to confront the hard questions he is raising. Politicians like to gambol in the long grass. I ask Johnson, who in person is anything but downbeat, whether despair is a legitimate response to his truth-telling. \u201cI\u2019m not filled with despair about what\u2019s possible because we are a relatively low-taxed country by European standards,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could perfectly easily, in an economic sense, raise more tax and still have an equitable, well-functioning economy. The thing that worries me is the difficulty of having a sensible conversation about it and the belief that, if you are going to raise more money from tax, there\u2019s some free money floating around.\u201d There is no free money. If we want better health care, social care, education, transport, we are all going to have to stump up. He estimates that in the next 20 years, we will have to pay an extra 3% of national income in tax \u2013 equivalent to about \u00a360bn a year \u2013 just to meet the rising pension and social care bill. He floats some bracing ideas: VAT on food; paying social insurance to help fund the NHS; road pricing to replace the \u00a330bn a year in fuel duty that will be lost as cars move away from petrol and diesel; wealth taxes levied on expensive properties, second homes (which he sees as a key factor in the housing crisis) and even personal pensions, which have been sacred until now. These are the sorts of big ideas he wants Philip Hammond to start to embrace next week. Whether the chancellor will rise to the challenge is another matter. That long grass looks very inviting. Even without Brexit the challenges facing the UK would be formidable. With Brexit they look cataclysmic. \u201cThe economics are obvious,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you make trade with your biggest, nearest and richest trading partner more expensive, you will make yourself worse off. The truth is there is no dispute about that. Of course there\u2019s a case for Brexit. It\u2019s just not an economic case. It\u2019s a controlling immigration case. With everything, and this is what\u2019s frustrating about a lot of political debate, there are trade-offs. Do you want control of your borders or do you want to avoid taking a hit of a couple of per cent of GDP? You can\u2019t have both. Politicians tell you that you can have your cake and eat it, but you can\u2019t. And that\u2019s not a jibe at Boris. It\u2019s true of pretty well all politicians about everything.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When the chancellor Philip Hammond sits down on Tuesday after delivering his first spring statement \u2013 the streamlined replacement for what we used to call the budget \u2013 one man will be greatly in demand, popping up on every media outlet to tell us what the figures on borrowing levels and the projected deficit really mean. That man is Paul Johnson, director of the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/\">Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). </a> I suggest to him that his official role is to pour a bucket of cold water over Hammond\u2019s head, and he doesn\u2019t disagree. \u201cEconomics is the dismal science, after all,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Happily, 51-year-old Johnson is not at all dismal. He is clever, sparky and down to earth \u2013 probably because he sees life through the lens of a father with four demanding sons going through the education system. He crunches all the numbers, but he also understands the personal stories behind those numbers. He has written about how his dyslexic second son has battled through further education and been <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/10301\">disappointed by the threadbare nature of Britain\u2019s vocational training system</a>. That, in turn, informs his critique of a society unduly preoccupied with universities and graduates. Johnson, despite a mildly nerdy manner, is the opposite of the ivory-towered academic.</p> <p>The idea of the spring statement, with the budget now pushed back to autumn, is to tell us where we are financially, and to kickstart consultations about the long-term fiscal challenges facing the UK. That, for Johnson, is the important bit. If the spring statement works, it is an opportunity to counteract the short-termism that bedevils British politics and to start thinking about the issues that really matter \u2013 the ageing population, the buckling health service, the lack of any coherent plan for social care, the fact that soon taxes are going to have to rise or public services will fall to pieces. There comes a point when you can no longer kick the can down the road because the road is no longer usable.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://obr.uk\">Office for Budget Responsibility</a> numbers cited in the spring statement will be better than those projected last autumn because tax receipts have been higher than anticipated, and Johnson reckons Hammond will indulge in some self-congratulation for having met the government\u2019s austerity targets (albeit two years later than his predecessor George Osborne forecast) and eliminated the deficit on day-to-day spending. But Johnson is ready with his bucket of cold water. \u201cChancellors always talk up the positive numbers,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we\u2019re not out of austerity; we\u2019re nowhere near out of austerity. There are still big spending cuts and big social security cuts to come.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b078d441ab9a73b54aabb403c41e3f9a93fa8c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b078d441ab9a73b54aabb403c41e3f9a93fa8c5d/23_199_4026_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson says the chancellor, Philip Hammond, will indulge in some self-congratulation for meeting austerity targets, but warns there are still big spending cuts to come.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson says the chancellor, Philip Hammond, will indulge in some self-congratulation for meeting austerity targets, but warns there are still big spending cuts to come.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says the government has done well to get the deficit under control, but thinks the pips are now starting to squeak. \u201cIf you look at the period up to 2013/14, spending came down without big political consequences or things falling apart. But, in a whole range of areas, that is no longer true. If you look at what\u2019s happening in prisons it\u2019s just disastrous. Local government until 2014 was coping fine. It really isn\u2019t any more. Clearly, the health service is struggling in a way that, three or four years ago, it wasn\u2019t. So it feels as if we\u2019ve got to the crunch point. We\u2019re really beginning to feel the cost.\u201d</p> <p>Government borrowing is now back to pre-financial crash levels. \u201cIt is quite an achievement to have got borrowing down from the highest level since the war to pretty much normal kinds of levels,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s come down from about 10% of national income to 2%, so from well over \u00a3150bn to a number somewhere in the low 40s.\u201d That\u2019s annual. It\u2019s an achievement that we are only running up extra debt of \u00a340bn a year. My head is starting to spin.</p> <p>It spins further when he tells me what the national debt is \u2013 approaching \u00a32tn, which equates to around 90% of GDP. When, I ask, do you hit the panic button about the size of the debt? \u201cWho knows?\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not close to that at the moment. Interest rates are still incredibly low, and despite the fact that the debt is twice as big as it was in 2008, we are not paying any more interest because rates are so low. The risk that the Treasury is balancing all the time is that at some point we\u2019ll have another recession and if the debt then goes up by another 40% of national income, can we manage 130% of national income debt? Maybe. Probably. But at the point at which you can\u2019t and people stop lending to you, then you lose control in quite a big way. You\u2019re managing a very small risk of a very bad outcome.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson reckons it is time for politicians to level with the public about the financial challenges facing the UK. Brexit, plus our ageing population and the resultant pressure on health, pensions and social care, means something has to give. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see what\u2019s left to squeeze,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no defence budget to squeeze. There is no industry budget to squeeze, no housing budget to squeeze. Where do you go next? Unless you say, \u2018Well, we are going to have to increase spending as a fraction of national income and increase taxes over the next 10 or 20 years\u2019, which at least until the last Labour manifesto was a conversation that no politician was terribly keen to have.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/08/councils-raid-reserves-to-cope-with-social-care-nao-report\">Stretched councils raid reserves to cope with social care, NAO warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He says both of the main political parties are living in a fantasy world. \u201cOn the one side you have a party saying you can have all the welfare state we\u2019ve ever had and pay no more tax, which isn\u2019t true. And on the other side, you\u2019ve got them saying we can levy more tax and it\u2019ll be somebody else who pays because it\u2019ll come off companies and the rich, which also isn\u2019t true. Labour\u2019s election manifesto had an awful lot of overestimates about what you can get from companies and the very rich, and didn\u2019t fully balance out. You can\u2019t have European standards of welfare with American-style tax levels. You have to make a choice.\u201d</p> <p>Making choices and being honest with the public is not, as Brexit shows, something politicians are good at. Analysing the shibboleths surrounding the NHS and the lack of progress on developing a system of social care, Johnson has written about the <a href=\" https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/9682\">\u201cinfantilisation of public debate\u201d</a>, which he says emerged starkly in both the recent referendums. \u201cIn the Brexit referendum there were strong arguments on both sides, but you didn\u2019t have any sense of the trade-offs. Referendums are a one-shot game and a pure yes/no, so everyone has to make out that everything is good about what they\u2019re suggesting \u2013 the economy is better and immigration is better and sovereignty is better and and, and ... It was exactly the same in the Scottish referendum. There were some entirely sensible and plausible arguments for Scottish independence, but it was absurd to pretend it wouldn\u2019t involve spending cuts or tax rises in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>I ask him if he ever considered a political career himself \u2013 many of the young alumni of the IFS, which he once was, go into politics. He pauses before giving the definitive reason why he could never have done it: \u201cIf you are working in the party political system, you have to subjugate yourself to such an extent to the party line. Some politicians manage to be independent, but not many successful ones.\u201d</p> <p>That is not, however, to say that he despises politicians for the compromises they have to make and the false claims that are part and parcel of political life. He recognises the nightmarish task they have. \u201cMaking policy is hard. You\u2019re trading off these huge political and ethical issues. You\u2019ve got your own ideology; you\u2019ve got lots of conflicting evidence; whatever you do is going to make some people better off, some people worse off, and you don\u2019t quite know who they\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1797aa1b0f5dc9c2f8bd68f021e915850769ce7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1797aa1b0f5dc9c2f8bd68f021e915850769ce7/1076_635_5204_3123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There is no economic case for Brexit, says Johnson \u2026 lorries at Dover port.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is no economic case for Brexit, says Johnson \u2026 lorries at Dover port.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does he ever doubt the merits of democracy, with its requirement to make a \u201cretail offer\u201d to the public that is inevitably overblown, perhaps even mendacious, to win votes?

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest arms manufacturer, BAE Systems, has moved towards completing an order worth billions of pounds from Saudi Arabia for the purchase of 48 Typhoon fighter jets. The announcement came at the end of a three-day visit to the UK by the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. Although the order could help save jobs, the proposed contract was immediately denounced by arms campaigners concerned about Saudi Arabia\u2019s bombing of Yemen. The UK signed a memorandum of intent with the Saudis. The BAE chief executive, Charles Woodburn, described the news as \u201ca positive step towards agreeing a contract for our valued partner, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We are committed to supporting the kingdom as it modernises the Saudi armed forces.\u201d Sales of the Typhoon have been slowing and BAE announced 1,400 job cuts in October. The prospect of a Saudi deal provides a boost, coming on top of a \u00a35bn order from Qatar for 24 Typhoons. Arms sales to Saudi Arabia have been dogged by scandal since allegations of illicit payments to land the al-Yamamah contract \u2013 Britain\u2019s biggest arms deal, worth \u00a343bn \u2013 surfaced soon after it was sealed in 1985. Both the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office and the US justice department investigated. Andrew Smith, a spokesman for the Campaign Against Arms Trade, said that since the bombardment of Yemen began in 2015, the UK has licensed arms worth \u00a34.6bn to Saudi Arabia even before the latest proposed deal. \u201cIf agreed, this shameful deal will be celebrated in the palaces of Riyadh and by the arms companies who will profit from it but it will mean even greater destruction for the people of Yemen,\u201d Smith said. The Typhoon could be the last \u201cBritish\u201d combat plane. Given the costs involved, the Ministry of Defence may find it cheaper in the future to buy planes from the US or elsewhere. BAE Systems says it employs about 5,000 people on the Typhoon programme. The Serious Fraud Office brought its investigation into the al-Yamamah deal to a premature close in 2006 when the then prime minister, Tony Blair, intervened to say its continuation would harm UK security after the Saudis threatened to stop sharing intelligence on terrorism.",

      "bodyText": "An unexpected decline in housebuilding meant the UK construction industry contracted for the ninth month in a row in January. The number of new homes built dropped 9% compared with the previous month as the threat of higher interest rates and rising labour costs deterred building firms from starting new projects. Public building, which fell 8.9%, was also hit as construction output, worsened by the collapse of the building contractor Carillion, decreased by 3.9% compared with the previous January, representing the biggest annual decline since March 2013. Figures from the Office for National Statistics also showed a rise in the cost of imports, mainly higher priced fuel, led to the trade deficit increasing from \u00a311.8bn to \u00a312.3bn. There was better news from the manufacturing industry, which extended its period of increased output to nine months in a row in January, the longest run of expansion since records began in 1968. But analysts said its weaker pace of growth shown in the official figures, which echoed industry surveys, was a worry when the rest of the world was experiencing a boom in manufacturing. Alan Clarke, a UK economist at Scotia Bank, described the 0.1% rise in UK manufacturing output in the first month of the year as \u201cdreary\u201d and \u201cbelow the sector\u2019s batting average\u201d. Dennis de Jong, the managing director at currency dealer UFX.com, said: \u201cThe big worry for Theresa May and her cabinet will be whether this slight slowdown represents the tip of the iceberg of an economy that is struggling to satisfy demand.\u201d The National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research said the weak figures for January contributed to GDP growth slowing in the three months to February to 0.3% from 0.4% in the three months to January. Amit Kara, the institute\u2019s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, said: \u201cEconomic growth continues to be driven by both the manufacturing and the service sectors, supported by a buoyant global economy, while construction output lags.\u201d The ONS data also included figures that showed Britain\u2019s industrial production rebounded in January following the boost in manufacturing and North Sea oil and gas production. Energy production was depressed in December following the temporary shutdown of production in the Forties oil and gas fields in the North Sea after a crack was discovered in the pipeline bringing fuel ashore. Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at currency dealer WorldFirst, said the most important ONS figure was the UK\u2019s trade deficit, which had worsened and looked vulnerable to an escalation of protectionist trade barriers. \u201cThe deficit continues to expand despite the pound being 14% cheaper than its trade weighted average over the past 20 years,\u201d he said. The trade deficit in January widened only marginally with the European Union compared with the rest of the world, which was the source of imports of fuel at higher prices and aircraft. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at the UK manufacturers\u2019 organisation, EEF, said there was evidence that capital goods exporters, such as mechanical equipment and electronics firms, had a solid start to 2018. But their success in selling to the EU compared with the rest of the world showed the bloc\u2019s dominant role in bolstering goods exports with growth outpacing that to non-EU customers. She also warned against a tit-for-tat trade war that would harm the UK more than most countries. \u201cWith overseas demand such an important contributor to the current positive outlook for manufacturing, risks of increasing protectionism would surely put the brakes on growth at a time when the economy is more reliant on a good performance from externally facing industries,\u201d Hopley said.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the kind of bad news best served with a stiff drink: the price of standard supermarket wines such as prosecco and pinot grigio could rise by up to 30% this year as the impact of 2017\u2019s disastrous harvest is felt on the high street. Global wine production slumped to its lowest level in more than 50 years in 2017 after vines in the world\u2019s top three producers \u2013 France, Spain and Italy \u2013 were ravaged by both freakishly hot and cold weather. Hard-hit regions include those producing Rioja and prosecco, which make large quantities of the affordable wines sold in supermarkets. \u201cWe\u2019ll start to see those [2017] wines coming to the market now and I think for higher volume, lower price wine you will see cost increases,\u201d says Dan Jago, chief executive of high end wine merchant Berry Bros &amp; Rudd. \u201cPrices for things like pinot grigio or generic Spanish reds will rise by between 10% and 30% and it\u2019s [a question of] how much of that retailers will pass on,\u201d says Jago, who previously headed up the Tesco wine business. \u201cProsecco was very hard hit by frost, so there will be less of it and the price will go up.\u201d The International Organisation of Vine and Wine estimates global wine production dropped 8% to 247m hectolitres in 2017 \u2013 the worst global harvest since 1961. A hectolitre is the equivalent to 133 standard wine bottles, so the fall in output equates to about 2.9bn fewer bottles. Last month the Bordeaux wine council said production in what is France\u2019s largest wine growing region was down 40% with vineyards in Saint-\u00c9milion worst affected by the severe frost. But while some chateaux lost up to 90% of their harvest, others escaped unscathed, the council added. \u201cIn Bordeaux the top 150 chateaux have not really been affected but the grand surface \u2013 the total acreage of Bordeaux \u2013 has been ravaged,\u201d says Jago. \u201cThe Bordeaux harvest, like the overall harvest across Italy and Spain, has been decimated but it tends to be the more flat lying, higher volume production land that has been hit.\u201d The devaluation of sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote has already had an impact on the cost of wine in supermarkets which is up by an average of 4% over the past year, according to research firm Nielsen. French wine cost 5.5% more, while the price tag for Portuguese and Italian varieties increased by 5.1% and 3.5% respectively. The UK\u2019s still and sparking wine market is worth more than \u00a310bn a year and is the biggest market by volume of EU wine exports. Last year alone Britons got through 81.7m bottles of pinot grigio and 85m bottles of prosecco at home. \u201cThe UK wine industry is facing a range of pressures that has seen the average priced bottle of wine reach an all-time high,\u201d says Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA). \u201cThis includes fall in the value of the pound \u2013 compounded by rising inflation and the uncertainty of Brexit.\u201d The average amount spent on a bottle of wine in the last three months of 2017 was \u00a35.74, according to the WSTA but the wine itself only makes up around a tenth of the price of entry level wines as nearly \u00a33 goes on duty and VAT. \u201cOnce the retailer margin, transport and logistical costs are taken into account on top of this tax burden, there is significant pressure on wine producers and retailers who are looking to provide customers good value for money as well as a quality product,\u201d says Beale. One senior wine industry source said it had faced a \u201cperfect storm\u201d in 2017 because there had been so many problems in wine producing regions around the world. \u201cThere is price pressure in two places: right at the top end, in premium claret, and in entry level wine,\u201d the executive says. In a \u00a35 bottle only 50p is for the wine so you are looking at a small increase of say 12.5p \u2026 on a \u00a3100 bottle of wine you\u2019ve got a material price change. \u201cIn a good year producers will try and profit and in a bad year they will try and eat some of the losses \u2013 it\u2019s in their interests to do so. At some point prices will have to reflect the cost of production but supermarkets will work hard to keep wine affordable because like eggs, milk and a loaf of white bread, people know the price of a bottle of pinot grigio.\u201d Six good value wines to beat the price rises \u2022 Asda Extra Special Pinot Grigio \u00a36, 12% abv It\u2019ll be hard for supermarkets to keep down the price of popular wines such as pinot grigio so grab them while you can \u2022 Mionetto Prosecco on offer at \u00a37.99 Bargain Booze, \u00a38.99 Wine Rack, 11% abv Prosecco prices have already been creeping up, which makes this premium brand pretty good value Beronia Rioja Crianza 2014 \u00a311.50 Booths, or \u00a38.63 if you buy three or more bottles, 13.5% abv Smooth, easy-drinking young Rioja, a region badly hit by frost last year \u2022 Coeur de Caroline Provence Ros\u00e9 2016 \u00a38.99 Co-op, 12% abv Snap up good deals on Provence ros\u00e9 before retailers move on to the 2017 vintage \u2022 Vinalba Patagonian Malbec 2015 on offer at \u00a37.50 Morrisons Smooth, ripe malbec from a consistently reliable French-born producer in Argentina.

But while some chateaux lost up to 90% of their harvest, others escaped unscathed, the council added.</p> <p>\u201cIn Bordeaux the top 150 chateaux have not really been affected but the<em> grand surface</em> \u2013 the total acreage of Bordeaux \u2013 has been ravaged,\u201d says Jago. \u201cThe Bordeaux harvest, like the overall harvest across Italy and Spain, has been decimated but it tends to be the more flat lying, higher volume production land that has been hit.\u201d</p> <p>The devaluation of sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote has already had an impact on the cost of wine in supermarkets which is up by an average of 4% over the past year, according to research firm Nielsen. French wine cost 5.5% more, while the price tag for Portuguese and Italian varieties increased by 5.1% and 3.5% respectively.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s still and sparking wine market is worth more than \u00a310bn a year and is the biggest market by volume of EU wine exports. Last year alone Britons got through 81.7m bottles of pinot grigio and 85m bottles of prosecco at home.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK wine industry is facing a range of pressures that has seen the average priced bottle of wine reach an all-time high,\u201d says Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA). \u201cThis includes fall in the value of the pound \u2013 compounded by rising inflation and the uncertainty of Brexit.\u201d </p> <p>The average amount spent on a bottle of wine in the last three months of 2017 was \u00a35.74, according to the WSTA but the wine itself only makes up around a tenth of the price of entry level wines as nearly \u00a33 goes on duty and VAT. </p> <p>\u201cOnce the retailer margin, transport and logistical costs are taken into account on top of this tax burden, there is significant pressure on wine producers and retailers who are looking to provide customers good value for money as well as a quality product,\u201d says Beale.</p> <p>One senior wine industry source said it had faced a \u201cperfect storm\u201d in 2017 because there had been so many problems in wine producing regions around the world. \u201cThere is price pressure in two places: right at the top end, in premium claret, and in entry level wine,\u201d the executive says. In a \u00a35 bottle only 50p is for the wine so you are looking at a small increase of say 12.5p \u2026 on a \u00a3100 bottle of wine you\u2019ve got a material price change.</p> <p>\u201cIn a good year producers will try and profit and in a bad year they will try and eat some of the losses \u2013 it\u2019s in their interests to do so. At some point prices will have to reflect the cost of production but supermarkets will work hard to keep wine affordable because like eggs, milk and a loaf of white bread, people know the price of a bottle of pinot grigio.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2a5ad865c0a96df7a3727e498b72346999ef563\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2a5ad865c0a96df7a3727e498b72346999ef563/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wine in the Catalan town of Sant Sadurn\u00ed d\u2019Anoia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wine in the Catalan town of Sant Sadurn\u00ed d\u2019Anoia, the largest producer of cava and wine of Catalunya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Six good value wines to beat the price rises</h2> <p><strong>\u2022 Asda Extra Special Pinot Grigio \u00a36, 12% abv<br></strong>It\u2019ll be hard for supermarkets to keep down the price of popular wines such as pinot grigio so grab them while you can</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Mionetto Prosecco on offer at \u00a37.99 Bargain Booze, \u00a38.99 Wine Rack, 11% abv</strong><br>Prosecco prices have already been creeping up, which makes this premium brand pretty good value<br></p> <p><strong>Beronia Rioja Crianza 2014 \u00a311.50 Booths, or \u00a38.63 if you buy three or more bottles, 13.5% abv</strong><br>Smooth, easy-drinking young Rioja, a region badly hit by frost last year<br></p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong><strong>Coeur de Caroline Provence Ros\u00e9 2016 \u00a38.99 Co-op, 12% abv</strong><br>Snap up good deals on Provence ros\u00e9 before retailers move on to the 2017 vintage<br></p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong><strong>Vinalba Patagonian Malbec 2015 on offer at \u00a37.50 Morrisons</strong><br>Smooth, ripe malbec from a consistently reliable French-born producer in Argentina.

      "bodyText": "Before we sign off, here is a summary of the main events of the day: Investors were in a cautious mood when European markets as they weighed up Trump\u2019s tariff plans against the surprise news he has agreed to meet Kim Jong-un. They were also in wait-and-see mode ahead of the US non-farm payrolls. With the exception of Germany\u2019s DAX and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB, markets are now higher across Europe Ryanair said that from September 2018, its tickets will come with a cautionary Brexit warning: \u201cThis flight is subject to the regulatory environment allowing the flight to take place\u201d There was a flurry of UK data for January, the most interesting of which was a surprise 3.4% fall in construction output driven by a slump in housebuilding The Institute of Directors suspended its chairwoman, Lady Barbara Judge, following allegations of misconduct including racism A spokesman for Theresa May said the UK intends to work with the EU as it seeks exemptions from US trade tariffs on steel and aluminium The February US non-farm payrolls report showed 313,000 jobs were added last month, more than expected, but wage growth slowed to 2.6% from 2.8% Wall Street is up in early trading On that note, we\u2019ll close up. Thank you for reading the blog and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend AM Here is our full story on the February US jobs report: And we\u2019re off... US markets open higher after the jobs report. Investors are weighing up the slower wage growth, which eases inflation fears and tempers expectations of faster interest rate rises. Dow Jones: +0.7% at 25,057 S&amp;P 500: +0.6% at 2,756 Nasdaq: +0.7% at 7,477 Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says the non-farm payrolls report leaves the Federal Reserve on track to vote for four interest rate rises this year. The massive 313,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in February, the biggest in 18 months, together with the 54,000 upward revision to gains in the preceding two months, illustrates that the economy is doing much better than the recent incoming activity data have suggested. The only negative is that with that 0.1% m/m gain in average hourly earnings, the annual growth rate dropped back to 2.6%, from 2.9%. Nevertheless, with the Fed\u2019s latest Beige Book noting that labour shortages are now severe in many industries, that isn\u2019t going to prevent a more aggressive monetary tightening this year. This is more evidence that the Fed will need to hike four times this year, starting later this month. However, CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson is not convinced about the rate hikes: The US jobs report for February turned out to be one of those reports that had a bit of everything for both the hawks and the doves. A really positive headline number with 313k jobs added in February while the January number was revised up to 239k. For a labour market that we are told is rather tight this is quite a big number and the fact that we saw wage growth slow to 2.6% from 2.9% would suggest that there is much more slack in this particular jobs market than most people think. This would suggest that those calls for four rate rises this year may well be a little bit premature, particularly when you see the participation rate jump from 62.7% to 63%, as more people return to the work force. This is likely to prompt a little bit of a brake on the US dollar rebound we\u2019ve seen this week. The mood has picked up in European markets, where earlier losses have been erased: Investors have been digesting the mixed US jobs report, which showed a sharper than expected rise in employment but weaker wage growth. After initially rising, the dollar index - which measures the US currency against a basket of others - fell and is now up by 0.15%. America\u2019s construction sector created the most jobs in February, with an increase of 61,000 according to the Labor Department. Economists speculated the jump in the sector was partly down to the work required in the aftermath of bad weather. Retail jobs and professional services employment both increased by 50,000. US wage growth slowed more than expected last month, to 2.6% from 2.8% in January (which was revised down from 2.9%). Traders believe the latest non-farm payrolls report will be a positive for US markets when Wall Street opens: US non-farm payrolls have easily beaten expectations, rising by 313,000 in February versus forecasts of 200,000. The number for January was also revised up to 239,000 from an earlier estimate of 200,000. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1% Andrew Sentance, former member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee believes a collaborative approach to US trade tariffs is the best one: Almost time for US non-farm payrolls ... here\u2019s what economists are expecting from the headline numbers for February: Number of jobs added: 200,000 (January: 200,000) Unemployment rate: 4% (January: 4.1%) Average annual earnings growth: 2.8% (January: 2.9%) The EU expects to be exempt from US tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium but will go to the World Trade Organization with its own measures if Trump presses ahead, officials have said. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade said she was ready to go the WTO - as the international trade arbiter - to impose the EU\u2019s own safeguards within 90 days. We have been very clear that [the US plan] is not in compliance with the WTO. We will have to protect our industry with rebalancing measures, safeguards. Malmstrom will meet US trade representative Robert Lighthizer in Brussels on Saturday. Britain might be preparing to leave the EU but there is still time for some collaborative work. The Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman says the UK will be working with the EU to consider possible exemptions from Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium. Both the UK and the EU will be hoping they fall into President Trump\u2019s \u201creal friends\u201d category when it comes to exemptions. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said: Tariffs are not the right way to address the problem of global overcapacity. We will work with EU partners to consider the scope for exemptions. The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the three months ending February, according to the latest estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. That\u2019s a slowdown from the 0.4% estimate in the three months to January (and the 0.4% official growth in the fourth quarter of 2017). Growth is expected to slow further in March as the impact of the disruption caused by the snow feeds through to the numbers. Niesr\u2019s Amit Kara said: We estimate that economic growth nudged lower to 0.3 per cent in the 3 months to February. Activity has eased slightly and is likely to slow further in March when the full impact of the recent extreme weather conditions will be realised. Economic growth continues to be driven by both the manufacturing and the service sectors, supported by a buoyant global economy, while construction output lags. UK industrial production in January was boosted in January by the reopening of the Forties pipeline, which was closed in December and which carries 40% of North Sea oil and gas output. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, explains: \u201cWith the closure of the Forties pipeline for much of December and its reopening the subsequent month, a rebound in industrial production was expected. Indeed, spurred by a record 32% rise in oil and gas output, the industrial sector grew by 1.3%, reversing the equivalent drop in December. JCB is hiring, despite the evident slowdown in the construction sector at the beginning of the year. The Staffordshire-based construction equipment maker said it would create 600 production jobs over the next three months. The reason was an \u201cunprecedented global demand\u201d for its products, made at JCB\u2019s Rocester, Cheadle, Rugeley and Foston, Derbyshire plants. JCB chief operating officer, Mark Turner: This is great news for the local economy and great news for anyone seeking to work with a globally successful business. We know the cities of Stoke-on-Trent, Derby and surrounding towns have people with the skills we need, and in return they can expect excellent rewards. We urgently need fabrication welding skills along with paint sprayers, and general assemblers who will be given full training. New workers will be paid a minimum of \u00a310.40 per hour, the company said. JCB is also seeking to hire more than 100 people in engineering and other roles at its headquarters in Rocester and other UK sites. Here is our full story on the suspension of Barbara Judge, chairwoman of the Institute of Directors: The 3.4% fall in construction output in January was the biggest drop since June 2012. The biggest driver was a 9% drop in new homes built, while public building fell 8.9% and construction of commercial property such as offices and shops slumped 3.9%. Economists believe the shocking figures - far worse than expected - reflect the collapse of the construction group Carillion. Alan Clarke of Scotiabank: Presumably there is a Carillion impact here, so it is not clear whether the massive 3.4% fall will be temporary or not. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said rising interest rates and Brexit uncertainty were proving to be a \u201ctoxic combination\u201d for the construction sector. Away from the data, the Institute of Directors has suspended its chairwoman, Lady Barbara Judge, following allegations of misconduct including racism. The decision was taken by the IoD\u2019s council, which met on Thursday afternoon to consider the matter. The IoD issued the following statement this morning: The council took the decision, having received the Hill Dickinson executive summary, to suspend the IoD Chair pending further investigation into the matters raised and the process. Here is the background to the story: Ole Black, a senior statistician at the ONS, sums up this morning\u2019s UK data: Manufacturing has recorded its ninth consecutive month of growth but with a slower start to 2018. Total production output continues to advance, bolstered in January by the Forties oil pipeline coming back on stream after December\u2019s shutdown. Construction continues to be a weak spot in the UK economy with a big drop in commercial developments, along with a slowdown in house building after its very strong end to last year. The total trade deficit widened again as rising oil prices made for dearer fuel imports.\u201d Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened unexpectedly in January, partly because December\u2019s figure was revised down. The trade in goods deficit rose to \u00a312.3bn from \u00a311.8bn. The ONS said the higher deficit was driven by a rise in imports such as aircraft and cars from non-EU countries and fuels from EU countries. Better news from British industry, which expanded in January - albeit at a slower than expected rate. Industrial production rose by 1.3% over the month, missing forecasts of a 1.5% rise. Manufacturing output rose 0.1% over the month, again just missing expectations of a 0.2% increase. Britain\u2019s construction sector had a shocking start to the year according to figures just out from the Office for National Statistics. Output in the sector fell by 3.4% over the month, sharply worse than the 0.3% dip predicted by economists. The ONS described construction as a \u201cweak spot\u201d in the UK economy. The biggest driver of the fall was private housebuilding, in a blow to Theresa May\u2019s hopes of addressing Britain\u2019s housing shortage. A host of UK data will be published at 9.30am by the Office for National Statistics, giving the latest official snapshot of how the economy is performing. Here is what City economists polled by Reuters are expecting the January data to show: Industrial output rose 1.5% over the month, following a 1.3% drop in December* Manufacturing output edged 0.2% higher, following a 0.3% rise in the previous month* Construction output fell by 0.3%m following a 1.6% rise in December* The trade in goods deficit narrowed to \u00a312bn from \u00a313.6bn *Previous months\u2019 figures are often revised. Ryanair has warned this morning that some airlines are being complacent about Brexit and the potential implications for the industry. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Wake up to Money that while the airline is hopeful some sort of deal will be struck for the industry between the UK and EU, it is making contingency plans. From September 2018, the airline will include the following warning on its tickets: This flight is subject to the regulatory environment allowing the flight to take place. In case you missed it yesterday, here is how events unfolded in the US as President Trump pressed ahead with plans to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium: Connor Campbell, analyst at Spread Ex, says traders are also weighing up the news that has come from the White House in the past 24 hours: Despite a 24 hour period stuffed with international developments, the markets avoiding any drastic movements this Friday. Perhaps it\u2019s because investors are caught between Donald Trump signing an order dictating tariffs on metal imports \u2013 but one with room for country-by-country exceptions \u2013 and the news that the President is set to meet Kim Jong-un for an unprecedented summit. It appears that the former is shaping trading more than the latter, though the relatively measured nature of the early losses suggests that the North Korea news may have helped matters. Of course, adding to the apparent reticence is the looming US non-farm jobs report, with investors set to dig through the wage growth data especially to assess it for any hawkish qualities. Here are the latest scores on the board as investors await the main event this afternoon with the US non-farm payrolls report for February. FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,192 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 12,333 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,250 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 22,698 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 9,656 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 376 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After shrugging off Donald Trump\u2019s decision to press ahead with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, European investors are in a more cautious mood this morning. All eyes will be on this afternoon\u2019s US non-farm payrolls report, as investors look for clues about the likely path for interest rate rises. Economists are expecting the US Labor Department to say 200,000 jobs were added in February, the same as January. Michael Hewson from CMC Markets gives his view ahead of the figures: Ultimately it\u2019s not the headline jobs number that is likely to be the primary market mover here, it\u2019s the average hourly earnings data and markets will be looking to see if the jump to 2.9% in January is sustained in the February numbers, with 2.8% expected. This would probably be sufficient to keep the four rate rise expectation for 2018 on the table after the jump from 2.5% in December. News overnight that President Trump has agreed to meet North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un boosted Asian markets. The Hang Seng rose 1%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 was up 0.5% after initially rising by 2.5%. Although investors will be sceptical about the outcome of any talks, it is a positive development after the two leaders traded insults and threats of war just months ago. The agenda: 9.30am GMT: January figures for UK manufacturing output, industrial production, construction output, and trade 12.00pm GMT: The National Institute of Economic and Social Research will publish its estimate of UK GDP growth for the three months to February 13.30 GMT: US non-farm payrolls for February will give the latest snapshot of employment in the world\u2019s largest economy",

Nevertheless, with the Fed\u2019s latest Beige Book noting that labour shortages are now severe in many industries, that isn\u2019t going to prevent a more aggressive monetary tightening this year. This is more evidence that the Fed will need to hike four times this year, starting later this month.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, <strong>CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson</strong> is not convinced about the rate hikes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The US jobs report for February turned out to be one of those reports that had a bit of everything for both the hawks and the doves. A really positive headline number with 313k jobs added in February while the January number was revised up to 239k. For a labour market that we are told is rather tight this is quite a big number and the fact that we saw wage growth slow to 2.6% from 2.9% would suggest that there is much more slack in this particular jobs market than most people think.<br></p> <p>This would suggest that those calls for four rate rises this year may well be a little bit premature, particularly when you see the participation rate jump from 62.7% to 63%, as more people return to the work force. This is likely to prompt a little bit of a brake on the US dollar rebound we\u2019ve seen this week. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5aa293c4e4b02e97675d2644\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-09T14:04:13.872Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The mood has picked up in European markets, where earlier losses have been erased:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbab7a8bd66cc4405bb6bb0d63315aa06c88cd7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbab7a8bd66cc4405bb6bb0d63315aa06c88cd7e/0_0_848_310/500.jpg\" alt=\"European markets rise\" width=\"500\" height=\"183\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5aa290dae4b050c4ca62d1c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-09T14:01:37.963Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors have been digesting the mixed US jobs report, which showed a sharper than expected rise in employment but weaker wage growth.</p> <p>After initially rising, the dollar index - which measures the US currency against a basket of others - fell and is now up by 0.15%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5aa2909ee4b050c4ca62d1c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-09T13:48:24.203Z\">1.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/972105555752964096\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">- Brought about world peace<br>- Saved the US steel and aluminium sector<br>- 313k NFP<br><br>...not a bad week for The Donald <a href=\"https://t.co/KiWJH37s5K\">pic.twitter.com/KiWJH37s5K</a></p>&mdash;

      "bodyText": "The US added 313,000 new jobs in February \u2013 the strongest gain since July 2016 \u2013 as the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%. The figures from the labor department smashed the 200,000 forecast from economists. But the recovery in wages, which sparked a sell-off on global stock markets, stalled again last month. Wages have lagged behind the growth in employment since the last recession. In February, average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% a month earlier, below economists\u2019 projections of 0.2% and January\u2019s 0.3% rise. The US jobs market has now added an average of 242,000 jobs each month over the past three months. But the still slow growth in wages implies that while people who were on the margins are returning to work, the jobs being created are still lower wage. Daniel Alpert, managing partner at Westwood Capital and a senior fellow in financial macroeconomics at Cornell Law School said it was a question of math. \u201cWe have had an enormous degradation in the quality of jobs in the last 25 years and have become far more dependent, especially since the recession, on low-wage, low-hour jobs. And these jobs really don\u2019t pay very much at all.\u201d \u201cFrom 1997 to 2017 we lost 5 million manufacturing jobs now we are adding them back at the rate of tens of thousands. It would take forever to add them back and we never will,\u201d he said. As a result jobs growth is now too heavily dependent on low wage growth, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many ways to flip a hamburger.\u201d Growth in construction and retail added to February\u2019s strong numbers with construction adding 61,000 and retail 50,000. Employment in professional and business services increased by 50,000 in February, and has risen by 495,000 over the year. In January, wages picked up at a rate unseen since 2009. The news led to a sell-off on stock markets as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would move more quickly to raise rates. But the closely watched number dipped in February, with wages up 2.6% over the year, down from January\u2019s 2.9% growth. \u201cThe massive 313,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in February, the biggest in 18 months, together with the 54,000 upward revision to gains in the preceding two months, illustrates that the economy is doing much better than the recent incoming activity data have suggested,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. \u201cThis is more evidence that the Fed will need to hike four times this year, starting later this month.\u201d",

But the recovery in wages, which sparked a sell-off on global stock markets, stalled again last month.</p> <p>Wages have lagged behind the growth in employment since the last recession. In February, average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% a month earlier, below economists\u2019 projections of 0.2% and January\u2019s 0.3% rise.</p> <p>The US jobs market has now added an average of 242,000 jobs each month over the past three months. But the still slow growth in wages implies that while people who were on the margins are returning to work, the jobs being created are still lower wage.</p> <p>Daniel Alpert, managing partner at Westwood Capital and a senior fellow in financial macroeconomics at Cornell Law School said it was a question of math. \u201cWe have had an enormous degradation in the quality of jobs in the last 25 years and have become far more dependent, especially since the recession, on low-wage, low-hour jobs. And these jobs really don\u2019t pay very much at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom 1997 to 2017 we lost 5 million manufacturing jobs now we are adding them back at the rate of tens of thousands. It would take forever to add them back and we never will,\u201d he said. As a result jobs growth is now too heavily dependent on low wage growth, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many ways to flip a hamburger.\u201d</p> <p>Growth in construction and retail added to February\u2019s strong numbers with construction adding 61,000 and retail 50,000. Employment in professional and business services increased by 50,000 in February, and has risen by 495,000 over the year.<br></p> <p>In January, wages picked up at a rate unseen since 2009. The news led to a sell-off on stock markets as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would move more quickly to raise rates. But the closely watched number dipped in February, with wages up 2.6% over the year, down from January\u2019s 2.9% growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe massive 313,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in February, the biggest in 18 months, together with the 54,000 upward revision to gains in the preceding two months, illustrates that the economy is doing much better than the recent incoming activity data have suggested,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.</p> <p>\u201cThis is more evidence that the Fed will need to hike four times this year, starting later this month.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sadly, the Institute of Directors\u2019 director competence framework offers few clues about what to do when your organisation is threatened with sudden implosion. The blurb for the IoD\u2019s training courses talks about the importance of \u201cworking collaboratively\u201d and \u201cseeking feedback at every stage of your development pathway\u201d. Top tips, no doubt, but tricky to adopt when your lovely Pall Mall hangout has become a place of plots, intrigue and explosive allegations. Barbara Judge has stepped aside as the IoD\u2019s chairwoman to fight 41 allegations against her in a report seen by the Times, including claims that she bullied staff, made racist and sexist comments, and tried to co-opt IoD personnel to help organise a show for her private fashion range. The high-profile deputy chairman, Ken Olisa, is backing Judge and talking of an attempted coup to unseat her. Meanwhile, the organisation\u2019s director general, Stephen Martin, is suspected of being part of it. An email from Olisa, as reported by Sky News, accuses Martin of covertly recording a conversation with Judge. How can the IoD\u2019s council, the guardian of its constitution, defuse this situation? Whatever the council decides, it needs to make a decision quickly. If that implies an immediate clean sweep at the top, with the rights and wrongs of the specific allegations determined another day, get on with it. The IoD, established by royal charter in 1906, had an excellent reputation until now. It has been willing to criticise obscene pay awards at big companies and take a stand against governance abuses. It is worth saving \u2013 but its credibility may not survive a drawn-out drama. Waitrose may have fallen back for good For five years, until the most recent one, operating profit in the two halves of John Lewis Partnership ran within very narrow bands. The department stores turned in \u00a3215m-\u00a3250m and Waitrose supermarkets produced \u00a3230m-\u00a3310m. The consistency was remarkable. In the latest showing, the department stores have continued to do their stuff, generating \u00a3254m. But Waitrose went backwards sharply \u2013 profit of \u00a3172m was down by one-third in a year, and 44% below the peak of 2013-14. The partners may have to get used to these leaner returns from Waitrose. The chain was never going to be immune for ever from upsets in supermarket land. Indeed, Waitrose had done well to protect its corner until now. It is also not a surprise that gross margins took a thump from the fall in sterling. All supermarkets have had to take some inflationary pain on the chin. Waitrose\u2019s profit margins at the operating level, however, were still 2.7%, and there\u2019s no shame in that. It is roughly the average for the sector. Self-help remedies have mostly been swallowed: fewer managers, flexible working, no new store openings, and investment in better distribution. It all helps, but it\u2019s hard to buck a tough market. It is possible Waitrose has passed the lowest point for profitability, but the road back to \u00a3230m-plus may be long. When gross margins are \u201creset\u201d, as Waitrose puts it, they tend to stay that way. Aviva buoyant amid global uncertainty It\u2019s odd now to remember that after the EU referendum in June 2016, shares in the insurer Aviva fell 20% to 350p over fears that the roof was about to fall in on the UK financial services industry. With hindsight, that price was a bargain. Two dividend increases later, Aviva is back at 509p and virtually the only mention of Brexit in the review of 2017 by the chief executive, Mark Wilson, was in a positive context. With the whiff of economic uncertainty in the air, large corporate customers are preferring to deal with big insurers, he reports.

The blurb for the IoD\u2019s training courses talks about the importance of \u201cworking collaboratively\u201d and \u201cseeking feedback at every stage of your development pathway\u201d. Top tips, no doubt, but tricky to adopt when your lovely Pall Mall hangout has become a place of plots, intrigue and explosive allegations.</p> <p>Barbara Judge has stepped aside as the IoD\u2019s chairwoman to fight 41 allegations against her in a report seen by the Times, including claims that she bullied staff, made racist and sexist comments, and tried to co-opt IoD personnel to help organise a show for her private fashion range.</p> <p>The high-profile deputy chairman, Ken Olisa, is backing Judge and talking of an attempted coup to unseat her. Meanwhile, the organisation\u2019s director general, Stephen Martin, is suspected of being part of it. An email from Olisa, as reported by Sky News, accuses Martin of covertly recording a conversation with Judge.</p> <p>How can the IoD\u2019s council, the guardian of its constitution, defuse this situation? Whatever the council decides, it needs to make a decision quickly. If that implies an immediate clean sweep at the top, with the rights and wrongs of the specific allegations determined another day, get on with it.</p> <p>The IoD, established by royal charter in 1906, had an excellent reputation until now. It has been willing to criticise obscene pay awards at big companies and take a stand against governance abuses.

The department stores turned in \u00a3215m-\u00a3250m and Waitrose supermarkets produced \u00a3230m-\u00a3310m. The consistency was remarkable.<br></p> <p>In the latest showing, the department stores have continued to do their stuff, generating \u00a3254m. But Waitrose went backwards sharply \u2013 profit of \u00a3172m was down by one-third in a year, and 44% below the peak of 2013-14.</p> <p>The partners may have to get used to these leaner returns from Waitrose. The chain was never going to be immune for ever from upsets in supermarket land. Indeed, Waitrose had done well to protect its corner until now.</p> <p>It is also not a surprise that gross margins took a thump from the fall in sterling. All supermarkets have had to take some inflationary pain on the chin. Waitrose\u2019s profit margins at the operating level, however, were still 2.7%, and there\u2019s no shame in that. It is roughly the average for the sector.</p> <p>Self-help remedies have mostly been swallowed: fewer managers, flexible working, no new store openings, and investment in better distribution. It all helps, but it\u2019s hard to buck a tough market. It is possible Waitrose has passed the lowest point for profitability, but the road back to \u00a3230m-plus may be long. When gross margins are \u201creset\u201d, as Waitrose puts it, they tend to stay that way.</p> <h2>Aviva buoyant amid global uncertainty</h2> <p>It\u2019s odd now to remember that after the EU referendum in June 2016, shares in the insurer Aviva fell 20% to 350p over fears that the roof was about to fall in on the UK financial services industry. With hindsight, that price was a bargain.</p> <p>Two dividend increases later, Aviva is back at 509p and virtually the only mention of Brexit in the review of 2017 by the chief executive, Mark Wilson, was in a positive context. With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-metal-tariffs-trade-war\">whiff of economic uncertainty</a> in the air, large corporate customers are preferring to deal with big insurers, he reports.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s happening with Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs? The United States will be imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminium imports. Donald Trump has allowed a 15-day negotiation period for countries to argue for an exemption. Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the tariffs initially, but the president says they will lose that status if the US doesn\u2019t get what it wants during its renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Will Australia get an exemption? Trump has made strong hints that Australia will be given special consideration, given the special ties between the two countries, but no firm answer. \u201cWe have a very close relationship with Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a trade surplus with Australia. Great country, long-term partner. We\u2019ll be doing something with them. We\u2019ll be doing something with some other countries.\u201d The Turnbull government is quietly confident that Australia may get an exemption from the tariffs. The total value of steel imports to the US is $17bn, of which Australia contributes just $200m \u2013 about 1%. Canada and Mexico, which have been granted exemptions, contribute about 25% of the total between them. The Australian finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by signals from the Trump administration that Australia may get an exemption, but emphasised there was \u201ca bit further to go\u201d over the next 15 days. What happens if the talks fail? The World Trade Organisation could challenge the tariffs. The Trump administration maintains the tariffs are necessary because the quantity of steel and aluminium in the global market is threatening to impair the \u201cnational security\u201d of the US. Trump said the US needs to increase domestic steel production from its present 73% of capacity to approximately an 80% operating rate, which is the minimum rate needed for the long-term viability of the industry. Alan Oxley, the managing director of ITS Global and a former Australian diplomat, has said most free trade agreements defer to WTO rules in key areas and many WTO principles are embedded in major FTAs. \u201cThe long and short of it is that no US administration can overturn legally binding commitments in WTO rules,\u201d he has written. But under WTO rules, there is a \u201cnational security exception\u201d \u2013 located in article 21 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \u2013 which allows members to impose trade restrictions on certain products for the purposes of national security. It is impossible to predict how the WTO will rule on that point. The European Union and South Korea have said they could challenge the tariffs through the WTO, so we may find out. Former US president George W Bush tried to imposed tariffs of up to 30% on steel imports in 2002, but the WTO rejected the tariffs. Can Australia retaliate if it does not get an exemption? Roland Rajah, the director of international economy at the Lowy Institute, said the WTO dispute settlement system is fraught. He pointed out the US has been undermining the dispute settlement process for a number of years, so if a complaint was lodged against Trump\u2019s tariffs, it could hit some institutional hurdles inside the WTO. Rajah said if Australia fails to get an exemption, the Turnbull government would have some grounds to retaliate, but it would be a complicated process. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be concluded within 12-15 months, but it can often go for longer,\u201d he said. The US potentially has more to lose in any trade war as it has a trade surplus with Australia (it exports more than it imports from Australia). However, steel and aluminium are not even among the top 10 exports from Australia to the US. Beef and other meat, pharmaceutical products, aircraft parts and alcohol are significantly more valuable, and Australia may not want to put the US market for those products in jeopardy by escalating tensions.",

      "bodyText": "A move urging Rio Tinto to rethink its funding of the fossil fuel lobby has suffered a setback \u2013 the Anglo-Australian mining company has refused to present a shareholder motion on the issue to its annual general meeting in the UK. Last week, institutional investors who manage a combined $84bn in funds \u2013 and hold about $100m of Rio Tinto shares \u2013 filed a motion to the Australian arm of Rio Tinto, calling for a review of the company\u2019s funding of industry association memberships. They said some of those groups lobbied for outcomes that hindered sensible climate and energy policy, and therefore harmed the financial position of the company. The move followed a similar motion filed at BHP, which won a significant minority of votes and resulted in the company announcing it would quit the World Coal Association and reconsider its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia. Like Rio, BHP is dual-listed in the UK and Australia, and it presented the motion to its annual general meetings in both countries. But it has emerged that Rio Tinto will not allow its UK shareholders to vote on the motion. Neither BHP nor Rio were legally obliged to present the motion to their UK AGMs, since they were filed only to the Australian arms of the companies. \u201cThat demonstrated BHP is not afraid of hearing from its shareholders on these issues,\u201d said Brynn O\u2019Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which organised the BHP and Rio Tinto motions. She said it was best practice for dual-listed companies to present issues such as these, which related to the global business, to the entire company. By allowing only the Australian arm of the company to vote on the motion, the company appeared to be taking a position against its content, she said. A spokesman for Rio Tinto said the company was working constructively with the co-filers of the motion, and would be happy to continue doing so. \u201cOur willingness to maintain this dialogue, including at the upcoming shareholders meeting in London, is not constrained by the fact that no formal resolution will be considered at the London AGM,\u201d the spokesman said. O\u2019Brien said she understood Rio Tinto had told major investors on a conference call that the motion was related to the Australian business, and so was not relevant to the UK entity. \u201cThe attempt to frame this as a local, Australian-specific issue is misguided and inaccurate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a global issue and there is a concern from shareholders that Rio Tinto does not have any appropriate governance structure in place to make sure the organisations it funds it funds are acting in its financial interests. \u201cWhat we have in Australia, and also globally, is a government leadership vacuum on climate and energy policy. And that vacuum runs counter to big companies and big energy users. \u201cOne of the reasons for that vacuum is the influence of this stratum of fossil fuel lobbies. In Australia that space is occupied by the Minerals Council of Australia, the NSW Minerals Council and the Queensland Resources Council, as well as other industry lobby groups. Those lobby groups are influencing government policy on climate and energy to the point where we have a stalemate. That is played out in other countries and also globally.\u201d",

Neither BHP nor Rio were legally obliged to present the motion to their UK AGMs, since they were filed only to the Australian arms of the companies.</p> <p>\u201cThat demonstrated BHP is not afraid of hearing from its shareholders on these issues,\u201d said Brynn O\u2019Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which organised the BHP and Rio Tinto motions.</p> <p>She said it was best practice for dual-listed companies to present issues such as these, which related to the global business, to the entire company.</p> <p>By allowing only the Australian arm of the company to vote on the motion, the company appeared to be taking a position against its content, she said.</p> <p>A spokesman for Rio Tinto said the company was working constructively with the co-filers of the motion, and would be happy to continue doing so.</p> <p>\u201cOur willingness to maintain this dialogue, including at the upcoming shareholders meeting in London, is not constrained by the fact that no formal resolution will be considered at the London AGM,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien said she understood Rio Tinto had told major investors on a conference call that the motion was related to the Australian business, and so was not relevant to the UK entity.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/rio-tinto-investors-recruited-to-force-mining-giant-to-quit-minerals-council\">Rio Tinto investors recruited to force mining giant to quit Minerals Council</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe attempt to frame this as a local, Australian-specific issue is misguided and inaccurate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a global issue and there is a concern from shareholders that Rio Tinto does not have any appropriate governance structure in place to make sure the organisations it funds it funds are acting in its financial interests.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have in Australia, and also globally, is a government leadership vacuum on climate and energy policy. And that vacuum runs counter to big companies and big energy users. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the reasons for that vacuum is the influence of this stratum of fossil fuel lobbies. In Australia that space is occupied by the Minerals Council of Australia, the NSW Minerals Council and the Queensland Resources Council, as well as other industry lobby groups. Those lobby groups are influencing government policy on climate and energy to the point where we have a stalemate. That is played out in other countries and also globally.\u201d</p>",
