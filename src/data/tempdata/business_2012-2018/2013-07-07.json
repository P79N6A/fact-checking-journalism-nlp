In the long-term, for this company to stay in the hearts and minds of customers, shareholders and all stakeholders, the brand needs to be built around trust and Plan A builds strongly around trust.\"</p> <p>Analysts predict that M&amp;S will report that fashion and homeware sales fell by 1.5%, on a like-for-like basis, in the last three months. That could fuel criticism of the company's performance, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/16/marks-spender-lingerie-director-resigns\" title=\"\">lingerie director Janie Schaffer having quit after just three months in April</a>. Food sales, though, are expected to have risen by 1.6%.</p> <p>According to Bolland, long-term investors are interested in a sustainable business fuelled by the values behind Plan A. Shoppers, assailed in recent months by headlines over the source of their products, like the idea that they don't have to worry if their strawberries are ethically sourced or that workers are treated well in factories supplying M&amp;S.</p> <p>Those issues of food and labour sourcing have had a major impact on the news headlines this year. M&amp;S, however, was untouched by the horsemeat scandal that hit Tesco among others, and also had no links to the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh where more than 1,000 workers died in April when the building collapsed. Primark was among the clothing brands that had to defend their manufacturing strategies after the tragedy when it emerged that dozens of western retailers used the Dhaka complex. Twenty UK retailers, including M&amp;S, attended a government summit last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/03/government-retailers-factory-disaster-bangladesh\" title=\"\">to discuss how to prevent a repeat of the disaster</a>.</p> <p>Bolland suggests that M&amp;S has avoided these disasters because of the strong sourcing policies of Plan A, which was billed as costing \u00a3200m over five years when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/15/marksspencer.retail\" title=\"\">launched in January 2007 with typical Rose razzmatazz</a>, but has since saved the company \u00a3320m.</p> <p>He says M&amp;S's food business has been doing well recently partly because shoppers trust the way the retailer sources food compared to rivals who discovered there was horsemeat in their beef products, and that those ethical values can also play a part in turning clothing sales around.</p> <p>\"Plan A has given an additional strength and trust in our business and brands and helped us improve and protect the provenance of our sourcing,\" he says.With that in mind, Bolland insists that the Plan A targets are not negotiable, despite tough economic times in which some shoppers give social and environmental issues a lower priority. \"In the economic times of today, interest in sustainability is under pressure and it shouldn't be because it is more critical now,\" Bolland says.His response to shoppers' changing priorities is more customer and community engagement.</p> <p>M&amp;S will be offering 1,400 unemployed young people one-month work placements this year in a scheme backed by The Prince's Trust. At last month's Plan A conference for 1,200 M&amp;S stakeholders, including manufacturers, charities and pressure groups, Bolland called on the retailer's suppliers to offer similar placements equivalent to 2% of their workforce, the same proportion as M&amp;S. He has also sought pledges from rival FTSE 100 companies, and believes at least 10 more will get involved in the bid to help tackle high youth unemployment.</p> <p>Bolland also wants to raise customer awareness about the way M&amp;S sources goods. Within three years, he wants customers to be able to use product codes or the company's website to see exactly where individual items have been made. He said transparency was important for all retailers in the days of smartphones, which enable shoppers to quickly gain access to information on working conditions and farming methods around the world.</p> <p>\"If they want to find out they will find out in the future and they will know all of our factories because it is in reach,\" he said.</p> <p>Winning shoppers over with such ideas could be important as gains from Plan A may be harder to find in tough economic times.</p> <p>M&amp;S saved \u00a3135m through Plan A in the past year, up from \u00a3105m last year, partly by installing low-energy lighting and changing the kind of refrigerators it used, which also helped cut overall carbon emissions by 0.5% year-on-year and 23% since 2006.</p> <p>M&amp;S has also cut waste by 28%, water use by 27% and trained and educated more than 240,000 workers in its supply chain.</p> <p>But M&amp;S struggled to meet some of its targets as shoppers tighten their belts.</p> <p>The company has been forced to set aside efforts to convert key clothing ranges to Fairtrade cotton, triple sales of organic food and convert pork to freerange sources amid indifference from shoppers and problems with supply.</p> <p>Meanwhile, use of disposable plastic bags was up year on year, and the company's How We Do Business report published last month also reveals that M&amp;S was behind the industry average in cutting down food packaging.</p> <p>A bid to collect 20m items of clothing a year for recycling by 2015 under <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/Shwop/b/1672188031\" title=\"\">its Shwopping scheme fronted by actress Joanna Lumley</a> also looks tough to meet. In the past year 3.8m items were collected against 3.3m in the year before, as shoppers' habits proved hard to change.</p> <p>Still, Bolland says M&amp;S continues to move forward, switching focus from Fairtrade cotton, for example, to sourcing more sustainable textiles through projects such as the Better Cotton Initiative which uses less water and pesticides than fibre grown in the traditional way. He argues that sticking to its ethical targets means that M&amp;S has strong backing from its staff even as the company faces external criticism over its clothing sales.</p> <p>City analysts believe the performance of M&amp;S's autumn/winter collection will be crucial for the company. \"The fashion writers seem to have a broadly positive narrative on the new ranges but the key measure will be that of 'Ms &amp; Mrs Britain',\" said Clive Black of Shore Capital.</p>",

M&amp;S will be offering 1,400 unemployed young people one-month work placements this year in a scheme backed by The Prince's Trust. At last month's Plan A conference for 1,200 M&amp;S stakeholders, including manufacturers, charities and pressure groups, Bolland called on the retailer's suppliers to offer similar placements equivalent to 2% of their workforce, the same proportion as M&amp;S. He has also sought pledges from rival FTSE 100 companies, and believes at least 10 more will get involved in the bid to help tackle high youth unemployment. Bolland also wants to raise customer awareness about the way M&amp;S sources goods. Within three years, he wants customers to be able to use product codes or the company's website to see exactly where individual items have been made. He said transparency was important for all retailers in the days of smartphones, which enable shoppers to quickly gain access to information on working conditions and farming methods around the world. \"If they want to find out they will find out in the future and they will know all of our factories because it is in reach,\" he said. Winning shoppers over with such ideas could be important as gains from Plan A may be harder to find in tough economic times. M&amp;S saved \u00a3135m through Plan A in the past year, up from \u00a3105m last year, partly by installing low-energy lighting and changing the kind of refrigerators it used, which also helped cut overall carbon emissions by 0.5% year-on-year and 23% since 2006. M&amp;S has also cut waste by 28%, water use by 27% and trained and educated more than 240,000 workers in its supply chain. But M&amp;S struggled to meet some of its targets as shoppers tighten their belts. The company has been forced to set aside efforts to convert key clothing ranges to Fairtrade cotton, triple sales of organic food and convert pork to freerange sources amid indifference from shoppers and problems with supply. Meanwhile, use of disposable plastic bags was up year on year, and the company's How We Do Business report published last month also reveals that M&amp;S was behind the industry average in cutting down food packaging. A bid to collect 20m items of clothing a year for recycling by 2015 under its Shwopping scheme fronted by actress Joanna Lumley also looks tough to meet. In the past year 3.8m items were collected against 3.3m in the year before, as shoppers' habits proved hard to change. Still, Bolland says M&amp;S continues to move forward, switching focus from Fairtrade cotton, for example, to sourcing more sustainable textiles through projects such as the Better Cotton Initiative which uses less water and pesticides than fibre grown in the traditional way. He argues that sticking to its ethical targets means that M&amp;S has strong backing from its staff even as the company faces external criticism over its clothing sales. City analysts believe the performance of M&amp;S's autumn/winter collection will be crucial for the company. \"The fashion writers seem to have a broadly positive narrative on the new ranges but the key measure will be that of 'Ms &amp; Mrs Britain',\" said Clive Black of Shore Capital.",

    "webTitle": "Central bankers face fight to keep bond markets calm | Phillip Inman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For the next few weeks and months, Europe's central bankers will be arming themselves for yet another battle with the bond markets. After a brief period of calm following the Spanish debt crisis last year, interrupted only briefly by Cyprus flirting with bankruptcy, the bond markets are tense, poised for a seismic economic jolt. The situation is complicated, undemocratic you might say, as the world's largest pension funds and sovereign wealth funds vie with each other to maximise their returns safe in the knowledge that only a few people at the heart of the financial system have a clue what they are doing. One month they pile into sovereign bonds, the next they turn to stock markets. Driven by fear and greed, they swim the international money markets like sharks scenting a profitable kill. Mark Carney, the Bank of England's new governor, was being sniffed by the markets for a sign of weakness or indecision within hours of his arrival last week. Four days into his five-year tenure and he took the plunge into giving forward guidance to the markets. The guidance said: \"There will be no shocks. We intend to maintain ultra low interest rates for some time\", or words to that effect. Mario Draghi, his counterpart at the European Central Bank, took the same step just 90 minutes later, promising an \"extended period\" of record-low rates. The problem faced by both men is that much of the bond markets is focused on the US where some major investors believe an end to ultra low rates is inevitable sooner rather than later. Already, some of the biggest investment funds that populate the bond markets are wrestling with the prospect of the Federal Reserve not only pushing up interest rates within a couple of years, but also bringing its $1 trillion (\u00a3670bn) a year bond buying programme to a halt before next summer. After years of feeding on cheap dollars, the party might be over. And if the US pulls back, there could be negative effects to inflation, commodity prices and the real economy. The Fed's QE spree, which is set at $85bn a month, makes it one of the biggest bond buyers on the planet. Mostly, it buys US government bonds and in so doing effectively underwrites the Obama administration's growing debt pile. Until a couple of months ago the only worry among bond investors was how the Fed's purchases pushed up the price of the remaining bonds left for sale. A higher demand for US Treasuries sent returns, known as the yield, spiralling down and encouraged many investors, often against their better judgment, to put their funds into US, UK and European stock markets. The huge recovery in the FTSE 100 during the first half of this year can partly be attributed to a share-buying frenzy with money previously locked up in the bond market. Such was the rise in the stock market that Fed boss Ben Bernanke has now hinted he might start to slow QE. Not switch it off, just slow the pace of growth. Pimco, one of the biggest bond fund managers, promptly experienced a huge outflow. Its boss, Bill Gross, wrote last week, seemingly with his head in his hands, that panicky investors were blinded by the smoke from recent battles to the long term outcome of the war. He pointed to the Fed's high tolerance of inflation. Just as the Bank of England has allowed inflation to yo-yo and peak at 5%, so the Fed is happy for its core inflation rate of around 1% to increase to beyond its 2% target, something Gross said would make inflation irrelevant as a guide to behaviour for many years. Then he talked about the likelihood of a dramatic fall in unemployment to the 6.5% level Bernanke has targeted. This target, he believes is also many years away. \"Fed [0.25% interest rate] will not increase until at least mid-2015 and even then subject to a consistently strong economy that produces 2%+ inflation. I wonder if we can get there in this decade to tell you the truth,\" he said. Far from endorsing the Fed, he is even gloomier, saying that short bursts of goods news on the housing market or car buying belie the problems all western economies face of growing health and care costs, competition from Asia that drives down wages and a constant technological drive that is de-skilling important white-collar industries from architecture to the media. \"The Fed, we would argue, is too cyclically oriented, focusing substantially on housing prices and car sales. And speaking of housing, since mortgage rates have risen by 1\u00bd% in the last six months and the average monthly check for a new home buyer is up by 20\u201325% as well, then as I tweeted several weeks ago, 'Mr Chairman are you serious?'\" Growth will be negatively influenced, Gross added. Carney faces a similar problem to Bernanke. He needs to convince the bond markets that a decent run of car sales and a booming housing market in the south east of England does not make for a surging economy. And yet he won't want to sound so gloomy that he deters businesses from investing and consumers from spending. There are many economists, mostly on the monetarist wing, who believe the underlying state of the economy is sound, and with the good times are so close we need to calm things down with higher rates. So every time Carney sounds even modestly upbeat he will find himself stinging his audience with a bit of gloom. Can he maintain this balancing act? As we have seen in the last few weeks, Bernanke only needed to allow the corners of his mouth to lift a little, to allow a slight smile, and the bond markets took flight. The answer must be that central bankers can maintain their balance if they just keep recycling the same message every month for the next few years. Fund managers will, no doubt, read too much into one speech versus another and send demand rocketing, or the reverse, only for the status quo to reassert itself, which is great if you are a mortgage holder or have high debts. Low interest rates for longer is your saviour. But the bond markets never lose. They will turn away and seek returns elsewhere, sniffing weakness in developing world countries or obscure stock markets. These investments could turn into nasty bubbles and crash, which means people \u2013 governments and small investors \u2013 getting hurt.",

Last year the company revealed its first profits fall in two decades; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/14/tesco-counts-cost-of-us-venture\" title=\"\">Fresh &amp; Easy</a>, Leahy's foray into the US, is being scrapped at a cost of \u00a31bn; and \u00a3800m has been wiped off the value of the land bank built up by the former chief executive.</p> <p>The Guardian study found Leahy had received two tranches of three-year-performance payouts worth \u00a32.95m since departing. Tesco's remuneration committee, chaired by Stuart Chambers, has judged the performance targets to be met, or partly met.</p> <p>In addition, shares worth \u00a35.47m have been released to Leahy from Tesco's \"executive incentive scheme\" since his departure.

      "bodyText": "Sir Terry Leahy, the Tesco chief executive who led the supermarket group for 14 years before retiring two years ago, has received almost \u00a38.5m in performance-based payouts since his departure. The payments, revealed by a Guardian analysis of share awards no longer disclosed in Tesco annual reports, comes against a backdrop of writedowns, profit warnings and mounting criticism of Leahy's strategic legacy. Last year the company revealed its first profits fall in two decades; Fresh &amp; Easy, Leahy's foray into the US, is being scrapped at a cost of \u00a31bn; and \u00a3800m has been wiped off the value of the land bank built up by the former chief executive. The Guardian study found Leahy had received two tranches of three-year-performance payouts worth \u00a32.95m since departing. Tesco's remuneration committee, chaired by Stuart Chambers, has judged the performance targets to be met, or partly met. In addition, shares worth \u00a35.47m have been released to Leahy from Tesco's \"executive incentive scheme\" since his departure. These were deferred annual bonus rewards, held by the company for three years before being released to executives. In Leahy's case, however, the release schedule was accelerated because of his departure. These rewards were not assessed on performance criteria, but the final batch were subject to a \"clawback\" clause, designed to prevent payments for failure. However, Tesco said clawback was not relevant to Leahy payouts as it was only triggered by a \"material misstatement\" in Tesco's accounts. The bulk of the \u00a38.42m in performance bonuses received by Leahy since leaving were paid out between February and July 2012. During that period the company was still reeling from a shock January profits warning that wiped 16%, or \u00a35bn, off the share value of the group in one day. It was reportedly the biggest fall in the stock since Black Monday, during the stock market crash of 1987. Shares have recovered some ground , but the stock is still 16% below the price when Leahy departed in March 2011. Meanwhile, over the same period, the wider FTSE 100 index has climbed 6.8%. Leahy also took with him an \u00a318.4m pension pot when he stood down. In addition he held options over almost 7m shares \u2013 all now unlikely to produce a windfall because of the share price slump and the scrapping of Fresh &amp; Easy. A Tesco spokesman confirmed the Guardian analysis of post-retirement performance payouts to Leahy was accurate. \"These awards were made during Terry Leahy's time as Tesco chief executive,\" he said. \"They were awarded and vested in line with the performance criteria set for them. No new awards will be made to Terry Leahy.\" In its latest annual report Chambers said the remuneration committee had strengthened performance criteria \"to ensure that they remained motivational for management while still representing long-term value creation for shareholders\". The full extent of the re-evaluation of Leahy's legacy was laid bare at the supermarket group's annual shareholder meeting last week when his predecessor Lord MacLaurin, attending as an ordinary shareholder, delivered a swingeing attack from the floor. \"I think you would probably agree with me that when you judge the performance of a chief executive, you not only judge the performance of his day-to-day operation, but you also have to judge his legacy and I think we're all very sad to see the legacy Sir Terry Leahy has left,\" he said. MacLaurin later told the Guardian Leahy had \"lost the plot\", and that the US venture was a \"disastrous\" enterprise he had counselled against \u2013 even though it was to be run by his son-in-law Tim Mason. He added: \"It's also unforgivable that he [Leahy] took money out of the UK business and allowed it to flounder when our rivals were catching up and expanding.\" Leahy's successor Phil Clarke \u2013 who still occasionally takes informal soundings from MacLaurin on Tesco business \u2013 has shied away from direct criticism of his immediate predecessor. However, he has said \"the strategy wasn't delivering\", claiming Tesco had been \"running up the down escalator\" with its focus on land purchases. \"Space growth is too fast. More very big stores aren't the answer any longer,\" he said last April. \"Customers are moving faster to smaller stores and to the internet.\" He promised to \"strike a better balance between growth and returns for shareholders\". Two years ago Leahy had appeared to retire on a high when he was feted by outgoing chairman David Reid as \"undoubtedly one of the leading businessmen of his generation \u2026 [who] has put in place a strategy which can secure the progress of Tesco for years go come.\" Former Asda boss Allan Leighton, for a long time an arch rival, also paid tribute. \"The test of all great leaders is the legacy they leave. Terry Leahy inherited a company that was the best food retailer in Britain \u2026 He has made it into the best food retailer in the world.\" No one appeared more sure of Leahy's achievements than himself. \"In every business the chief executive wakes up in the morning wondering where the growth will come from,\" he reflected in valedictory remarks. \"And we have answered that question at Tesco.\"",

There was no large environmental damage caused by the Piper Alpha explosion compared with the devastation to the beaches of gulf states caused by the explosion at the Macondo well. But the loss of life was much worse: 167 oil workers died at Piper Alpha compared with 11 at Deepwater Horizon and yet Oxy faced no criminal or civil proceedings, either for corporate manslaughter or for breaches of health and safety legislation. No officials were made personally liable and there was certainly no equivalent of BP's Tony Hayward being forced out of his job. Peter Fraser, the lord advocate and chief legal officer in Scotland, took the view that the public interest would not be served by prosecution after the case was referred to him by the Department of Trade and Industry. Yet Lord Cullen's report of 1990 into Piper Alpha was extremely critical of the US oil group. \"There were significant flaws in the quality of Occidental's management of safety which affected the circumstances of the event of the disaster, wrote the high court judge. The cost to Occidental was around $100m (\u00a365m) in compensation to the families of the dead and injured.
