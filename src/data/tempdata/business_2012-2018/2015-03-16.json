      "bodyText": "It\u2019s spring, so time for the annual ritual of Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, collecting a large payment in shares. The year\u2019s sum is \u00a336m, which should inflate to \u00a340m or more once short-term bonuses are added next month. Add it all up and Sorrell has been paid \u00a387m in the past three years \u2013 call it \u00a31m every fortnight. If the advertising firm continues its jackpot-paying ways for the next two years, the workaholic boss can expect another \u00a390m or so to arrive from his super-charged co-investment scheme, known as Leap, or Leadership Equity Acquisition Plan. Hold on, you might say, wasn\u2019t WPP a victim of the inelegantly-named \u201cshareholder spring\u201d of 2012? Didn\u2019t the shareholders rise in rebellion and insist that Leap be squashed and WPP observe modern pay norms? Well, yes, but there were two important details. First, Leap was allowed a lingering death. The scheme works on a five-year cycle, so the thumbs-down in 2012 actually meant more leaping until the end of 2016. As WPP chairman Philip Lader says, this year\u2019s \u00a336m was determined by the \u201carithmetic application\u201d of the 2009 terms. And, as he also argues, WPP investors have done very nicely in the period: \u00a31,000 invested in WPP shares has become \u00a32,207, versus \u00a31,213 for the FTSE 100 index as a whole. The second detail is that, even when Leap finally expires, Sorrell and colleagues will hardly be boardroom paupers. Last year\u2019s annual report explained that the pay committee still imagines Sorrell getting \u00a37.8m for an \u201con plan\u201d performance or \u00a319.2m in a \u201cmaximum\u201d year. You wouldn\u2019t even get that for running GlaxoSmithKline, a company more than four times the size of WPP, brilliantly. Thus it\u2019s odds-on that the other spring ritual \u2013 about a quarter of WPP\u2019s shareholders voting against the pay report \u2013 will also be observed. This year\u2019s twist may be a political row because the final pay numbers will be published a week before the general election. Sorrell has spoken of Labour\u2019s \u201cbusiness-bashing\u201d tendencies so he can hardly be surprised if he receives a thump from Ed Miliband. If it happens, it would be hard to symphasise with the hero of adland. Sorrell is a unique individual and the rise of WPP is an extraordinary achievement. But, on pay, WPP is in a world of its own. Few allies for Alliance It\u2019s a long way from Buenos Aires to Dundee, but New York hedge funds roam widely these days. Elliott Advisors, fresh from chasing the Republic of Argentina over debt restructuring terms, has decided that grand old Alliance Trust, stalwart of the investment trust sector, deserves of dose of activist medicine. Alliance\u2019s board, led by chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox, will not be surprised by this turn of events. The likes of Elliott do not accumulate a 12% holding to stand in the wings offering polite applause. Nor is Elliott the first outsider to regard Alliance as too sleepy for its investors\u2019 good. Four years ago Laxey, a much smaller activist, had a go. It failed to oust Garrett-Cox but did see Alliance perform a philosophical U-turn by starting to buy in shares to close the gap between the value of the assets and the market value of the trust. The discount, though, is 12% today, wide enough to be embarrassing. Elliott is taking a subtler tack than Laxey. It is proposing three new non-executive directors, none of whom look like standard patsies. They include Peter Chambers, former chief executive of Legal &amp; General Investment Management, the type of person Alliance might appoint under its own steam. Naturally, Elliott also has specific complaints. The investment portfolio has performed sluggishly, it says; costs are too high and inflexible; and two subsidiaries, a fund administration platform and a third-party asset management business, have been drains on resources. Alliance, when it makes its defence, will be able to make a few counter-arguments of the \u201cbe patient\u201d variety. Investment performance has improved, even if \u201csecond quartile\u201d is not the best boast. Costs are falling. And the two subsidiaries are at least gathering assets. The crew of 50,000 private investors, by repute, are the patient sort but Elliott\u2019s agitation may test their loyalty. Could outside managers squeeze better returns from Alliance\u2019s portfolio? It\u2019s not outlandish to suggest that a trio of experienced outsiders should examine the idea, among others. Garrett-Cox has a battle on her hands. Thorn in AO\u2019s side Apparently Richard Rose always planned to off-load a few of his shares in AO World a year after flotation. In the event, the non-executive chairman has shed almost nine-tenths of his holding, raising \u00a310m. Rose is entitled to do as he wishes, of course, since the post-flotation lock-up period has expired, and AO says he remains committed \u201cboth as a shareholder and as chairman.\u201d OK, but his commitment as a shareholder ain\u2019t as big as it was.

    "webTitle": "WPP launches bid for data company that devised Tesco clubcard", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WPP has lodged a bid for the customer data company that created the Tesco clubcard. A source with knowledge of the talks confirmed that the world\u2019s largest advertising group had made an approach for Tesco-owned Dunnhumby, which gathers and analyses data from almost 1 billion shoppers around the world. The information is then used to help companies create customer loyalty programmes and create tailored offerings for shoppers. Spokespeople at WPP and Tesco declined to comment. The deal would also give WPP access to data that helps conglomerates such as Kellogg\u2019s and Coca-Cola set prices and promotions. Tesco announced in January that it was considering a sale of the business, as part of a broader strategy to win back customers who are opting for low-cost discounters rather than clubcard vouchers. Dunnhumby was founded by husband-and-wife team Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby at their kitchen table in 1989. The business is now rumoured to be worth \u00a32bn and counts Danone, Nestl\u00e9 and drug manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline among its clients. But the firm is most closely associated with the Tesco clubcard, launched in the UK in 1995. At the time this was a groundbreaking loyalty scheme that helped propel Tesco to the position of the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket. The scheme allowed Tesco to profile its shoppers, finding out whether they were a family with kids or a singleton subsisting on beer and ready meals. Tesco took a majority stake in 2001, later increasing its control, while Dunn and Humby bowed out as shareholders in 2010. As the supermarket battles to maintain market share, Tesco announced in January that it had hired Goldman Sachs to weigh up whether to sell the data-mining business. The decision was widely expected as Tesco\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who joined last September, seeks to revive the fortunes of the supermarket by closing stores, sacking thousands of staff, relocating the head office and hiving off non-essential parts of the Tesco empire. The troubled supermarket has already sold Tesco Broadband and the movie streaming service Blinkbox. According to its latest results statement, WPP made 65 acquisitions last year, of which 53 involved data firms. It said that its next round of acquisitions \u201cwill be focused on our strategy of new markets, new media and data investment management, including the application of new technology and big data\u201d. The company recently reported a 12% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a31.45bn for 2014. The company has earmarked up to \u00a3400m this year for acquisitions. Last month WPP paid $300m (\u00a3202m) for a stake in ComScore, a US-based company that measures internet audiences. As part of the deal, WPP\u2019s market research unit, Kantar, will team up with ComScore to help advertisers measure the performance of their campaigns online and offline. WPP hopes that the ComScore investment and the Kantar partnership will create a rival to Nielsen in media measurement across all platforms. WPP\u2019s strategy will be outlined to large investors in June at its annual shareholder meeting. WPP\u2019s chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, is also likely to come under scrutiny after it emerged on Monday that he earned more than \u00a336m last year. WPP revealed it had awarded Sorrell more than 2.3m WPP shares worth \u00a336.04m under its Leap incentive plan. The Leap payment is likely to take Sorrell\u2019s total pay for last year to more than \u00a340m, including salary and short-term bonus.",

Spokespeople at WPP and Tesco declined to comment.</p> <p>The deal would also give WPP access to data that helps conglomerates such as Kellogg\u2019s and Coca-Cola set prices and promotions.</p> <p>Tesco announced in January that it was considering a sale of the business, as part of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/08/tesco-chief-unveils-dramatic-shake-up-troubled-supermarket\">broader strategy to win back customers </a>who are opting for low-cost discounters rather than clubcard vouchers.</p> <p>Dunnhumby was founded by husband-and-wife team Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby at their kitchen table in 1989. The business is now rumoured to be worth \u00a32bn and counts Danone, Nestl\u00e9 and drug manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>among its clients. But the firm is most closely associated with the Tesco clubcard, launched in the UK in 1995.</p> <p>At the time this was a groundbreaking loyalty scheme that helped propel Tesco to the position of the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket. The scheme allowed Tesco to profile its shoppers, finding out whether they were a family with kids or a singleton subsisting on beer and ready meals. Tesco took a majority stake in 2001, later increasing its control, while Dunn and Humby bowed out as shareholders in 2010.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As the supermarket battles to maintain market share, Tesco announced in January that it had hired Goldman Sachs to weigh up whether to sell the data-mining business. <br></p> <p>The decision was widely expected as Tesco\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who joined last September, seeks to revive the fortunes of the supermarket by closing stores, sacking thousands of staff, relocating the head office and hiving off non-essential parts of the Tesco empire. The troubled supermarket has already sold Tesco Broadband and the movie streaming service Blinkbox.</p> <p>According to its latest results statement, WPP made 65 acquisitions last year, of which 53 involved data firms. It said that its next round of acquisitions \u201cwill be focused on our strategy of new markets, new media and data investment management, including the application of new technology and big data\u201d. The company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/09/wpp-pre-tax-profits-sir-martin-sorrell\" draggable=\"true\">recently reported a 12% rise in pre-tax profits</a> to \u00a31.45bn for 2014.</p> <p>The company has earmarked up to \u00a3400m this year for acquisitions. Last month WPP paid $300m (\u00a3202m) for a stake in ComScore, a US-based company that measures internet audiences. As part of the deal, WPP\u2019s market research unit, Kantar, will team up with ComScore to help advertisers measure the performance of their campaigns online and offline. WPP hopes that the ComScore investment and the Kantar partnership will create a rival to Nielsen in media measurement across all platforms. </p> <p>WPP\u2019s strategy will be outlined to large investors in June at its annual shareholder meeting. WPP\u2019s chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, is also likely to come under scrutiny after it emerged on Monday that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/16/wpps-martin-sorrell-gets-36m-payout-for-2014-under-contentious-share-plan\">he earned more than \u00a336m last year</a>.</p> <p>WPP revealed it had awarded Sorrell more than 2.3m WPP shares worth \u00a336.04m under its Leap incentive plan. The Leap payment is likely to take Sorrell\u2019s total pay for last year to more than \u00a340m, including salary and short-term bonus.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A strengthening euro as the dollar weakened help support stock markets, as did another dip in the oil price on oversupply fears. Ahead of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting, the US currency slipped back as weak economic data suggested an interest rate rise may not be imminent. Investors were also buoyed by comments from the Chinese government that it would act to support the country\u2019s economy, while in the UK retailers benefited from hopes of a reduction in business rates. Germany\u2019s Dax moved through 12,000 for the first time to close at a new record high, the beneficiary of the first week of the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. The final scores showed: The FTSe 100 finished 63.50 points or 0.94% higher at 6804.08 Germany\u2019s Dax closed at a record 12,167.72, up 2.24% France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.01% to 5061.16 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.96% to 22,930.92 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.73% higher at 11,114.7 But the Athens market lost 0.92% to 763.09 as worries about Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone continued. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 179 points or 1.01% higher. And on that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The Greek government has just issued a statement confirming that the German chancellor Angela Merkel has indeed invited her Greek counterpart to Berlin, reports Helena Smith. \u201cMrs Angela Merkel requested a telephone rendezvous with the Greek prime minister which took place at 16:30,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDuring their telephone conversation the German chancellor issued an invitation to Mr Alexis Tsipras to visit Berlin and the German chancellor on Monday 23 March. The prime minister responded positively to the invitation.\u201d This is not the first time that the German chancellor has attempted to calm spirits by contacting her Greek counterpart personally. Regular readers will recall that she telephoned Tsipras during last month\u2019s dramatic negotiations in Brussels to extend the debt-stricken country\u2019s EU-IMF-sponsored bailout until June. On the ECB quantitative easing Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets said: The European Central Bank reported that in its first week it has bought \u20ac9.8bn in public sector assets. Were government bonds to be all the ECB was buying, that\u2019s only be 16% of the monthly \u20ac60bn total where 25% would be needed to be on target. However the \u20ac60bn is inclusive of other asset purchases including covered bonds and asset-backed securities which will make up the difference. \u20ac9.8bn is not quite as aggressive as some might have hoped in the first week but the ECB is still testing the waters and this total should creep up in the coming months. Now this looks interesting. German chancellor Angela Merkel has invited Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras to visit Berlin on March 23, next Monday, Reuters is reporting, citing a Greek government official. Given the conflicting views expressed by politicians from the two countries, it will be intriguing to see how this pans out. Oil prices continue to slide on fears of oversupply, with US crude falling to $43.18 a barrel, its lowest level since March 2009. Brent crude is currently down 3.3% at $52.82, on rising global inventories and the prospect of more exports from Iran if an agreement is reached during nuclear talks this week. More details on the ECB purchases. As part of its plan to buy sovereign bonds to lift inflation and put pressure on the euro, it intends to buy \u20ac60bn a month until September 2016. The \u20ac9.751bn figure represents the first week\u2019s purchases, and the ECB also gave updates on its other programmes so far. It said its covered bond purchase programme totalled \u00a356.947bn as of March 13, while its asset backed securities programme had reached \u20ac3.754bn. The European Central Bank has announced it spend \u20ac9.751bn on bonds in the first week of its quantitative easing programme which started last Monday. The continuing worries about Greece and its possible exit from the eurozone, given the apparent differences in Athens and Berlin, has seen the country\u2019s short term bond yields rise again. Greece\u2019s three year bond yields have climbed above 20% for the first time since the middle of February, up 1% to 20.26%. The 10 year yield however is up just 6 basis points at 10/87%. US markets are on the rise and the dollar is weakening against the euro after some weak US data. Industrial production slipped 0.2% in February, the third monthly fall in a row, with car production down 3%. Economists had expected a 0.1% increase in industrial production, following a revised 0.3% decline in January (compared to the previous estimate of 0.2%). Meanwhile housebuilder confidence was also down for the third straight month, with the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index falling from 55 to 53 in March. This compares to expectations of a rise to 56. NAHB chief economist David Crowe said: The drop in builder confidence is largely attributable to supply chain issues, such as lot and labour shortages as well as tight underwriting standards. These obstacles notwithstanding, we are expecting solid gains in the housing market this year, buoyed by sustained job growth, low mortgage interest rates and pent-up demand. The weak figures come ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting where the bank will set out its latest views on interest rates. A move higher is widely expected this year, but the disappointing data casts more doubt on when exactly that might happen, hence the dollar weakness and market strength. Heads-up: the European Central Bank will publish some details of its new QE programme shortly: Klaus Regling, who runs Europe\u2019s bailout fund, has just warned that everyone involved in the Greek debt crisis must strive to avoid Greece crashing out of the eurozone by accident. Efi Koutsokosta of Euronews is tweeting the details: Time for a brief recap. Greece has cleared another funding hurdle, by repaying a \u20ac580m loan tranche to the International Monetary Fund this morning. Greece now has a few days grace until Friday, when it must hand over more than \u20ac300m to the IMF. These payments are putting further pressure on Greece\u2019s cash reserves. The country\u2019s largest union has urged the government not to tap into social security funds to meet its debt demands. Today\u2019s payment was made amid growing anxiety over relations between Berlin and Athens. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis faces a backlash from German media after claiming last night that footage of him performing a middle-digit salute to Germany is faked. The ARD broadcaster insist it\u2019s genuine: German\u2019s Bild is leading the charge against Varoufakis this morning, saying he could have misled millions of viewers. The Germany government has reiterated that it wants Greece to remain in the eurozone. A spokesman said: We continue to pursue the political goal - and there are no differences there between the finance ministry and the chancellor on this - to keep Greece in the euro zone and the German government has worked towards that since the start of the crisis and this work is continuing.\u201d A poll of German citizens, though, shows support for Greece is declining. Greek government insiders have told the Guardian they fear Berlin is conducting \u2018psychological warfare\u2019 against them. One said: \u201cIt\u2019s a two-pronged war: We\u2019re being worn down economically and psychologically. It\u2019s deliberate.\u201d Greek business leaders are also worried. In the markets, the German DAX has hit a fresh record high over 12,000 points. The European Central Bank\u2019s new QE programme is driving money into German shares, because its exporters will benefit from a weak euro. Other European markets are also up, with the exception of the Athens bourse which is in the red: Technical officials from the Brussels Group (don\u2019t call them the Troika!) have been spotted in Athens in recent days, Helena adds. But rather than being regularly snapped on the streets, officials representing Greece\u2019s creditors have generally been sighted in \u201csubterranean garages\u201d. That\u2019s a small victory for the government, which was desperate to avoid photos of Troika officials roaming the streets. Rumour has it that most meetings are taking place in hotels, as the two sides try to make progress over Greece\u2019s bailout. But Proto Thema reported on Sunday that Greek officials are letting inspectors \u201cstep foot\u201d in the General Accountancy office to go over the government\u2019s books..... New York has followed Europe\u2019s lead, with shares rising in the first few minutes of trading on Wall Street: Greece\u2019s biggest union, ADEDY, has fired a warning shot across the cash-strapped government\u2019s bows saying it must \u201crespect\u201d the country\u2019s social security funds. The warning comes amid escalating fears that the funds could soon be raided to prevent delays in payment of pensions and civil servants\u2019 salaries later this month. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Calling on the Syriza-led government to abandon any \u201cthought or scenario\u201d of using the funds to meet its own payment obligations, the public sector union described the deposits as \u201csacred.\u201d ADEDY said in a statement that: \u201cThe government must respect its pre-election promises. The damage that the funds have suffered in the past is precisely because of the criminal choices of previous governments, [choices] that are incalculable and have lead the funds to their dramatic situation today.\u201d The funds\u2019 reserves are estimated at around \u20ac2bn - enough to cover Friday\u2019s forthcoming loan payment to the IMF and salaries and pensions, if needed. ADEDY issued the warning after the central bank revealed today that the government\u2019s cash balance had sustained a deficit of \u20ac684m euro between January and February this year compared to a surplus of \u20ac139m in the same period in 2014. Here\u2019s the details: The bank\u2019s announcement was further evidence of the sharp fall in tax revenues in January, itself the result of the political uncertainty that has gripped Greece. Delays are such that tax departments have yet to produce declarations for the past year. Greek officials are accusing Germany of \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d as relations between the two countries become ever more strained, reports our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith. Greece\u2019s governing coalition is finding it ever harder to hide its infuriation with Berlin. The latest \u201cverbal assault\u201d lobbed at Athens triggered thinly veiled outrage from officials this morning. One said: \u201cIt\u2019s a two-pronged war: We\u2019re being worn down economically and psychologically. It\u2019s deliberate.\u201d The complaint echoed similar statements over the weekend by Panos Kammenos, who heads the Independent Greeks party, the junior partner in prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led administration. Speaking to Bild, Kammenos accused Berlin of pursuing a concerted policy to eject Greece from the euro zone \u2013 despite the insistence of German officials that Athens\u2019 place is in the currency bloc (as flagged earlier). \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he turns against Greece every day in new statements,\u201d Kammenos - who is also defence minister - said of the German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble. Kammenos added: \u201cIt\u2019s like a psychological war and Schauble is poisoning the relationship between the two countries through that. The German government is out to get us and some really want to push us out of the Eurozone.\u201d The business community is becoming increasingly worried. Fears are growing that Greek enthusiasm for the euro will gradually erode in the coming months. \u201cIt is almost as if the government is preparing Greeks for the drachma, that that is its aim,\u201d said one well-placed source at a large Greek industrial firm. \u201cMy fear is that as the situation gradually worsens, support for the euro will drop. Now it is around 70% but in a couple of months\u2019 time, when things are much tougher, we could be seeing a situation of 50\u201450 support for the currency.\u201d In recent weeks \u2013 as talk of the government holding a possible referendum has mounted \u2013 seasoned political observers have voiced similar fears. HS Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell reckons Germany\u2019s stock market will climb further into record territory, thanks to Mario Draghi: \u201cAs the steroid injection of ECB QE continues to swell the DAX, as well as the other euro zone indices, investors remain enthralled with the region and seem committed to continuing its upswing.\u201d Germany\u2019s stock market has now surged by 138 points today, or 1.2%, to a new lifetime high of 12,040 points. The DAX has gained around 25% since the start of January, fuelled by optimism that the ECB\u2019s stimulus package will help German exporters (by weakening the euro). Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, explains: The benefits of the ECB\u2019s QE policy continue to drive European equities higher with the DAX leading the way. Germany continues to spearhead the move higher for the rest of the eurozone having broken through the 12,000 level less than a month after moving above 11,000. As cheerful as the average German might be about the DAX this propensity for optimism does not stretch towards the Greeks. The last month has seen the percentage of Germans wanting Greece to exit the eurozone increase from 41% up to 52%. The grumblings of discontent between German and Greek ministers has once more escalated as the focus on historical wrongdoings has led to even more bitter sentiment, and the phrase \u2018don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you\u2019 appears not to translate well into Greek. The news that Greece had made its IMF repayment today has helped to keep the main European markets up today. The FTSEurofirst 100, which tracks the region\u2019s largest companies, is up 0.8%. Thanks to Reuters, here\u2019s what German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a press conference in Berlin today: \u201cWe continue to pursue the political goal - and there are no differences there between the finance ministry and the chancellor on this - to keep Greece in the euro zone and the German government has worked towards that since the start of the crisis and this work is continuing.\u201d That follows finance minister Wolfgang Schauble\u2019s claim on Friday that Greece could leave the eurozone by accident. That sparked several reports that Germany had lost patience with Greece over its debt crisis; something Seibert was also forced to deny on Friday. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert has just told reporters that Angela Merkel and the finance ministry have a \u201cshared goal\u201d of keeping Greece in the eurozone. More on this shortly.... The Greek government has handed over the \u20ac580m due to the International Monetary Fund today, according to Bloomberg. That means Greece has cleared most of the money owed to the IMF this month, but still faces another \u20ac350m bill on Friday. These IMF repayments are depleting its cash reserves, raising the pressure on Greece to satisfy its creditors and unlock fresh bailout funds [the eurozone has been withholding a \u20ac7.2bn payment for several months now]. Technical talks between Greek officials and those of its creditors restarted today, having made little progress last week. The Kathmerini newspaper explains: Athens will be hoping that discussions can advance next week because the government is running short of money. It is hoping for either an early disbursement of some of the 7.2 billion euros in remaining bailout loans or an increase in the 15-billion-euro limit on T-bills that the state can issue. Several other German media outlets are also up in arms about Fingergate - with Die Speigel, Die Welt and Zeit all running articles about the video clip, and Varoufakis\u2019s denial. German newspaper Bild is gripped by Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s middle finger (so to speak). The tabloid is querying Varoufakis\u2019s claim last night that the footage showing him giving Germany the finger in 2013 was faked (see 8.12am post). It has found a social media specialist, and a video expert, who both insists the footage of the Greek finance minister is actually genuine. Bild (no fan of the Greek government, of course) even suggests Varoufakis could be \u201cunmasked\u201d as having lied to a TV audience of millions. More here: Hat Varoufakis bei Jauch gelogen? Greece has insisted that it will make today\u2019s loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund today. A government source told Reuters this morning that: \u201cIt\u2019s in the pipeline. The payment of 580 million euros will go out later today.\u201d That will leave Greece looking to repay another \u20ac350m to the IMF on Friday. The Greek stock market has fallen 1% this morning, defying the upward trend in other European markets. The head of the International Monetary Fund has urged Greece to press on with structural reforms. Speaking in New Delhi today, Christine Lagarde also warned that the world economy is vulnerable: \u201cLooking ahead, something better may yet come on the back of low oil prices and interest rates. Still, there are significant risks to this fragile global recovery.\u201d Update.... Germany\u2019s DAX just ploughed through the 12,000 mark for the first time ever. Relations between Greece and Germany have not been improved by last week\u2019s demand for war reparations. A \u2018vox pop\u2019 of German citizens by Bloomberg, published today, found many who are losing patience with Greece. Here\u2019s a flavour.... \u201cThe way the Greeks have been behaving has been impossible. Now they\u2019re making their own demands with these reparations,\u201d said Dorli Schneider, an interpreter waiting for a train at Munich\u2019s central station. \u201cGreece should pay back what they owe. We can\u2019t forever give them more money.\u201d And over in Berlin... Cabdriver Jens Mueller says he\u2019s had it with the Greek government and he doesn\u2019t want Germany to send any more of his tax money to be squandered in Athens. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of hubris and arrogance, being in the situation they\u2019re in and making all these demands,\u201d said Mueller, 49, waiting for fares near the Brandenburg Gate. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better for Greece to just leave the euro.\u201d More here: Germans tired of demands from Athens want Greece to leave euro Germany\u2019s main stock index has hit a new record high, as European stock markets make a cautiously optimistic start to the week. The DAX jumped by 0.6% to 11977 points, while the FTSE 100 and French CAC are both up around 0.3%. German share prices have rallied strongly in recent weeks, as traders calculate that the eurozone\u2019s new quantitative easing programme will weaken the euro and boost German exporters. That\u2019s ironic, given Germany\u2019s opposition to the programme. As Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart, puts it: How the Bundesbank must be seething with rage as the DAX soars by over 20% so far in 2015 as the punters believe that exports and earnings from overseas operations represent a new Klondike! Relations between Athens and Berlin over its debt crisis remain rather tense, as was illustrated by a news programme on Germany\u2019s ARD last night. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis appeared on the show (by videolink), and urged the audience that Germany should to more to assist Greece. Varoufakis told them: My message to the viewers this evening is very simple: help us to grow, so that we can pay the money back. Varoufakis also tried to downplay concerns over Greece\u2019s cash position, ahead of today\u2019s IMF repayment, arguing that: \u201cSmall, insignificant problems of liquidity should not divide Europe,\u201d I watched most of the show, and felt that the audience gave Varoufakis a rather cool reception [unlike other guests, he didn\u2019t win much applause]. He was also called to task over a video from 2013, which appeared to show him suggesting Greece could \u201cstick the finger to Germany\u201d and default. Varoufakis claimed last night that the footage was \u2018doctored\u2019, and he\u2019s never given the finger, ever. See for yourself.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re firmly on Greece Watch this morning. The Greek government is due to repay almost \u20ac600m to the International Monetary Fund today, which will take another slice out of its cash reserves. The payment is the third tranche of the loan repayment which Greece must make to the IMF this month (the last slice is due on Friday). Prime minister Alexis Tsipras tried to calm nerves over Greece\u2019s situation last night, telling reporters that \u201cThere is absolutely no problem with liquidity...There is no problem in securing funds for salaries and pensions\u201d. The Greek finance ministry is also adamant the payment will be met, but it will further deplete Greece\u2019s assets. As Bloomberg reports: Greece is set to make its next repayment to the International Monetary Fund Monday, further depleting cash reserves that risk running out this month unless a deal is reached with European partners. Greece will deposit about 588 million euros ($617 million) with the IMF, as scheduled, according to a Finance Ministry spokesman, who declined to be named in line with policy. As other repayments come due this week, the government said on March 14 it had a plan to \u201cenhance its liquidity\u201d and won\u2019t have problems paying wages or pensions. Greece\u2019s funding plight continues to grip the eurozone. On Saturday, a group of protesters held an anti-austerity demonstration outside the finance ministry in Berlin. They carried posters reading \u201cThe banks are going hungry\u201d, \u201cNo to austerity. People ahead of profit\u201d, and \u201cFight the European Criminal Bankers\u201d, as these photos show: Otherwise, it looks like a slightly quiet day, with not much in the calendar. Financial markets are expected to be calm, with investors waiting for the US Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on Wednesday. Stan Shamu of IG explains: This meeting will see the Fed update its economic and financial forecasts (summary of economic projections); and will also bring the dot plot analysis. These will be released along with the statement and the key here is whether the updated forecasts will give the Fed room to adjust its language regarding rates lift-off. Hawkish members such as Mr Bullard have suggested the Fed should remove the \u2018patient\u2019 reference at the March meeting. Some analysts expect the language to be adjusted so as to allow flexibility to raise interest rates sometime around the middle of the year. Those expectations of a US rate rise continue to dominate the foreign exchange markets, with the euro trading close to the 12-year lows hit last week. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

      "body": "<p>As the market rallied after last week\u2019s falls, retailers were among the biggest gainers.</p> <p>Bricks and mortar companies were boosted by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/16/uk-business-rate-review\">the prospect of lower business rates</a>, which could help limit the number of high street closures and help them fend off competition from online firms with lower fixed costs.</p> <p>So <strong>Sainsbury</strong> added 9.5p to 268.6p, <strong>Tesco</strong> rose 8.5p to 241.35p and B&amp;Q owner <strong>Kingfisher</strong> climbed 12.3p to 367p.</p> <p><strong>Next</strong> jumped 205p to \u00a375.55 ahead of full year results later this week, while <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> was 12.4p better at 506p, helped by a positive note from RBC Capital Markets, based on an improvement in its online performance. Analyst Richard Chamberlain said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think M&amp;S\u2019 ecommerce performance is likely to have improved since mid-February when it annualised its web platform change last year and as systems disruption has eased. Our survey of 700 UK shoppers late last year showed that M&amp;S\u2019 website is well regarded which suggests that the demand is there if M&amp;S can improve on its execution and fulfilment. </p> <p>On the food side of the business (around 50% of sales, 40% of profit), we believe M&amp;S is benefitting from being an events driven business, with strong performances around recent events such as Valentine\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day. M&amp;S Food is less reliant on the regular weekly shop than other grocers and also has a higher food to go offer.

      "bodyText": "As the market rallied after last week\u2019s falls, retailers were among the biggest gainers. Bricks and mortar companies were boosted by the prospect of lower business rates, which could help limit the number of high street closures and help them fend off competition from online firms with lower fixed costs. So Sainsbury added 9.5p to 268.6p, Tesco rose 8.5p to 241.35p and B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher climbed 12.3p to 367p. Next jumped 205p to \u00a375.55 ahead of full year results later this week, while Marks &amp; Spencer was 12.4p better at 506p, helped by a positive note from RBC Capital Markets, based on an improvement in its online performance. Analyst Richard Chamberlain said: We think M&amp;S\u2019 ecommerce performance is likely to have improved since mid-February when it annualised its web platform change last year and as systems disruption has eased. Our survey of 700 UK shoppers late last year showed that M&amp;S\u2019 website is well regarded which suggests that the demand is there if M&amp;S can improve on its execution and fulfilment. On the food side of the business (around 50% of sales, 40% of profit), we believe M&amp;S is benefitting from being an events driven business, with strong performances around recent events such as Valentine\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day. M&amp;S Food is less reliant on the regular weekly shop than other grocers and also has a higher food to go offer. As such it should be less exposed to heavy food price deflation. At the very least some more bearish expectations on M&amp;S Food that like for like sales could turn negative in the fourth quarter now look wide of the mark (we forecast fourth quarter like for like sales of 0.8% year on year for food and -1% for General Merchandise).

And yet, whenever data shows that wages restraint is occurring across the nation and that unions are not causing industrial war, there is little more than silence from those same groups. </p> <p>Last Friday \u2013 the very day after the latest industrial disputes figures were released \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/ir-reform-starts-with-fair-work-commission-miners/story-e6frg6n6-1227260635595\">the Australian</a> reported that the Australian Mines and Metals Association was calling for the Fair Work Commission (which makes <a href=\"#termination\">rulings</a> on the legality of industrial action) to be disbanded and that there be a \u201cone-year extension to workplace agreements for new projects\u201d from four years to five \u201cto limit industrial disputes and avoid delays\u201d.</p> <p>You would think an article which suggested the mining industry was the source of an over abundance of industrial disputes might at least make mention of the latest figures. But no.<br></p> <p>The article quoted research undertaken by KPMG for the mines association that suggests \u201cfrom 2009-13 the resources industry accounted for 28% of the working days lost due to industrial action\u201d. </p> <p>The figures by the ABS suggest otherwise:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/QHNEJ/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Even by including figures not in industry breakdowns due to privacy, the mining sector from 2008 to 2013 would still only account for just 14.9% of all days lost. </p> <p>Overwhelmingly, the biggest industries to be hit by industrial disputes were education &amp; training and the health care &amp; social assistance industry. By and large, these industries are not covered by the FWA, but involve agreements with state governments, accounting for 39.8% of days lost from 2008-2013. </p> <p>And they were the major reason for the spike in industrial action that got business into such a tizz in 2012. </p> <p>If we include 2013 and 2014 figures, the mining industry accounts for 13% of days lost to disputes since 2008. </p> <p>Certainly on a per 1,000 employees basis, the coal industry was hit hard by industrial action in 2010-2011, when the FWA first came into effect. But it appears to have subsided greatly since then. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 7\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/1tsHB/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Productivity Commission\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/current/workplace-relations/issues\">review</a> into the workplace relations framework will examine industrial dispute provisions, and business groups will be arguing for a tightening of the reasons and timing in which employees can undertake such action. </p> <p>But the data right now shows industrial relations landscape is overwhelmingly one of industrial peace. </p> <p>I fully expect business groups to ignore the data \u2013 they always do. </p>",

Back then, and in the period after the introduction of the FWA, the industrial disputes figures made the news, as media outlets were ever on the watch for a break out of industrial war that would see a return to the bad old days. In 2011-12, when the level of days lost to strikes reached six-year highs, the knives were out for the FWA. The Australian reported in March 2012 of the \u201cthe worsening industrial climate\u201d, and quoted the Australian Industry Group industrial relations manager, Stephen Smith, who said \u201cthe figures painted a \u201cvery bad picture\u201d, and that \u201cit hasn\u2019t been this bad for quite a few years now not since 2007.\u201d The Sydney Morning Herald reported the then shadow minister for workplace relations and now minister for employment, Senator Eric Abetz, as saying the figures showed that \u201cwe are seeing significant increases in industrial disputation\u201d. The next day the Australian followed up by reporting that the doubling of days lost to industrial disputes in the previous year was, according to business, the blame of \u201cthe bargaining provisions in Labor\u2019s fair work laws\u201d, which slightly broadened the reasons for which workers could take industrial action. Business groups at the time suggested the FWA was \u201cstrangling national productivity\u201d, and the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry argued that because of the increase in the number of working days lost per strike there was a growing \u201cseverity in industrial clashes.\u201d So it\u2019s a pity that now, when such good news regarding near record low levels of industrial action appears, it doesn\u2019t get anywhere near the level of coverage. The actual number of disputes in 2014 fell 14% below the number in 2013: And as for \u201cseverity\u201d of strikes, the number of days lost per industrial dispute in 2014 was just 380 \u2013 the lowest since the 368 days lost per strike in the 12 months to December 2007. The results and coverage highlight the biggest problem with industrial relations \u2013 any suggestion of an increase in worker power through high wages or increased industrial action is immediately and widely condemned by business and conservative media. And yet, whenever data shows that wages restraint is occurring across the nation and that unions are not causing industrial war, there is little more than silence from those same groups. Last Friday \u2013 the very day after the latest industrial disputes figures were released \u2013 the Australian reported that the Australian Mines and Metals Association was calling for the Fair Work Commission (which makes rulings on the legality of industrial action) to be disbanded and that there be a \u201cone-year extension to workplace agreements for new projects\u201d from four years to five \u201cto limit industrial disputes and avoid delays\u201d. You would think an article which suggested the mining industry was the source of an over abundance of industrial disputes might at least make mention of the latest figures. But no. The article quoted research undertaken by KPMG for the mines association that suggests \u201cfrom 2009-13 the resources industry accounted for 28% of the working days lost due to industrial action\u201d. The figures by the ABS suggest otherwise: Even by including figures not in industry breakdowns due to privacy, the mining sector from 2008 to 2013 would still only account for just 14.9% of all days lost. Overwhelmingly, the biggest industries to be hit by industrial disputes were education &amp; training and the health care &amp; social assistance industry. By and large, these industries are not covered by the FWA, but involve agreements with state governments, accounting for 39.8% of days lost from 2008-2013. And they were the major reason for the spike in industrial action that got business into such a tizz in 2012. If we include 2013 and 2014 figures, the mining industry accounts for 13% of days lost to disputes since 2008. Certainly on a per 1,000 employees basis, the coal industry was hit hard by industrial action in 2010-2011, when the FWA first came into effect. But it appears to have subsided greatly since then. The Productivity Commission\u2019s review into the workplace relations framework will examine industrial dispute provisions, and business groups will be arguing for a tightening of the reasons and timing in which employees can undertake such action. But the data right now shows industrial relations landscape is overwhelmingly one of industrial peace. I fully expect business groups to ignore the data \u2013 they always do.",
