      "bodyText": "Sterling\u2019s slump since the Brexit vote appears to have led to not just an increase in staycations but a boom in the numbers of UK holidaymakers heading east to destinations such as Thailand, Vietnam and Bali. The Post Office\u2019s travel money arm said the trends it was seeing in demand for currency indicated a surge in trips booked to south-east Asia as UK tourists look to combine winter sun later this year with lower prices for accommodation, food and other holiday staples. The weakness of sterling added hundreds of pounds to the cost of many people\u2019s summer holidays both this year and last. On Friday the pound was trading at just under \u20ac1.09. That is down from \u20ac1.30 the day before the referendum in June 2016, and \u20ac1.42 in August 2015. But British holidaymakers heading to Europe are being offered much worse exchange rates than that at some UK airport bureaux de change. It was reported on Friday one at Southampton was offering \u20ac0.867 for a pound. While sterling\u2019s slide has made overseas holidays more expensive and prompted some Britons to swap Ibiza for the Isle of Wight, others have decided to look further afield, which may partly reflect the fact that in the case of some currencies, the pound is not down quite so dramatically. For example, while sterling has fallen by 16% against the euro since the day before the Brexit vote, it is down 10% against the Vietnamese dong over the same period. The Post Office, which claims to be the UK\u2019s biggest travel money provider, said one of the biggest surges in demand had been for the Thai baht. Sales of Thailand\u2019s currency June to August were up 69% on the same period last year. Demand for the Vietnamese dong was up 29%, while for the Indonesian rupiah the increase was 13%. As a result, these three countries, plus Malaysia (up 7%), accounted for four of the top 10 spots in the provider\u2019s table of the \u201cfastest growing currencies\u201d this summer. Andrew Brown, a spokesman for the Post Office\u2019s travel money division, said: \u201cLooking forward to the autumn and winter, there is every reason to expect that UK tourists will head east for long-haul holidays if our summer currency sales are anything to go by. Savvy travellers know that prices in Thailand, Bali, Vietnam and Penang are cheap, and in times when the value of sterling is uncertain, low resort costs are proving a big draw.\u201d Strong demand for trips to watch the British &amp; Irish Lions summer rugby tour made the New Zealand dollar the fastest growing currency between June and August, with demand up 124%. Brown said: \u201cSales have remained very healthy over the past month, suggesting New Zealand will be popular with UK visitors this winter.\u201d In terms of Europe, Croatia proved to be \u201cthe year\u2019s big winner\u201d, with Post Office sales of its currency, the kuna, up by a third over the summer compared with the same period last year. Over the past five years kuna sales have more than doubled, it said.",

      "bodyText": "There is likely to be a very heady aroma floating across the nation\u2019s beauty halls this weekend as a small army of shop assistants mobilises to spray shoppers with Gabrielle \u2013 Chanel\u2019s first new perfume in 15 years. The perfume industry\u2019s equivalent of a new blockbuster movie, the hype has been building for months, and peaked this week with the release of an ad featuring the actress Kristen Stewart dancing her way into a wall of Gabrielle bottles. Chanel is putting its considerable financial muscle behind the new brand at a time when the UK perfume market \u2013 along with key European markets \u2013 is in the doldrums. The number of bottles sold is falling by between 5%-10% a year as millennials turn their nose up at traditional scents. Perfume sales put \u00a31.5bn a year into the tills of UK retailers but in recent years growth has only been maintained by manufacturers hiking prices and well-heeled shoppers trading up to expensive products like Creed aftershave, which costs more than \u00a3100 for a 30ml bottle, and Gabrielle, which starts at \u00a379 for 50ml. \u201cWe think this will be one of the biggest launches in our 25-year history,\u201d says Gill Smith, the managing director of the The Perfume Shop, the UK\u2019s biggest specialist retailer. \u201cChanel has a universal appeal and we know our customers love the interlocking C\u2019s. It\u2019s also pay day this weekend so lots of people will see it and want to buy it.\u201d The Mintel analyst Roshida Khanom says specialist chains and department store counters have been having a tough time selling scents. Savvy shoppers sniff testers in store and then scour the web for the best price. Perfume is also having to battle for consumers\u2019 cash at a time when Britons are spending more of their spare money on experiences. Most perfumes are made under contract by beauty conglomerates such as Est\u00e9e Lauder and L\u2019Or\u00e9al but at the top end, luxury goods companies such as Herm\u00e8s and Chanel continue to make their own. A big problem area is the mass market, where manufacturers are struggling to replace dwindling sales of celebrity fragrances, which have fallen out of favour. \u201cThe celebrity fragrance is not as aspirational as it once,\u201d says Khanom. \u201cCelebrities have become more accessible; we see the good, bad and the ugly on social media.\u201d Sanjay Vadera, who runs the 183-store chain The Fragrance Shop, said sales of celebrity fragrances have slumped more than 10% in the last year. In their place has come a new breed of brands linked to fashion stores, such as Babe Power, the first perfume from the online fashion retailer Missguided, which has been among the year\u2019s biggest sellers to date. The boom in celebrity perfumes ranged from movie and music stars such as Elizabeth Taylor (White Diamonds), Jennifer Lopez (Glow), Beyonc\u00e9 (Heat) and Britney Spears (Fantasy, Curious), to footballer fragrances such as David Beckham (Instinct, Intimately). Some of the brands have had surprising longevity, including the late Jade Goody\u2019s Shh! and Controversial. \u201cBritney Spears launched 10 years ago but it still sells because it\u2019s a good juice,\u201d says Vadera. \u201cJade Goody still sells because of the price. They are not buying it because of Jade Goody but because the juice is very good value at \u00a310 and they are getting it in a nice bottle. At the end of the day it is about product and value.\u201d Vadera says the UK perfume market has seen low single digit growth, in value terms, over the last few years but after inflation is stripped out the underlying picture is one of flat or falling sales \u2013 although The Fragrance Shop has continued to perform strongly as it cashes in on demand for big ticket scents such as Dior Sauvage. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of a slack market than anything else,\u201d he said. But the buzz around Gabrielle, as well as a slew of other new perfumes, including Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s Scandal and Bloom from Gucci, means perfume retailers are hoping for a lucrative Christmas period. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen a lineup like this for a long time,\u201d says Vadera. But with perfume sales also falling in key luxury markets such as France and Italy, the industry has begun to ring the changes. The use of Stewart by Chanel suggests a willingness to drop some of the romantic boy-meets-girl cliches it has been using to sell perfume since Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel launched No5 in the 1920s. Marketing budgets are also being deployed to buy social media promotions rather than space in department store windows as shopping habits change. The cut-throat nature of the perfume industry means that despite months of hype around Gabrielle in the fashion press, what it actually smells like was left to remain a mystery until the first bottles were opened in stores. With characteristic fashion industry hyperbole, Chanel describes the smell as a \u201csolar vibration\u201d. Smith, who had to sign a non-disclosure agreement to sniff a Gabrielle tester six months ago, offered a rather more down-to-earth description: floral and quite fresh with an air of French chic.",

      "bodyText": "The future of Keith Hellawell as Sports Direct\u2019s chairman is hanging in the balance after a string of investment groups said they plan to vote him out next week in protest against corporate governance at the retail group. Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), Sports Direct\u2019s fourth largest independent shareholder, has joined Royal London Asset Management (RLAM) and Aberdeen Asset Management (AAM) in pledging to vote against Hellawell\u2019s re-election at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Wednesday. Hellawell has pledged to step down if he does not win the backing of independent shareholders this year after more than half of them voted against him in 2016. He only remains in his job because of the backing of Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority shareholder, Mike Ashley, who now controls more than 60% of the group\u2019s shares. Despite a number of changes in the way the company has operated since last year, including the exit of Dave Forsey as chief executive, independent investors remain concerned over the dominance of Ashley and poor treatment of workers. A Guardian investigation in 2015 prompted a parliamentary inquiry last year, in which MPs likened the depot to a Victorian workhouse. Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at LGIM, said: \u201cLegal &amp; General has voted against the Sports Direct chairman re-election since 2014 due to concerns regarding the governance of the company. We escalated our concerns in 2016 by opposing the re-election of all of the non-executive directors. Although we are encouraged by some of the positive steps made over the past year, such as refreshing the board and labour relations, we believe progress is not sufficient to warrant supporting the chairman\u2019s re-election this year.\u201d Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at RLAM, which owns a \u00a34m stake in Sports Direct, said it had no confidence in the ability of the retail group\u2019s chairman and non-executive directors to provide effective oversight. \u201cIn a year where some companies have made meaningful progress towards improving their corporate governance, Sports Direct continues to show a serious disregard for shareholders\u2019 views about the governance and management of the company,\u201d Hamilton said. Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at AAM, said: \u201cSports Direct has made some improvements over the last year but there remain significant, entrenched governance problems. The review of governance and working practices is not fully independent and its results are not yet visible. The executive leadership and board structure remain works in progress.

      "bodyText": "The former chief executive of Provident Financial is to forfeit pay and bonuses worth up to \u00a34m after last week\u2019s shock profit warning that sent the doorstep lender\u2019s shares into a tailspin. Peter Crook, who presided over an ill-fated radical change to the company\u2019s century-old business model, will give up cash, shares and benefits, some as part of a voluntary agreement and some thanks to a decision taken by senior figures at the company. He agreed to give up pay, pension and benefits, worth at least \u00a31m according to the company\u2019s annual report, that would have been due for his contractual notice period of a year. The company has cancelled share awards for three previous years that would have been worth a combined \u00a31m at today\u2019s share price and would have become available to him over three years starting in 2018. Crook, who stepped down with immediate effect last week after 12 years with the company, will also miss out on outstanding long-term bonus payments worth \u00a31.5m at Provident\u2019s current share price. A further \u00a3500,000 in shares already granted to him could also be under threat, under \u201cclawback\u201d provisions, although he is still technically entitled to them at present. Crook, whose pay and bonuses deal was worth \u00a36.3m last year, could theoretically also have earned a \u00a33.7m bonus in 2017, but the majority of that is a variable bonus that he would have been highly unlikely to qualify for given the company\u2019s financial woes. Excluding that bonus, he stands to miss out on around \u00a34m based on the company\u2019s share price of \u00a38.72 at close of trading on Friday. The share portion of his forfeited package would have been even more valuable before the company\u2019s stock dived by two thirds last week, wiping \u00a31.7bn off its stock market value. The dramatic fall came after Provident warned that its home credit division could lose up to \u00a3120m this year compared with a prediction of a \u00a360m profit just two months ago, a forecast that was already a downgrade on previous expectations. The firm also cancelled its dividend and said City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority was probing the sale of a credit card product by its banking division, Vanquis Bank. Provident\u2019s home lending business has struggled after it axed its 130-year-old model of using self-employed agents, who travelled door to door offering loans to people struggling financially and collecting debts. It replaced them with iPad-carrying \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d whose daily activity was to be directed by computer software and saw its collections plummet amid problems with the technology and efforts by rivals to poach its best agents and their clients. Writing on a web forum used by current and former Provident staff, user Guesswho said: \u201cTrouble is, these bonuses usually show from previous year\u2019s figures so it\u2019s never a true picture of the company as it is right now. \u201cHe\u2019s gone and his successor and others may not see bonuses for quite some time.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was \u201cthe first taste of a bitter cup that will be proffered to us over and over again,\u201d according to former US vice president Al Gore at the time. Since then, Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and now Hurricane Harvey have borne out this prediction. The latest storm may turn out to be less fatal than Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people but in economic terms it may be as bad. Hurricane Katrina cost about $160bn (\u00a3124bn) in economic losses in today\u2019s terms, accounting for the last decade\u2019s inflation, while Sandy wrought about $70bn in damage. Preliminary estimates for the damage caused by Harvey are wide apart, spanning $90bn to $190bn, reflecting the difficulty of judging an unfolding disaster. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, at the London School of Economics, says: \u201cHurricane Harvey may turn out to be the most damaging weather disaster to have hit the US. It will take some time before we know what the full cost is [and] in addition to the physical damage there will be the economic losses from businesses that cannot operate. If Houston is slow to recover from the impacts, the losses will mount.\u201d In the UK, motorists have been warned that petrol prices are likely to rise sharply as the effect of Hurricane Harvey on oil production is felt. If past disasters are anything to go by, about half of the direct, local cost of Hurricane Harvey is likely to be picked up eventually by insurers, with the rest borne by the public purse and by individuals and businesses. Insurers have taken an increasingly active role in the last decade in warning of the potential for more intense storms, floods, droughts and other natural disasters as a result of climate change, and of our failure to protect a rising population and increasingly complex infrastructure against these effects. \u201cWe have been working on climate change since the 1970s,\u201d says Ernst Rauch, head of climate and public sector business development at Munich Re. \u201cWe are one of the largest risk takers and it is essential we understand these potential risks. This is crucial to us.\u201d For insurers, the key issue is the resilience of populations and infrastructure \u2013 the ability to deal with disasters when they happen. In most situations, this requires government planning, working with the private sector to help proof homes and buildings against severe weather. But while insurers have grown acutely aware of these risks, governments and other parts of the private sector have lagged behind. \u201cWe see the need at a global scale for societies and public risk managers like government and local authorities to pay more attention to the reduction of risk and resilience building,\u201d says Rauch. \u201cOtherwise we will see an ongoing increase in losses, driven and intensified by climate change.\u201d Caspar Honegger, who heads global flood peril assessment at Swiss Re, reports that after Superstorm Sandy hit New York, the city asked his team to analyse the climate risks for the next 40 years. They found that rising sea levels and the increasing frequency of storms would raise average annual losses by 170% to $4.4bn. ClimateWise \u2013 a coalition of 29 insurers including Allianz, Lloyd\u2019s, Zurich, Prudential and Swiss Re \u2013 warned of a growing \u201cprotection gap\u201d between the cost of natural disasters and the amount insured for. The group said weather catastrophes \u2013 which are now six times more frequent than in 1950 \u2013 are making some assets uninsurable and advised more investment in building resilience against floods and heat waves. The online property company Zillow estimates that 1.9 million homes in the US, valued at a combined $882bn, could be submerged by the end of the century as sea levels rise and storm surges erode coastlines and riverbanks. Florida would be worst affected, losing one in eight properties, followed by Hawaii with one in 10. Insurers now treat this as a board level issue, with chief executives reporting to their shareholders on the increasing risk from climate-related disasters, and working with the UN, World Bank and national governments. As their business relies on understanding risk, they have taken a lead not just in pricing in new risks but in encouraging efforts to reduce them. Insurers are among the top global investors in renewable energy, and some are considering divesting from fossil fuels. They have funded studies of vulnerability and ways to adapt to climate change, and urged governments to protect their populations from the potential ravages of warming. Yet not enough is being done, warns Rauch. \u201cNot enough account is taken of climate change at the public decision-making level. Climate change is not something that is going to have an impact in a hundred years, its impact is already felt today. That\u2019s why we need to adapt to the consequences, such as by investing in infrastructure, fortifying homes, building levees and dykes, maybe removing homes from highly exposed zones.\u201d In part this lack of preparedness is down to the cost of equipping communities with better protection and better recovery mechanisms. But for more than a decade, since the pivotal Stern review of the economics of climate change in 2006, an increasing body of work has demonstrated that dealing with emissions and the probable effects of climate change now will save money in the medium and longer term. \u201cThe longer we fail to act the more expensive it will be; the sooner we act, the cheaper. Doing nothing will be much more expensive,\u201d says Rauch. But insurance does offer one big advantage in assessing the likely impacts of climate disasters, says Rauch. \u201cWe are very transparent. Insurance premiums reflect risk based on two factors: first is the underlying hazard, that is the probability of an event occurring, and the second is the vulnerability if an event occurs. If the hazard is driven up by climate change, you can still reduce vulnerability, by investing in protection and fortifying homes, such as by building them to higher standards. Then the premiums could remain constant. But if you keep everything as it is today and the risk goes up, they would have to rise.\u201d In Florida, for instance, lax building regulations mean buildings are more vulnerable, as well as more at risk, and premiums are higher accordingly \u2013 more than $2,000 for insurance coverage that would cost less than \u20ac200 in Germany, according to Rauch. \u201cAt the end of the day, insurance is a simple system and one of the biggest benefits is that we put a price tag on risk \u2013 so in a functioning market everyone can understand where the risk is higher.\u201d",

Hurricane Katrina cost about $160bn (\u00a3124bn) in economic losses in today\u2019s terms, accounting for the last decade\u2019s inflation, while Sandy wrought about $70bn in damage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/timeline-billion-dollar-weather-disasters-us-2007-2016\">A timeline of the billion-dollar weather disasters in the US over the past decade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Preliminary estimates for the damage caused by Harvey are wide apart, spanning $90bn to $190bn, reflecting the difficulty of judging an unfolding disaster. </p> <p>Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, at the London School of Economics, says: \u201cHurricane Harvey may turn out to be the most damaging weather disaster to have hit the US. It will take some time before we know what the full cost is [and] in addition to the physical damage there will be the economic losses from businesses that cannot operate. If Houston is slow to recover from the impacts, the losses will mount.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2017-09-01T15:46:11/embed.html\" data-alt=\"US weather costs graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2017-09-01T15:46:11/embed.html\">US weather costs graphic</a> </figure>  <p>In the UK, motorists have been warned that petrol prices are likely to rise sharply as the effect of Hurricane Harvey on oil production is felt.</p> <p>If past disasters are anything to go by, about half of the direct, local cost of Hurricane Harvey is likely to be picked up eventually by insurers, with the rest borne by the public purse and by individuals and businesses. Insurers have taken an increasingly active role in the last decade in warning of the potential for more intense storms, floods, droughts and other natural disasters as a result of climate change, and of our failure to protect a rising population and increasingly complex infrastructure against these effects.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been working on climate change since the 1970s,\u201d says Ernst Rauch, head of climate and public sector business development at Munich Re. \u201cWe are one of the largest risk takers and it is essential we understand these potential risks. This is crucial to us.\u201d</p> <p>For insurers, the key issue is the resilience of populations and infrastructure \u2013 the ability to deal with disasters when they happen. In most situations, this requires government planning, working with the private sector to help proof homes and buildings against severe weather. But while insurers have grown acutely aware of these risks, governments and other parts of the private sector have lagged behind.</p> <p>\u201cWe see the need at a global scale for societies and public risk managers like government and local authorities to pay more attention to the reduction of risk and resilience building,\u201d says Rauch. \u201cOtherwise we will see an ongoing increase in losses, driven and intensified by climate change.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Weather catastrophes are now six times more frequent than in 1950</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Caspar Honegger, who heads global flood peril assessment at Swiss Re, reports that after Superstorm Sandy hit New York, the city asked his team to analyse the climate risks for the next 40 years. They found that rising sea levels and the increasing frequency of storms would raise average annual losses by 170% to $4.4bn.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/business-action/sustainable-finance/climatewise\">ClimateWise</a> \u2013 a coalition of 29 insurers including Allianz, Lloyd\u2019s, Zurich, Prudential and Swiss Re \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/07/climate-change-threatens-ability-insurers-manage-risk\">warned of a growing \u201cprotection gap\u201d </a>between the cost of natural disasters and the amount insured for. The group said weather catastrophes \u2013 which are now six times more frequent than in 1950 \u2013 are making some assets uninsurable and advised more investment in building resilience against floods and heat waves.</p> <p>The online property company <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/climate-change-underwater-homes-12890/\">Zillow estimates</a> that 1.9 million homes in the US, valued at a combined $882bn, could be submerged by the end of the century as sea levels rise and storm surges erode coastlines and riverbanks. Florida would be worst affected, losing one in eight properties, followed by Hawaii with one in 10.</p> <p>Insurers now treat this as a board level issue, with chief executives reporting to their shareholders on the increasing risk from climate-related disasters, and working with the UN, World Bank and national governments. As their business relies on understanding risk, they have taken a lead not just in pricing in new risks but in encouraging efforts to reduce them. Insurers are among the top global investors in renewable energy, and some are considering divesting from fossil fuels. They have funded studies of vulnerability and ways to adapt to climate change, and urged governments to protect their populations from the potential ravages of warming.</p> <p>Yet not enough is being done, warns Rauch. \u201cNot enough account is taken of climate change at the public decision-making level. Climate change is not something that is going to have an impact in a hundred years, its impact is already felt today. That\u2019s why we need to adapt to the consequences, such as by investing in infrastructure, fortifying homes, building levees and dykes, maybe removing homes from highly exposed zones.\u201d</p> <p>In part this lack of preparedness is down to the cost of equipping communities with better protection and better recovery mechanisms. But for more than a decade, since the pivotal Stern review of the economics of climate change in 2006, an increasing body of work has demonstrated that dealing with emissions and the probable effects of climate change now will save money in the medium and longer term. \u201cThe longer we fail to act the more expensive it will be; the sooner we act, the cheaper. Doing nothing will be much more expensive,\u201d says Rauch.</p> <p>But insurance does offer one big advantage in assessing the likely impacts of climate disasters, says Rauch. \u201cWe are very transparent. Insurance premiums reflect risk based on two factors: first is the underlying hazard, that is the probability of an event occurring, and the second is the vulnerability if an event occurs. If the hazard is driven up by climate change, you can still reduce vulnerability, by investing in protection and fortifying homes, such as by building them to higher standards. Then the premiums could remain constant. But if you keep everything as it is today and the risk goes up, they would have to rise.\u201d<br></p> <p>In Florida, for instance, lax building regulations mean buildings are more vulnerable, as well as more at risk, and premiums are higher accordingly \u2013 more than $2,000 for insurance coverage that would cost less than \u20ac200 in Germany, according to Rauch. \u201cAt the end of the day, insurance is a simple system and one of the biggest benefits is that we put a price tag on risk \u2013 so in a functioning market everyone can understand where the risk is higher.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Five more carmakers have launched scrappage schemes as the auto industry tries to kickstart the stuttering UK market by offering thousands of pounds off new, less polluting models. Renault, Nissan, Toyota and Kia announced deals whereby owners of cars registered before 2010 could save up to \u00a32,000 by trading in their vehicles for a new one. Volkswagen unveiled a new diesel scrappage scheme, the latest in a series of manufacturers to do so. The schemes come after faltering new car sales, which have dropped off in the UK after years of growth. They also come amid the threat of renewed action by governments on older, polluting cars \u2013 especially following the VW diesel emissions scandal. The German carmaker has promised discounts of up to \u00a36,000 when buying a new car. Nissan, whose offer is not a scrappage scheme but a swap, is encouraging a switch to electric vehicles such as its UK-built Leaf, offering discounts of up to \u00a32,000 plus the trade-in value of the older vehicle. Toyota said it was offering up to \u00a34,000 for buyers of a Land Cruiser, adding: \u201cWe go to great lengths to make sure [the old] car is scrapped in the greenest possible way, with everything which can possibly be recycled being extracted by experts.\u201d Ford, BMW, Hyundai, Mercedes and Vauxhall have all announced similar schemes. Most of the trade-ins can be of any brand of car registered before 2010, the date when vehicles have had to comply with Euro V regulations on engine standards and cleanliness. Most of the UK schemes will run until the end of December. The incentives are to encourage take-up of vehicles with Euro VI standard engines, which the industry claims reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesel in particular \u2013 although independent studies have indicated that most modern vehicles emit far higher levels of pollution than advertised. The barrage of announcements coincide with more rigorous, real-world tests being introduced in the UK. The government has floated the idea of a national scrappage scheme in its clean air strategy, while local authorities and the mayor of London have urged tougher action. Pressure has mounted since the diesel emissions scandal, in which VW was found to be deliberately cheating vehicle emissions tests. Manufacturers have already launched scrappage schemes abroad, with VW offering substantially more, a \u20ac10,000 incentive, to German car owners. Observers welcomed the moves but with some scepticism. Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: \u201cScrappage schemes are fast becoming the autumn fashion in car showrooms, with no manufacturer wanting to be left behind in either the commercial or PR stakes. There\u2019s no harm in that if the result is a good deal for consumers and a positive impact on emissions. \u201cThe acid test is whether the savings on offer are large enough to make brand new models affordable to people and businesses who might normally buy secondhand.\u201d Ana Nicholls, automotive analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the schemes were partly the results of pressure on carmakers to get polluting cars off the road. But, she added: \u201cIt is also about getting new customers into showrooms at a time when car sales are subdued \u2013 down by 2.2% year on year in the first half of 2017.\u201d Nicholls said VW and Toyota\u2019s discounts looked to be aiming in particular at customers who usually buy used cars, potentially deflating prices in that market. Oliver Hayes, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said it seemed clear the motivation behind the schemes was to \u201cboost flagging sales rather than meaningfully tackle air pollution\u201d. He said: \u201cEncouraging the sale of electric VWs is clearly welcome, but knocking \u00a310,000 off a \u00a332,000 Golf still puts it beyond the reach of many people driving the oldest, most polluting cars that urgently need taking off the roads in order to protect our children from growing up with lungs damaged by air pollution.\u201d Hayes said the government should roll out a nationwide scrappage scheme, giving more money to people ditching cars altogether for train season tickets or car club membership: \u201cLowering pollution requires reducing traffic \u2013 an aim car companies are never going to pursue if left to their own devices,\u201d he said.",

Labour MPs called for the G4S contract to run Brook House, which can hold up to 508 adult male immigration detainees facing removal, to be suspended and reviewed. However, the company confirmed it would continue with its bid to renew its eight-year-old contract to run the centre from next May. More than 14,000 people passed through the centre in the year to 30 August. Thangam Debbonaire, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on refugees, said: \u201cThis contract should be, in my view, suspended and reviewed. The Home Office needs to take responsibility for this. This is part of a much wider problem. \u201cThese are people who are not criminals, they are being detained. And the use of detention, unfortunately, over the last few years has, by the Home Office, become a port of first resort rather than last resort as it is supposed to be.\u201d A BBC Panorama programme to be broadcast on Monday will feature undercover footage shot by one staff member showing officers \u201cmocking, abusing and even assaulting detainees\u201d. The nine staff suspended by G4S include two managers, six detention custody officers and a nurse. Several other staff members have been moved to other duties. G4S said it had opened an investigation into allegations of \u201cchaos, incompetence and abuse\u201d and had passed details to Sussex police. Jerry Petherick, the managing director for custodial and detention services, said: \u201cThere is no place for the type of conduct described in the allegations anywhere in G4S. Such behaviour is not representative of the many G4S colleagues who do a great job, often in difficult and challenging circumstances, across the country. \u201cWe have not yet been provided with the recorded evidence which forms the basis of the allegations and it is inappropriate for me to prejudge the outcome of our investigation. Once we have seen the evidence and concluded the investigation, I will ensure that we take the appropriate action.\u201d The Home Office said it condemned any actions that put the safety or dignity of immigration removal centre detainees at risk. \u201cWe are clear that all detainees should be treated with dignity and respect and we expect G4S to carry out a thorough investigation into these allegations and that all appropriate action be taken.\u201d The allegations are the latest in series of well-documented problems on government security contracts awarded to G4S. In November 2013, three G4S guards were acquitted of manslaughter over the death of Jimmy Mubenga on a deportation flight to Angola. In the same year G4S was temporarily banned from bidding for government work over allegations of overcharging on contracts to electronically monitor offenders. The ban was lifted in 2014 when G4S agreed to repay \u00a3109m and put in place a \u201ccorporate renewal plan\u201d to prevent any recurrence, but a Serious Fraud Office inquiry is ongoing. The G4S-run child jail at Oakhill has been plagued with high levels of violence, according to inspectors. The firm was stripped of a contract to run Medway secure training centre (STC) after another Panorama undercover expos\u00e9, and the firm\u2019s other STC, Rainsbrook in Northamptonshire, was transferred to another provider last year.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct warehouse staff who say they are unhappy with their working conditions are being identified by their fingerprints and asked to explain their grievances to management, according to the trade union Unite. The leisurewear company has introduced a staff survey system at its Shirebrook warehouse, Derbyshire, which was at the centre of allegations of \u201cgulag\u201d conditions last year after a Guardian investigation. When the warehouse\u2019s 3,500 workers clock in, they are asked to press a touchpad featuring a happy or sad face emoji to indicate whether they are satisfied with working conditions. If they press sad, they are asked whether they are sure about their decision and, if they press it again, they can be called in by managers to discuss why they did so. Staff can be identified because the touchpad uses fingerprint recognition technology to identify those who express discontent. Unite said the staff survey system was \u201cbogus\u201d because workers were unlikely to be candid about their feelings if they could then be singled out for questioning. \u201cPut yourself in their shoes,\u201d said the union\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner. \u201cWould you risk having hours withheld, possibly losing your job and being called in by management because you indicated dissatisfaction with your work environment?\u201d Turner described the survey as \u201ca bogus exercise to gloss over past failures and some of the problems\u201d which he said still persisted at the warehouse. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs of the work and pensions select committee, said an anonymous feedback system would be better. \u201cAll it will reveal is how brave some staff are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ought to extend it to MPs and see how they feel about Sports Direct.\u201d Shirebrook became the focus of a parliamentary inquiry last year after a Guardian investigation revealed dismal working conditions, including body searches, pay below the minimum wage and constant fear of sacking for minor transgressions. Unite said conditions were still poor and that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of workers were on contracts that guaranteed no more than 336 hours a year. \u201cWith reports from agency workers of crowded aisles, defective warehouse equipment and products stacked dangerously high, we know that health and safety is still a major cause for concern,\u201d said Turner. \u201cGimmicks like using emojis do not escape the fact that Sports Direct\u2019s reliance on thousands of insecure agency workers still poses a reputational risk or that many are still owed money for non-payment of the minimum wage. \u201cSports Direct still has a long way to go to clean its act up and risks the charge of \u2018business as usual\u2019 until it makes temporary agency workers direct permanent employees.\u201d Sports Direct said it had put in place multiple ways to protect staff and allow them to provide feedback. \u201cWe believe these comments by Unite do not accurately reflect the position at Sports Direct,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe have a range of different measures in place to protect staff. These include a comprehensive system for staff to provide detailed feedback via an initiative called your company, your voice, plus a workers representative who attends meetings of the board.\u201d Sports Direct also had a \u201cstaff listening group, a staff health and safety committee and a staff wellbeing service\u201d, said the spokesperson. \u201cWhilst we are disappointed with Unite\u2019s stance we will continue to engage with the union, and we recently contacted Unite on this basis.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "David Davis takes aim at Trump's isolationist rhetoric in US speech", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has taken aim at the isolationist rhetoric of Donald Trump in a pointed speech in which he told US business leaders that free trade was the solution to, not the cause of, global turmoil. Speaking to the US Chamber of Commerce, Davis said Britain would not take part in a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in order to secure new free trade deals with countries outside the EU after Brexit. But he conceded that one of the UK government\u2019s Brexit proposals, a so-called track-and-trace scheme using technology and trust to replace customs controls as part of a mooted new customs arrangement, may not happen. Asked by a FedEx executive to explain how the proposed regime would work in practice, Davis said it was less likely to be accepted than a more conventional system, adding that it was \u201cblue-sky\u201d. He said he did not want to see a return to 1930s-style protectionism and hinted that the US president should rethink his policy on global trade. \u201cThe answers to the problems of the west cannot be to turn our backs on globalisation and trade,\u201d Davis said, without mentioning Trump directly. \u201cIt feels to me it is necessary to make the case once more for free trade and capitalism.\u201d Trump has been a firm advocate of a new protectionist agenda for the US, prioritising its manufacturing, and has blamed \u201cterrible deals\u201d with states such as China and Mexico for much of the country\u2019s economic problems. Davis said the pace of change \u201cmay feel like a threat\u201d, but said western economies had to find ways to compete. \u201cThere is no future in trying to be cheaper than China,\u201d he said. Instead, he said the major aim of US-UK cooperation should be a renewed focus on easing trade in services. \u201cWe must work together to convince other countries of the benefits,\u201d he said. Asked by one business leader if the UK had been able to persuade the Trump administration of the importance of services as well as goods, given Trump\u2019s particular fixation on the US automotive industry, Davis said: \u201cIt\u2019s natural I\u2019m afraid in politics for people to focus on the obvious, and it\u2019s easy to see lots of cars crossing a border, for example. It\u2019s harder to see the effect of the virtual world of services. But we are working on it.\u201d In the speech, Davis also appeared to give his backing to cabinet colleagues such as Michael Gove, who has said the UK is not prepared to consider lowering standards on items such as chlorinated chicken in order to secure a trade deal with the US. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has suggested that the UK should be open to more flexible regulations in order to open up new markets. Davis said he was \u201cno fan of excess burdens for business ... [but] we will not be engaging in a regulatory race to the bottom.\u201d He said Britain had an \u201copportunity to lead a race to the top on quality and standards across the globe\u201d. Asked about the timeframe for a new US-UK free trade deal, Davis said he did not expect any new agreements to come into force during a transition period after the UK leaves the EU, but added that new deals could be concluded in preparation for the end of the transition. However, he also refused to rule out the UK would paying part of its EU exit bill during the transition period. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling anything in or out. I never do. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been floated around,\u201d he said. Davis called the Brexit negotiation \u201cprobably the most complicated negotiation in history and our enemy is time\u201d.He said the UK was going through the EU\u2019s financial demands \u201cline by line and we have very good lawyers, so it is getting a bit tense\u201d. Throughout the speech, Davis struck an upbeat note and called himself a determined optimist after the bruising round of talks in Brussels, where the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said progress was hampered by a \u201clack of trust\u201d between the two sides. Instead, it was Fox who continued the war of words with Brussels as Davis flew across the Atlantic to woo US business leaders. Speaking in Japan on a trip with the prime minister and business leaders to lay the groundwork for future trade talks, he said the UK \u201ccan\u2019t be blackmailed into paying a price\u201d when asked whether it was time for the UK to name a figure for an exit settlement. \u201cWe think we should begin discussions on the final settlement because that\u2019s good for business, and it\u2019s good for the prosperity both of the British people and of the rest of the people of the European Union,\u201d he said. Asked whether he agreed with Fox, Davis said he did not want to comment directly. \u201cWe are in a difficult, tough, complicated negotiation; it will be turbulent and what we are having is the first ripple, and there will be many more ripples along the way,\u201d he said. Davis said he was confident the government would last the next five years, beyond the Brexit cut-off date of March 2019. \u201cThe real issue on Brexit is mostly practical, what is in the mutual best interest of all [of] us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the driver. There is a majority to carry Brexit through parliament.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The drugs group Indivior has seen more than \u00a31bn wiped off its stock market value after it lost a US patent ruling that could pave the way for the launch of rivals to its Suboxone Film heroin substitute. The company, spun out of Reckitt Benckiser in 2014, said it would appeal against the Delaware court decision that the generic drug maker Dr Reddy\u2019s had not infringed its patents. Indivior\u2019s shares plunged 38% to 255p after news of the ruling. The chief executive, Shaun Thaxter, said: \u201cToday\u2019s news is disappointing \u2026 given the belief that the company has in its intellectual property for Suboxone Film \u2026 We remain confident in Indivior\u2019s long-term outlook and vision.\u201d The company said it was not possible to quantify precisely what effect the launch of a generic competitor would have on its revenues but admitted such a move \u201ccould potentially result in a rapid and material loss of market share for Suboxone Film in the US\u201d. The average market share of Suboxone Film in the US was 6% in 2016, it said, and it accounted for 80% of Indivior\u2019s total revenues last year. Indivior said if pharmacies could substitute Suboxone Film with a generic rival without direct consultation with the patient it could lead to the firm\u2019s treatment losing up to 80% of its market share \u201cwithin a matter of months\u201d. Indivior said in June it had won a US patent battle against Actavis and Par Pharmaceutical over Suboxone Film. James Vane-Tempest, an analyst at Jefferies, said: \u201cAlthough today\u2019s update is disappointing, in our view the situation is not as bad as this scenario would suggest given: 1) the appeals process can take 12-18 months; 2) Indivior has a strong balance sheet; 3) if the [rival treatment] launches in the first quarter of 2018, there is potentially a year to convert stable patients on to the new formulation, thus reducing the market opportunity of the film generic if the timings are as per our base case; and 4) the scenario doesn\u2019t consider any change in Indivior\u2019s business model \u2013 given Indivior\u2019s fixed and sizeable cost base there is the potential for significant savings if needs be to weather any profitability impact.\u201d Nick Keher at RBC Europe said there were still several possible outcomes following the ruling. He said: \u201cThe one positive from this news is that Indivior\u2019s patents were upheld, and Dr Reddy\u2019s was found to not be infringing on said patents. This could potentially help offset any future generic challenges, as [they] must also show to not be infringing. This could limit the number of competitors and hence the market share loss of Subuxone Film.\u201d Indivior is the latest victim of a summer of discontent which has seen sharp share price falls in the likes of Dixons Carphone, WPP, Carillion and Provident Financial as investors punished disappointing updates. With markets still within sight of their record levels and company valuations so high, any company falling short of expectations has tended to suffer an immediate sell-off of its shares.",

      "bodyText": "The US economy recorded a sharp fall in job creation in August, raising questions over whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year. Economists had expected the US to add about 180,000 jobs over the month. But the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a marked slowdown on the previous month, with a rise of 156,000 jobs. The figure for July was revised down to 189,000 from an initial 209,000, while for June number was reduced from 231,000 to 210,000, compounding the weaker picture. The figures made for disappointing reading for Donald Trump, who hasput jobs and wage growth among the top priorities for his administration. There was a modest rise in the unemployment rate from 4.3% to 4.4%, as the number of unemployed people in the US economy stood at 7.1 million. Average hourly earnings rose by 3c to $26.39 (\u00a320.34), after rising by 9c in July. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 65c, or 2.5%. The August jobs report showed the rate of growth in US employment to be below the average of 176,000 per month so far this year \u2013 the average gain in 2016 was 187,000. The services sector had the weakest growth, as employment increased by only 95,000, little more than half the size of gains made in recent months. The August report, however, may have included statistical anomalies that will be ironed out in future. The data will probably be revised a couple of times and may end up showing a brighter picture, according to Ian Shepherdson, founder of research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cWe expect a rebound in September,\u201d he added. While the figures for last month were disappointing, there is potential for an even weaker outlook for the US economy, should damage from Tropical Storm Harvey continue to linger. The Department of Labor said there was \u201cno discernible effect on the employment and unemployment\u201d rate from the storm last month because the survey was compiled before it hit. While it could still be too early to do a full damage assessment, Harvey has the potential to have a negative effect on the US economy in the third quarter. The storm means there will be zero economic output in the affected states of Texas and Louisiana, which could hurt the wider economy. With a weaker outlook for employment, the August jobs report adds an additional problem for the Federal Reserve to consider as it weighs a further interest rate rise before the end of the year. There are still some expectations for an increase in December, although a slowing jobs market, the fallout from Harvey and low levels of inflation could build a case for maintaing the status quo. Dennis de Jong, managing director at currency trading firm UFX, said: \u201cA stronger than expected reading would have made that almost a certainty, now it\u2019s very much up in the air.\u201d Investors have been looking for a better sense of the next Fed policy move by it chair, Janet Yellen, who gave away few clues last month at a meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. There are further potential pitfalls ahead, as Washington faces a showdown over the debt ceiling, a statutory limit on how much money the US can borrow that can only be increased by Congress, which could rattle markets, and delay action by the Fed.",

      "bodyText": "Production at US factories in August grew at the weakest rate since June 2016 according to the latest manufacturing PMI report from IHS Markit. The headline index slipped to 52.8 in August, from 53.3 in July (where anything above 50 signals growth). Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: Although still above the 50 \u2018no change\u2019 level, the decline in the PMI shows signs of a renewed stuttering of the manufacturing economy during August. The latest reading indicates one of the weakest improvements in the overall health of the sector seen over the past year, and translates into disappointing signals for comparable official data. The survey brings more encouraging signs of improved domestic demand, however, with orders for both consumer goods and investment goods such as plant and machinery on the rise, boding well for the wider economy to continue to expand as we move through the second half of 2017. And on that note, we\u2019ll close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. AM The opening bell has been rung on Wall Street and here is how it looks: Dow Jones: +0.2% at 21,984 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,476 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 6,444 European markets have also stayed in positive territory, although the FTSE 100 is now up just 7 points or 0.1% at 7,437. The dollar has broadly recovered after a sharp fall immediately after the weak non-farm payrolls report was published. The dollar index is down just 0.1% now, but the pound has held on to its gains against the US currency at $1.2987. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital: The US dollar was driven down and then snapped back to trade almost flat after a weaker-than-expected jobs report left traders searching for direction. Although a miss it looks like this print isn\u2019t doing anything to alter projections for what the Federal Reserve will do later this month or for the rest of the year. The labour market remains in fine health, wage growth is AWOL and inflation lacklustre \u2013 nothing has changed today. One swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer and one August jobs miss doesn\u2019t make for a weakening labour market. Markets have already decided the Fed probably won\u2019t hike again this year. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, takes the view that the weak jobs report will make the Fed more reluctant to raise interest rates again before the end of the year. If Federal Reserve policy makers were already starting to question the need for another rate hike this year \u2013 and the pace thereafter \u2013 then this week\u2019s data won\u2019t have made them feel any more comfortable. Anyone hoping for a signal this month that the Fed is on track for another rate hike this year may well be disappointed. The downward revision to July\u2019s non-farm payrolls number was the icing on the cake. It\u2019s worth noting that while the numbers are disappointing, the labor market is still performing very well, but when inflation data is lacking, the Fed is relying on the employment data to justify more rate hikes. The jobs report will be seen as a blow to Fed chances of another rate hike this year, as well as to Donald Trump who I\u2019m sure would have loved nothing more than a reason to post something positive on Twitter. I feel this month\u2019s report may not make the Twitter cut. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says that while the non-farm payrolls report was gloomy, it wasn\u2019t bad enough to have an impact on the Fed\u2019s rate decisions. August\u2019s employment report was disappointing across the board but, given the potential seasonal problems \u2013 with weak initial readings in August subsequently revised higher in previous years \u2013 it isn\u2019t going to have any meaningful impact on the Fed. With the survey evidence still strong and third-quarter economic growth on course for another decent gain after the second, there is no reason to believe that the modest drop-off in employment growth is the start of a more serious downturn. Nevertheless, since the September figures could be affected by Hurricane Harvey, the Fed might be waiting until the October data are released in early November before confirming that the labour market remains in good health. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of other major currencies, is down 0.5% following the weak payrolls report from the Labor Department. The dollar\u2019s loss is the pound\u2019s gain, with sterling now up 0.4% at $1.2986. The detail of the non-farm payrolls report showed a surprise uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.4% in August, from 4.3% in July. Earnings growth was unchanged at 2.5%, disappointing expectations of a pick-up to 2.6%. Breaking: US non-farm payrolls have come in well below expectations, with 156,000 jobs added in August. The consensus among economists was 180,000 jobs. The number for July was also revised down to 189,000 from 209,000 previously. More soon... Over in Greece, the government said the economy is finally moving on from the crisis, after a second consecutive quarter of growth between April and June. A statement released by the office of prime minister Alexis Tsipras said: Without any doubt the Greek economy has turned a page. We are continuing our efforts for just growth, one in which workers ate protected, and building a new productive model. The leftist-led coalition added that even at the height of tortuous negotiations to unlock emergency funding from creditors and keep debt-stricken Greece afloat, the economy exhibited signs of \u201cdynamic recovery.\u201d Opposition parties contend that because of bungled negotiations under former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, the punishing \u20ac86bn bailout package Athens was forced to sign up to - in the form of a third rescue - was much harsher than necessary. Time for a look again at European markets, which have extended gains this afternoon ahead of the US non-farm payrolls at 13.30. FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,456 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.9% at 12,165 France\u2019s CAC: +1% at 5,134 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 21,841 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.6% at 10,356 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 376 Some positive news on Greece\u2019s economy, which grew for a second successive quarter between April and June. GDP grew by 0.5% in the second quarter, maintaining the pace of first-quarter growth. Annual growth picked up to 0.8% from 0.4%. The main driver of growth in the second quarter was exports, which increased by 3.8%. The pound is roughly stable today against both the dollar and the euro, at $1.2926 and \u20ac1.0847 respectively. But Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says the pound is in for a tough time as uncertainty grows: Sterling has had a rough month, particularly against the euro. A big part of that has been driven by euro strength ... There\u2019s also the fact that recent data suggests the Brexit chickens may finally be coming home to roost for the economy, with lukewarm consumer spending and flat business investment. It all adds up to a lot of uncertainty, which of course translates to rich pickings for sterling bears. Politics and growth remain the two key considerations for the rest of the year. How quickly Brexit negotiations move from divorce terms to the future relationship between the EU and UK stands out as a key issue, as delays risk further dents to business investment. High frequency data, especially retail sales, will also be worth picking apart with a fine-tooth comb as the last couple of months have shown some recovery, but real wages remain in contraction and it\u2019s unclear how consumers will respond. Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital, says the US non-farm payrolls number would have to come in a lot higher than expected to give the dollar a major boost. (Economists are forecasting a headline figure of 180,000 jobs.) It will require a big beat on the headline jobs number today for the dollar to get another leg up from these levels. With EURUSD holding below 1.19 and USJPY above 110 there does not much scope to the upside unless the non-farm payrolls (NFP) over deliver in a big way. The dollar was looking a touch oversold but has found its feet \u2013 it just needs some more direction but the NFP will only provide that if it\u2019s significantly stronger than expected or undershoots. On hopes for the NFP, it\u2019s all about whether this print is strong enough to get the market talking up another hike this year, which is currently a 1-in-3 chance right now. Shares in drugs group Indivior are down almost 40% after it lost a US patent ruling that could pave the way for the launch of rivals to its Suboxone Film heroin substitute. The shares plunge made it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 and wiped more than \u00a31bn off the value of the company. Read our full story here: Italy\u2019s economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter, the national statistics bureau ISTAT confirmed. It matched first-quarter growth and left the annual growth rate for Q2 unchanged at 1.5%. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturing trade body, EEF, says that the UK PMI suggests the sector is in store for a better second half of the year. Today\u2019s data confirm that UK manufacturers are looking beyond the Brexit negotiations to strengthening market opportunities in Europe and beyond, with the acceleration in manufacturing activity in August helping to provide some welcome offset to sluggish consumer demand at home. The raft of decent survey data from the sector suggest manufacturing output growth should look better in the second half of this year than it did in the first, but longer term the continued robustness of demand in the rest of the world and the right investment decisions at home to capitalise on it will be key to sustaining this picture. The UK manufacturing PMI hit a four-month high in August. Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says that while the survey signals strong growth, manufacturers remain cautious about the outlook. The pickup in the PMI brings tentative hope that the recent decline in the official manufacturing output data will be reversed swiftly. The manufacturing sector, however, should be doing even better, given sterling\u2019s huge depreciation and the emergence of a strong recovery in the eurozone. Indeed, the U.K.\u2019s PMI remained below the eurozone\u2019s for the fourth consecutive month. In addition, manufacturers\u2019 optimism regarding future production growth only edged up in August to its five-year average, suggesting that they will invest only cautiously in extra capacity. Britain\u2019s factories were going full steam ahead in August according to the IHS Markit UK manufacturing PMI. The headline index combining factory output, orders and employment, rose to a four-month high of 56.9, from 55.3 in July. It comfortably beat economists\u2019 expectations of 55. Demand was chiefly driven by domestic customers, but customers also reported new export orders from mainland Europe, the US, China and Australia. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector was performing well despite Brexit uncertainty: The key question is whether this positive start to the second half of the year can be sustained. This is looking increasingly likely during the near-term, given the breadth of the expansion. At the moment, the survey data suggest that the manufacturing economy remains in good health despite Brexit uncertainty, and should help support on-going growth in the economy in the third quarter, which will add fuel to hawkish policymakers\u2019 calls for higher interest rates. Eurozone factories enjoyed strong demand in August, with output growing at a faster pace than in July. The headline index on the IHS Markit manufacturing PMI rose to 57.4, from 56.6 in July (any number above 50 indicates growth). Domestic and export orders were both strong, and expansion was led by Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria. Here is how individual countries performed: Austria: 61.1 (78-month high) Netherlands: 59.7 (78-month high) Germany: 59.3 (2-month high) Italy: 56.3 (78-month high) Ireland: 56.1 (25-month high) France: 55.8 (76-month high) Spain: 52.4 (11-month low) Greece: 52.2 (108-month high) Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the August survey suggested a positive start to the third quarter for the eurozone economy. The eurozone\u2019s impressive manufacturing upturn regained momentum in August, with a summer surge in factory activity suggesting rising goods production will support another strong GDP reading in the third quarter. The survey indicates that euro area manufacturing output is growing at an annual rate of approximately 4%. Producers across the region are benefitting from rising domestic demand as economic recoveries gain momentum, as well as surging export sales. The FTSE 100 is up 15 points this morning, as major markets across Europe rise for a third day. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,446 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 12,090 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 5,118 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 21,750 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,336 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 375 China\u2019s August Caixin manufacturing PMI has come in ahead of expectations, picking up to 51.6 from 51.1 in July (where anything above 50 signals growth). It supports the official PMI survey published on Thursday, which also signalled stronger-than-expected growth in China\u2019s factories. However Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, says it\u2019s not all good news for the world\u2019s second largest economy: Stronger manufacturing PMI readings for August suggest that industrial output remains resilient. However, momentum elsewhere in the economy has weakened. We suspect that it is speculation over future capacity cuts that has pushed up metal prices and industrial production, rather than stronger underlying demand. Indeed, investment growth has cooled recently and we anticipate a further slowdown as the impact of tighter monetary conditions continue to feed through. If we are right, then the current strength of industrial activity can\u2019t be sustained for long. Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC, says that it would be wrong to place too much emphasis on the strong ADP jobs report from earlier in the week. US August payrolls dominate the day ahead. Expectations are probably for a firmer reading than the published consensus of a 180K increase after the ADP survey, though we would note that the ADP survey has a very patchy track record and does not consistently improve the accuracy of consensus forecasts. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s that time again: non-farm payrolls day. At 13.30 BST we will get the August report on employment and wages, giving the latest snapshot of how well the US jobs market and wider economy are doing. The official consensus among economists is for a 180,000 increase in jobs, following a 209,000 rise in July. Wage growth is expected to edge up to 2.6% from 2.5% previously. However, a stronger-than-expected ADP jobs report earlier in the week is raising speculation the payrolls report could surprise on the upside. If that was the case, investors would be more willing to bet that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again before the end of the year. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson: A decent payrolls number today would be the icing on the cake in a week that has seen some positive signs that the US economy may be in better shape that was previously thought prior to Jackson Hole. Today\u2019s US employment report is expected to see 180k jobs added in August, down from July\u2019s 209k, however this week\u2019s bumper ADP report has seen some estimates for today revised higher. Of more importance will be how strong the wages numbers come in, given an unemployment rate of 4.3%. Annual hourly wage growth is currently 2.5%, a little on the weak side for an economy supposedly at full employment so a strong number here could increase the odds of another rate rise this year, most likely in December. Of course a stronger report is not a foregone conclusion: The other major focus of the day will be manufacturing PMIs from the eurozone and UK, providing the latest clues on the health of those economies: 09.00 BST Eurozone manufacturing PMI (August) 09.00 BST Italian GDP, final estimate (Q2) 09.30 BST UK manufacturing PMI (August)",

If that was the case, investors would be more willing to bet that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again before the end of the year.<br></p> <p><strong>CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> A decent payrolls number today would be the icing on the cake in a week that has seen some positive signs that the US economy may be in better shape that was previously thought prior to Jackson Hole.</p> <p>Today\u2019s US employment report is expected to see 180k jobs added in August, down from July\u2019s 209k, however this week\u2019s bumper ADP report has seen some estimates for today revised higher. </p> <p>Of more importance will be how strong the wages numbers come in, given an unemployment rate of 4.3%. Annual hourly wage growth is currently 2.5%, a little on the weak side for an economy supposedly at full employment so a strong number here could increase the odds of another rate rise this year, most likely in December. </p> </blockquote> <p>Of course a stronger report is not a foregone conclusion:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FxLiveTradingUK/status/903508675658166274\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In 16 of the past 20 years, August non-farm payrolls has been below the consensus.<br><br>The Fed is\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/ifyGFWN9US\">https://t.co/ifyGFWN9US</a></p>&mdash; Forex Live (@FxLiveTradingUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FxLiveTradingUK/status/903508675658166274\">September 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The other major focus of the day will be <strong>manufacturing PMIs from the eurozone and UK</strong>, providing the latest clues on the health of those economies:</p> <ul> <li>09.00 BST Eurozone manufacturing PMI (August)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>09.00 BST Italian GDP, final estimate (Q2)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>09.30 BST UK manufacturing PMI (August)</li> </ul> </div>   </div>",

The tech company plans to invest $1bn on original TV programming over the next year and is reportedly in discussions with the Culver Studios, close to the Culver City offices of Beats, which it acquired from co-founders Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine for $3bn two years ago. The studio, which has been owned by RKO, Howard Hughes and Cecil B DeMille, has more than a dozen soundstages for TV and film work. However, Apple is mainly looking for office space, according to the Financial Times. Moving the management of its original content division to such a status symbol location would mark Apple\u2019s latest signal that it is to ramp up its challenge to streaming giants Netflix and Amazon as well as traditional TV broadcasters. Apple made no comment on the talks and Culver Studios was unavailable for comment at the time of publication. In June, Apple recruited Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg from Sony as its new TV chiefs. The pair have been responsible for striking a \u00a3100m co-production deal with Netflix to make The Crown, and have overseen production of hit shows including Breaking Bad and The Black List. Apple has so far only dipped its toe in original programming, striking a deal to spin James Corden\u2019s popular Carpool Karaoke segment from his late night TV show in the US into a 16-episode series featuring stars such as Will Smith. There was also Planet of the Apps \u2013 a sort of Dragon\u2019s Den featuring Gwyneth Paltrow, will.i.am, Jessica Alba and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk on a panel that sees app developers competing for funding \u2013 which Apple Music made available in June. In development are documentaries about Sean \u201cP Diddy\u201d Combs and Clive Davis, as well as a six-part series on Dr Dre. Given Apple\u2019s huge resources \u2013 it has a stock value of $815bn, almost twice Jeff Bezos\u2019s Amazon ($474bn), five times Disney ($168bn), and more than 10 times Netflix ($77bn) \u2013 its intent to enter original programming makes it a serious new player in the TV market. Netflix has committed $6.6bn to buying and creating TV programmes and it makes about 1,000 hours of its owns shows annually; HBO, the Game of Thrones and Sopranos maker, spends about $2bn a year. Amazon, which paid up to \u00a3150m to lure former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, is estimated to spend about $4.5bn annually on its Prime Video service.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s second-largest doorstep lender has recorded a big increase in lending after poaching customers and agents from rival Provident Financial. Morses Club, which offers cash loans from \u00a3100 to \u00a31,000 to people in financial difficulty, said its gross loan book had grown 12% in the six months to the end of August. Customer numbers were also up by 12% to 233,000. Total credit issued increased by 25% to \u00a382.2m. Its chief executive, Paul Smith, said the firm had \u201ccapitalised on market conditions\u201d and that its growth was based on \u201clistening to our customers and adapting to their needs\u201d. He added: \u201cThe growth we had planned was just accelerated by Provident\u2019s current position, rather than caused by its position.\u201d Provident, the UK\u2019s biggest doorstep lender with 800,000 customers, lost two-thirds of its stock market value last Tuesday when it issued a second profit warning in two months, parted company with its chief executive and cancelled a dividend for shareholders. Analysts blamed a botched attempt to overhaul its 130-year-old business model by replacing its army of part-time self-employed agents, who managed their own schedules, with full-time staff on the company\u2019s payroll. Problems with new software used to arrange home visits meant the new \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d were sent to the wrong addresses or at the wrong time, and were unable to make sales or collect payments. Unlike Provident, Morses has been increasing its force of self-employed agents, adding another 400 since March. Most of them have come from its bigger rival, attracted by a guaranteed commission in the first year. This takes its total to about 2,300. Smith said: \u201cWe subsidise agents so they don\u2019t feel pressured to sell where it would not be appropriate.\u201d He said Morses was attracting more customers, rather than lending larger amounts \u2013 the average balance has fallen from about \u00a3480 three years ago when he became chief executive to \u00a3450 today. Household finances in the UK have been squeezed by rising inflation and stagnating wages. Smith said people still mainly borrow for special events such as Christmas, Easter and summer breaks. On a typical loan of \u00a3200 repayable over 20 weeks, people pay \u00a315 per week to Morses, so end up paying \u00a3300 in total. Morses has a fixed interest rate of 50% on a 20-week loan, 65% on a 33-week loan and 82% on a 52-week loan. Doorstep lenders cater for about 1.8 million people who borrow regularly, out of a total of 10 million who have poor or incomplete credit histories. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cMore evidence of the botched revamp at Provident Financial \u2013 rival Morses Club is stealing business hand over fist \u2026 This is more evidence that the idea to change a business model that\u2019s worked perfectly well for 130 years was not so clever.\u201d Morses looks poised for more growth after expanding its existing loan facility by \u00a315m to \u00a340m to fund expansion, he said. \u201cThis new loan facility is expected to deliver 400 new agent territories over this financial year \u2013 the troubles at Provident mean it may require a bit more.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK manufacturing beats forecasts with strong growth in August", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers increased production at the fastest pace in seven months in August, taking on more workers to keep up with strong domestic and international demand. The closely watched Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI barometer of factory sentiment showed activity jumped to 56.9 last month from 55.3 in July, the second-highest level in more than three years, helped by the weak value of the pound. That confounded forecasts for a modest slowdown to 55.0 in a Reuters poll of economists and was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The weak pound, having plunged after the Brexit vote, was reported to have increased competitiveness for British products. The domestic market, however, was the prime source of contract wins for the manufacturing sector, despite robust demand from mainland Europe, the US, China and Australia. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF, said: \u201cUK manufacturers are looking beyond the Brexit negotiations to strengthening market opportunities in Europe and beyond, with the acceleration in manufacturing activity in August helping to provide some welcome offset to sluggish consumer demand at home.\u201d The jump in production was underpinned by faster intakes of new work, which filtered through to the labour market as the number of jobs grew for the 13th straight month. However, almost 31% of companies said they experienced an increase in the price of materials required for their operations, generally linked to the rising cost of commodities. Despite the strong performance in August, there may be trouble brewing. The survey of more than 600 industrial companies found higher raw materials and staff shortages could lie ahead, which would hit the pace of production in future and lead to higher costs. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: \u201cAt the moment, the survey data suggests the manufacturing economy remains in good health despite Brexit uncertainty, and should help support ongoing growth in the economy in the third quarter.\u201d The survey provides a snapshot of the UK economy before official figures are released later in the year, meaning the expectations for faster growth may fail to materialise. Manufacturing contracted by 0.6% in the three months to June, despite the PMI data pointing to an expansion of about 0.5%, according to Andrew Wishart, an assistant economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. The survey results \u201cadd weight to our view that the sector will put a disappointing first half to the year behind it\u201d, he said. \u201cWe expect the manufacturing sector to help overall GDP growth to accelerate in the second half of 2017.\u201d The upbeat survey could give credence to policymakers calling for the Bank of England to raise interest rates to offset higher inflation, arguing the economy is now strong enough to handle tighter monetary conditions. Michael Saunders, one of the two dissenting Bank of England rate-setters to vote for a rise last month, made another call for an increase in a speech in Cardiff on Thursday. The manufacturing figures reflect activity in a sector that contributes about 10% to GDP, although uncertainties remain in other areas. Consumer spending is under pressure as higher prices and weaker wage growth squeeze their purchasing power. Caution has been recorded among businesses considering investments in the British economy amid political and Brexit uncertainties. The improved picture for manufacturers was also mirrored in Europe, even though a steep climb for the euro has eroded competitiveness on the continent. Production in the eurozone accelerated in August, as manufacturers recorded the fastest rise in export orders since February 2011, according to separate figures on Friday. IHS Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI for the eurozone rose to 57.4 in August, up from 56.6 in July. Those levels of productivity should indicate \u201csolid support\u201d for the eurozone in the third quarter, according to Claus Vistesen at research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. The stronger picture on the continent could encourage the European Central Bank to begin cutting its \u20ac2.3tn (\u00a32.11tn) bond buying programme. Mario Draghi, the ECB president, could take such steps at a key meeting later this month.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s manufacturers increased production at the fastest pace in seven months in August, taking on more workers to keep up with strong domestic and international demand. </p> <p>The closely watched <a href=\"https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/ed7a5218709a47c4b613d069d0c196cf\">Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI</a> barometer of factory sentiment showed activity jumped to 56.9 last month from 55.3 in July, the second-highest level in more than three years, helped by the weak value of the pound. </p> <p>That confounded forecasts for a modest slowdown to 55.0 in a Reuters poll of economists and was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. </p> <p>The weak pound, having plunged after the Brexit vote, was reported to have increased competitiveness for British products. The domestic market, however, was the prime source of contract wins for the manufacturing sector, despite robust demand from mainland Europe, the US, China and Australia. </p> <p>Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF, said: \u201cUK manufacturers are looking beyond the Brexit negotiations to strengthening market opportunities in Europe and beyond, with the acceleration in manufacturing activity in August helping to provide some welcome offset to sluggish consumer demand at home.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/29/lack-of-skilled-eu-workers-could-choke-uk-growth-post-brexit-say-manufacturers\">Lack of skilled EU workers 'could choke UK growth post-Brexit'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The jump in production was underpinned by faster intakes of new work, which filtered through to the labour market as the number of jobs grew for the 13th straight month. However, almost 31% of companies said they experienced an increase in the price of materials required for their operations, generally linked to the rising cost of commodities. </p> <p>Despite the strong performance in August, there may be trouble brewing. The survey of more than 600 industrial companies found higher raw materials and staff shortages could lie ahead, which would hit the pace of production in future and lead to higher costs. </p> <p>Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: \u201cAt the moment, the survey data suggests the manufacturing economy remains in good health despite Brexit uncertainty, and should help support ongoing growth in the economy in the third quarter.\u201d</p> <p>The survey provides a snapshot of the UK economy before official figures are released later in the year, meaning the expectations for faster growth may fail to materialise. </p> <p>Manufacturing contracted by 0.6% in the three months to June, despite the PMI data pointing to an expansion of about 0.5%, according to Andrew Wishart, an assistant economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The survey results \u201cadd weight to our view that the sector will put a disappointing first half to the year behind it\u201d, he said. \u201cWe expect the manufacturing sector to help overall GDP growth to accelerate in the second half of 2017.\u201d</p> <p>The upbeat survey could give credence to policymakers calling for the Bank of England to raise interest rates to offset higher inflation, arguing the economy is now strong enough to handle tighter monetary conditions. <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Pages/people/biographies/saunders.aspx\">Michael Saunders</a>, one of the two dissenting Bank of England rate-setters to vote for a rise last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/31/bank-of-england-interest-rate-rise-brexit-michael-saunders\">made another call for an increase in a speech in Cardiff on Thursday. </a></p> <p>The manufacturing figures reflect activity in a sector that contributes about 10% to GDP, although uncertainties remain in other areas. Consumer spending is under pressure as higher prices and weaker wage growth squeeze their purchasing power. Caution has been recorded among businesses considering investments in the British economy amid political and Brexit uncertainties. </p> <p>The improved picture for manufacturers was also mirrored in Europe, even though a steep climb for the euro has eroded competitiveness on the continent. Production in the eurozone accelerated in August, as manufacturers recorded the fastest rise in export orders since February 2011, according to separate figures on Friday. </p> <p>IHS Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI for the eurozone rose to 57.4 in August, up from 56.6 in July. Those levels of productivity should indicate \u201csolid support\u201d for the eurozone in the third quarter, according to Claus Vistesen at research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. </p> <p>The stronger picture on the continent could encourage the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank\">European Central Bank </a>to begin cutting its \u20ac2.3tn (\u00a32.11tn) bond buying programme. Mario Draghi, the ECB president, could take such steps at a key meeting later this month. </p>",
