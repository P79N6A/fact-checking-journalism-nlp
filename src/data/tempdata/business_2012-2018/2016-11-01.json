      "bodyText": "Inquiries into the banking sector have arrived at a rate of about one a year for the past couple of decades, but has any been as feeble as this summer\u2019s offering from the Competition and Markets Authority? That was the one that concluded that a few tweaks, like better price comparison websites and a voluntary cap on overdraft charges, might succeed where stiffer remedies had failed in the past to boost competition. Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, who knows a thing or two about banking inquiries (he\u2019s conducted a couple himself), is not the only person to think the CMA \u201cdropped the catch\u201d, as he put it. But Tuesday\u2019s questioning-cum-torture of Alasdair Smith, who chaired the CMA\u2019s investigation, was exquisitely done. As he waved a copy of Smith\u2019s latest attempt to combat the criticism, Tyrie turned his headmasterly scorn to maximum: \u201cThis speech has an air of complacency greater than ever I have read from a regulator. It seems to say \u2018don\u2019t worry, let time go by, let\u2019s build on existing practices, let\u2019s use behavioural remedies of an incremental nature and we\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\u201d Yes, that\u2019s a fair summary. The only possible defence of the CMA is that structural remedies \u2013 like reversing the 2008 merger of Lloyds and HBOS \u2013 attract little political support. Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, has made the job of splitting off 300 branches resemble the labours of Hercules. Even so, the CMA could have been far bolder. The shame, as Tyrie argued, is that regulators have rarely had such an opportunity to improve the lot of banking customers. After the crash and scandals, the balance of power shifted away from the corporate lobbyists. The next inquiry \u2013 and there\u2019s always another \u2013 can\u2019t come soon enough. Shell dividend still hostage to the oil price Here\u2019s a group of winners from Brexit: those Shell shareholders who elect to receive their dividends in sterling. The oil giant, operating in an industry that runs on dollars, has kept its quarterly dividend unchanged all year at 47 cents a share but, after sterling\u2019s fall, the progress looks much better in pennies: 32.9p in the first quarter, 35.3p in the second and, at current exchange rates, 38.4p for the third. That\u2019s a handy improvement. It is also, however, a sideshow to the main event. Can Shell, after consuming BG Group at the start of the year, afford to sustain its dividend at such levels, in any currency? We\u2019re not talking small change. With BG on board, the Shell dividend costs $15bn a year to maintain, which is a reason why many investors were sceptical about the \u00a335bn purchase. Some 17% of shareholders voted against the deal, which counts as serious dissent. Shell executive Ben van Beurden has won round one. His gamble is looking better than it did in January. The price of a barrel of Brent has improved from $32 to $48, allowing Shell to boast that, unlike many rivals, it did not pay dividends out of debt in the latest quarter. Meanwhile, the company is doing its best to demonstrate that, just as it told the doubters, it can duck and dive. Another few billions have been hacked out of next year\u2019s spending budget. Jolly good. But here\u2019s why van Beurden, who staked his reputation on the BG deal, can\u2019t relax yet. Debt is a colossal $78bn and financial gearing, at 29.2%, is bumping up against Shell\u2019s self-imposed ceiling of 30%. Some $30bn-worth of assets are due to be sold, but talk of disposals is not the same as cold cash. In short, the dividend still looks hostage to the oil price. If a barrel costs $60 a barrel in a year\u2019s time, Shell is out of the woods. But another year of sub-$50 prices would test the company\u2019s ability to keep investors sweet while investing for the future. There is no point trying to predict the oil price but we can say this much: the shares looked a decent bet at \u00a313 in January, as said here at the time, but today\u2019s \u00a322 looks too much, too soon. That dividend, yielding 7% in sterling terms, is not safe yet. Saying no to Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Lloyds stunt Publicity stunts masquerading as serious petitions to government are a modern irritant. So it is encouraging that only 30,000 people have so far signed Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s attempt to get the government to flog a few Lloyds Banking Group shares to the general public at a discount. Chancellor Philip Hammond sensibly reversed his predecessor\u2019s idea of selling shares at less than their market price. This annoyed Hargreaves, an investment platform, because it had 374,000 potential investors lined up, some of whom could become valuable customers for years. But the commercial self-interest behind the petition was so blatant it was offensive. If nine out of 10 of Hargreaves\u2019s would-be Lloyds punters decline to sign, that\u2019s a good thing.",

      "bodyText": "New polling reveals Australians are concerned about increasing inequality in this country and a majority agree with the proposition that inequality creates societal division. The survey carried out by Essential for the United Voice union found 65% of the sample of 1,008 agreed with the statement \u201cAustralian society has become more unequal over the past few years\u201d. The statement \u201cinequality affects us all because it creates social and economic division\u201d attracted 78% agreement. But Australians are divided over the antidotes to the problem. The survey showed strong support (63%) for a significant increase in the minimum wage. But the majority of the survey rejected the two proposals that could be characterised as wealth taxes. The survey gave the thumbs down to the idea that people\u2019s assets \u2013 such as the family home, or share portfolios \u2013 should be taxed in the same way as incomes are taxed. People also rejected the idea of an inheritance tax, which has been floated by the influential French economist Thomas Piketty. During a tour of Australia, Piketty, the author of Capital in the 21st Century, said Malcolm Turnbull should consider introducing an inheritance tax because Australia was an outlier among developed nations. \u201cJapan just raised its top inheritance tax rate from 45% to 55% last year,\u201d Piketty said in an interview with the ABC. \u201cThis was under a rightwing government by the way and I don\u2019t hear Angela Merkel or I didn\u2019t hear [David] Cameron in Britain say he wanted to reduce the inheritance tax of 40% \u2013 the Australian level of 0%, so [Australia] is very unusual.\u201d But the Piketty proposal attracted only 19% agreement from the Essential survey and 67% disagreement. The split was identical for the idea that assets should be taxed in the same way as income. United Voice has called on the Fair Work Commission to set four-year targets for minimum wage increases as part of a strategy to combat growing inequality. The union proposes a floor in the minimum wage of 60% of median earnings by 2020. It says in recent years minimum wages have failed to keep pace with incomes in the economy more generally. \u201cAs this has happened, inequality has risen and the incidence of low-paid work has increased,\u201d United Voice says in its submission. The union says if \u201cthe gap between minimum and average wages continues its growth trend (noting the modest reversal in the few years), then earnings inequality and prevalence of low pay are also likely to continue to rise\u201d. \u201cIf this occurs, Australia will increasingly come to resemble other OECD countries with less egalitarian income distributions.\u201d In recent times, both the prime minister and his departmental head, Martin Parkinson, have raised redistributive policies as part of rebuilding community consensus for globalisation, open markets and trade liberalisation at a time when people perceive that several decades of economic reform have not resulted in an equitable distribution of benefits. In the lead up to the G20 meeting in Hangzhou, Turnbull said world leaders had to make the case for the benefits of trade liberalisation but they also had to ensure that the benefits of open economies were distributed fairly. In a recent speech to the Lowy Institute, Parkinson said the government needed to consider \u201credistributive\u201d policies as part of rebuilding public consensus for open economies in an atmosphere of rising protectionism.",

      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has been accused of complacency and missing an opportunity to overhaul high street banking, including capping overdraft charges, despite a two-year long investigation. The accusations were levelled at Alasdair Smith, who led the investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), by MPs on the Treasury select committee who were questioning him following the publication of the report in August. In a gruelling evidence session, MPs questioned why Smith \u2013 flanked by two members of his team \u2013 had not put a cap on overdraft charges and taken more radical measures to break the stranglehold on the current-account market held by the \u201cbig four\u201d of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the CMA had \u201cdropped the catch\u201d despite support from politicians, academics, consumer groups and the media for a tougher stance towards the banking sector. \u201cThe banking crash has changed the terms of trade in favour of the regulators with respect to reform,\u201d said Tyrie. The Labour MP Rachel Reeves said that the cost of an unauthorised overdraft was greater than a payday loan, where the charges have been capped. Reeves, who is arguing overdraft fees should be restricted, said vulnerable consumers were being let down. \u201cIt\u2019s dereliction of duty,\u201d said Reeves. The CMA report stopped short of recommending overdraft caps and said that banks should set out a monthly maximum charge for unauthorised overdrafts, from which the industry generates \u00a31.2bn in fees annually. It recommended that the Financial Conduct Authority should examine this area. Smith argues that a new technology allowing consumers to compare the personal data, known as Midata, will shake up banking. Tyrie said no other CMA report had ever received such \u201cunequivocal condemnation\u201d but Smith said he was confident the recommendations would transform banking in three or four years. \u201cOnly history will prove which one of us is right,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI am confident that the work of our group will result in a major change for the better and that when people look back at the CMA report of 2016 they will see it as a landmark that really changed the direction that this market has gone in,\u201d said Smith, who also insisted that banks were not making excess profits. Smith said after the hearing that the CMA was introducing 17 \u201chard hitting\u201d changes. \u201cWe will also help customers avoid unauthorised overdraft charges by requiring banks to text customers when they are at risk of incurring charges and give them a grace period in which to take action,\u201d said Smith. The CMA investigation was first announced in July 2014 at a time when the Labour party was promising to create new banks. At the end of the three-hour evidence session, Tyrie said: \u201cThe committee was deeply disappointed by what it heard.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Pound could fall to $1.15 as City accepts reality of Brexit, says BAML \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound may indeed fall to $1.15 as Bank of America Merrill Lynch has suggested, but at the moment it is holding fairly steady against the US currency. Sterling is currently down just 0.07% at $1.2234, but this is mainly thanks to dollar weakness due to renewed uncertainty surrounding the US election, not to mention Wednesday\u2019s interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital, said: A poll from ABC that gave Trump a slender lead over Clinton has been the catalyst for some fairly significant risk-off moves...Given how far ahead in the polls Clinton was very recently, the fact that we\u2019re talking about a close race again is clearly rattling investors. Suffice to say we can expect more volatility in the coming week. Against the euro the pound is not faring so well, down 0,77% at \u20ac1.1064. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s some gloom from pro-Brexit fund manager Crispin Odey, who has told investors the UK could face recession and the stock market could slump by 80%. Bloomberg reported: Crispin Odey, whose main hedge fund has lost about 43 percent this year, says U.K. stocks could slump 80 percent as the economy is roiled by a recession and higher inflation following the vote to leave the European Union. Shares will come under pressure after the FTSE 100 share index climbed 30 percent over five years even as earnings fell by 80 percent, the money manager said in a letter to investors last week seen by Bloomberg News... \u201cWe are now destined to have a recession in the U.K. as well as inflation,\u201d Odey wrote. \u201cIt will be difficult for the stock market to remain above all of this.\u201d A host of badly received results - from Standard Chartered to BP to Shire and Pfizer - has helped push markets lower, not to mention renewed uncertainty over the US election. A poll showing Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton ahead of next week\u2019s votes has unnerved investors while mixed US figures - good manufacturing, poor construction - just added to the downbeat mood. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Despite two attempts at a rally today, the FTSE 100 remains in the red... European markets have had it far worse, with the Dax losing over 1% today, with euro strength helping to take the shine off markets on the continent that have enjoyed a recent spate of outperformance compared to London... With US markets taking a hit this afternoon as well it doesn\u2019t take Sherlock Holmes to work out that the new polls giving Donald Trump an edge in the election are spooking investors. The parallels with Brexit are there for everyone to see, but the key battleground states are still leaning towards the Democrats. In all probability, the election will still turn out as expected, but the market\u2019s nagging doubts are clearly getting the better of it this afternoon. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 37.08 points or 0.53% at 6917.14 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.3% to 10,526.16 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.86% lower at 4470.28 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.32% to 16,898.28 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.12% down at 9040.7 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.47% to 582.45 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 103 points or 0.59%. Meanwhile HSBC analysts say buy gold whoever wins the US election. Bloomberg reports: Although they deem a Donald Trump victory more supportive for the price of the metal than a win by Hillary Clinton, the bank\u2019s Chief Precious Metals Analyst James Steel says it\u2019ll enjoy at least a 8 percent jump whoever wins the race. Both candidates have espoused trade policies that could stimulate demand, with gold offering a potential \u201cprotection against protectionism,\u201d he says. Even the relatively more internationalist Democratic candidate has argued for the renegotiation of longstanding free-trade agreements. That\u2019s positive for gold \u2014 even if \u201cnot on the scale of Mr Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d If the real-estate magnate triumphs, gold could rise to $1,500 an ounce, according to HSBC, up from around $1,289 at 10:55 a.m. in New York. If Clinton wins, the price of the metal could improve to $1,400 an ounce by year end, Steel writes, adding that a Democratic sweep of Congress would further stoke demand for the metal owing to a possible boost in fiscal spending. On gold, Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Weakness in the US dollar and rising uncertainty from Presidential nominee Donald Trump rising in the polls saw gold breakout to a three-week high. The gold price has continued to climb after CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] data showed the first rise in net long positions in four weeks. Gold appears to be being accumulated as a hedge against equity market declines before the US election. In times of uncertainty, gold and silver are seen as havens for investors and so it is proving at the moment, ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rate decision and, crucially, the US presidential election. Gold has climbed from $1276 an ounce to $1288, while silver is up from $17.87 to $18.37. The ISM said the October PMI indicated growth for the 89th consecutive month in the overall US economy, and indicated growth in the manufacturing sector for the second consecutive month. The ISM\u2019s Holcomb said: The past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates that the average PMI for January through October (51 percent) corresponds to a 2.5 percent increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualised basis. In addition, if the PMI for October (51.9 percent) is annualised, it corresponds to a 2.8 percent increase in real GDP annually. Back with the ISM manufacturing report, and here are some of the comments from the respondents to the survey: \u201cDomestic business steady. Export business trending higher.\u201d (Chemical Products) \u201cVery favorable outlook in the market.\u201d (Computer &amp; Electronic Products) \u201cWe are looking at a considerable slowdown for October and November. Production is down 20 percent.\u201d (Primary Metals) \u201cBusiness is much better.\u201d (Fabricated Metal Products) \u201cStrong economy driving steady sales.\u201d (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) \u201cDue to the hurricane and other storms, our business is up significantly.\u201d (Machinery) \u201cOngoing strength seen in 2016 \u2014 it\u2019s a good year.\u201d (Miscellaneous Manufacturing) \u201cCustomers continue to press price reductions.\u201d (Transportation Equipment) \u201cOur business remains strong.\u201d (Plastics &amp; Rubber Products) \u201cHard to predict oil price dynamics, but there seems to be a consensus that the market is stabilizing, at least above USD 50 bbl this month.\u201d (Petroleum &amp; Coal Products) Bradley J. Holcomb, chair of the Institute for Supply Management, said: \u201cComments from the panel are largely positive citing a favorable economy and steady sales, with some exceptions.\u201d But there are some poor US construction figures. The Commerce Department said construction spending fell 0.4% in September, compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise. The figure for August was revised slightly higher, from a 0.7% drop to a 0.5% fall. And the other manufacturing survey does indeed also show signs of improvement. The ISM manufacturing activity index climbed from 51.5 in September to 51.9 last month, better than the 51.7 expected. And on jobs, the picture is more optimistic. The manufacturing employment index jumped from 49.7 in September to 52.9, well ahead of the forecast level of 50. This is the highest level since June 2015. The two manufacturing surveys strike a positive note as the US Federal Reserve begins its latest two day meeting. However it appears unlikely the Fed will announce an interest rate rise tomorrow, just ahead of the election, even if a December hike could well be on the cards. Despite the good US manufacturing performance, firms are reluctant to take on staff, says IHS Markit, partly due to caution ahead of the election. IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said: October saw manufacturing enjoy its best performance for a year. Factories benefitted from rising domestic and export sales, driving output higher to mark an encouragingly strong start to the fourth quarter. The survey also picked up signs of manufacturers and their customers rebuilding their inventories, often filling warehouses in anticipation of stronger demand in coming months. However, a widespread reticence to take on extra staff highlights lingering caution with respect to investing in capacity, at least until after the presidential election. Hiring is also being subdued partly by worries about escalating costs, with the October survey recording the largely monthly rise in factory prices for five years. While output growth is accelerating, so too are inflationary pressures, which will further fuel speculation that the Fed will hike interest rates again in December. And here is the first manufacturing survey, and it\u2019s fairly positive. The final IHS Markit manufacturing PMI figure for October has come in at 53.4, marginally higher than the initial estimate of 53.2 and up on September\u2019s final reading of 51.5. This is the highest level since October 2015. In short order, we get the ISM manufacturing reading, which is also expected to show an improvement. Ahead of two US manufacturing surveys due shortly, the US market is slightly ahead at the open, but with continuing nervousness about the forthcoming election - with one new poll showing Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton - investors remain cautious. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 12 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.2% higher. As a reminder, all three indices recorded their worst monthly performances since January in October. Alert! Bank of America Merrill Lynch has predicted that the pound could plunge to just $1.15 by the first quarter of 2017. In a new research note, analysts at the bank warn that sterling hasn\u2019t fully adjusted to the reality of Brexit, and have slashed their forecasts for the pound. They also predict the pound will weaken to just 94p against the euro, closer to parity. BAML believe some investors are hoping that court cases brought by Remain campaigners will stop Theresa May triggering article 50 without a parliamentary vote. BAML say: Whilst the outcome is still unknown, client feedback suggests to us there is hope that the verdict may derail the governments\u2019 intentions. The decision on the review is pending and is expected soon, but this will not be the end of the matter. In our view, an appeal to the Supreme Court is a possibility by whoever loses the hearing and if the verdict is appealed, this could be held before the end of the year. A defining feature of our conversations with clients since the Referendum is the belief that Brexit may never happen. For this reason, we think some investors retain the hope that somehow the courts will able to prevent the triggering of A50. But.... BAML believe that article 50 WILL be triggered, with or without MPs voting. The result of the Referendum has been accepted by most politicians\u2019 and with seven out of ten Labour constituencies having voted to leave the EU we find it hard to imagine that Labour MP\u2019s would go against that mandate. And that would send the pound down to new 31-year lows early next year, before recovering through the year. We think Q1 could mark the low in the pound. A combination of US dollar weakness, Brexit fatigue and data stabilisation should see pound recover into end-2017. This graph shows how the pound has fallen faster than in many previous sterling crises (and boy, have there been a few over the years), but not as sharply or as far as after Black Wednesday in 1992 (yet anyway) BAML also dub sterling the \u2018British peso\u2019, saying it has been trading like an emerging market currency such as the South African rand (ZAR) or the Turkish lira (TRY) Back in the markets, two pharmaceuticals firms have both disappointed investors with their latest financial results. Shares in Pfizer, the viagra-maker, have slipped by 2.2% in pre-market trading after it missed its profit and sales targets in the last quarter. Reuters explains: Pfizer\u2019s new breast cancer treatment, Ibrance, generated sales of $550 million, missing the consensus forecast of $576 million compiled by Evercore ISI. The company\u2019s Lyrica pain drug brought in sales of $1.05 billion, missing expectation of $1.28 billion, but its Prevnar vaccine generated $1.54 billion, above the forecast of $1.48 billion. Separately, Shire, the London-listed drugs group, has plunged by 5.5% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after posting smaller revenues than the City expected. The company insists, though, that it\u2019s \u2018highly confident\u2019 about Shire\u2019s future growth prospects. The new dry eye disease drug, called Xiidra, has made a very strong start, it adds. Wall Street bank JP Morgan has got Mark Carney\u2019s back. Analysts Malcolm Barr and Allan Monks argue there are five \u2018lines of defence\u2019 against the argument that the Carney, and the rest of the monetary policy committee, violated the Banks independence by being so gloomy about Brexit. The judgements were limited to short run impacts, not the long run. They were shared by the whole of the MPC. They related directly to areas where the BoE had to make policy decisions. Supporting analysis for the views expressed was provided. And those views were in line with the consensus among most private and international institutions. That doesn\u2019t get away from the fact that Britain\u2019s economy expanded by a solid 0.5% in the three months after the refererendum. But still.... In our view, the fact that the economy has held up better than expected thus far reflects a forecasting error that many have made, rather than being clear evidence of any abuse of office. The opposition Labour party have tweeted their support for Mark Carney today: Last night Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, criticised the attacks on the BoE governor from some conservative MPs: \u201cThat a committed public servant like Mr Carney has been the subject of briefings, on and off the record, questioning his fitness for the role - when he himself has no opportunity to respond - is an indictment of the toxic atmosphere now brewing inside the Conservative Party.\u201d Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group is also concerned that UK manufacturers are suffering such a sharp spike in import costs: We don\u2019t want Mark Carney\u2019s ego to expand too quickly, so here\u2019s a rather critical assessment of the governor, from Ben Habib, CEO of First Property Group, a fund manager. The pressure on Mr. Carney to go was portrayed as coming from Tory Brexiters and his decision to stay another year has been described as providing stability during the Brexit process. Both assertions are wrong. \u201cMr. Carney should have resigned early because he is simply not competent. Perhaps the best of example of this was his assessment of the UK economy in August when he launched another wave of pernicious QE. He justified this decision in significant part because of his prediction that the economy would grow by only 0.1% in the third quarter. In fact it grew at five times this rate. His remaining as Governor of the BoE during the Brexit process is going to materially add to the challenges faced by Mrs. May.\u201d Carlo Alberto de Casa, chief analyst at spread-betting firm ActivTrades, also sees Carneys\u2019 decision as positive: \u2018The City has welcomed news that Mark Carney will stay one more year at the helm of the Bank of England. When he eventually leaves the post in summer 2019, the Brexit process should largely be over. Significantly, we have seen the FTSE 100 go up, whilst the pound is also performing well. This appears to reflect a certain amount of relief and reassurance in the City that Carney will be at the controls for a while longer.\u2019 Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money, has told us that she\u2019s pleased Mark Carney chose to stay at the Bank of England until June 2019. Gadhia says Carney showed leadership immediately after the EU referendum, and was right to express his view on Brexit. Thank goodness for that would be my comment. When I think back to 24 June when an awful lot of people wondered who was leading the country I was pretty relieved when Mark Carney stepped up and was sensible. We need stability going forward. How difficult to have a job where we are all able to comment [on Carney\u2019s performance]. When you take on a big role like that you have to be a public figure and expect to have public comment. I don\u2019t criticise people for making the comments they have made. I do think now he is here we should let him get on with his job. Hopefully that will add to the stability of the country.\u201d (via my colleague Sean Farrell) Capital Economics have taken one look at Markit\u2019s survey, and produced this excellent chart showing how UK inflation is heading a lot higher.... Markit\u2019s October manufacturing PMI should deter the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from cutting interest rates again, at its meeting on Thursday. As well as showing that companies are faring quite well, the data also shows how the slump in sterling has painful effects as well as benefits. Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, explains: \u201cThe weaker pound is supporting improving demand from export customers, but price rises from higher import costs are becoming more significant and will be felt in consumer\u2019s pockets sooner rather than later. If any MPC members were on the fence about interest rate moves this month, this latest survey would argue against any further cuts right now. Dave Atkinson, head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, is encouraged by today\u2019s UK factory report. \u201cManufacturing activity remains at its highest level since January, and the fact that firms have maintained a positive outlook amid an uncertain landscape and a devalued pound is something to be applauded. Markit also produced this chart, showing just how sharply import costs have jumped since the Brexit vote: That is likely to feed through to prices in the shops. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says: \u201cThe impact of the pound\u2019s performance against the euro and dollar was particularly felt on imports as manufacturers experienced one of the fastest rises in average costs for raw materials in the 25-year survey history. Especially highlighted were costs for flour, dairy products, steel and zinc. These price hikes resulted in manufacturers passing on higher prices to their customers as charges rose for the sixth consecutive month and to the steepest degree since June 2011. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector is probably returning to growth this quarter, as the weak pound helps factories to win export orders -- but also makes raw materials pricier. The monthly healthcheck from data firm Markit shows that UK factories grew their output last month, with new orders rising and staffing levels picking up too. This pushed Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI to 54.3, down slightly from 55.5 in September, but well above the long-run average of 51.5 (anything over 50 = growth). The survey shows that the slump in the pound since June is helping the manufacturing sector. Bosses reported a rise in new exports, and new orders from the USA, the EU and China. But the weaker currency is also driving up the cost of imports, like oil, energy, metals and pork products. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u201cThe UK manufacturing sector remained on a firm footing in October and should return to growth in the fourth quarter. Despite slowing from September\u2019s highs, growth of output and new orders continued to defy expectations, rising at marked rates and supporting the fastest job creation in a year. \u201cThe main topic of the latest PMI survey was, however, the impact of the sterling depreciation on manufacturers. On the positive side, the boost to competitiveness drove new export order inflows higher, providing a key support to output volumes. The down-side of the weaker currency is becoming increasingly evident, however, with increased import prices leading to one of the steepest rises in purchasing costs in the near 25-year survey history. Around 90% of companies offering a reason for increased costs made some reference to the sterling exchange rate. Eek. Shares in Standard Chartered have just slumped by 5%, after it posting its latest financial results. The Asia-focused bank posted a pre-tax profit of $458m up from a $139m loss a year earlier, but shy of forecasts of $500m profits. Income dipped to $3.47bn, from $3.68bn. CEO Bill Winters doesn\u2019t sound best pleased, saying: \u201cWe now have a stronger balance sheet...but income and profit levels are not yet acceptable.\u201d Standard Chartered also revealed that it is being investigated by Hong Kong regulators, over an IPO (stock market flotation) it handled in 2009. The FT\u2019s Janan Ganesh has handed out a pasting to Mark Carney\u2019s critics in Westminster this morning: The pound is living up to its reputation for volatility, and dropping back from earlier highs. Not every investor is toasting Mark Carney this morning, though. Savvas Savouri, chief economist of asset manager Toscafund, has been criticising the governor on Radio 5\u2019s Wake Up To Money this morning, and on Sky News last night. City veteran David Buik is also relieved that Mark Carney has decided not to leave in 2018: Most observers will be delighted that he did not wait until after the Inflation Report and MPC meeting this coming Thursday, to announce his decision. Many hoped he would stay the full trip until 2021. And in his classic colourful prose, Buik argues that Carney was rather too gloomy about the consequences of EU exit. The reassurance he needed consisted, I think, of some TLC and an official ringing endorsement from Chancellor Philip Hammond to follow up positive comments made by senior government ministers. In terms of Mr Carney\u2019s duty of care post the Referendum, he was right to point out that the UK\u2019s economy might not be as robust immediately prior to the BREXIT and post its withdrawal. However I think he ladled on the \u2018Sodom &amp; Gomorrah\u2019 syndrome far too thickly, which gave the impression that he was massively pro-REMAIN and possibly an acolyte of George Osborne, who, after all appointed him. The pound hit its highest level since 20 October this morning, nudging $1.228. That\u2019s up a cent this week, but still sharply lower than a month ago - when traders started worrying about a hard Brexit. Shares are rising in London this morning, in another sign that Mark Carney\u2019s 12-month extension has reassured the markets. The FTSE 100 has gained 31 points, or 0.44%, to 6985 points. Royal Dutch Shell is leading the way, up 3.7%, after posting an 8% jump in quarterly profits this morning. Mining firms are also gaining ground, after overnight data showed China\u2019s factories growing faster than expected. That should bolster demand for iron ore, coal, copper and nickel. The pound continues to climb, and is now trading at $1.227 - up almost one cent this week. Labour MP John Mann argues that Theresa May, and chancellor Philip Hammond, have botched the whole issue of Mark Carney\u2019s tenure at the BoE. Writing for Politics Home, Mann says the pair have been \u201cdragged kicking and screaming by the markets\u201d to extend the contract of a governor who deserved more respect for his actions after the Brexit vote. Mann says: The day after the referendum saw the Prime Minister resign after previously promising he wouldn\u2019t and the Chancellor disappear as the Treasury went silent at a time when the markets went into a panic. Into this breach stepped Mark Carney, speaking publicly from the Bank of England, who calmly stated the steps the bank had already taken to reassure the market and would be taking to ensure that the UK\u2019s economic system remained functional. It should never have to come to the point where his re-appointment became a such a test of strength for the Prime Minister and Chancellor. Mann also hits out at former Conservative ministers William Hague and Michael Gove for attacking Carney. During 2016 the Bank of England will have to have found two new deputy Governors to replace Andrew Bailey who was appointed to run the FCA by George Osborne, and Dr Minouche Shafik who is leaving her role as head of markets and banking. Their calls for a new Governor to be appointed at a time when the Government is about to start its negotiations with the EU was staggeringly short sighted and suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the challenges facing the British economy. Investors are relieved that Mark Carney won\u2019t quit the UK in 2018, as had initially been his plan. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, says yesterday\u2019s decision to serve an extra year is is \u201ca welcome sign of stability in exceptionally uncertain times\u201d. She writes: The markets are breathing a collective sigh of relief that Carney has extended his term, after all, if he extended it once, could he do so again? The pound has enjoyed a major turnaround, and is the best performing currency in the G10 at the start of this week. It is higher by a decent 0.5% against both the USD and the euro, and has also done well against the yen However, the City would be even happier if the governor had agreed to stay until 2012. An extra year is good, however the uncertainty caused by Brexit makes it very difficult to anticipate the health of the UK economy in three years\u2019 time. Thus, even after today\u2019s announcement, Carney may still leave the Bank of England at a delicate time for the UK economy, as the government tries to navigate a smooth exit from the EU. Mark Carney\u2019s 2019 departure makes the front page of several newspapers today. The Telegraph point out that the governor has decided to quit shortly after Britain\u2019s exit from the EU has been concluded, following a \u201cdeterioration of relations\u201d with Downing Street in recent weeks. The Times also point out that recent criticism from Conservative politicians may have encouraged Carney not to serve three extra years. They write: Mark Carney surprised the government last night by turning down the chance to stay in his post until 2021 after receiving lukewarm backing from Downing Street. The governor of the Bank of England said that he would leave in June 2019 \u2014 the earliest opportunity to depart after Brexit. The Financial Times points out that the governor\u2019s family will return to Canada in the summer of 2018, as originally planned. These personal circumstances (Carney is blessed with four daughters) are the reason he originally only signed up for five years. Carney also graces the front page of the Guardian: The pound got an immediate lift last night when the Bank of England announced that governor Carney would serve an extra year. And it\u2019s still trading around $1.224 this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s economy today, when data firm Markit publishes its latest Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI) covering the manufacturing sector, at 9.30am GMT. Economists are expecting to see that factory output grew at a steady rate in October, with the PMI (which measures activity) dipping to around 55.0 from 55.4 in September. This is the first \u2018soft\u2019 economic data for the fourth quarter of 2016, so it will be scrutinised closely for signs that the Brexit vote is causing a slowdown. RBC Capital Markets say: UK PMIs enjoyed something of a rollercoaster ride in the three months after the Brexit referendum before returning to close to their long-run average at the end of Q3. For today\u2019s manufacturing print, we look for a slight weakening to 55.0 from 55.4, though that is coming off the highest reading for the manufacturing reading since June 2014. We\u2019ll also be watching the Bank of England, after Mark Carney decided to serve one extra year as governor, until 2019. Our financial editor Nils Pratley says the Canadian central banker got one over the prime minister. He writes: You want me to stay for an extra three years? I\u2019ll do one more and then I\u2019m off. Mark Carney\u2019s decision to leave the Bank of England in 2019 looks to be a straightforward snub to Theresa May. Earlier on Monday, the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman described the governor as \u201cabsolutely\u201d the best person for the job, which is the sort of thing you say if you think he\u2019ll do the full eight-year term. But he\u2019s doing six. Yes, it\u2019s one more year than was signalled back at his appointment, but it is not the full deal. Those angry Tory Brexiters who have been making mischief at Carney\u2019s expense for the past month will count this result as a victory for them. And on the corporate front, oil giants BP and Shell are both reporting results this morning, along with Virgin Money, MoneySupermarket.com, and Standard Chartered bank. Pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer are reporting later too.",

On the positive side, the boost to competitiveness drove new export order inflows higher, providing a key support to output volumes.

      "bodyText": "The pharmaceutical company Shire has reported a drop in sales of haemophilia drugs, its biggest source of revenue since the $32bn acquisition of US firm Baxalta was completed in June. The London-listed company\u2019s third-quarter results disappointed the City. Shire shares closed down 2.6% at \u00a345.28, the second day of falls, as investors also worried about the future pricing of haemophilia drugs in the US. On Monday, Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for US companies, said it was looking at ways to manage the rising cost of haemophilia medicines. Hillary Clinton is expected to tackle drug pricing if she wins the US presidential election. The Democratic candidate has repeatedly lambasted high pricing \u2013 describing that of EpiPen, drug firm Mylan\u2019s emergency treatment of anaphylaxis, as \u201coutrageous\u201d and accusing entrepreneur Martin Shkreli of \u201cprice gouging\u201d vital medicines. Shire\u2019s chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov, admitted that firms that managed prescription US drug plans wanted to \u201cmanage a number of categories more tightly\u201d including haemophilia. \u201cWe live in an environment, certainly during a presidential campaign, where price is in high focus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can expect for all our categories, not just haemophilia, tighter management, but we have the programmes in place to make sure this does not affect our patients and has limited impact on our overall business. I remain incredibly confident about the outlook for haemophilia.\u201d \u00d8rnskov said existing patients would not be forced to switch haemophilia medications as this would be considered too risky. The Danish businessman was upbeat about Shire\u2019s new drug for dry eye disease. Launched in August, Xiidra has already taken a 16% market share in the US. The eye drop is expected to generate annual sales of more than $1bn by 2020. Shire said its integration of Illinois-based Baxalta, which specialises in treatments for rare blood conditions, cancer and immune system disorders, was ahead of schedule. Sales of haemophilia medicines, also acquired from Baxalta, fell by 6% to $884m in the three months to 30 September, which Shire blamed on the timing of some large orders. Overall, sales more than doubled to $3.3bn after the acquisition, but this was slightly lower than analysts had expected. Excluding Baxalta, revenues rose 12%. Costs related to the takeover were also higher than Shire expected, partly because it has accelerated some factory closures in the US. Shire is based in Dublin for tax purposes and run from Boston. As announced in the spring, it is pushing ahead with the closure of its Basingstoke office, where 270 people work. The company wants to open an office in the Paddington, London, as its UK commercial base, so it can be \u201ccloser to the heart of life science communities\u201d. There has been speculation that some staff may be moved to Dublin.",

They questioned whether working time would be defined as when the worker was logged into the app and waiting for work or only when they were on a job. They also questioned who would pay the minimum wage if a worker was using several employment apps at the same time. Vaizey was speaking at an event in London on Tuesday about the impact of digital technology on the labour market and urged the government to produce a \u201cdefinition of a new kind of worker in the gig economy\u201d as a \u201chalfway house\u201d between an employee and self-employed contractor. \u201cWhat is emerging from the current debate is an inchoate feeling that there is something out there called the gig economy that needs some definition,\u201d said Vaizey. \u201cI wonder whether the application of a minimum wage to people who work in the so-called gig economy might be one step forward.\u201d He said it would not necessarily mean employers having to provide sick pay or holidays, but added: \u201cThe minimum wage has effectively taken the place now of tax credits as a statutory intervention to support people on low pay.\u201d Vaizey\u2019s speech reflected increasing concern inside the government about low pay, a lack of training opportunities and job insecurity in a growing part of the low-paid economy. The prime minister, Theresa May, last month commissioned a review of employment practices from Matthew Taylor, the former adviser to Tony Blair, that is expected to make recommendations for reform. Speaking on the same platform as Vaizey at a discussion forum on the gig economy, Alan Milburn, the chairman of the government\u2019s social mobility taskforce, said the Taylor review should clarify that \u201cwhat is happening in terms of the creation of a class of self-employed is genuinely a demand from the labour market for greater flexibility and is not driven by financial and tax incentives that are creating an imbalanced playing field\u201d. \u201cThe time is right to strike a new deal, between big employers in particular and government about what it is we expect to see employers discharge as their social obligations,\u201d said the former Labour health secretary. \u201cWhat we should expect of employers is not just that they create jobs, but they create careers; how they design jobs not just to get people off welfare into work, but to give them the opportunity to progress. This is the time to strike a different relationship between the employing class and the governing class.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Virgin Money\u2019s chief executive has called on Mark Carney\u2019s critics to let him get on with his job following his clarification of his departure date from the Bank of England. Jayne-Anne Gadhia said the Bank\u2019s governor had helped soothe fears about Brexit immediately after the EU referendum and that his decision to stay in the job until June 2019 would help bring stability. She said the economy\u2019s resilience in the months since the vote was in part due to Carney\u2019s interventions, which included cutting interest rates, to shore up confidence. Gadhia said: \u201cThank goodness for that would be my comment. When I think back to 24 June when an awful lot of people wondered who was leading the country I was pretty relieved when Mark Carney stepped up and was sensible. We need stability going forward.\u201d Carney\u2019s future became the subject of intense speculation after a string of attacks on him by senior Conservatives, including calls for him to resign. The Canadian had planned to leave the Bank in June 2018 after five years but on Monday he agreed to stay an extra year to see the UK through the process of leaving the EU. Brexit campaigners criticised Carney during the referendum campaign for predicting a vote for Brexit would be bad for the economy. Since the vote, Conservatives have accused him of talking down the economy and others, including Theresa May, have criticised the harmful effects of low interest rates on savers. Gadhia said criticism came with the job of Bank governor but she said with his future settled and with uncertain times ahead for the economy Carney should be left to concentrate on helping steer Britain through Brexit. \u201cHow difficult to have a job where we are all able to comment. When you take on a big role like that you have to be a public figure and expect to have public comment. I don\u2019t criticise people for making the comments they have made. I do think now he is here we should let him get on with his job. Hopefully that will add to the stability of the country.\u201d Gadhia made her comments as Virgin Money announced steady trading for the first nine months of the year. Gross mortgage lending increased 19% to \u00a36.5bn from a year earlier and credit card balances rose 14% to \u00a328.9bn from the end of December as deposits increased 12% to \u00a328.3bn. Virgin Money, backed by Sir Richard Branson, tightened its credit card lending after the referendum because of concerns about the economy, slowing lending growth in the third quarter. Gadhia, who like Branson wanted Britain to stay in the EU, said she had seen no change in customers\u2019 behaviour since the referendum and that the economy had performed better than she expected. \u201cThat gives us an optimistic view of the future. It\u2019s tempered by some caution, not because we see an economic downturn necessarily \u2026 but because the future is uncertain. Everybody needs to look forward with some caution.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered has become ensnarled in another regulatory problem after admitting it faced potential sanctions from the Hong Kong authorities over its handling of a stock market flotation. As the London-listed bank reported its third quarter results, it admitted that the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission had warned that it intended to take action against the bank in relation to an IPO in 2009. Standard Chartered, which is focused on emerging markets, said \u201cthere may be financial consequences\u201d for its securities arm. The bank did not identify the company but it is thought to be the share sale for China Forestry, which is being liquidated. Last week, Swiss bank UBS also mentioned it faced an investigation into share listings in Hong Kong. The investigation adds to the list of regulatory problems which has been revealed by Standard Chartered, whose new chief executive, Bill Winters, is 12 months into a strategy to retreat from riskier businesses after bolstering its capital through a \u00a33.3bn cash-call a year ago. The shares closed down 5.4% at 673p \u2013 the biggest drop in the FTSE 100 \u2013 after Winters admitted that revenue was not rising fast enough and said the Bank of England had ordered it to hold more capital. \u201cWe have made progress executing the strategic actions announced a year ago. We now have a stronger balance sheet, reduced concentrations and are becoming more efficient, but income and profit levels are not yet acceptable,\u201d Winters said. \u201cMarket conditions are expected to remain challenging,\u201d the bank said. Pre-tax profits for the nine-month period were $1bn (\u00a3816m) compared with $2.5bn a year ago. In the third quarter, the group produced an underlying profit of $458m compared with a loss of $139m a year earlier. Winters confirmed that Standard Chartered had told the US Department of Justice about allegations of bribery involving the Indonesian power group MAXpower, which has in the past declined to comment on the alleged bribery. There was no update on the ongoing UK investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into the effectiveness of its controls against financial crime. In February, Standard Chartered reported its first annual loss since 1989 after it was knocked by restructuring costs and repricing of complex financial instruments. The shares dived to 385p at the start of the year and are below the 713p they traded at a year ago. It is a dramatic reversal of fortunes for Standard Chartered, which survived the 2008 banking crisis unscathed but started to experience problems in 2012 when the US regulators fined it for breaching sanctions. Winters was named chief executive in February 2015 during a boardroom shakeout. He is now focusing on closing risky operations.",

      "bodyText": "A near \u00a3100m deal to sell the Football Pools to its management team has failed to get across the goal line. Pools owner Sportech announced in September that the management of the 92-year old business would pay \u00a397.2m to take it over, allowing Sportech to focus on its US gaming division. The pools accounted for around a third of Sportech\u2019s revenues last year. But now Sportech said the deal with the takeover vehicle, Burlywood Capital was off. Sportech chief executive Ian Penrose said: Burlywood was unable to conclude the transaction set out within their proposal which we announced in September. The Football Pools is a valuable asset which has been transformed following a lengthy modernisation programme. We will continue to focus on maximising opportunities for the business. Shares in Sportech, which bought Littlewoods Gaming including the pools in 2000 and added Vernons and Zetters in 2007, have slumped 7% to 63p on the news. Analyst Alistair Ross at Investec said the deal failed because Burlywood failed to raise the necessary funds from institutional investors: Following the Football Pools modernisation programme, which included the closure of the Collector Division, management of Sportech thought the sale of the division represented an attractive opportunity to realise the value of the Pools and so transition the business model. The division was to be sold to Burlywood, which proposed incorporating a new AIM listed company and financing the acquisition of the Pools through debt (\u00a330m) and institutional equity. The sale was contingent on the necessary equity being raised, final agreement of the sale and debt documentation and, in view of its size, approval from the Sportech shareholders. Burlywood failed to raise the necessary funds for the sale to complete, and Sportech has therefore announced that discussions have now terminated. Ahead of the third quarters due on 10 November, we place our forecasts and target price under review, but maintain our buy recommendation. Overall the FTSE 100 has drifted lower, down 12.02 points at 6942.20 despite an early boost from news that Bank of England governor Mark Carney was staying on until 2019 and better than expected results from Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The October UK manufacturing PMI slipped slightly from September and was marginally down on expectations at 54.3 rather than 55.5p. Shell B shares are currently topping the risers, up 77.5p at 2192.5p, but BP is down 14.7p at 469p. Standard Chartered is the biggest faller, down 43.9p at 668p after its latest update. Among the mid-caps, Weir is down 76p at \u00a316.24 as the pumps maker said 2016 profits would be slightly lower than expected due to weaker oil markets and tougher trading conditions in the middle east. But Moneysupermarket has climbed 21.3p to 283.2p after third quarter revenues rose 12% and it said it was confident of meeting full year expectations. Malcolm Morgan at Peel Hunt said: The third quarter was strong. Insurance is accelerating. Home services has delivered again. Revenue for the year will exceed the consensus expectation, and should beat our top end of the range forecast. Profit will be in line with expectation. The recent share price weakness is unwarranted in our view, so we are happy to reiterate our buy recommendation.",

The sale was contingent on the necessary equity being raised, final agreement of the sale and debt documentation and, in view of its size, approval from the Sportech shareholders.</p> <p>Burlywood failed to raise the necessary funds for the sale to complete, and Sportech has therefore announced that discussions have now terminated. </p> <p> Ahead of the third quarters due on 10 November, we place our forecasts and target price under review, but maintain our buy recommendation.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the<strong> FTSE 100</strong> has drifted lower, down 12.02 points at 6942.20 despite an early boost from news that Bank of England governor Mark Carney was staying on until 2019 and better than expected results from <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> and <strong>BP.</strong> The October UK manufacturing PMI slipped slightly from September and was marginally down on expectations at 54.3 rather than 55.5p.</p> <p>Shell B shares are currently topping the risers, up 77.5p at 2192.5p, but BP is down 14.7p at 469p.</p> <p><strong>Standard Chartered </strong>is the biggest faller, down 43.9p at 668p after its latest update.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>Weir</strong> is down 76p at \u00a316.24 as the pumps maker said 2016 profits would be slightly lower than expected due to weaker oil markets and tougher trading conditions in the middle east.</p> <p>But <strong>Moneysupermarket</strong> has climbed 21.3p to 283.2p after third quarter revenues rose 12% and it said it was confident of meeting full year expectations. Malcolm Morgan at Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The third quarter was strong. Insurance is accelerating. Home services has delivered again. Revenue for the year will exceed the consensus expectation, and should beat our top end of the range forecast. Profit will be in line with expectation. The recent share price weakness is unwarranted in our view, so we are happy to reiterate our buy recommendation. </p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "Dame Clara Furse, the former chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, is to be named as the chair of HSBC UK, the bank\u2019s domestic retail arm which is being ringfenced from its other operations following new regulations in the wake of the financial crisis. The move, first reported by Sky News, is set to be confirmed as early as Tuesday. The lender is relocating its UK high street operations to Birmingham as part of its effort to comply with new rules that require banks to insulate their high street customers from their investment banking arms. Furse is a high-profile appointment as HSBC attempts to address the lack of gender equality at the top of its operations by setting a target for equal numbers of women and men in senior roles in its UK arm. The new head office for its high street operations is due to be opened by 2019. HSBC UK also aims to achieve gender parity in the most senior of about 550 roles by 2020. The appointment is likely to lead to Furse stepping down from the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC), which was set up to look for potential problems in the financial system. Furse was the first female member of the committee and has served for the past three years. Her appointment to the FPC proved controversial because of her previous role on the board of the bailed-out bank and insurance group Fortis, where she was a non-executive director and on the risk and capital committees when the Dutch-Belgian firm was involved in taking over ABN Amro \u2013 as part of a consortium with Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Santander \u2013 during the 2007 credit crunch. Fortis ended up needing a state bailout, as did RBS. Furse said she deeply regretted the losses to shareholders, but that taxpayers in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg had not done too badly from the rescue. She insisted the deal had floundered because of execution risk and not because of the quality of the assets, and that legal advice taken by Fortis had prevented the firm from pulling out of the deal. Even so, the Canadian-born Furse is perhaps best known in the City for her eight years as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. During that spell she fended off a number of hostile takeover bids for the UK stock market, including advances from rivals including Nasdaq and Deutsche B\u00f6rse.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s two oil \u201csupermajors\u201d, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, have outlined plans for a more frugal future to withstand stubbornly low oil prices as they beat profit expectations in the third quarter. While both firms outperformed forecasts, Shell won greater plaudits from investors thanks to rapid progress on cutting costs and a hefty production boost from its \u00a343bn takeover of gas specialist BG. Shell\u2019s underlying net profit for the three months to the end of September rose 18% to $2.8bn, beating analyst forecasts of $1.7bn. Britain\u2019s biggest company said its performance had improved after a disappointing second quarter as it cut costs following its takeover of BG Group in January. Chief financial officer Simon Henry said the BG deal had \u201cturbocharged\u201d the company, helping increase production by 25% to 3.6m barrels per day (bpd) from 2.9m this time last year. But the cost of the takeover, coupled with low oil prices, has seen the company\u2019s debt balloon from $26.6bn last year to nearly $79bn, adding to pressure to reduce spending and sell assets. Shell expects its capital investment to fall $25bn next year \u2013 at the lowest end of its $25bn to $30bn guidance range. Henry pointed out that Shell is already being thrifty, with this year\u2019s $29bn in capital investment some $18bn less than Shell and BG were spending as separate companies in 2014. Oil companies around the world have cut spending severely to cope with a plunge in the oil price that has weighed on the industry for more than two years and that both companies said is unlikely to reverse this year. Henry warned that continued retrenchment could include further job losses in the North Sea, where Shell has already cut 1,000 staff since 2014. \u201cI cannot rule out further changes in the number of jobs,\u201d he said, adding that Shell was ready to sell North Sea assets but hadn\u2019t received attractive offers. The firm is in the process of selling 16 assets as part of a $30bn sale programme as it looks to bolster its balance sheet following the BG deal. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, stressed the need for caution despite the better-than-expected results, saying: \u201cLower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business, and the outlook remains uncertain.\u201d Shell\u2019s cost cuts and progress in integrating BG won approval from the markets, sending its shares up nearly 4% to \u00a321.15. But while BP beat expectations, investors were less impressed than they were with Shell and its stock fell 4.5% to \u00a34.62. Investors in both companies stand to receive a \u00a32.5bn boost to their dividends from sterling\u2019s weakness this year, according to Capita Dividend Monitor, which expects their combined payouts to be \u00a318.6bn. At BP, net profit almost halved to $933m in the third quarter from $1.8bn a year earlier, although the result was better than the average analyst forecast of $780m, according to Reuters. The company blamed lower oil prices as well as higher costs for writing off exploration projects and cancelling rigs. BP scrapped plans to drill in Australia\u2019s Great Australian Bight last month after commissioning a high-spec oil rig in Singapore. Like Shell, BP is battening down the hatches for continued low oil prices, with capital spending due to be $16bn this year, $1bn less than predicted in April. The company has largely worked through the costs of its Gulf of Mexico oil spill but added $189m to its overall bill, which has now reached $61.8bn since the incident in April 2010. Both companies\u2019 shares have been under pressure as the oil price hovers at about $50 a barrel and rising doubts about Opec\u2019s ability to organise a promised production cut. But Shell\u2019s finance chief Simon Henry said the efforts to slash costs will put it in \u201cvery strong cash generating territory\u201d if prices rise again. He said every $10 rise in the price of Brent crude was worth $5bn to Shell and would be worth $6bn within years, signalling huge rewards if oil prices eventually reach $100 again. \u201cThat\u2019s another $30bn in the bank each year,\u201d he said. Energy industry commentators have pointed to the falling cost of renewables versus fossil fuels and Shell\u2019s head of new energies and integrate gas, Maarten Wetselaar, said solar and wind were already undercutting gas in some areas. He said solar panels were \u201cequivalent or cheaper than fully costed gas\u201d in areas near the equator when stripping out the cost of period with limited sunshine. He said the same was true of wind power in the North Sea, although he stressed that gas still has an advantage when windless days are factored in.",

It says the tax affairs of 6,500 super-rich individuals \u2013 each worth more than \u00a320m \u2013 are being examined by a specialist HM Revenue and Customs unit. The unit is investigating outstanding receipts worth \u00a31.9bn, a majority of which involve aggressive avoidance schemes. However, just two individuals have been criminally investigated over the past five years, leading to a single prosecution, while another 70 were pursued through the civil courts. In an indication of the scale of the task faced by the unit, the report discloses that each of the 6,500 super-rich taxpayers has had on average four serious tax issues looked at by the unit. Around 4,000 inquiries have been open for more than three years, it adds. The report sheds a light on the scale of potential tax avoidance involving the super-rich and will prompt further claims that Britain\u2019s wealthiest people are not being pursued with the same vigour as benefits claimants or small businesses. Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, which will question tax officials over its policies, said the findings would prompt further examination of the tax authority\u2019s policies towards wealthy taxpayers. \u201cThis very low prosecution rate highlights the concern that high net worth individuals and their tax advisers are always one step ahead of HMRC. We will be questioning HMRC about the level of prosecutions and whether it is stepping up to the plate,\u201d she said. HMRC set up the specialist unit in 2009 after criticisms that it had failed to pursue wealthy taxpayers. Each wealthy individual is assigned a \u201ccustomer relationship manager\u201d within HMRC. Where high net worth individuals are suspected of tax fraud, their case is passed to a team that examines whether the evidence is sufficient to merit a criminal, rather than civil, investigation. The tax authority estimates that around \u00a31.1bn of the potential \u00a31.9bn in unpaid taxes is linked to tax avoidance schemes, and that 15% of the wealthiest have used at least one such scheme. In 2014-15, the super-rich paid more than \u00a34.3bn in tax, according to the NAO\u2019s report. It says 137 people who had undisclosed assets in Liechtenstein used an agreement with the tax haven in 2009 to admit liabilities of \u00a3141m in return for gentler penalties. The average settlement was \u00a31m per person. The report also discloses that the unit, alongside the National Crime Agency, is investigating 40 wealthy individuals named in the Panama Papers. \u201c[HMRC officials] are assessing if the data reveals new risks that mean these 40 people should be considered for civil or criminal investigation,\u201d the report says. In the past five years, HMRC has investigated and closed 72 cases relating to high net worth individuals. Seventy of these were investigated with civil powers, raising \u00a380m in compliance yield including penalties. In 2015-16, HMRC undertook a review of high net worth cases and identified an extra 1,000 people with a net worth of more than \u00a320m on top of the 6,500 initially identified, the report says. The head of the NAO, Amyas Morse, said: \u201cThe tax affairs of the wealthiest in society are complex, making it harder for HMRC to ensure that they are paying the right amount of tax. HMRC\u2019s specialist team gives it a better understanding of the tax affairs and behaviours of these taxpayers. \u201cWhile the yields from HMRC\u2019s work in this area have increased, it needs to evaluate what approaches are the most effective and to understand the outcomes it achieves.\u201d A HMRC spokesperson said it enforced the rules impartially and last year tracked down an additional \u00a3416m in tax from the wealthiest that would have otherwise gone unpaid. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate our results so that we carry on getting what is due to the country,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe NAO\u2019s report recognises that taxing the wealthy is complex but also commends HMRC\u2019s approach as both sensible and in line with OECD best practice advice.\u201d",
