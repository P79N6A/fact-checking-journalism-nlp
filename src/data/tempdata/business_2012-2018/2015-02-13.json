      "bodyText": "The son of \u201dcarpet king\u201d Baron Harris of Peckham is planning to compete with the business his father founded, Carpetright, with his own chain of 200 flooring stores. Martin Harris, who left Carpetright last year after 23 years at the business, said he hoped to open the first store this summer. He is aiming to attract a more affluent shopper than the former family business and take advantage of an anticipated rise in sales of home furnishings this year after a period in the doldrums. \u201cThere\u2019s enough room in the market for more than one national retailer. There\u2019s room for us both,\u201d he told the trade journal Retail Week. \u201cA lot of flooring stores are not aspirational and I want people to be inspired by the possibility of what they can do with their home,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are spending money on their homes as there\u2019s no point keeping it in the bank.\u201d He said his father was supportive of his plan to open 200 stores over five years. The business will be chaired by Sir Harry Djanogly, who served as a Carpetright non-executive director between 1993 and 2005. It is not clear if Lord Harris will have any role. Analysts said his son\u2019s plans were ambitious and might benefit from his father\u2019s expertise and contacts in the floorcovering and property worlds. \u201cThis is not a second coming. Martin is a likeable guy but is not viewed as in the same league as his father,\u201d said one analyst who declined to be named. Harris junior left Carpetright, where he was development director, last autumn, a few weeks before his father stepped down as chairman of the company he founded in 1988. The chain is now run by Wilf Walsh, who was brought in after Harris\u2019s appointed successor, Darren Shapland, stepped down in 2013 just 17 months into the job. At the time, Harris said his son had become \u201cvery disillusioned\u201d and felt let down after the shock departure of Shapland, who he had been instrumental in hiring from J Sainsbury. Harris junior sold down the vast majority of his personally held shares in Carpetright, worth nearly \u00a3500,000, last summer. The family then gradually cut its stake in the business from nearly 17% to less than 3% by December last year. It\u2019s not clear if Lord Harris, 72, will become involved in his son\u2019s latest venture. The Conservative party donor has ploughed some of his fortune into academy schools in south London via the Harris Federation and also into equestrian pursuits, backing a gold medal-winning horse at the 2012 Olympics in London. Harris first became involved in retail at the age of 15 in 1957, when he was left in charge of a Peckham market stall and two shops after his father died.",

      "bodyText": "Greek stock markets have rallied on growing confidence that Athens will reach a deal with its international creditors next week. In the runup to a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Monday, the new Greek prime minister\u2019s office vowed to do \u201cwhatever we can\u201d to come to an agreement over a new support programme for the bailed-out country. Talks between eurozone ministers this week failed to make progress in resolving a standoff over the desire by Greece\u2019s new leftist government to ditch the strict terms of its \u20ac240bn (\u00a3180bn) bailout programme and the insistence from other eurozone countries, most notably Germany, that the old framework should continue. But on Friday, the new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, appeared to soften his stance. He agreed that Greek officials would meet representatives of the troika of lenders who supplied the bailout money and imposed and policed the terms that came with it. Previously, Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said the new government would refuse to engage with representatives of troika, made up of the European Central Bank, the European commission and the International Monetary Fund. A government spokesman said Greece was straining to get the pieces in place for a deal on Monday, but he also sought to play down fears time was running out to avert a fresh crisis in the eurozone that would see Greece defaulting on the bailout programme and being forced to leave the single currency. \u201cWe will do whatever we can so that a deal is found on Monday,\u201d Gabriel Sakellaridis told Greece\u2019s Skai TV. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have an agreement on Monday, we believe that there is always time so that there won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Markets were cheered by signs the two sides were looking for common ground and the main share index in Athens rallied while yields came down on Greek government bonds. The ATG index rose 5.6% and the Athens Stock Exchange FTSE Banks Index, which has seen wild swings since the new Syriza-led government came to power last month, gained 12.7%. The current bailout programme expires on 28 February, but Monday 16 Februaryis the last date Greece can apply for an extension, according to Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chair of the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers. Dijsselbloem, who is also Dutch finance minister, said on Friday he was \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d about getting a new deal at Monday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. \u201cThe Greeks have sky-high ambitions. The possibilities, given the state of the Greek economy, are limited,\u201d he told Netherlands\u2019 public broadcaster, NOS. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get there by Monday.\u201d Syriza swept to power on a vow to break free of the \u201ccruel\u201d conditions imposed under the bailout, which it blames for causing widespread unemployment and poverty. Greece has sought to take the same message to its eurozone neighbours, insisting that relentless cuts aimed at repaying loans have been self-defeating and an end to austerity would do more for economic recovery. At meetings with his counterparts around Europe, Varoufakis has been adamant that Greece wants a new deal and that the bailout programme must not simply be extended. The new Greek finance minister risked further stoking tensions with the country\u2019s creditors on Friday when he used a German news magazine interview to liken the Troika\u2019s actions to the CIA\u2019s waterboarding of suspected terrorists. \u201cJust before heart failure we are allowed to take a few breaths. Then we get pushed back under the water and it all starts over,\u201d he told Germany\u2019s Spiegel. Troika officials were decent people, he told the magazine, but added: \u201cThere were also very good people in the CIA, who against their will were engaged in waterboarding and therefore found themselves in a terrible moral dilemma.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Amid conflicting talk about the state of talks between Greece and its creditors, investors decided to accentuate the positive ahead of Monday\u2019s key eurogroup meeting. Postive eurozone GDP data - particularly from Germany - also helped matters, with Germany\u2019s Dax hitting a new peak. This weekend\u2019s ceasefire in Ukraine added to the optimistic mood. Overall, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 45.41 points or 0.67% at 6873.52 Germany\u2019s Dax hit a record close of 10,963.4, up 0.4% France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.7% at 4759.36 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.96% to 21,204.07 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.68% at 10,739.5 As previously mentioned, the Athens stock market added 5.61% to 893.98 In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 35 points or 0.2% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday for what looks to be another crucial day for Greece and the eurozone. Despite the mixed signals coming from various sources, investors are hopeful a deal between Greece and its creditors can be done, pushing the Athens stock market up 5.61% to its highest level since the middle of December. Greek bond yields are also falling, another sign of optimism, with the 10 year yield down 91 basis points at 9.4%. Another negative ahead of Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting which is attempting to find a solution to Greece\u2019s financial crisis. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has said he was \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d about reaching a final debt deal. Reuters reports: Saying Greek voters\u2019 expectations of their new government were \u201ca mile high\u201d, Dutch finance minister Dijsselbloem was asked whether a plan to resolve Athens\u2019 financial problems would be achieved on Monday. He replied, in a remark aired on Dutch television: \u201cI\u2019m really still very pessimistic about that now.\u201d Back with Greece and it appears some believe that Grexit could be contained: Not clear yet who \u201cEU\u201d is in this case. And on the other hand: The US confidence figure is still a strong one despite the fall and a June rate rise is in fact on the cards, says James Knightley of ING Bank: The February preliminary reading of University of Michigan consumer confidence has come in at 93.6 versus the final reading of 98.1 in January. Markets had been looking for it to hold steady so it is a little disappointing. Nonetheless, it is still a strong reading that matches the figure recorded in December and is at a level historically consistent with decent consumer spending growth. Looking at the breakdown the expectations component fell 3.5 points while the current conditions series dropped 6.2 points, but it is important to remember that the trend is still moving in the right directions. With equity markets hitting new highs, mortgage rates falling, real incomes being boosted by falling energy prices and rising nominal wages at a time when employment continues to grow strongly, it is a pretty positive environment for the household sector right now. There has been some concern about the softness in retail sales, but we still take the view that the economy has strong momentum and that the Fed will start to tighten monetary policy at the June FOMC meeting. In the US, a survey of consumer confidence has come in lower than expected. The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan sentiment index for February fell from 98.1 the previous month to 93.6. Analysts had expected an unchanged figure. With weak retail sales despite the falling oil price, this is another indication the US economy might not be quite as strong as previously thought. In any case it may well push back the idea of a US rate rise in the middle of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped back from its best levels in early trading and is now up just 19 points or 0.1%. But amid the optimism and hope that Greece and its creditors can come to a deal, there\u2019s always someone to dampen the mood. Step forward Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission: With talks between Greece and its creditors starting today ahead of a key (another key) eurozone finance ministers meeting on Monday, here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on what is happening: [Monday\u2019s talks} are the last moment for the new Greek government to ask for a technical extension of the current bailout programme, which runs out on February 28. Greece needs such an extension to ensure continued official financing at a time when market borrowing is too expensive for Athens and to be eligible for negotiations on more time to repay the euro zone loans already received. But the left-wing government of Alexis Tsipras won elections in January on promises of ending the \u20ac240bn bailout and the belt-tightening reforms that came with it and does not want to ask for an extension, even by a few months. \u201cThere have been very good political debates ... and now we need to get down to the hard facts, explaining what is in the (bailout reform) agreement and what are the quantified results of the new Greek government\u2019s programme,\u201d a senior EU official close to the talks said. \u201cOn Monday we expect a description of what are the overlaps between the two, and I expect them to be non-negligible, and what are the divergences,\u201d the official said. If Greece wanted to remove a certain reform from the list agreed under the bailout, it would have to propose in its place a measure that would have a similar fiscal effect, he said. The official noted that if Greece did not ask for a bailout extension on Monday, the programme, with the financial cushion it provided, would expire and Athens would have to apply for a new, fully fledged bailout - the country\u2019s third. \u201cIt\u2019s not crucial to extend. One could also agree to start discussions on a new programme, That is a distinct possibility, I would not exclude it,\u201d the official said. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has caused a bit of a stir, by comparing the Troika\u2019s actions to the CIA\u2019s waterboarding of suspected terrorists. The interview is online here. In it Varoufakis talks about how Greece was given \u201ca few breaths\u201d before being pushed back under water again. Those Troika officials sent to oversea Greece\u2019s programme were in a \u201cterrible moral dilemma\u201d, he adds. Varoufakis also talks about how a debt haircut would be better for all sides. A quick catch-up on Greece. There have been encouraging signs of progress this morning, with Athens promising to stretch every sinew to reach an agreement. Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis told Skai TV. \u201cWe will do whatever we can so that a deal is found on Monday,\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t have an agreement on Monday, we believe that there is always time so that there won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d The word \u201ctroika\u201d may have been banished to history. Instead, Greece will be dealing with its institutions. Although not everyone has got the memo, as Reuters reports: Germany does not believe the Paris-based OECD can emulate the supervisory role of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund in the Greek bailout, a spokesman for the finance ministry in Berlin said on Friday. The OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) was welcome to provide its expertise to the Greek government, said spokesman Martin Jaeger, \u201cbut what we cannot envisage is an OECD role in the troika framework\u201d. Although this chart doesn\u2019t include today\u2019s data, it shows how Italy has been struggling badly since the eurozone crisis began: Here\u2019s a full breakdown of all today\u2019s growth data: One for football fans: The better than expected eurozone growth data have driven European stock markets to seven-year highs. Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown, says the strong growth in Germany has cheered traders. This is the latest in a series of signs that the economic climate might be improving, and the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme might therefore benefit from a following wind. Most notably the credit cycle appears finally to be showing improvement - after two and a half years of contraction, euro zone bank lending to the private sector is growing again. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index reached its highest level since 2007 in early trading while the German DAX index climbed to an all-time high over 11,000. Finland\u2019s economy also shrank in the last quarter, with GDP falling by 0.3% in the last quarter. Its reputation as part of the eurozone\u2019s strong northern core has been dented by the decline of Nokia, and lower demand for its forestry and paper products. Russia\u2019s economic problems aren\u2019t helping either. Some instant reaction to the growth figures: In short, Europe\u2019s economy is picking up, but growth remains much weaker than the United States (which has recorded three strong quarters) Cyprus\u2019s economy shrank by 0.7% in the last quarter. Greece\u2019s economy has suffered a contraction, with GDP falling by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of 2014 That\u2019s a blow to Athens, and suggests the recent political uncertainty has hurt its economy. That 0.3% growth in the last quarter means that the Eurozone grew by 0.9% during 2014, compared to the 0.8% expected. The eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the last three months of 2014, faster than expected. That\u2019s an improvement on the 0.2% recorded in the previous quarter, primarily thanks to forecast-busting growth in Germany. Time for a recap, while we wait for the overall eurozone growth reading at 10am GMT. Germany\u2019s economy has recorded unexpectedly strong growth, raising hopes that Europe\u2019s powerhouse economy has shrugged off its recent weakness. German GDP increased by 0.7% in the final three months, more than twice as fast as expected. Destatis reports that the German economy \u201cgained momentum\u201d at the end of 2014, driven by domestic demand, exports and business investment. Economists predict that German growth will pick up in 2015, with the weak euro likely to help its exporters. As Carsten Brzeski of ING put it: The German economy ended a volatile year on a very strong note. There was also encouragement that the Netherlands\u2019 GDP rose by 0.5% in the last quarter..... ...a figure matched by Portugal. France, though, lagged behind with growth of just 0.1% in the quarter. Business investment contracted again, showing French firms remain nervous and unwilling to spend. Mathilde Lemoine of HSBC explains: [French] exports accelerated but business investment declined. Consumer spending slowed down mainly due to weather-related reasons. Italy\u2019s slump has ended. GDP was flat quarter-on-quarter, better than the 0.1% contraction that economists expected. That still leaves Italy as the worst-performing major eurozone economy. That means that Portugal\u2019s economy grew by 0.9% in 2014, after shrinking by 1.4% in 2013. And finally, Portugal has posted another quarter of growth. The Portuguese economy expanded by 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with the previous three months. The FT\u2019s Rome bureau chief, James Politi, suggests Italy\u2019s economy may finally return to growth this year: Although Italy\u2019s economy didn\u2019t shrink again, the country is still lagging behind its neighbours. Spain, for example, grew by a Germanic 0.7% during the last quarter. Prime minister Matteo Renzi has a lot of work to do, out Nick Koutis of ABN Amro. Breaking: Italy\u2019s economy stagnated in the last three months of 2014. GDP was unchanged across the Italian economy in the fourth quarter, beating expectations of a 0.1% decline in GDP. Poland\u2019s economy has slowed a little. GDP rose by 0.6% in the October-December quarter, down from 0.8% in Q3 2014. Germany\u2019s stock market has hit a new all-time high: Germany should also benefit if the Ukraine ceasefire holds, says Christian Schulz of Berenberg bank: The tailwinds from cheap oil, a weaker euro exchange rate and increasingly aggressive ECB monetary policy easing should more than offset the serious short-term risks such as Greece and Russia. While the first half of 2015 could still be a little more subdued due to these risks, we expect German growth to reach trend levels a bit above 2% in the summer 2015. Back to the GDP data... and Carsten Brzeski of ING reckons Germany is going to enjoy 2015: Looking ahead, the German economy looks set to continue surfing on a wave of economic well-being. With the strong labour market, wage increases, low energy prices and extremely low interest rates, consumers should continue to spend it. At the same time, the weak euro will definitely benefit German exports, letting them return as a growth engine. Optimism is growing that Greece and its lenders are going to hammer out a bailout extension in time. The Athens stock market surged by 7.6% at the start of trading, and bank shares have surged by around 20%. And Greek bonds are strengthening, pushing down the yields on Greece\u2019s debt into less dangerous territory. That follows the news last night that Greece and its creditors appear to be compromising, by agreeing to explore \u2018common ground\u2019 ready for Monday night\u2019s eurogroup meeting [see opening post]. Bloomberg reports that Athens is looking for a \u201cnew contract\u201d with the eurozone, and believes Berlin may be amenable: Germany won\u2019t insist that all elements of Greece\u2019s current aid program continue, said two officials in Berlin. As long as the program is prolonged, they said, Germany would be open to talking about the size of Greece\u2019s budget-surplus requirement and conditions to sell off government assets. Full story: Greece, Germany Said to Offer Compromises on Aid Terms This morning\u2019s GDP data is giving European stock markets a lift. The ceasefire in Ukraine, and hopes of a breakthrough in the Greek bailout talks, have also helped to push the main indices up in early trading. Here\u2019s the situation: France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, is hopeful that the country\u2019s economy might pick up this year, after ending 2014 with growth of just 0.1%. He told French radio that: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously still too weak, but the conditions are ripe to permit a cleaner start of activity in 2015.\u201d Outside the eurozone, Hungary has also outperformed expectations; its economy grew by 3.4% year-on-year in the October-December period, compared to the 2.9% expected. The eurozone could have grown by as much as 0.4% in the last quarter, reckons Claus Vistesen, macroeconomist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. Back to the Dutch data briefly, and Statistics Netherlands says the 0.5% growth was broad-based, with exports, household consumption and investments all rising. The strong German growth figures are a \u201cthunderbolt\u201d, says economist Andreas Rees at Unicredit. Rees told Reuters: \u201cEconomic recovery in Germany started much earlier than expected. Some spoke of possible recession after the summer but instead Germany rebounded. The fact that the growth comes mainly from the domestic economy gives strong grounds for optimism,\u201d \u201cThanks to 2014\u2019s strong finish we have a higher chance of seeing stronger-than-expected growth this year, which would help the rest of the euro zone.\u201d The Netherlands has followed Germany\u2019s lead by reporting faster than expected growth. Dutch GDP grew by 0.5% in the last quarter, according to Statistics Netherlands, beating forecasts of 0.3%. Growth in the third quarter has been revised up too, from 0.1% to 0.2%. Another encouraging sign for the eurozone. The forecast-beating German growth data suggests the eurozone may have grown faster than the 0.2% economists had expected: The story so far: The surge in German exports suggests Europe\u2019s powerhouse economy is benefitting from the weak euro. That\u2019s ironic, given the Bundesbank\u2019s attempts to prevent the European Central Bank launching its quantitative easing stimulus programme, which has helped pushed down the value of the euro. Destatis, the German statistics body, says that the country\u2019s economy \u201cgained momentum towards the end of 2014,\u201d with its growth of 0.7%. It adds: In a quarter-on-quarter comparison (adjusted for price, seasonal and calendar variations), positive contributions were made mainly by domestic demand. Especially households markedly increased their final consumption expenditure again. A positive development was also observed for fixed capital formation which was up on the third quarter of 2014 in machinery and equipment and especially in construction. Also, exports of goods and services increased considerably again, according to provisional calculations; however, imports rose to a similar extent. German exports also drove growth in the last three months of the year: Germany\u2019s stats office also reports that the economy grew by 1.6% during 2014 -- that\u2019s four times as fast as France. Instant reaction: Germany has smashed growth forecasts. Its GDP rose by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014, more than twice the 0.3% economists expected. Domestic demand drove the pick-up in activity, according to the German statistics body. Credit Agricole\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet agrees: He\u2019s also told Bloomberg that: \u201cThe expectation is that now France will finally be pulled out of its stagnation trap by its neighbours. \u201cThe external conditions cannot be more favorable and on top of that you have a domestic improvement driven by credit easing at the ECB.\u201d Sophie Pedder, Paris Bureau Chief at The Economist, is also concerned by that French investment keeps falling: Today\u2019s GDP data shows that French firms remain unwilling to invest. Gross fixed capital formation shrank by 0.5% in October-December, following a 0.6% drop in the third quarter. Output across all French industry was flat, while the manufacturing sector shrank by 0.2%. So it was left to household spending to drive growth, with consumption up by 0.2%. But there\u2019s good news on trade: Exports accelerated markedly in Q4 (+2.3% after +0.7%), while imports kept on increasing (+1.7% after +1.3%). Full details here Here we go: The French economy grew by just 0.1% in the last three months of 2014. INSEE, the French statistics body, also reports that GDP rose by just 0.4% during 2014. That\u2019s in line with forecasts, and confirms that Europe\u2019s second-largest economy has been through a rather poor year. More details to follow.... Good morning. Is the eurozone\u2019s economy continuing to struggle, or is it starting to pick up after some tough times? We\u2019re about to find out, with fresh GDP data from countries across the single currency are released this morning, covering the final three months of last year. We get data from France any moment, then Germany at 7am GMT. Then there\u2019s a splurge of data - watch out for the Netherlands at 7.30am 8.30am , Italy at 9am, Portugal at 9.30am, and then the overall eurozone at 10a. Economists aren\u2019t too confidence, predicting that GDP rose by just 0.2% -- matching the weak growth in July-September. Greece also on the agenda We\u2019ll also be tracking the latest developments around the Greek bailout. Last night, German chancellor Angela Merkel struck a tough line at the EU summit in Brussels, saying \u201cEurope always aims to find a compromise, and that is the success of Europe. Germany is ready for that. However, it must also be said that Europe\u2019s credibility naturally depends on us respecting rules and being reliable with each other.\u201d But there was also a glimmer of progress, as Greece government and its creditors agreed to start work on finding \u2018common ground\u2019.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British engineering group Rolls-Royce experienced its first fall in sales in a decade last year and warned that its performance in 2015 would be worse than previously feared owing to low oil prices. The aircraft engine-maker is already cutting thousands of jobs but added on Friday that a fall in the price of Brent crude, which has hit less than $50 per barrel this year, is forcing customers in other parts of the business to delay spending plans. Rolls-Royce reported lower demand for products in its marine business, which designs ships and supplies equipment for the offshore oil and gas industry, as well as cutbacks from customers who use its equipment in power generation, construction and mining projects. As a consequence, the group downgraded forecasts for 2015 issued in October, when it shocked the markets with a profits warning. The group expects profits this year to fall by up to 14% against its forecast of a 4% fall four months ago. In annual results published on Friday, revenues at the FTSE 100 company were lower last year for the first time in a decade, down 6% to \u00a313.7bn. Pre-tax profits plunged 96% to \u00a367m in 2014, a year that included two profits warnings, the departure of its long-serving finance director, and an investigation into corruption allegations by the Serious Fraud Office. In November, Rolls-Royce announced it was cutting 2,600 jobs over the next 18 months, with about 1,700 expected in the UK. Asked if there would be further job cuts, John Rishton, its chief executive, said Rolls-Royce was continuing to look at how efficiency could be improved across the group. \u201cWe will need to look at all elements of the business to make sure we are competitive.\u201d He added that the group was committed to maintaining its engineering capability, and it would be a case of balancing the two. Outlining some of the difficulties the group faced last year, Rishton said: \u201c2014 has been a mixed year during which underlying revenue fell for the first time in a decade, reflecting reduced spending by our defence customers, macroeconomic uncertainty, and falling commodity prices. The fundamentals of our business remain solid, with long-term growth in demand for the complex power systems we deliver across our aerospace and land and sea divisions.\u201d Looking ahead to this year, the company said: \u201cSince we last gave guidance, the external environment has deteriorated in some of our major markets. In particular, oil prices have halved over this period, creating increased uncertainty for many of our markets and customers, particularly in marine offshore.\u201d Rolls-Royce\u2019s marine business accounts for about 20% of the group\u2019s activities, with about half of that focused on the oil and gas industry. Rishton said Rolls would be hit as its customers among the big oil companies scaled back their spending plans as a result of the slump in oil prices, which have roughly halved since last summer. Last month Shell announced plans to cut spending by $15bn (\u00a310bn) over the next three years, while BP said a \u201craging gale\u201d was sweeping through the industry and said it was cutting spending plans by 20% for 2015. Until last year, the company had enjoyed a consistent run of of strong profit and revenue growth, as demand for fuel-efficient engines by aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing boosted its civil aerospace unit. Rami Myerson, an analyst at Investec, said: \u201cFollowing 2014, investors will likely remain cautious. We expect focus to move rapidly to 2016 where Rolls will continue to face headwinds in most of its businesses. A continued drag on group performance by Rolls\u2019s non-aerospace businesses should serve as a catalyst for a strategic review.\u201d Mark Morris, finance director at Rolls-Royce for 27 years, left in November to be replaced by David Smith, who was promoted from finance chief of the aerospace division. Rolls-Royce employs 55,000 people in 45 countries, including more than 24,000 in the UK.",

It was hit by fears of increased competition after Virgin Media unveiled plans to spend \u00a33bn boosting its broadband coverage. Analyst Robert Grindle at Deutsche Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Virgin Media\u2019s increased ambition is a material threat to BT which is presently the only broadband infrastructure provider to around 50% of UK homes. We have recently been concerned that other operators may also be tempted to roll-out fibre (eg, Vodafone and TalkTalk) but perhaps this news makes them less likely to do so or alternatively, could trigger a rush to invest in areas not being considered by Virgin Media. BT in turn may feel pressured to accelerate the roll-out of its own fibre network (i.e. g.fast) with the risk of rising capex/weaker free cashflows...Though there is no immediate financial impact as a result of this news, the risk of rising medium term capex, and market share loss, perhaps equivalent to around 5% of BT\u2019s consumer base (plus business customers) is unhelpful for estimates. In the near-term, the merger between BT and EE will create a hiatus (up to one year) which competition will use as an opportunity to make gains in UK fixed/mobile, partly at BT\u2019s expense. Escalating sports content costs make it more difficult for cost cuts at BT to offset any competitive impact. We see better value elsewhere in a more broadly recovering European telco sector at this time.

It said it had not received a satisfactory proposal from Seplat, and despite the Nigerian company seeking an extention to its deadline to bid or walk away, Afren refused to agree. Seplat later issued a statement clarifying it would not make a bid.</p> <p>Meanwhile Afren said it was still in talks about a recapitalisation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The company is continuing discussions with the advisers to the ad hoc committee of its largest bond holders regarding the immediate liquidity and funding needs of the business.

However, on balance, in our view, it is among the best names that will survive a prolonged period of low oil price and in the same time be among the better performers in a potential oil price turnaround. We maintain a buy rating and our 650p a share target price. With copper hitting a three week high, mining shares moved higher. BHP Billiton was 74.5p better at \u00a315.69 and Rio Tinto rose 112p to 3151.5p. Anglo American added 39p to 1204.5p despite a $3.9bn write down, as it held its dividend. GlaxoSmithKline climbed 67.5p to \u00a315.53 after UBS moved from sell to buy with a target price raised from \u00a312.50 to \u00a317. But BT fell 10.9p to 439.1p, a day after a \u00a31bn placing to help fund its purchase of EE. It was hit by fears of increased competition after Virgin Media unveiled plans to spend \u00a33bn boosting its broadband coverage. Analyst Robert Grindle at Deutsche Bank said: Virgin Media\u2019s increased ambition is a material threat to BT which is presently the only broadband infrastructure provider to around 50% of UK homes. We have recently been concerned that other operators may also be tempted to roll-out fibre (eg, Vodafone and TalkTalk) but perhaps this news makes them less likely to do so or alternatively, could trigger a rush to invest in areas not being considered by Virgin Media. BT in turn may feel pressured to accelerate the roll-out of its own fibre network (i.e. g.fast) with the risk of rising capex/weaker free cashflows...Though there is no immediate financial impact as a result of this news, the risk of rising medium term capex, and market share loss, perhaps equivalent to around 5% of BT\u2019s consumer base (plus business customers) is unhelpful for estimates. In the near-term, the merger between BT and EE will create a hiatus (up to one year) which competition will use as an opportunity to make gains in UK fixed/mobile, partly at BT\u2019s expense. Escalating sports content costs make it more difficult for cost cuts at BT to offset any competitive impact. We see better value elsewhere in a more broadly recovering European telco sector at this time. Hold. Among the mid-caps, exploration group Afren had a rollercoaster ride after it terminated talks with potential predator Seplat of Nigeria. It said it had not received a satisfactory proposal from Seplat, and despite the Nigerian company seeking an extention to its deadline to bid or walk away, Afren refused to agree. Seplat later issued a statement clarifying it would not make a bid. Meanwhile Afren said it was still in talks about a recapitalisation: The company is continuing discussions with the advisers to the ad hoc committee of its largest bond holders regarding the immediate liquidity and funding needs of the business. The company is also having discussions with its existing stakeholders and new third party investors regarding recapitalising the company. After falling as low as 4.07p its shares closed up 2.3% at 7.275p. Finally Shaft Sinkers sank 70% to 0.625p after it said there may be little or no value in the equity. The underground construction company is in talks about funding working capital, but the options available are unlikely to leave the holding company as a going concern.",

      "bodyText": "Frankfurt\u2019s stock market has reached a new high, topping 11,000 for the first time. According to the latest eurozone GDP figures, Germany enjoyed strong GDP growth in the last three months of the year and helped push expansion across the currency bloc to 0.3% for the quarter and 0.9% for the year. In Portugal and Spain, the headline growth figures improved. Even Italy beat analysts\u2019 expectations after it avoided a decline. So the recovery is real. In fact, say the eurozone\u2019s top policymakers, it\u2019s all going so well the new Greek government should open its eyes and see the warm, golden glow of sunshine appearing on the horizon. Jens Weidmann, the head of the German central bank, was in London on Thursday evening and joined the chorus of top officials bemoaning those who believe the eurozone is entering a long period of Japan-like stagnation. He urged the Greeks to stop opposing the austerity measures imposed by Brussels and accept wage cuts that have already brought an increase in competitiveness. No doubt the 0.2% fall in Greek GDP in the fourth quarter will be cast as a temporary blip and a lesson that political uncertainty has unhelpful economic consequences. Investors also believe the upbeat story, hence the soaring Frankfurt stock market. The promise of a huge stimulus package from the European Central Bank (which Weidmann believes is unnecessary, such is his confidence) and the fall in value of the euro it has precipitated, when combined with the vast European bailouts funds now available, have convinced global investment funds that Europe is a one-way bet. Look beyond the figures and the chatter of ivory tower policymakers and you will find the story is radically different. Yes, Spain is growing. But its GDP growth in 2014 has made up only around half of its losses in 2013. It is still an economy in need of major investment to get back on its feet. Unemployment remains at disturbingly high levels and the state is held in contempt in many quarters. Why else would the radical anti-austerity Podemos party be polling ahead of all the established parties at the moment, and its leader be writing in praise of Tsipras (and the Catalonia independence movement still be in full swing)? Weidmann said the policies of austerity he supported would work slowly but staying the course was important. To him, a lost generation of young workers, who were denied skilled training and out of work for several years, is a matter for individual countries. He cannot see that sovereign states under the current arrangements are denied the funds to invest and improve productivity over the longer term. He cannot see that austerity, if only for this reason, is self-defeating. Even the Americans, who suffer long-term unemployment at all age levels, worry about Europe\u2019s lost youth. President Obama has made it clear he favours a more lenient attitude to southern Europe from Germany and its supporters in Amsterdam and Helsinki. Weidmann, like so many policymakers lobbying to keep austerity measures in place, has a version of growth that satisfies investors (or shall we call them German savers) and leaves workers to pick up crumbs from the table. That is the point made by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who is arguing for the kind of stable, long-term investment that keeps both investors and workers happy. But the Greek kitty is bare and Varoufakis knows it. If he wins a bridging loan to keep the country afloat until the autumn he wants Brussels to sanction investment bonds that are eurozone-wide. Not eurobonds that replace and share existing debts. Such sharing is beyond the Germans at the moment.",

The two German chains now control more than 10% of the grocery market, according to data from Nielsen, as they continue to enjoy double-digit sales growth while their bigger rivals shrink. \u201cThe 10% market share for discounters has not been seen since the heyday of Kwik Save some 15 years ago,\u201d said Watkins. \u201cInitially built on the premise of saving money, the new wave of discounters are now a regular part of grocery shopping and have changed shopping habits forever.\u201d Watkins said switching to cheaper grocery brands had emerged as shoppers\u2019 prime tactic for saving money in a survey conducted by Nielsen in the last quarter of 2014. Nielsen\u2019s figures show a fall in sales at all \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets in the 12 weeks to 31 January, as they battled against changing habits by cutting prices. While there was a 1.7% rise in the number of items bought at Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, the value of sales fell 0.1%.",

Brent crude collapsed 60% from a high of $115 a barrel last summer to $45.19 in January, the lowest in almost six years, as a result of oversupply.

The FTSE 100 is now at 6872, up 44 points on the day and within 60 points of the closing peak of 6930 hit on 30 December 1999. The move follows a couple of attempts to reach new heights in 2014, but what has driven this latest tilt at the record? Hopes of a deal to solve Greek crisis News that Greece had called a snap election sent tremors through world markets, as investors feared the anti-austerity party Syriza would emerge triumphant and immediately ditch the country\u2019s bailout agreement with its creditors. In the event Syriza did win the vote, but in a busy first few days, both prime minister Alexis Tsipras and finance minister Yanis Varoufakis toured European leaders to explain their plans. While they immediately ruled out directly engaging with the troika of lenders - the EU, IMF and ECB - they came up with a proposed deal to cope with Greece\u2019s financial crisis without extending the bailout. These initial demands seem unlikely to satisfy the country\u2019s creditors, in particular Germany, and long and tortuous meetings between eurozone ministers have so far failed to show much progress. But with time running out - Greece\u2019s bailout deadline is the end of February - investors are hopeful that a deal can be reached before the cash runs out. This week\u2019s move by the European Central Bank to extend its emergency liquidity assistance for Greek banks by \u20ac5bn to \u20ac65bn (\u00a348bn) has also soothed some nerves. An agreed ceasefire in Ukraine has also helped European markets, with Germany\u2019s Dax pushing through 11,000 for the first time on Friday. Oil price recovery Oil prices, which hit five-year lows on fears of falling demand and oversupply, have recovered some ground, prompting suggestions the low could have been reached. Brent crude, which slumped from a peak of $115 (\u00a375) a barrel last year to less than $47, is now sitting at around $60. The recovery has helped energy and commodity companies, which had been cutting investment and writing off asset values as the low price of crude made projects increasingly uneconomic. The FTSE 100 is dominated by commodity companies. This is one of the reasons for its underperformance compared to other global markets, so the new stability in oil prices has given it some support. European Central Bank finally launches quantitative easing Markets have been supported in recent years by central banks turning on the money taps to boost economic growth, most notably the US Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly bond buying programme which only ended at the end of last year. But despite Mario Draghi, the ECB president, promising to do whatever it takes, the bank has been slow off the mark with its own QE programme, partly thanks to German opposition. However Draghi finally unveiled a \u20ac1tn bond buying programme at the end of January which will last until September 2016, and this gave another lift to share prices. Signs of global recovery The most recent spate of economic data has been fairly positive, including UK manfacturing and service data for January moving higher according to the latest purchasing managers\u2019 surveys. Even the beleaguered eurozone is showing signs of life, with the latest growth figures showing that the region\u2019s economy grew by 0.3% in the last quarter. No immediate US rate rise The US economy has been a strong performer recently, especially compared to the performance of the eurozone. But signs of weakness, with fourth-quarter GDP growth coming in at 2.6% compared to expectations of 3% and disappointing retail sales, mean that any imminent rise in US interest rates looks unlikely, the recent strong non-farm payroll and average earnings figures notwithstanding. Falling pound likely to boost UK companies earnings The weakness in sterling against the dollar over the past year or so - despite a recent mini-revival - benefits exporters, and the FTSE 100 has a high proportion of overseas earners. Goldman Sachs has estimated that some 60% of total sales among Britain\u2019s top 100 quoted companies come from overseas. Mining shares boosted by Australian rate cut and growth hopes The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to an all-time low of 2.25%, in an attempt to kickstart growth amid a slowdown in mining activity. The news gave a boost to the likes of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, which have major investments in the country. Other mining shares - which as indicated, dominate the FTSE 100 - have also stablised as oil and metals prices come off their lows.",

      "bodyText": "A judge has ruled that mining billionaire Gina Rinehart can view the second episode of Channel Nine\u2019s The House of Hancock before it airs. Rinehart\u2019s lawyers successfully applied to the supreme court to be given a copy of the concluding episode of the series before its scheduled airing on Sunday night. Australia\u2019s richest woman is seeking to determine whether the drama is defamatory in its portrayal of her fraught relationship with her late father, Lang Hancock, and his wife Rose, a former housemaid Rinehart employed to care for her father after her mother died. Justice Peter Garling said that based on promotional material and interviews about the second episode there was a real prospect the show would air statements that are not entirely accurate and perhaps even made up. He ordered Nine Network to hand over a DVD of the episode due to be broadcast on Sunday. It could only be viewed by Rinehart, her senior and junior counsel and a number of solicitors. \u201cI am satisfied the plaintiff is entitled to see it,\u201d he said. He said Rinehart\u2019s lawyers had to let the Nine Network know if they were going to make an application to stop the broadcast of the show by 9.15pm on Friday. If such an application was made the hearing would happen at midday on Saturday, he said. Rinehart\u2019s lawyers have argued that the actors may be engaging in false and misleading conduct by portraying events that never happened. At the supreme court hearing in Sydney on Friday, Garling called that argument \u201cnovel\u201d and said if applied it \u201ccould shut down all of Shakespeare\u2019s plays\u201d, the Australian reported. Rinehart\u2019s barrister Tom Blackburn SC also used a story on Nine\u2019s A Current Affair program on Thursday night to argue that much of the action in the drama is simply made up. A Current Affair interviewed the program\u2019s producer, Michael Cordell, and asked him: \u201cDid you make this stuff up?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re making a drama, we\u2019re not making a documentary,\u201d Cordell replied. The entertainment reporter Peter Ford was also interviewed about The House of Hancock and described it as a \u201cripping yarn\u201d straight out of the US television tradition. \u201cThis is a big explosive Dallas-type drama and a lot of it we didn\u2019t have to make up, a lot of it is on the public record,\u201d Ford told ACA. Rinehart\u2019s lawyers have seized on the ACA segment as evidence much of the action in the drama is fiction. \u201cThese exchanges are a clear admission not only that the miniseries contains matters that are untrue, but that your client knew that they were untrue when it broadcast the program,\u201d Rinehart\u2019s legal team wrote to Nine. \u201cMr Ford is further quoted as saying via other media after viewing the show that the second show contains \u2018an even more explosive conclusion this Sunday\u2019, and adds that it is \u2018must-see television on Sunday night, except for Mrs Rinehart, she should definitely make plans to go out to dinner next Sunday night.\u201d \u201cGiven your client\u2019s admissions that the programs contain untruths, and Peter Ford\u2019s boast after seeing the film on A Current Affair that the second program is \u2018even more explosive\u2019, and that our client should \u2018make plans to go out to dinner\u2019, we have reason to think that the second program may be defamatory of our client, contain injurious falsehoods about her, and involve your client in an accessorial breach [of] Australian consumer law.\u201d The legal letter also includes quotes from Ford who has seen both parts of the series. \u201cThey make her look like an obsessed, vindictive shrew,\u201d Ford says. \u201cI felt very sorry for her.

On the Nine website there are numerous links to archival material which viewers can access to compare the drama to the real events as described on TV news. The second episode covers the legal battle between Rinehart and Rose Hancock over Lang Hancock\u2019s estate, as well as the dramatic scenes when he died. It also covers more recent events when Rinehart\u2019s children took her to court over their inheritance. After the first part screened on Sunday night the executive director of Hancock Prospecting, Tad Watroba, issued a list of alleged errors in the program, including that Hancock had insulted his daughter over her weight. \u201cMr Hancock never told Mrs Rinehart that no one could ever love her, or that her husband never loved her,\u201d Watroba said. \u201cThe scene was made up and untrue. Her relationship with Mr Frank Rinehart was very loving, and her mother Hope loved her son-in-law also.\u201d Beginning on the first night of TV ratings for 2015 to an audience of 1.4 million, the two-part drama has been described by Nine as \u201cthe controversial and epic true story of the Hancock dynasty\u201d.",

Some people snapped photos and videos as they passed.</p> <p>The workers who were on strike are employed by Aviation Safeguards, part of Command Security \u2013 a company that provides baggage handlers and security guards to various airlines at New York City\u2019s airports.

      "bodyText": "Contract workers at New York\u2019s John F Kennedy airport took strike action on Thursday morning despite a recent letter sent by their employer warning of possible consequences including termination. British Airways and United Airlines passengers arriving at JFK were greeted by a picket line of striking baggage handlers. Some people snapped photos and videos as they passed. The workers who were on strike are employed by Aviation Safeguards, part of Command Security \u2013 a company that provides baggage handlers and security guards to various airlines at New York City\u2019s airports. About 100 of those workers handle baggage for British Airways and United Airlines at JFK. The reason for Thursday\u2019s strike was the lack of union representation, low wages and a hostile working environment, say the workers. The strike also served to prove a point, as Aviation Safeguards recently sent a letter to its employees informing them of potential consequences, including termination, for striking and speaking out. Holding signs that read \u201cStop Illegal Threats\u201d, the workers marched in circles and chanted: \u201cAirport workers under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back.\u201d \u201cThere have been no threats. There has been none of that,\u201d Craig P Coy, the CEO of Command Security, told the Guardian. The letter was only intended to inform the workers of what can happen to employees who strike, under the Railway Labor Act, if the company chose to act, he said. \u201cWe want to make sure the employees are aware and not surprised by what the law is,\u201d he said. According to the strike\u2019s organizers, only about three of the 27 Aviation Safeguards employees scheduled to work on Thursday morning went to work.
