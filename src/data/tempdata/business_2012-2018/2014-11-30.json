      "bodyText": "The battle for Christmas spending will intensify on Monday with 25 million shoppers expected to go online to buy gifts as a \u00a336.5bn month-long spending spree gets under way. Hot on the heels of Black Friday\u2019s orgy of spending comes Cyber Monday \u2013 another key date in the festive shopping calendar. Internet industry body IMRG predicts \u00a3451,000 will be spent every minute on retailers\u2019 websites, resulting in almost \u00a3650m of sales on Monday. A separate study by retail finance specialists Pay4Later estimates that 24.9m people will do some of their Christmas shopping on Monday \u2013 with almost 1m doing half their shopping. Mintel analyst John Mercer said it was difficult to compare Black Friday and Cyber Monday as the former was manufactured by retailers whereas the latter is a spending spike created by the first Monday after many Britons banks their last pre-Christmas pay cheque. \u201cFriday will have pulled forward a little bit of Christmas spending,\u201d said Mercer. He said that even though customers fought over bargains in some supermarkets, the number of items being discounted was actually quite limited. Mercer had predicted before Black Friday that promotions would generate an additional \u00a3200m of non-food sales, taking total spending on the day above \u00a31.2bn \u2013 about 20% higher than the month\u2019s average daily spend. That estimate could now be conservative, he admitted, even when compared with last year\u2019s \u00a3100m boost, as several retailers are reporting bumper sales. In a series of tweets, the Dixons Carphone chief executive, Sebastian James, said Black Friday had been the \u201cbiggest day in the Currys/PC World history\u201d while Saturday looked like it was \u201cgoing to be big too\u201d. There were hour-long queues at times to get on the Curry\u2019s website and James said traffic peaked at five times the level seen on Black Friday last year. Rival website ao.com said it had enjoyed its best day\u2019s sales in its 14-year history and was looking to repeat its success with more than 200 Cyber Monday new deals on items ranging from washing machines to Blu-Ray DVD players. \u201cThe robust structure of our site held firm and we definitely picked up traffic from those retailers whose sites crashed,\u201d said John Coulter, its retail director. While the websites of Currys, Argos and Tesco struggled to cope with Friday\u2019s shopper deluge, Amazon had no such problems, reporting that it was the busiest day on its UK website, with more than 5.5m items ordered. The previous record of 4.1m was set on Cyber Monday last year. Amazon\u2019s \u201cBlack Friday Deals Week\u201d has now segued into Cyber Monday when it will release new offers, including discounts on TomTom satnavs and Sennheiser headphones, every 10 minutes. Mintel is predicting a 3% increase in spending throughout December \u2013 not quite matching last year\u2019s rise of 4% \u2013 taking the festive blowout to \u00a336.5bn. Its researchers forecast that nearly 13% of all retail sales will involve a mouse rather than a till, with \u00a34.7bn spent online this month. A poll of 500 shoppers by management consultants Accenture found that two-thirds planned to spend 50% or more of their Christmas gift pounds online. Analysts at IMRG think that although Cyber Monday will see bumper takings, it could be eclipsed by next Monday \u2013 the so-called Manic Monday\u2013with sales of \u00a3676.5m anticipated as faster delivery times, coupled with widespread ownership of smartphones and tablets, encourages Britons to leave their shopping later and later. Online traffic on Manic Monday is expected to be up 26% year on year, with shoppers spending an average of \u00a3470,000 each minute. \u201cChristmas 2014 is on track to be another record breaking year for online retail in the UK,\u201d said James Miller, senior retail consultant at Experian Marketing Services. \u201cContinuing a trend we identified last year, Cyber Monday will no longer be the busiest pre-Christmas online shopping day, with Manic Monday expected to take the lead. With increased confidence in the standard of delivery services and click-and-collect, we expect to see people break away from traditional shopping habits.\u201d Some industry experts are concerned that events such as Black Friday are feeding a culture of discounting that makes it difficult for store groups to sell anything at full price, with some pricing surveys suggesting that discounting is already more prevalent than last year. \u201cThey are creating an expectation among shoppers that this [discounting] will be an annual event,\u201d said Mercer who claimed Marks &amp; Spencer was clever not to label its \u201c4 Magical Days\u201d promotion as a Black Friday event, enabling it to \u201cmanage expectations for future years\u201d.",

Instead of the note ending after he struck the key, he wanted to shape and slide the sound from the piano just as a guitarist could bend notes. Such a frustration has led, after four years in development, to a futuristic recreation of the piano \u2013 a sleek black keyboard instrument which allows the keys to blend into each other and lets sounds be tweaked, manipulated and elongated. Underneath the silicone rubber keyboard of the Seaboard, launched by Lamb\u2019s company Roli, squats an array of sensors that react to the touch of a finger pressing down, changing the pitch and volume of the sound according to the touch. The technology could soon find its way into games consoles, cars and even robotics devices. \u201cAs a keyboard player it felt like I should be able to play and use the same keyboard finger as I am using to activate the note to vary it,\u201d says Lamb. Without any knowledge of sensor engineering or material science, the philosophy graduate took apart pianos and keyboards during a masters degree at the Royal College of Art in London to try and make sense of his idea. \u201cI wanted a solution that was both intuitive \u2013 based on years of practising the piano \u2013 and very tactile so I started playing with these wave-like surfaces \u2026 and realising you could get something that was both tactile and intuitive. It is intuitive because it has exactly the same layout as a piano so you can use the same scales to play it and it is tactile because you can feel right where you are on those waves.\u201d After spending \u00a3700 of his \u00a31,000 life savings on paying an engineer for the early prototype, Lamb realised he would not be able to buy in talent so he gleaned enough knowledge of the various fields \u2013 starting with basic coding books \u2013 to develop his idea in the spare room of his flat. What resulted was the Seaboard \u2013 an instrument which allows the musician to bend and slide between notes via the bumps and grooves while also moving along the edges for more elaborate sounds and controlling the volume by pressure. Lamb was trying to emulate his favourite childhood jazz pianist Thelonious Monk who was said to be trying to play \u201cbetween the keys\u201d. Like other synthesisers, an array of sounds can be channelled through the Seaboard \u2013 from wind instruments to elaborate dance beats and, of course, the traditional piano. If someone is able to play the piano, they will also be able to play the Seaboard, says Lamb. \u201cUnder the silicone is an array of pressure sensors. The force is diffused through the silicone on to this pressure pad and then we read those for signatures and translate them into musical notes and data. Then we are able to filter them in different ways according to the sounds that are used and filter them into the sound engines in the right ways,\u201d he says. The Seaboard was unveiled in 2013 at the South by South West festival in Austin, Texas, gaining recognition for an innovation in music \u2013 a field not known for a stream of new products. It won plaudits too from musicians. John Moore, a former member of the Jesus and Mary Chain band, said that \u201cin the right hands, it could help to create something really marvellous\u201d. The jazz-pop singer and songwriter Jamie Cullum describes a \u201csensory experience I am not used to when I play\u201d. After a year of the Seaboard being on sale \u2013 there are three version, ranging between \u00a31,200 and \u00a35,600 \u2013 production cannot keep up with demand, and a waiting list of between three and four months for the machines which are handmade in London. Now with 60 staff, Roli raised \u00a310.6m earlier this year in funding, bringing to more than \u00a312.7m the total amount invested so far. The hefty price tag has attracted critics but Lamb says that they have plans to reduce it in future so that the new device can be thought of in a similar vein as a keyboard, albeit remaining distinct. The Seaboard is a more organic way of playing, says Lamb, it is like you are touching the sound. \u201cThere is a more organic connection between your hands and the sound.\u201d While Lamb set out to change the piano, in creating the technology that forms the keyboard \u2013 called SEA Interactive \u2013 he has happened upon a way to interact with machines which could stretch far beyond music into sectors such as gaming and robotics. Staff at Roli are looking at ways to use the sensor technology in areas where precise control is important. \u201cThe technology that we have built to create the Seaboard can be used to shape other things,\u201d he says. When he played computer games in the past, there was little to relate the figure on the screen jumping around to the single click on the joystick. With the Roli technology, there is the opportunity to use \u201cmore intelligent gestures\u201d, he says. \u201cIn this next phase of technology development, interface is hugely important because computers are so fast and so advanced, our brains are so fast and advanced, and yet so many of the ways we touch and control technology are tremendously antiquated.\u201d An unlikely journey With parents who were \u201ckind of hippies\u201d, Roland Lamb never had a TV at home but instead found his main form of entertainment in the piano. From New Hampshire, on the US east coast, he moved to Japan to practice Zen buddhism at 18, travelling around Asia and exploring his interest in various types of music. He then went to Harvard, studying classical Chinese and Sanskrit philosophy.",

    "webTitle": "Chancellor, it\u2019s time to put more money where the makers are", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three years ago, George Osborne set out his dream for a rebalanced economy, using his 2011 budget to declare: \u201cWe want the words \u2018Made in Britain, Created in Britain, Designed in Britain, Invented in Britain\u2019 to drive our nation forward. A Britain carried aloft by the march of the makers.\u201d He reprised the theme this year, describing his spring budget as one \u201cfor the makers\u201d. It was heartening talk for an industrial sector decimated under Margaret Thatcher and further marginalised by the rise of finance and dotcoms and by a generally unhealthy emphasis on the service sector. Naturally, the hope is that Osborne will use this week\u2019s autumn statement to reinforce his support for the nation\u2019s \u201cmakers\u201d. It comes at a particularly jittery moment for manufacturers. Growth in the sector is on course to be faster than for the economy as a whole this year, but exports are tailing off as demand drops in Britain\u2019s key market, the embattled eurozone. Domestic demand is taking up some of the slack, but overseas sales are vital if manufacturers want to claw back the deep losses of the recession. Manufacturing output is still well below its pre-crisis peak. The service industries are the only sector to have exceeded pre-downturn levels and they are still the largest and steadiest contributor to economic growth. The makers will want to know how Osborne plans to power their march. Talk is helpful when it comes to business confidence and intentions. But talk is also cheap, and the giveaway pot is empty. Osborne, so keen to trumpet his \u201clong-term economic plan\u201d, must seize this moment to show he is serious about creating the foundations for a cutting-edge, resilient manufacturing sector. We can\u2019t wait for the eurozone to recover to stop exports going into reverse. \u201cMade in Britain\u201d success can only come from a well-funded, well-organised innovation strategy. For now, the UK lags behind countries such as Germany when it comes to supporting research and development (R&amp;D). That was the recent assessment from Hermann Hauser, the technology entrepreneur who originally proposed the UK\u2019s Catapult centres, where scientists can turn their inventions into commercial products. Hauser said in his progress report this month that he was \u201cgenuinely surprised\u201d at how well the first centres had done. But he is calling for more money to keep them at the top of their game and to open more. Latest figures for R&amp;D spending tell the same story: progress is encouraging, but we\u2019re still behind our competitors. Business expenditure on R&amp;D continued to grow in 2013 \u2013 it\u2019s now back above its pre-recession peak \u2013 but it remains weak by international standards. At the equivalent of 1.1% of GDP, it is, according to manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF, lower than the 1.6% average for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The EEF argues that state support makes all the difference. Talk to a small manufacturer, or a university scientist with a spin-out idea, and they will tell you the same. Catapult centres were supposed to bridge the \u201cvalley of death\u201d between the idea and the commercial reality by having the state share some of the cost of making and testing prototypes. The idea was modelled on the longer-established, bigger and better-funded Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany. The German experience and the success of the UK centres shows that the partly taxpayer-funded model works. At their best, such hubs open innovation to companies of all sizes, rather than concentrating the spoils of scientific breakthroughs in the hands of rich multinationals. Money is almost too tight to mention, but if Osborne does care about long-term prosperity he has to fund this game of catch-up. EEF chief economist Lee Hopley spells it out: \u201cOur key hope is to get something really positive around innovation, with a big pound sign in front of it.\u201d BG\u2019s pay blunder The City now has a textbook example of how not to recruit a chief executive, courtesy of blue-chip oil group BG. That is not to say that the City doubts the stellar background of the new man, Helge Lund, who turned Norway\u2019s Statoil into a world-class exploration company during his 10 years at the top. But having made a widely applauded choice, the oil and gas company went on to achieve the rare feat of uniting business leaders, politicians and shareholders, who have all lined up to criticise the \u00a325m pay deal that has been devised for Lund. The timing is not helpful: Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, pointed out last week that a general election is just six months away, and packages like Lund\u2019s risk thrusting executive pay back on to the agenda. As it is, BG is the first major company to try to override its own pay policy, which was approved in a shareholder vote only six months ago. These votes are in their infancy, having been introduced by business secretary Vince Cable last year with the aim of kicking any future rows over pay into the long grass for three years. BG perhaps should have thought about this when it decided Lund should get a one-off award of shares worth \u00a312m \u2013 a handout too big to be allowed under those rules approved by its shareholders in the spring. Even worse, the company has made it clear that if investors do not give the package their formal blessing, Lund is under no obligation to turn up for work in March. This puts shareholders in an unenviable position: approve a pay deal that breaks all the rules (and face criticism from politicians for being too supine to take a stand) or risk a collapse in the share price if the candidate walks way. It is a sorry tale. The BG board \u2013 under chairman Andrew Gould \u2013 is damaged even though it found a superb candidate; and Lund, even before he starts his job, is already being associated with his pay packet rather than his management credentials. Gender top of the Swiss agenda Switzerland goes to the polls today to vote on whether the country\u2019s central bank should triple its gold reserves. And the answer, after all that effort, is likely to be no. Campaigners for global financial reform, and some rival governments, would probably prefer the country to tackle more urgent issues such as banking transparency. But they should note that there is one area where this hub of financial opacity is showing welcome maturity. The Swiss government is proposing a law recommending that women occupy at least 30% of management and board posts at top listed companies \u2013 such as UBS and pharmaceuticals group Novartis. This would not be a binding quota, unlike the regimes in neighbouring France and Germany, but it is a welcome start. Indeed, if Switzerland put a binding quota to a referendum, a yes vote would win rare applause for its business sector.",

      "body": "<p>Three years ago, George Osborne set out his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2011-budget-britain-open-for-business\" title=\"\">dream for a rebalanced economy</a>, using his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget-2011\" title=\"\">2011 budget</a> to declare: \u201cWe want the words \u2018Made in Britain, Created in Britain, Designed in Britain, Invented in Britain\u2019 to drive our nation forward. A Britain carried aloft by the march of the makers.\u201d</p> <p>He reprised the theme this year, describing <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-budget-2014-speech\" title=\"\">his spring budget</a> as one \u201cfor the makers\u201d. It was heartening talk for an industrial sector decimated under Margaret Thatcher and further marginalised by the rise of finance and dotcoms and by a generally unhealthy emphasis on the service sector.</p> <p>Naturally, the hope is that Osborne will use this week\u2019s autumn statement to reinforce his support for the nation\u2019s \u201cmakers\u201d. It comes at a particularly jittery moment for manufacturers. Growth in the sector is on course to be faster than for the economy as a whole this year, but exports are tailing off as demand drops in Britain\u2019s key market, the embattled eurozone. Domestic demand is taking up some of the slack, but overseas sales are vital if manufacturers want to claw back the deep losses of the recession.</p> <p>Manufacturing output is still well below its pre-crisis peak. The service industries are the only sector to have exceeded pre-downturn levels and they are still the largest and steadiest contributor to economic growth.</p> <p>The makers will want to know how Osborne plans to power their march. Talk is helpful when it comes to business confidence and intentions. But talk is also cheap, and the giveaway pot is empty. Osborne, so keen to trumpet his \u201clong-term economic plan\u201d, must seize this moment to show he is serious about creating the foundations for a cutting-edge, resilient manufacturing sector.</p> <p>We can\u2019t wait for the eurozone to recover to stop exports going into reverse. \u201cMade in Britain\u201d success can only come from a well-funded, well-organised innovation strategy. For now, the UK lags behind countries such as Germany when it comes to supporting research and development (R&amp;D). That was the recent assessment from Hermann Hauser, the technology entrepreneur who originally proposed the UK\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/16/catapult-centres-research-reality\" title=\"\">Catapult centres</a>, where scientists can turn their inventions into commercial products. Hauser said in his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hauser-report-calls-for-long-term-expansion-of-catapult-network\" title=\"\">progress report</a> this month that he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/05/hermann-hauser-science-catapults-more-innovation-uk\" title=\"\">\u201cgenuinely surprised\u201d at how well the first centres had done</a>. But he is calling for more money to keep them at the top of their game and to open more.</p> <p>Latest figures for R&amp;D spending tell the same story: progress is encouraging, but we\u2019re still behind our competitors. Business expenditure on R&amp;D continued to grow in 2013 \u2013 it\u2019s now back above its pre-recession peak \u2013 but it remains weak by international standards. At the equivalent of 1.1% of GDP, it is, according to manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF, lower than the 1.6% average for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p> <p>The EEF argues that state support makes all the difference. Talk to a small manufacturer, or a university scientist with a spin-out idea, and they will tell you the same. Catapult centres were supposed to bridge the \u201cvalley of death\u201d between the idea and the commercial reality by having the state share some of the cost of making and testing prototypes. The idea was modelled on the longer-established, bigger and better-funded Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany.</p> <p>The German experience and the success of the UK centres shows that the partly taxpayer-funded model works. At their best, such hubs open innovation to companies of all sizes, rather than concentrating the spoils of scientific breakthroughs in the hands of rich multinationals.</p> <p>Money is almost too tight to mention, but if Osborne does care about long-term prosperity he has to fund this game of catch-up. EEF chief economist Lee Hopley spells it out: \u201cOur key hope is to get something really positive around innovation, with a big pound sign in front of it.\u201d</p> <h2>BG\u2019s pay blunder</h2> <p>The City now has a textbook example of how not to recruit a chief executive, courtesy of blue-chip oil group BG. That is not to say that the City doubts the stellar background of the new man, Helge Lund, who turned Norway\u2019s Statoil into a world-class exploration company during his 10 years at the top.</p> <p>But having made a widely applauded choice, the oil and gas company went on to achieve the rare feat of uniting business leaders, politicians and shareholders, who have all lined up to criticise the \u00a325m pay deal that has been devised for Lund.</p> <p>The timing is not helpful: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/25/bg-pay-deal-excessive-institute-of-directors\" title=\"\">Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, pointed out last week that a general election is just six months away</a>, and packages like Lund\u2019s risk thrusting executive pay back on to the agenda.</p> <p>As it is, BG is the first major company to try to override its own pay policy, which was approved in a shareholder vote only six months ago. These votes are in their infancy, having been introduced by business secretary Vince Cable last year with the aim of kicking any future rows over pay into the long grass for three years.</p> <p>BG perhaps should have thought about this when it decided Lund should get a one-off award of shares worth \u00a312m \u2013 a handout too big to be allowed under those rules approved by its shareholders in the spring.</p> <p>Even worse, the company has made it clear that if investors do not give the package their formal blessing, Lund is under no obligation to turn up for work in March.</p> <p>This puts shareholders in an unenviable position: approve a pay deal that breaks all the rules (and face criticism from politicians for being too supine to take a stand) or risk a collapse in the share price if the candidate walks way.</p> <p>It is a sorry tale. The BG board \u2013 under chairman Andrew Gould \u2013 is damaged even though it found a superb candidate; and Lund, even before he starts his job, is already being associated with his pay packet rather than his management credentials.</p> <h2>Gender top of the Swiss agenda<br></h2> <p>Switzerland goes to the polls today to vote on whether the country\u2019s central bank should triple its gold reserves. And the answer, after all that effort, is likely to be no. Campaigners for global financial reform, and some rival governments, would probably prefer the country to tackle more urgent issues such as banking transparency. But they should note that there is one area where this hub of financial opacity is showing welcome maturity. The Swiss government is proposing a law recommending that women occupy at least 30% of management and board posts at top listed companies \u2013 such as UBS and pharmaceuticals group Novartis. This would not be a binding quota, unlike the regimes in neighbouring France and Germany, but it is a welcome start. Indeed, if Switzerland put a binding quota to a referendum, a yes vote would win rare applause for its business sector.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the first Thursday of every month, nine men and women meet within the marble halls of the Bank of England to decide whether the nation\u2019s mortgages will get more expensive and to answer the \u00a3375bn question: is it time to reverse the Bank\u2019s electronic printing presses, which pumped money into the economy during the financial crisis. More specifically, seven men and two women make those vital decisions. As recently as six months ago it was nine men. It was only the arrival of Nemat (Minouche) Shafik, a former World Bank official, and Kristin Forbes, a US academic, at the monetary policy committee that ended an all-male run that had lasted for four years. Around the same time Charlotte Hogg was poached from Santander to become the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer, as part of governor Mark Carney\u2019s attempt to get more women into the 320-year-old institution. And early next year in the US, Janet Yellen will mark the anniversary of her becoming the first woman to run the Federal Reserve. But despite these appointments, researchers warn that progress in getting women into such influential jobs will remain slow because not enough women are studying economics. In the UK, women make up just 27% of economics students, despite accounting for 57% of the undergraduate population, according to a study from the University of Southampton last month. This gap has remained unchanged for almost 20 years, even though female undergraduates now outnumber men in law and medicine, while almost equal numbers study business. Fewer girls than boys take A-level maths, a common prerequisite for an economics degree, but according to the Southampton researchers, those girls who did were more likely to get top grades, but then less likely to go on to economics at university. Mirco Tonin, lead author of the study, thinks deeper cultural factors put women off the \u201cdismal science\u201d. \u201cMaybe when people think about economics what comes to mind is a male role model,\u201d he says. Kate Barker, who served on the MPC for nine years, was at times the only woman and says it was an odd experience. \u201cIt is not because I felt crushed or got at... There is just something odd about being the only woman on a panel of nine. It was much better when [former members] Marion Bell and Rachel Lomax were on. When there were three women it felt much more normal.\u201d She was invited to help recruit her successors when her fixed term came to an end, but says: \u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attract as many applications from women as we would like. On the first two occasions we appointed men and we felt uneasy about perpetuating an all-male panel...but equally you have to appoint people of the right calibre.\u201d DeAnne Julius, the only woman among the founding members of the MPC, says the finding that more than 50% of undergraduates are female is probably more important than the numbers studying economics, since it makes women\u2019s talents available to the economy at large. But that does not mean the economics establishment should rest easy. \u201cI think there is something wrong with economics,\u201d she said. \u201cThis [lack of women] is a symptom that something is wrong.\u201d Julius points the finger at university economics curriculums that centre increasingly on statistical modelling and have lost sight of real-world problems. Barker agrees. \u201cThe issue about economics as a subject and how it is taught runs beyond the gender issue,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe if people felt there was more relevance, they would do it.\u201d Olivia Wills, a fourth-year undergraduate studying economics and politics at the University of Sheffield, says her inspirations were pioneering scholars of human behaviour, the psychologist Dan Ariely and Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, as well as an \u201cincredibly enthusiastic\u201d economics teacher at her sixth form. But university offered a discipline clinging to nineteenth century orthodoxies, a textbook world where \u201crational economic man\u201d acts in a self-interested and predictable way: \u201cEconomics as it is taught at university is incredibly one-dimensional and doesn\u2019t allow for nuances of human behaviour.\u201d She is part of Rethinking Economics, a student movement campaigning for economics to become a more evidence-based, critically minded discipline focused on real-world problems. A co-leader of the campaign, Yuan Yang, says economics is often seen as \u201cdetached from the community\u201d and associated with \u201cself-serving professions\u201d \u2013 such as investment banking and consultancy: \u201cThe economics we are taught is increasingly out of touch with real problems and perhaps that puts off women, and people in general, who don\u2019t want careers for economic gain.\u201d She thinks more people overall, men and women, would choose economics if it was seen as a \u201cmethod of enquiry\u201d rather than a springboard into the City. The notion that the speculative frenzy that led to the 2008 crisis would have been less disastrous if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Sisters is well-worn \u2013 repeated by everyone from Labour MP Harriet Harman to IMF head Christine Lagarde. But Julie Nelson, economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, thinks we should be wary of stereotyping qualities such as \u201ccarefulness\u201d as female and \u201crisk-taking\u201d as male, promoting the idea that women are best suited to mopping up after a crisis, rather than running companies or setting policy during the good times. A survey of the profession by the American Economic Association found men and women holding different views on the solution to economic problems. Male economists were more likely to oppose government regulation requiring employers to buy health insurance for workers. Female economists were more likely to oppose free-trade agreements unless they were linked to improvements in foreign workers\u2019 rights, to prevent domestic industries from being undercut. Nelson is sceptical: \u201cAny difference between male and female economists is likely to be more an issue of self-selection than of any innately different interests. To brave a male-dominated field such as economics, a woman pretty much has to be at least a bit of a feminist, and that correlates with other more progressive views.\u201d Despite her frustrations at Sheffield, Wills doesn\u2019t regret her choice. She hopes to do a PhD focused on health economics. \u201cNow I am in economics I am having a brilliant time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the biggest challenge is getting women into economics and making them realise it is not a hostile environment.\u201d SHE-CONOMISTS HARRIET TAYLOR MILL 1807-58 Philosopher John Stuart Mill dedicated his book On Liberty to \u201cthe friend and wife whose exalted sense of truth and right was my strongest incitement\u201d. Harriet contributed a chapter to Mill\u2019s The Principles of Political Economy. A later essay, \u2018The Enfranchisement of Women\u2019, called for women to be allowed to work outside the home \u2013 but was published under her husband\u2019s name. In her own words: \u201cWhen we ask why the existence of one-half of the species should be merely ancillary to that of the other\u2026.the only reason that can be given, is that men like it.\u201d JOAN ROBINSON 1903-83 Robinson was one of the most brilliant economists of the postwar years. She taught Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, and reserved her most caustic put-downs for the mathematical models that spellbound other economists. Some believe it was her admiration for Mao Zedong and Kim Il Sung that stood in the way of a Nobel prize. In her own words: \u201cThe purpose of studying economics is not to acquire a set of ready-made answers to economic questions, but to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists.\u201d ELINOR OSTROM 1933-2012 The only woman to win a Nobel prize in economics: she shared it with Oliver Williamson in 2009. Discouraged from studying maths and economics, she graduated in political science in 1965. Ostrom won her Nobel for overturning the idea that people will always destroy a common resource through overuse. Studying Maine lobster fishers and Nepalese foresters, she showed that people can develop grassroots rules to manage a resource, a theory she expanded to climate change. In her own words: \u201cSome of our mentality about what it means to have a good life is, I think, not going to help us in the next 50 years.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On the first Thursday of every month, nine men and women meet within the marble halls of the Bank of England to decide whether the nation\u2019s mortgages will get more expensive and to answer the \u00a3375bn question: is it time to reverse the Bank\u2019s electronic printing presses, which pumped money into the economy during the financial crisis.</p> <p>More specifically, seven men and two women make those vital decisions. As recently as six months ago it was nine men. It was only the arrival of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/18/nemat-shafik-economist-stellar-cv-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">Nemat (Minouche) Shafik, a former World Bank official</a>, and Kristin Forbes, a US academic, at the monetary policy committee that ended an all-male run that had lasted for four years.</p> <p>Around the same time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jun/20/profile-charlotte-hogg-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">Charlotte Hogg was poached from Santander</a> to become the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer, as part of governor Mark Carney\u2019s attempt to get more women into the 320-year-old institution.

In the UK, women make up just 27% of economics students, despite accounting for 57% of the undergraduate population, according to a study from the University of Southampton last month. This gap has remained unchanged for almost 20&#xa0;years, even though female undergraduates now outnumber men in law and medicine, while almost equal numbers study business.</p> <p>Fewer girls than boys take A-level maths, a common prerequisite for an economics degree, but according to the Southampton researchers, those girls who did were more likely to get top grades, but then less likely to go on to economics at university.</p> <p>Mirco Tonin, lead author of the study, thinks deeper cultural factors put women off the \u201cdismal science\u201d. \u201cMaybe when people think about economics what comes to mind is a male role model,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Kate Barker, who served on the MPC for nine years, was at times the only woman and says it was an odd experience. \u201cIt is not because I felt crushed or got at... There is just something odd about being the only woman on a panel of nine. It was much better when [former members] Marion Bell and Rachel Lomax were on. When there were three women it felt much more normal.\u201d</p> <p>She was invited to help recruit her successors when her fixed term came to an end, but says: \u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attract as many applications from women as we would like. On the first two occasions we appointed men and we felt uneasy about perpetuating an all-male panel...but equally you have to appoint people of the right calibre.\u201d</p> <p>DeAnne Julius, the only woman among the founding members of the MPC, says the finding that more than 50% of undergraduates are female is probably more important than the numbers studying economics, since it makes women\u2019s talents available to the economy at large. But that does not mean the economics establishment should rest easy. \u201cI think there is something wrong with economics,\u201d she said. \u201cThis [lack of women] is a symptom that something is wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Julius points the finger at university economics curriculums that centre increasingly on statistical modelling and have lost sight of real-world problems. Barker agrees. \u201cThe issue about economics as a subject and how it is taught runs beyond the gender issue,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe if people felt there was more relevance, they would do it.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia Wills, a fourth-year undergraduate studying economics and politics at the University of Sheffield, says her inspirations were pioneering scholars of human behaviour, the psychologist Dan Ariely and Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, as well as an \u201cincredibly enthusiastic\u201d economics teacher at her sixth form. But university offered a discipline clinging to nineteenth century orthodoxies, a textbook world where \u201crational economic man\u201d acts in a self-interested and predictable way: \u201cEconomics as it is taught at university is incredibly one-dimensional and doesn\u2019t allow for nuances of human behaviour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9dc73321496d5cda64c30277fe87b8a0bbe6bbc9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/28/1417196123778/d3680f5f-a856-4523-a06a-4b4c3fdadb33-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">IMF managing director Christine Lagarde.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JOSHUA ROBERTS/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is part of Rethinking Economics, a student movement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/24/students-post-crash-economics\" title=\"\">campaigning for economics to become a more evidence-based, critically minded discipline focused on real-world problems</a>. A co-leader of the campaign, Yuan Yang, says economics is often seen as \u201cdetached from the community\u201d and associated with \u201cself-serving professions\u201d \u2013 such as investment banking and consultancy: \u201cThe economics we are taught is increasingly out of touch with real problems and perhaps that puts off women, and people in general, who don\u2019t want careers for economic gain.\u201d</p> <p>She thinks more people overall, men and women, would choose economics if it was seen as a \u201cmethod of enquiry\u201d rather than a springboard into the City.</p> <p>The notion that the speculative frenzy that led to the 2008 crisis would have been less disastrous if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Sisters is well-worn \u2013 repeated by everyone from Labour MP Harriet Harman to IMF head Christine Lagarde. But Julie Nelson, economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, thinks we should be wary of stereotyping qualities such as \u201ccarefulness\u201d as female and \u201crisk-taking\u201d as male, promoting the idea that women are best suited to mopping up after a crisis, rather than running companies or setting policy during the good times.</p> <p>A survey of the profession by the American Economic Association found men and women holding different views on the solution to economic problems. Male economists were more likely to oppose government regulation requiring employers to buy health insurance for workers. Female economists were more likely to oppose free-trade agreements unless they were linked to improvements in foreign workers\u2019 rights, to prevent domestic industries from being undercut.</p> <p>Nelson is sceptical: \u201cAny difference between male and female economists is likely to be more an issue of self-selection than of any innately different interests. To brave a male-dominated field such as economics, a woman pretty much has to be at least a bit of a feminist, and that correlates with other more progressive views.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her frustrations at Sheffield, Wills doesn\u2019t regret her choice. She hopes to do a PhD focused on health economics. \u201cNow I am in economics I am having a brilliant time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the biggest challenge is getting women into economics and making them realise it is not a hostile environment.\u201d</p> <h2>SHE-CONOMISTS</h2> <p><strong>HARRIET TAYLOR MILL 1807-58</strong><br>Philosopher John Stuart Mill dedicated his book <em>On Liberty</em> to \u201cthe friend and wife whose exalted sense of truth and right was my strongest incitement\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Convergence has come to our mobile phones, laptops and TV screens \u2013 and now it is the turn of Britain\u2019s fragmented communications industry. BT revealed last week that it was considering buying the mobile network O2, and is also in early-stage talks with the UK\u2019s largest network, EE. Investment bankers are alert to the prospect that BT\u2019s dive back into mobile, 13 years after spinning off the company that became O2, will trigger copycat mergers across the telecoms and pay-TV sector. The much-hyped concept of communication supergroups offering everything from Premier League football rights to internet on the go, already established in continental Europe, seems about to become a reality in the UK. \u201cThe horse has bolted out of the stable door,\u201d says Deutsche Bank\u2019s telecoms analyst Robert Grindle. \u201cThe market now is going down a convergent route. The competitive forces have been unleashed and things are going to have to shake out.\u201d The landscape will change for consumers too. Not every household is interested in a \u201cquadplay\u201d bundle, which means buying TV, mobile, home phone and broadband from the same company. But customers could benefit in other ways. Firstly, analysts are forecasting a price drop: as well as giving away its BT Sport channels to customers that take its broadband, BT could soon be adding discounted mobile connections to that package. BT\u2019s move back into mobile could also help those waiting for a faster internet connection as competitors retaliate. Rivals such as Vodafone and TalkTalk may choose to hit back where BT is strongest, by stepping up investment in their own superfast fibre networks. The big mobile, broadband and pay-TV companies, from Sky to Vodafone, must now consider their options. Most have already begun encroaching on each other\u2019s lines of business. Below, we set out what the future could hold for the eight major players. Vodafone It may rank third by customers, but Vodafone seems the most determined of the UK\u2019s four mobile networks to stay in the race. It has been busy buying broadband and TV operators in Europe, and laying fibre-optic cables in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland. In the UK, Vodafone\u2019s 20 million customers will have broadband and a TV set-top box if they want one from next spring. \u201cIf BT comes more into mobile then we will go more into consumer broadband,\u201d Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao warned days before BT\u2019s talks with O2 were confirmed. For broadband, Vodafone will use the fibre it acquired when it bought the UK network built by Cable &amp; Wireless, which so far has been reserved for business customers. This only covers half of telephone exchanges. To reach homes, it may lay its own fibre, or rent them wholesale from BT. For TV, Vodafone is thought likely to join forces with Sky, distributing the satellite broadcaster\u2019s Now set-top box. Could this lead to a full-blown corporate wedding? Rupert Murdoch would have to part with his 39% stake in Sky. Analysts at Espirito Santo say Vodafone, currently valued at \u00a360bn, would need \u00a320bn to take full control \u2013 a 30% premium to Sky\u2019s current valuation. Sky \u201cWe\u2019re going to be led by what we see the customer wants,\u201d said Sky boss Jeremy Darroch last month. So far, his verdict is that customers are not clamouring for quadplay. But Sky is thinking about mobile and broadband. It is reportedly discussing renting airtime from Vodafone, for a Virgin Mobile-style virtual network where its brand piggybacks on another company\u2019s infrastructure. A joint venture in York with TalkTalk has seen the pair invest \u00a310m between them and team up with specialist CityFibre to build an ultra-high-speed network \u2013 1 gigabit per second \u2013 that will take fibre-optic cables all the way to the door. Barclays analysts believe this model could be rolled out to Britain\u2019s 47 second-tier cities, which include Inverness and Bristol, at a cost of \u00a31.4bn. Not cheap, particularly with the next Premier League football rights auction looming. Virgin Media Virgin is now part of US media tycoon John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global empire, the largest cable firm in the world with operations in 14 countries. That means Liberty owns a virtual network, Virgin Mobile, but no masts in Britain, at a time when the growth of mobile internet use is challenging the business model for mobile virtual networks (MVNOs). MVNOs made a profit by bulk-buying minutes from operators and then reselling them at a profit to consumers \u2013 but making a margin from selling on expensive data for mobile internet usage is much more difficult. In a note, Macquarie analyst Guy Peddy said: \u201cIn our view, current MVNO models are breaking.\u201d Merging with Vodafone could offer a solution, but so far rumours of an alliance remain just that. BT If BT balks at EE\u2019s potential \u00a312bn price tag and fails to agree terms with a (probably less expensive) O2, there is a fallback plan. The former state-owned telecoms group bought a chunk of spectrum in the 4G auction. It plans to combine this with its home Wi-Fi networks and special miniature masts known as femtocells, installed on telephone exchanges and on its street cabinets, to create a patched-together mobile network. BT has also agreed a deal to rent airtime from EE. Under this cobbled-together system, dubbed an \u201cinside-out\u201d network, a BT customer\u2019s mobile call would begin at home on Wi-Fi, move into the street using BT\u2019s femtocells broadcasting over its 4G spectrum, and continue in the car using EE\u2019s masts. For a fraction of the cost of building a fully fledged network, BT is threatening to introduce a fifth player in the market. Such a move could send prices and profits tumbling. Good news for consumers, bad news for networks. No wonder EE and O2 are keen to sell. TalkTalk With no fibre-optic network, no mobile phone masts and no valuable pay-TV content to call its own, TalkTalk is looking increasingly stranded in a converging world. There is a plan to extend its fibre pilot in York to other cities, if the trial proves a success. But Peddy at Macquarie says TalkTalk doesn\u2019t need a network when it can promise the cheapest prices in the market. \u201cTalkTalk is a value play. Infrastructure ownership is less relevant when price is the major driver.\u201d He believes Ofcom will ensure competition remains healthy by regulating the wholesale price of BT\u2019s network, which is a key piece of infrastructure for Sky and TalkTalk, which piggyback on it for their broadband offering. BT\u2019s network remains a monopoly in the 50% of the country where Virgin Mobile\u2019s cables do not yet reach. O2 Mobile businesses are looking to move into broadband because their revenues are in decline, pushed down by a number of factors including EU price controls; widespread use of apps like Facebook or WhatsApp for phone messaging; and accessing the internet over Wi-Fi networks. While revenues for the broadband industry have grown by 4-5% a year over the last two years, mobile dropped by 3% in 2013, according to media consultancy Enders. O2\u2019s spanish owner, Telef\u00f3nica, has been busy selling assets in Europe and if BT does not bite there are other buyers, including Hong Kong-owned Three. James Barford at Enders comments: \u201cOne major trade sale alternative would be in market consolidation and I would observe that Three Ireland bought O2 Ireland.\u201d EE With 25 million customers, EE has the largest subscriber base in the UK, owns more spectrum than any other network, and has the best 4G service. Analysts put its value at \u00a312bn, which could prove a turn-off for BT. The network\u2019s owners are Deutsche Telekom and French-owned Orange, and both are keen to cash in. If no buyer can be found, floating on the London Stock Exchange remains an option. In the meantime, EE is not standing still: in October it launched a set-top box, EE TV, which it will sell alongside a fibre broadband service rented from BT. Three Owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, Three is the UK\u2019s smallest network with 8 million customers. But its owner has deep pockets and has been spending, buying O2 in Ireland this year and Orange Austria in 2012. In Britain the most obvious merger is with O2, but this would be complicated because Three shares masts with EE while O2 has a mast-sharing deal with Vodafone. Otherwise, like TalkTalk, the challenger network will have to rely on lower pricing as a selling point.

Not cheap, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/nov/20/sky-bt-premier-league-bids\" title=\"\">particularly with the next Premier League football rights auction looming</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Virgin Media</strong></h2> <p>Virgin is now part of US media tycoon John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global empire, the largest cable firm in the world with operations in 14 countries. That means Liberty owns a virtual network, Virgin Mobile, but no masts in Britain, at a time when the growth of mobile internet use is challenging the business model for mobile virtual networks (MVNOs). MVNOs made a profit by bulk-buying minutes from operators and then reselling them at a profit to consumers \u2013 but making a margin from selling on expensive data for mobile internet usage is much more difficult. In a note, Macquarie analyst Guy Peddy said: \u201cIn our view, current MVNO models are breaking.\u201d Merging with Vodafone could offer a solution, but so far rumours of an alliance remain just that.</p> <h2><strong>BT</strong></h2> <p>If BT balks at EE\u2019s potential \u00a312bn price tag and fails to agree terms with a (probably less expensive) O2, there is a fallback plan. The former state-owned telecoms group bought a chunk of spectrum in the 4G auction. It plans to combine this with its home Wi-Fi networks and special miniature masts known as femtocells, installed on telephone exchanges and on its street cabinets, to create a patched-together mobile network.</p> <p>BT has also agreed a deal to rent airtime from EE. Under this cobbled-together system, dubbed an \u201cinside-out\u201d network, a BT customer\u2019s mobile call would begin at home on Wi-Fi, move into the street using BT\u2019s femtocells broadcasting over its 4G spectrum, and continue in the car using EE\u2019s masts. For a fraction of the cost of building a fully fledged network, BT is threatening to introduce a fifth player in the market. Such a move could send prices and profits tumbling. Good news for consumers, bad news for networks. No wonder EE and O2 are keen to sell.</p> <h2><strong>TalkTalk</strong></h2> <p>With no fibre-optic network, no mobile phone masts and no valuable pay-TV content to call its own, TalkTalk is looking increasingly stranded in a converging world. There is a plan to extend its fibre pilot in York to other cities, if the trial proves a success. But Peddy at Macquarie says TalkTalk doesn\u2019t need a network when it can promise the cheapest prices in the market. \u201cTalkTalk is a value play. Infrastructure ownership is less relevant when price is the major driver.\u201d He believes Ofcom will ensure competition remains healthy by regulating the wholesale price of BT\u2019s network, which is a key piece of infrastructure for Sky and TalkTalk, which piggyback on it for their broadband offering. BT\u2019s network remains a monopoly in the 50% of the country where Virgin Mobile\u2019s cables do not yet reach.</p> <h2><strong>O2</strong></h2> <p>Mobile businesses are looking to move into broadband because their revenues are in decline, pushed down by a number of factors including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/16/legislation-abolish-roaming-charges-european-parliament\" title=\"\">EU price controls</a>; widespread use of apps like Facebook or WhatsApp for phone messaging; and accessing the internet over Wi-Fi networks. While revenues for the broadband industry have grown by 4-5% a year over the last two years, mobile dropped by 3% in 2013, according to media consultancy Enders. O2\u2019s spanish owner, Telef\u00f3nica, has been busy selling assets in Europe and if BT does not bite there are other buyers, including Hong Kong-owned Three. James Barford at Enders comments: \u201cOne major trade sale alternative would be in market consolidation and I would observe that Three Ireland bought O2 Ireland.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e418a264680704ca798b442efb11e9de0ddee77\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/28/1417194287673/d0b2f7c9-223d-4e0b-81db-9ac537d8e62b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"EE sign\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EE has launched a television service, EE TV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>EE</strong></h2> <p>With 25 million customers, EE has the largest subscriber base in the UK, owns more spectrum than any other network, and has the best 4G service. Analysts put its value at \u00a312bn, which could prove a turn-off for BT. The network\u2019s owners are Deutsche Telekom and French-owned Orange, and both are keen to cash in. If no buyer can be found, floating on the London Stock Exchange remains an option. In the meantime, EE is not standing still: in October it launched a set-top box, EE TV, which it will sell alongside a fibre broadband service rented from BT.</p> <h2><strong>Three</strong></h2> <p>Owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, Three is the UK\u2019s smallest network with 8 million customers. But its owner has deep pockets and has been spending, buying O2 in Ireland this year and Orange Austria in 2012. In Britain the most obvious merger is with O2, but this would be complicated because Three shares masts with EE while O2 has a mast-sharing deal with Vodafone. Otherwise, like TalkTalk, the challenger network will have to rely on lower pricing as a selling point.</p> <h2>AT A GLANCE</h2> <p><strong>BT</strong><br><strong>UK customers:</strong> 9.8 million for home broadband and phone<br><strong>Products:</strong> TV, broadband, land line</p> <p><strong>SKY</strong><br><strong>UK customers: </strong>11.5 million<br><strong>Products:</strong> TV, broadband, land line</p> <p><strong>VIRGIN MEDIA</strong><br><strong>UK customers:</strong> 4.9 million<br><strong>Products:</strong> TV, broadband, land line, mobile</p> <p><strong>TALKTALK</strong><br><strong>UK customers: </strong>4.2 million<br><strong>Products: </strong>TV, broadband, landline, mobile</p> <p><strong>EE</strong><br><strong>UK customers: </strong>25 million<br><strong>Products:</strong> TV, broadband, mobile</p> <p><strong>O2</strong><br><strong>UK customers: </strong>22 million<br><strong>Products:</strong> mobile</p> <p><strong>VODAFONE </strong><br><strong>UK customers:</strong> 20 million<br><strong>Products:</strong> mobile, soon to launch broadband and TV</p> <p><strong>THREE</strong><br><strong>UK customers: </strong>8 million<br><strong>Products: </strong>mobile</p>",

      "bodyText": "After his stunning speech on the eve of the Scottish referendum, Gordon Brown, by announcing that he will not stand for parliament again, has chosen to go out on a high. His speech was so powerful that even the occupants of Downing Street were bowled over, with some wondering whether he planned a return to mainstream politics. That, apparently, is not to be. But there is still an outside chance that he might return to a prominent role. It depends on two big \u201cifs\u201d. If Labour were to have the balance of power in the next election and if, for some reason, Christine Lagarde were to resign prematurely from her job as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, then Brown would be an obvious candidate to succeed her. The last three holders of the IMF post have, for different reasons, not served a full term. Brown was sounded out twice for the job during his chancellorship, but naturally chose to remain where he was. When he was defeated in 2010, he was available, but there was no way that George Osborne was going to nominate him. No: George backed Lagarde, a move which had the French establishment rolling in the aisles: can you begin to imagine the French suggesting a British candidate? Osborne had been hopelessly wrong in his reaction to the financial crisis, whereas Brown got it right, both in his leading role in the proposals for bank recapitalisation and his championing of the G20 fiscal stimulus agreed at the London summit of early April 2010. Brown knew that it was a huge mistake to begin to withdraw the fiscal stimulus before recovery was well established. He was aware of the US precedent in the mid-1930s. He knew that to embark on a policy of austerity was the last thing required, but also the best possible way to dampen the animal spirits of entrepreneurs and induce a collapse of confidence. So did Ed Balls. In a memorable speech in August 2010, Balls acknowledged that there should be a deficit reduction plan, \u201cbut only once growth is fully secured and over a markedly longer period than George Osborne is currently planning \u2026Just think if Clement Attlee\u2019s government at the end of the second world war had decided that the first priority was to reduce the debts built up during the war \u2013 there would have been no money to fund the creation of the NHS, no money to rebuild the railways and housing destroyed in the blitz, no money to fund the expansion of the welfare state.\u201d This was a powerful point. We did not pay the final instalment on our wartime debt for 50 years. The financial crisis was the peacetime equivalent of the economic cataclysm resulting from the second world war. Osborne\u2019s policy of imposing austerity and budget cuts on an economy that was actually recovering was a catastrophic error. The austerity panic propelled the economy back into depression; and, far from using public spending as a countervailing force against the cutbacks in private sector investment, the coalition\u2019s budget cuts served to aggravate the crisis. This year\u2019s Reith lecturer, Dr Atul Gawande, speaks of the twin problems of ignorance and ineptitude that can beset medical practice. This applies also to economic policy. Osborne, on the verge of his last autumn statement before next May\u2019s election, has ended up with the worst of both worlds: he is being widely criticised, indeed derided, for having failed lamentably to achieve his target of eliminating the budget deficit during the lifetime of this parliament. Yet the austerity that he introduced so dramatically, epitomised by the emphasis on premature deficit reduction, has brought us the slowest economic recovery on record, and deep dissatisfaction all round with the depressed state of living standards. There are commentators who place their faith in the Bank of England\u2019s growth forecasts, and the belief that average earnings will finally take off after a long period of falling and then stagnating. Yet, even if they do, the starting level is so low that Osborne is hardly going to be in a position to repeat that dreadful phrase \u201cjob done\u201d. And what does our imperturbable chancellor promise if the government is re-elected? More of the same: austerity for the poor and public services, and tax cuts for the better off. But austerity fatigue is setting in: even the man responsible for control of public spending, Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander, has made it plain that enough is enough, and the Conservative plans are \u201ceye-wateringly unfair on the working poor, who will pay the highest price.\u201d The coalition has led this country into an austerity trap. No wonder the Conservatives are worried that Ukip may unseat them. Talking of which: what is the Ukip policy on immigrant footballers? Are they planning to repatriate most Premier League players and replace them with White Van Men? We should be told!",
