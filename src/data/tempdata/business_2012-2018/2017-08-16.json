There is little benefit in trying to maintain sweet relations with a president whose ability to deliver tax cuts is fading by the day. But there is real reputational risk in being the last corporate suit still lending him support. With the bosses resigning in droves from Trump\u2019s two advisory councils, the president was obliged to take matters into his own hands by disbanding both panels. This was done to relieve \u201cpressure\u201d on the business people, he tweeted. But the way events were running, there would have been nobody left by the end of the week. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s power to move companies\u2019 share prices seems to have evaporated. Amazon is \u201cdoing great damage to tax paying retailers\u201d, tweeted the president in the morning, but investors no longer care what he thinks about individual companies. Some $5bn was wiped off Amazon\u2019s stock market value after the tweet, but the sum was quickly wiped on again. We may soon be at a point where being the target of an angry presidential tweet is good for a stock price. It is hard, though, to think that a breakdown in relations between corporate America and the president can be good news for the wider stock market. Sooner or later, the damage to confidence will affect real business decisions, and the process may now be starting. Corporate America is saying Trump is a sell. If only Balfour Beatty turnaround model could work for Carillion Balfour Beatty is turning into an impressive turnaround story. After issuing six profits warnings between 2012 and 2015, the construction firm is showing that even supposedly toxic problems can be washed out of the system with the help of time and common sense. Leo Quinn arrived as chief executive at the start of 2015 to implement his derisking plans and Wednesday\u2019s half-year results delivered the clearest improvement so far. Underlying profits from operations of \u00a339m doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy return on \u00a34bn of revenues but Quinn is now predicting \u201cindustry standard margins\u201d \u2013 which means about 2.5% \u2013 in the second half of next year. Over a full year, that might mean profits of \u00a3200m. The shares rose 6% and are now back to something close to pre-crisis levels. Should shareholders in Carillion, in despair after last month\u2019s horrible profits warning, enormous \u00a3845m provision and disposal of the chief executive, take heart? Does Balfour\u2019s recovery provide a model for how to proceed? Only in one respect: better risk management is obviously the way to go, but that has always been true in construction. Sadly, however, there is a fundamental difference between Balfour\u2019s crisis circa 2015 and Carillion\u2019s of today. It is the balance sheet. Balfour\u2019s was never broken but Carillion\u2019s is. Balfour\u2019s salvation was an investment portfolio of student accommodation, hospitals and so forth, worth \u00a31bn (and now worth \u00a31.23bn). That solidity made a rights issue avoidable and allowed Quinn to go about his derisking work without short-term pressures. Carillion, by contrast, has a much smaller investment portfolio and is towing a much bigger pension fund deficit, \u00a3587m at the last count, plus borrowings that averaged \u00a3695m in the first half of this year. For a company whose stock market value has collapsed to \u00a3225m, there is no easy escape. A thumping rights issue, or even a debt-for-equity swap, looks inevitable. Carillion\u2019s stand-in boss Keith Cochrane will reveal his self-help plan next month. He can rule out a despairing appeal to Balfour to ride to the rescue with a bid. Carillion\u2019s opportunistic attempt to buy Balfour in 2014 was a monumental act of hubris, we now know. Quinn, it is safe to assume, has zero appetite to attempt the takeover trick in reverse. PwC\u2019s \u00a35m fine may be small change if BT inquiry goes against it Why does it always seem to be PricewaterhouseCoopers? The accounting outfit has broken its own record for the size of its audit-related fine from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). It has copped a \u00a35.1m penalty for \u201cextensive misconduct\u201d in the auditing of finance firm RSM Tenon. That is slightly more than the \u00a35m whack in May for its work at social housing group Connaught. Still, PwC found out the following month that it is in the clear at Tesco, where the FRC closed its investigation in the wake of the supermarket chain\u2019s profits overstatement. But one big inquiry is outstanding \u2013 into the Italian job at BT, where PwC was the auditor. The outcome is keenly awaited.

    "webTitle": "UK pay growth picks up as unemployment rate falls again", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK pay growth has started to edge up amid signs that the lowest level of unemployment since the mid 1970s may be increasing workers\u2019 bargaining power. Office for National Statistics figures showed that earnings growth in the three months to June was 2.1% higher than in the same period in 2016, and up from 2% in the three months to May and a recent low of 1.8% in April. The ONS said unemployment in the quarter ending in June was down 57,000 on the previous three months at 1,484,000. The jobless rate fell to a 42-year low of 4.4%. Employment was up by 125,000 at 32.1 million in the three months to June, the highest rate (75.1%) since modern records began in 1971. Its breakdown of the 338,000 increase in employment over the past year found that full-time jobs were up by 380,000, while part-time posts fell by 43,000. Male employment was at a level not seen since 1991, while female employment was at the highest rate since 1971. The ability of the economy to generate new jobs contradicts warnings by the Treasury before last year\u2019s EU referendum that a vote to leave would lead to a sharp rise in the jobless total. The then chancellor George Osborne predicted that unemployment would rise by 500,000 within two years of a vote to leave. The first year following the Brexit vote saw unemployment fall by 157,000. But despite the additional jobs and the acceleration in earnings growth, living standards remain under pressure because pay has failed to keep pace with inflation, which stood at 2.6% in June. The increase from 0.9% a year earlier has largely been the result of dearer import prices caused by the drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Ruth Gregory, the UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe latest labour market figures provided some signs that the tightening in the labour market may be leading to a recovery in wage growth at long last.\u201d The increase in employment had beaten consensus expectations of a 97,000 rise, she added. The City responded to the unemployment and earnings data by pushing up the value of the pound against the dollar by half a cent on foreign exchanges. A tighter labour market is seen as strengthening the hand of the hawks on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, who are pressing for an increase in interest rates. The ONS reported that the availability of jobs in the UK continues to attract workers from overseas, but found that the rate of increase had slowed over the past year. Between April and June 2016, and the same three months of 2017, the number of non-UK nationals from the EU working in Britain rose by 126,000 to 2.37 million. In the previous year, there had been an increase of 242,000. The number of workers from the rest of the world fell by 18,000 between April and June. While the private sector continues to take on more staff, ONS figures showed state employment had fallen to its lowest level since 1999. The number of public sector jobs in the three months to March stood at 5.42 million, down 7,000 over the quarter and 20,000 over the year. Matt Hughes, a senior labour market statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cThe employment picture remains strong, with a new record high employment rate and another fall in the unemployment rate. Despite the strong jobs picture, however, real earnings continue to decline. \u201cThe number of workers born elsewhere in the EU continues to increase, but the annual rate of change has slowed markedly. \u201cNew figures on the number of workers who say they are on zero-hours contracts show a small drop on last year.\u201d Damian Hinds, the employment minister, said the 338,000 increase in employment in the year to June had been primarily driven by full-time, permanent jobs. \u201cMore than 3 million more people are in work now than in 2010, with seven in 10 of these roles being in higher-skilled work,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The British car market is coming under increasing pressure as consumers turn away from buying new models after a squeeze on earnings, favouring secondhand cars instead. Figures show the number of used cars bought using finance increased by 7% in June compared with the same month a year ago, according to the Finance and Leasing Association, which represents about 86% of borrowing against vehicles in the UK. There was an 8% drop in lending extended for new vehicles, in a move that could alleviate concerns over a credit bubble in motor finance. Booming car sales helped by financing deals have troubled the Bank of England, which sounded the alarm in July over consumers racking up debt they may find difficult to pay back in future. Dealership car finance, through loans offered to car buyers at the point of sale, has been growing rapidly in recent years and in total was worth \u00a358bn at the end of March, according to Threadneedle Street. \u201cWhile the new car market is going to continue to stutter for the rest of the year, we could still see the used car market surging as people switch from new to secondhand motors,\u201d said Alex Buttle, of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk. There were 1m new cars sold to consumers buying with the help of finance in the 12 months to June, compared with 1.2m used vehicles, according to the FLA data. The UK new car market declined 9.3% in July, according to figures published this month by the the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the fourth consecutive monthly fall. The SMMT said on Wednesday almost 4m used cars were sold in the first half of this year, down 5.1% on a year ago. Consumers got a glimpse of some respite this week from surging inflation after the vote to leave the European Union, as the consumer price index remained static at 2.6%, while pay growth showed signs of edging up after the lowest level of unemployment since the mid-1970s potentially handed workers more bargaining power. Lookers, the UK\u2019s biggest car dealership, said on Wednesday it viewed the second half of the year with caution and that new car sales would probably fall by 2.6% this year. It said the used car market represented a significant opportunity and that it had seen a 23% increase in leads generated by its website in the first half of 2017. There has been plenty of pressure on car sales in recent months, with consumers facing political uncertainty from the Brexit vote and Theresa May\u2019s snap general election, while the government also put forward plans to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040 to encourage a shift to electric vehicles. Falling used car prices would trouble the Bank of England, as banks lending to customers buying new cars on hire purchase plans could be left with vehicles worth less than they had previously envisaged at the end of a deal. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, said greater levels of interest in used cars as consumers tighten their belts could help protect the value of vehicles. \u201cIf we see the new car market cool, the secondhand market will probably do better, and in a sense that might support residual values of the cars coming onto the secondhand market,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK cost of living squeeze has unexpectedly eased, albeit only marginally. According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, average weekly earnings grew by 2.1% year on year in the three months to June, much better than the 1.8% analysts had been forecasting. But, even with inflation holding steady at 2.6% rather than rising, that still means a 0.5% fall in real wages. As for the jobs figures, the unemployment rate fell to 4.4%, marking the lowest level since early 1975. The pound recovered from early losses after the data, although not many analysts believe the figures make an imminent UK interest rate rise any more likely. Over in the eurozone, second quarter GDP rose by 2.2% on a year on year basis, slightly better than expected, and by 0.6% compared to the first three months of the year. On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Some below par figures from the US housing market. Housing starts fell by 4.8% in July, compared to expectations of a 0.4% increase. June\u2019s figure has been revised down from an 8.3% rise to a 7.4% increase. More on the UK wages squeeze: UK productivity keeps falling, according to the second quarter jobs and wages data. Output per hour worked fell 0.1% quarter on quarter after a 0.5% decline in the first three months of the year. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: The further relapse in the second quarter\u2019s productivity fuels concerns over the UK\u2019s overall poor productivity record since the deep 2008/9 recession. This even allows for the possibility that there may well have been an appreciable cyclical element in the drop as GDP growth was slow in the first half of 2017 and business seemingly remained keen to employ amid potential shortages of labour. Given the uncertain economic and political outlook, it may be that several companies are trying to meet extra work by taking on labour rather than commit to investment. Persistent low earnings growth is facilitating labour growth. Productivity had seen growth through 2016, but it was hardly dynamic. The further second quarter dip in productivity is all the more disappointing as the UK has a lot of catching up to do on the productivity front as it has been markedly lagging its performance before the 2008/9 downturn. There may be structural factors at work, said Archer: Many of the new jobs that have been created are in less-skilled, low-paid sectors where productivity is limited. The economy\u2019s past prolonged weakness and financial sector problems may have hurt productivity through under-investment and an inefficient allocation of resources. There is particular concern that an extended inability to access capital held back innovation and investment by smaller companies. The jobs and wages data increase the chances of a UK rate rise before too long, reckons Kallum Pickering, senior UK Economist at Berenberg: For the UK monetary policy outlook, today\u2019s upside surprise for labour demand and acceleration in wage growth matters far more than yesterday\u2019s downside surprise for headline inflation (2.6% in July versus an estimated 2.7%). Unemployment fell to 4.4% in June (4.5% expected) while weekly earnings excluding bonus accelerated to 2.1%, for the third month in a row, in line with our expectations but above the consensus (2.0%). Because monetary policy works with a lag, interest rate setters at the Bank of England (BoE) focus more on what the inflation picture will look like in a year or two. The UK\u2019s current period of above-target (2% target) inflation is mostly driven by the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote, which has pushed up import prices. But this effect will fade as the annual change in import prices washes out of the consumer price index. As the BoE is already looking through the sterling-effect, whether or not current inflation is a little higher or lower than expected is largely irrelevant for the policy outlook. However, in the BoE\u2019s model, an acceleration in wage growth today will cause underlying inflation to rise in the future. Today\u2019s upside surprise thus raises the chances of a policy tightening soon. Back with the UK data, and here is the chancellor\u2019s reaction to the unemployment numbers (no mention of wages so far, though): The eurozone economy appears to be firing on all cylinders, said economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Eurozone annual GDP growth has been revised upwards to 2.2% year-on-year in the second estimate. While growth could come down a touch in the second half of the year, we expect growth to come in at 2% for 2017.The quarterly growth rate was unrevised at 0.6% quarter on quarter, confirming the robust growth pace for the Eurozone in the first half of the year. No breakdown by components has been released as of yet, but some of the individual countries show the economy is firing on all cylinders right now. Domestic demand is improving significantly, while exports continue to grow despite uncertainty among trade partners and an appreciating euro. While some countries remain laggards in the eurozone, the good news at the moment is that poorer performers are also exceeding expectations. Italian growth in the second quarter lags the Eurozone average, but the 1.5% year on year growth did surprise analysts. Among the larger economies, the Dutch economy grew at an extraordinary pace of 1.5% quarter on quarter, a rate more commonly seen in booming developing economies. Spain also continues to record tremendous growth rates as the second quarter came in at 0.9% quarter on quarter, accelerating from 0.8% in the first quarter. The countries that experienced a deeper real estate crisis all seem to be recovering quite robustly at the moment as Irish growth is currently at 6.6% year on year, although figures for the second quarter have yet to be released. Given the incredible Dutch GDP growth and continued strength in Germany, the push for an end to QE in northern economies will become even louder as some key events are coming up. With inflation one of the few indicators that have not recovered to pre-crisis rates, the ECB will continue to be very cautious in its communication about the possible endings of QE. More signs of strength in the eurozone economy. On an annualised basis, the region\u2019s GDP grew by 2.2% in the second quarter, better than the original estimate of 2.1% and higher than analyst forecasts. The quarter on quarter growth figure was left unchanged at 0.6%, as expected. In the wider European Union the quarterly rise was also 0.6% while the annual figure was 2.3%. Here is a graph showing the EU and eurozone compared to the US: Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Strong economic performances from Germany, France and Spain have contributed to the eurozone\u2019s GDP being exactly where ECB president Mario Draghi would like it. Draghi has made it clear that he will refuse to budge on interest rates for the foreseeable future \u2013 a policy that appears to be working well. Given the political uncertainty in Europe over the past year, Draghi has sailed the ECB ship safely through the choppy waters of the Italian referendum and French election. The ECB will be hoping for calmer times ahead, but global financial instability is beyond its control. Should there be a slowdown in external trade due to a wobble in China, the UK or US, dark clouds could be on the horizon once again. And here is the pokesperson for Economic and Financial Affairs at the EU Commission: More reaction to today\u2019s UK data: Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute: It should be a real cause for concern that the UK\u2019s productivity has fallen again, especially considering we still lag well behind our G7 peers in this area. UK productivity per hour is now 35% below the German level, and 30% below the US, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that decisive action is needed if we are to end this downward trend. Most people still don\u2019t realise that the largest drag on productivity is poor management and leadership skills, estimated to account for almost half of the productivity gap. Investing in apprenticeships to boost management talent, as well as technical skills, is therefore vital. Not only will doing so help solve our productivity problem, it will be crucial to building a globally competitive UK plc. Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at the Work Foundation: Overall, the evidence suggests that, despite the low headline rate of unemployment, there remains a lot of slack in the labour market. With employment continuing to rise while rates of immigration fall, this slack is likely to diminish over the coming months. But, with pay settlements now well below the rate of price inflation, there is no evidence to suggest that this is turning into sustained wage pressure.\u201d Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index: There are signs that wage pressure could start to build. If you dig a bit deeper into the ONS data then you find that employment levels made another record high, the employment rate is at 75.1%. There has been a drop of 157,000 unemployed people in the UK in the last year, and the number of economically inactive people has also fallen by 90,000 in the past year. Although 883,000 people remain on \u201czero-hours\u201d contracts, this has fallen by 20,000 in the past year. Although this is a fairly small decline, if more firms stop hiring people on zero hours contracts then we could see wage growth start to rise on a sustained basis. The market impact was a swift move higher in the pound, the FTSE 100 is also higher this morning along with other European indices, while the UK 10-year bond yield has also jumped back above 1.10%, which could sustain a deeper recovery in GBP. So far this data hasn\u2019t had any impact on UK consumer discretionary stocks like M&amp;S or Next, we may need to get confirmation of decent July retail sales figures before these stocks make a move. James Smith, economist at ING Bank: Wednesday\u2019s jobs report was slightly healthier than might have been expected...The big question for the Bank of England is whether the ever-tighter jobs market starts to translate into a sharp acceleration in wage growth. We have seen slightly more momentum in the level of average weekly earnings recently following a particularly sluggish start to the year. That appears to corroborate the BoE\u2019s view that some of the recent weakness in pay growth is attributable to temporary factors like the apprenticeship levy and pension costs. However, even as the probability of a Brexit transition period increases, there\u2019s still plenty of political uncertainty facing businesses. Throw in rising import costs, which will keep pressure on firm\u2019s cost bases, and slowing economic growth and consumer demand, then it looks unlikely that wage growth will pick up rapidly over coming months. Or at least, not enough to meet the Bank\u2019s 3% target for 2018. In fact, we expect wage growth to hover around the 2% level for the rest of this year. With inflation likely to inch closer to 3%, that means real incomes will continue to be squeezed. We expect the Bank of England to increasingly \u201clook through\u201d rising inflation and focus instead on the muted outlook for growth. A 2017 rate hike looks very unlikely. Here is our report on the jobs and wages figures from economics editor Larry Elliott: Pay growth in the UK has started to pick up amid signs that the steady fall in unemployment may be boosting the bargaining power of workers. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that earnings growth in the three months to June was 2.1% higher than in the same months of 2016 \u2013 up from 2.0% in the three months to May. The ONS said unemployment in the quarter ending in June was down 57,000 on the previous three months at 1,484,000. The jobless rate fell to a fresh 42-year low of 4.4%. Employment was up by 125,000 at 32.1m in the three months to June. Despite the acceleration in earnings growth, living standards remained under pressure because pay has failed to keep pace with inflation, which stood at 2.6% in June. The full story is here: And here is the wages growth data: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Some positive news on the UK\u2019s cost of living squeeze from the ONS today, with average earnings growth beating expectations by growing 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to June. When inflation is taken into account, however, real wages still fell by 0.5% in the three month period... There is some cause for optimism that the squeeze on household finances could come to an end later this year, though ultimately the light at the end of the tunnel could be provided by falling inflation rather than rising wages. Yesterday\u2019s CPI numbers showed inflation remaining at 2.6% in July, and the hope is this will fall back towards the 2% target as the Brexit-induced weakness in the pound starts to fade. Yet despite today\u2019s good news on wages, sustained growth could prove harder to come by. Conventional economic theory - the Phillips curve - suggests that with unemployment as low as it is, sooner or later demand for labour will outstrip supply and workers will be able to demand higher wages. However a fundamental shift in the labour market has led this relationship to break down, meaning wages remain depressed despite low unemployment. The cause seems to be a lack of underlying inflationary pressure, combined with technological developments and global competition which has weakened the bargaining power of the worker. Throw continuing lacklustre productivity growth into the mix too, and the Bank of England\u2019s prediction of 3% wage growth by next year could look optimistic. All this has implications for interest rates. If unemployment can fall further without causing wage inflation, there is absolutely no pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates. The unemployment rate of 4.4% is the lowest since March-May 1975: And here are the changes in the number of jobs by sector: Sterling has edged higher after the stronger than expected wages growth figures. The pound is now up 0.19% against the dollar at $1.2892, and against the euro it is 0.21% higher at \u20ac1.0986. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The UK wages growth surprised on the upside, as the British households saw their average earnings improved by 2.1% (3 month-on-year) versus 1.8% anticipated by analysts. Still, consumer prices rose by 2.6% over the same month. Although, the divergence between the price and wages growth will likely continue weighing on British households\u2019 purchasing power and cool down the inflationary pressures, the Bank of England (BoE) hawks will remain alert on the economic data as long as the rates remain at the historical low levels. The pound-bulls came back in charge following the solid wages growth. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: More detail on the jobless numbers. There were 32.07 million people in work, 125,000 more than for January to March 2017 and 338,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 1.48 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 57,000 fewer than for January to March 2017 and 157,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 883,000 people (not seasonally adjusted) in employment on \u201czero-hours contracts\u201d in their main job, 20,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Breaking: Better news for householders, UK average earnings have come in higher than expected. Average weekly earnings rose by 2.1% year on year in the three months to June, better than the forecast 1.8%. Excluding bonuses the figure was also 2.1% compared to expectations of 2%. Meanwhile the July claimant count fell by 4,200 and the unemployment rate came in at 4.4%, better than the expected 4.5% and the lowest since 1975. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, does not plan to give any new monetary policy statements at the gathering of bankers at Jackson Hole in the US at the end of the month. Stephen Gallo, European head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said: This reinforces our view that the ECB is going to stagger the taper and normalisation process as much as possible so as to avoid a taper tantrum or anything of that nature. We will continue to favour selling rallies in EURUSD for the next month or so...At the July rate decision Draghi said announcements (on policy) would come in the autumn. The term autumn as opposed to a specific date gives the ECB flexibility. With some nervousness ahead of the UK wages and jobs data, sterling slipped to a ten month low against the euro before recovering slightly. The pound was trading at 91.44p a euro before edging back to 91.07p, a 0.12% decline. A Reuters report said dealers were speculating on a weaker than expected wage growth figure. The Italian economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter, the same rate as the previous three months and in line with expectations. Domestic demand offset a weakening trade position, and analysts said the figures suggested the country would meet its 1.1% annual growth target. Over in Europe, there have been some better than expected economic growth figures from the Netherlands: Here\u2019s a look at what is expected from the imminent UK data: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Following yesterday\u2019s unchanged, if still high, UK inflation reading attention turns to the latest jobs report and, specifically, the state of the country\u2019s wages. Including bonuses the average earnings index for the 3 months to June is expected to remain at 1.8%, meaning real wages are continuing to suffer under the tyranny of UK inflation (and explains Thursday\u2019s expected fall in retail sales). Elsewhere in the jobs report the unemployment rate will likely stay at 4.5% for the second month in a row, while the claimant count change \u2013 the most up to date figure \u2013 is forecast to shrink from 5.9k to 3.2k. Away from Europe for the moment, and ratings agency S&amp;P has confirmed its view on Brazil after president Michel Temer survived a vote related to corruption charges. S&amp;P said: Since we placed our ratings on Brazil on CreditWatch with negative implications in May, the political landscape is somewhat more settled as President Temer survived a vote--by the Federal Electoral Court (TSE) in June and by Congress in August--related to corruption charges. Meanwhile, the economy appears to have stabilised despite fluid politics, Congress passed a labor reform in July, and the government remains committed to advancing some pension reform, containing expenditure growth to minimise deviation from its primary fiscal targets, and advancing its active microeconomic reform agenda. We are removing our long-term sovereign ratings on Brazil from CreditWatch with negative implications and affirming them at \u2018BB\u2019. We are also affirming our \u2018B\u2019 short-term sovereign ratings. The negative outlook, however, reflects ongoing political challenges and the risk of a downgrade over the next six to nine months--given Brazil\u2019s high and rising debt burden--should Congress fail to advance legislation that begins to reduce Brazil\u2019s fiscal rigidities, which hinder deficit reduction and sustained moderation in spending growth. The week\u2019s stock market revival is continuing as investors put aside concerns about North Korea and indulge in a little bargain hunting. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5%, Germany\u2019s Dax has opened 0.6% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.4%. Wage growth is unlikely to pick up to 3% next year as the Bank of England is forecasting, says ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel, while the pound is likely to continue to come under pressure: The combination of lacklustre UK economic data and political noise has served to highlight the pound\u2019s vulnerabilities this week and we expect these factors to further weigh on the currency. The \u2018hot, but not too hot\u2019 core inflation release yesterday has all but silenced any 2017 Bank of England rate hike calls; markets see a \u224820% chance of a 25bp rate increase by year-end. Those looking to wage growth as evidence for rising underlying price pressures are unlikely to find much support in the UK jobs report today. We expect average hourly earnings growth to remain unchanged at 2% \u2013 and stay pretty much anchored at this level for the rest of 2017. This might not come as too much of a surprise to markets given that it would be in line with the BoE\u2019s forecasts outlined in the Aug Inflation Report. Yet, the bigger question is whether wage inflation can pick up to 3% in 2018 as the Bank predicts; such a sharp uplift in earnings growth is unlikely given signs of greater than anticipated slack in the labour market.. We expect the pound to remain on the back foot today, with the pound/dollar moving below the 1.2850/60 area and the euro/pound grinding higher towards 0.9140/50. Stock markets are expected to continue their recent mini-revival, as last week\u2019s turmoil amid the tensions between North Korea and the US fade further. (President Trump of course has other matters closer to home to deal with at the moment). Here are the opening calls from IG: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Continuing evidence of Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze is expected today with the latest wages and jobs data. Despite inflation unexpectedly holding steady at 2.6% rather than rising further, cash strapped households are likely to find little relief in the wages figures. They are expected to continue lagging the cost of living, with analysts predicting that average weekly earnings grew by 1.8% year-on-year in the three months to June, the same figure as last time. Stripping out bonuses, the figure is expected to hold steady at 2%. But Michael Hewson. chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says that wages growth has been on an upward trend: The most recent wages numbers saw weekly earnings excluding bonuses for June come in at 2%, up from 1.7% in May, an encouraging sign that we may have seen wages start to show signs of a rebound at a time when ILO unemployment is at and expected to remain at a 42 year low of 4.5%. With employment levels at record highs any signs of a tighter labour market could well offer the pound some significant support which means that a strong wages number today could offer the Bank of England that \u201cgoldilocks\u201d scenario of falling inflation and rising wages and potentially move the debate back to the timing of a possible rate rise. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, disagrees: The divergence between the price and wages growth will likely continue weighing on the real wages and cool down the inflationary pressures as a consequence. Under these circumstances, the Bank of England will be in a position to keep the interest rates at the current historical low levels for an extended period of time and walk the UK businesses through challenging Brexit times. The pound seems undecided too, edging down just 0.05% against a recently revived dollar at $1.2862. Also coming up today are eurozone second quarter growth figures, expected to show an increase of 0.6%. This compares to a 0.3% rise in the UK in the second quarter.

Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/uk/en/newsroom/news-releases/17-08-16-uk-productivity-sees-further-dip-in-q2-after-relapsing-markedly-in-q1-ey-item-club\">said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The further relapse in the second quarter\u2019s productivity fuels concerns over the UK\u2019s overall poor productivity record since the deep 2008/9 recession. This even allows for the possibility that there may well have been an appreciable cyclical element in the drop as GDP growth was slow in the first half of 2017 and business seemingly remained keen to employ amid potential shortages of labour. Given the uncertain economic and political outlook, it may be that several companies are trying to meet extra work by taking on labour rather than commit to investment. Persistent low earnings growth is facilitating labour growth.

UK productivity per hour is now 35% below the German level, and 30% below the US, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that decisive action is needed if we are to end this downward trend.</p> <p>Most people still don\u2019t realise that the largest drag on productivity is poor management and leadership skills, estimated to account for almost half of the productivity gap. Investing in apprenticeships to boost management talent, as well as technical skills, is therefore vital. Not only will doing so help solve our productivity problem, it will be crucial to building a globally competitive UK plc.</p> <h2>Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at the Work Foundation:</h2> <p>Overall, the evidence suggests that, despite the low headline rate of unemployment, there remains a lot of slack in the labour market.</p> <p>With employment continuing to rise while rates of immigration fall, this slack is likely to diminish over the coming months. But, with pay settlements now well below the rate of price inflation, there is no evidence to suggest that this is turning into sustained wage pressure.\u201d</p> <h2>Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index:</h2> <p>There are signs that wage pressure could start to build. If you dig a bit deeper into the ONS data then you find that employment levels made another record high, the employment rate is at 75.1%. There has been a drop of 157,000 unemployed people in the UK in the last year, and the number of economically inactive people has also fallen by 90,000 in the past year. Although 883,000 people remain on \u201czero-hours\u201d contracts, this has fallen by 20,000 in the past year. Although this is a fairly small decline, if more firms stop hiring people on zero hours contracts then we could see wage growth start to rise on a sustained basis.</p> <p>The market impact was a swift move higher in the pound, the FTSE 100 is also higher this morning along with other European indices, while the UK 10-year bond yield has also jumped back above 1.10%, which could sustain a deeper recovery in GBP. So far this data hasn\u2019t had any impact on UK consumer discretionary stocks like M&amp;S or Next, we may need to get confirmation of decent July retail sales figures before these stocks make a move.</p> <h2>James Smith, economist at ING Bank:</h2> <p>Wednesday\u2019s jobs report was slightly healthier than might have been expected...The big question for the Bank of England is whether the ever-tighter jobs market starts to translate into a sharp acceleration in wage growth. We have seen slightly more momentum in the level of average weekly earnings recently following a particularly sluggish start to the year. That appears to corroborate the BoE\u2019s view that some of the recent weakness in pay growth is attributable to temporary factors like the apprenticeship levy and pension costs.</p> <p>However, even as the probability of a Brexit transition period increases, there\u2019s still plenty of political uncertainty facing businesses. Throw in rising import costs, which will keep pressure on firm\u2019s cost bases, and slowing economic growth and consumer demand, then it looks unlikely that wage growth will pick up rapidly over coming months. Or at least, not enough to meet the Bank\u2019s 3% target for 2018.</p> <p>In fact, we expect wage growth to hover around the 2% level for the rest of this year. With inflation likely to inch closer to 3%, that means real incomes will continue to be squeezed.</p> <p>We expect the Bank of England to increasingly \u201clook through\u201d rising inflation and focus instead on the muted outlook for growth. A 2017 rate hike looks very unlikely.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59940c05e4b0f099f0196dd8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-16T09:11:19.185Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is our report on the jobs and wages figures from economics editor Larry Elliott:</p> <blockquote> <p>Pay growth in the UK has started to pick up amid signs that the steady fall in unemployment may be boosting the bargaining power of workers.</p> <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that earnings growth in the three months to June was 2.1% higher than in the same months of 2016 \u2013 up from 2.0% in the three months to May.</p> <p>The ONS said unemployment in the quarter ending in June was down 57,000 on the previous three months at 1,484,000.

When inflation is taken into account, however, real wages still fell by 0.5% in the three month period...</p> <p>There is some cause for optimism that the squeeze on household finances could come to an end later this year, though ultimately the light at the end of the tunnel could be provided by falling inflation rather than rising wages. Yesterday\u2019s CPI numbers showed inflation remaining at 2.6% in July, and the hope is this will fall back towards the 2% target as the Brexit-induced weakness in the pound starts to fade.</p> <p>Yet despite today\u2019s good news on wages, sustained growth could prove harder to come by.</p> <p>Conventional economic theory - the Phillips curve - suggests that with unemployment as low as it is, sooner or later demand for labour will outstrip supply and workers will be able to demand higher wages. However a fundamental shift in the labour market has led this relationship to break down, meaning wages remain depressed despite low unemployment. The cause seems to be a lack of underlying inflationary pressure, combined with technological developments and global competition which has weakened the bargaining power of the worker. Throw continuing lacklustre productivity growth into the mix too, and the Bank of England\u2019s prediction of 3% wage growth by next year could look optimistic.</p> <p>All this has implications for interest rates.

They are expected to continue lagging the cost of living, with analysts predicting that average weekly earnings grew by 1.8% year-on-year in the three months to June, the same figure as last time. Stripping out bonuses, the figure is expected to hold steady at 2%.</p> <p>But Michael Hewson. chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says that wages growth has been on an upward trend:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The most recent wages numbers saw weekly earnings excluding bonuses for June come in at 2%, up from 1.7% in May, an encouraging sign that we may have seen wages start to show signs of a rebound at a time when ILO unemployment is at and expected to remain at a 42 year low of 4.5%.</p> <p>With employment levels at record highs any signs of a tighter labour market could well offer the pound some significant support which means that a strong wages number today could offer the Bank of England that \u201cgoldilocks\u201d scenario of falling inflation and rising wages and potentially move the debate back to the timing of a possible rate rise.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, disagrees:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The divergence between the price and wages growth will likely continue weighing on the real wages and cool down the inflationary pressures as a consequence.

      "bodyText": "The UK social housing maintenance company Mears Group has downgraded its profit forecast and slashed its full-year revenue predictions as its clients delay new contracts following the Grenfell Tower fire. The company, which carries out repair and maintenance work for properties belonging to local authorities and other social housing landlords, said new orders were on hold as authorities focused on ensuring all their properties were safe and compliant in the wake of the June fire, in which 80 people died. Mears, which provides services across the UK \u2013 delivering more than 6,000 repairs every day to a portfolio of more than 1m homes \u2013 said it had had no involvement with Grenfell Tower, nor with any properties run by Kensington and Chelsea council. But it warned that the \u201ctragic events at Grenfell Tower will impact the housing division later this year as clients review the commissioning and safety practices at their properties\u201d. This would cut the revenue it had expected to make this year from housing by \u00a330m, to \u00a3800m. It said that would result in a lower than previously expected annual profit, although it has not disclosed its profit forecast. The group posted revenues of \u00a3471m and pre-tax profit of \u00a313m for the six months to June. UK authorities are currently reviewing building and fire safety rules after police said they believe the cladding panels added during a refurbishment of Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire. The Mears chief executive, David Miles, said: \u201cWhile the likely revenue shortfall for the full year is frustrating, it is entirely understandable in the circumstances and the group will be working closely with its partners and clients at this time to address their immediate priorities.\u201d He said delays in procurement decisions by housing clients were expected to be temporary and would not impact its long-term order book. Mears, which was set up in 1996, employs more than 13,000 people in the UK. It also has a smaller care division providing support and help for older and disabled people who live independently in their own homes. The group\u2019s shares closed down 7.6% at 448p, having been down by 11% at one stage. Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, commented: \u201cDelays to social housing contracts in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster mean that Mears will miss its budgets for the year and add to a litany of woe for the support services sector, where firms such as Aggreko, G4S, Interserve, Carillion, Serco and Mitie have already badly disappointed, albeit for a wide range of different reasons.\u201d",

It said that would result in a lower than previously expected annual profit, although it has not disclosed its profit forecast. The group posted revenues of \u00a3471m and pre-tax profit of \u00a313m for the six months to June.</p> <p>UK authorities are currently reviewing building and fire safety rules after police said they believe the cladding panels added during a refurbishment of Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire.</p> <p>The Mears chief executive, David Miles, said: \u201cWhile the likely revenue shortfall for the full year is frustrating, it is entirely understandable in the circumstances and the group will be working closely with its partners and clients at this time to address their immediate priorities.\u201d He said delays in procurement decisions by housing clients were expected to be temporary and would not impact its long-term order book.</p> <p>Mears, which was set up in 1996, employs more than 13,000 people in the UK.

      "bodyText": "The government should immediately suspend any consideration of a federal loan to Adani or an any associated entity, environmental groups have said in response to the Guardian\u2019s reporting on Wednesday about fraud allegations faced by Adani in India. The Adani Group allegedly fraudulently siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars from India into tax havens \u2013 a practice enabled by Indian government tax breaks. Details of the allegations, and documents from India\u2019s directorate of revenue intelligence, have been published by the Guardian today. The group is expecting a legal decision in the \u201cnear future\u201d in connection with allegations it inflated invoices for an electricity project in India to shift huge sums of money into offshore bank accounts. The mining giant is seeking a loan of up to $900m from the Australian government through the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (Naif) for a rail line between its proposed Carmichael coalmine and the Abbot point coal terminal near the Great Barrier Reef. Naif has said the request for the loan has been progressed all the way through to the \u201cdue diligence\u201d stage. The company has also received a tax break from the Queensland government on potential royalties due from the mining activity, the details of which the government has kept secret, despite saying the deal is \u201copen and transparent\u201d. \u201cThe revelations make it untenable for the Naif to now risk almost a $1bn of taxpayers\u2019 money on infrastructure associated with this company,\u201d the executive director of the Australia Institute, Ben Oquist, said. \u201cToday\u2019s revelations mean the Naif should immediately suspend all consideration of Adani\u2019s railway infrastructure project.\u201d The loan would require the approval of the the minister for northern Australia, a portfolio now held by Barnaby Joyce, whose eligibility to hold his seat in parliament has been questioned. \u201cIt would be unsound for him to approve this project when there is so much uncertainty surrounding the project as well as his position in the parliament,\u201d Oquist said. The Adani Group said it \u201cstrongly denies the allegations of overvaluation\u201d. \u201cIt is a standard procedure for the group to follow international competitive bidding route for major capital expenditures to ensure transparency and competitiveness in the process,\u201d it said. \u201cAll our transactions are always conducted within the framework of extant regulatory guidelines and provisions. \u201cThe fact that our projects have incurred the lowest cost across central, state and private utility players has gone to establish the robustness of the processes followed by our group.\u201d It said it \u201chas fully cooperated and shall continue to cooperate with the investigating agencies\u201d. Before the Guardian reports were published, the former chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which functions under a very similar mandate to Naif\u2019s, said any loan from Naif to Adani or a related company may be beyond Naif\u2019s power. Both Naif and the CEFC are required to not act in any way that might harm the reputation of the federal or any state government. Yates told the Guardian in July that a loan to Adani would be in breach of that requirement and would therefore be unlawful. \u201cIt is beyond my understanding how the board of Naif can conclude that providing a subsidised loan to facilitate a project of this nature is \u2018not in a way likely to cause damage to the commonwealth government\u2019s reputation\u2019,\u201d Yates said in July. The leader of the Australian Greens, Richard Di Natale, said: \u201cEven beyond the obvious environmental catastrophe that would be unleashed by the Adani mine, these allegations should make the Liberals immediately rule out handing over $1bn of public money to a multinational corporation with such serious questions to answer.\u201d The director of campaigns at the Australian Conservation Foundation, Dr Paul Sinclair, said: \u201cThese allegations raise serious questions for the Naif and the Turnbull government to answer. Acting northern Australian minister Barnaby Joyce and Naif management must explain whether the corporate history and appalling environmental record of Adani is being properly scrutinised before any public money is tipped into its dirty new coal project.\u201d GetUp described the revelations as \u201cstunning\u201d and said they demonstrated the enormous risk to Australian public money from any Naif funding. \u201cPM Turnbull and Queensland premier Palaszczuk must immediately rule out public money being given to this disgraced company for its dangerous coal project,\u201d GetUp\u2019s environment campaign director, Sam Regester, said. \u201cNaif is an infamously opaque body but even its mandate makes it abundantly clear it could never fund a company facing allegations like these.\u201d Environmental Justice Australia\u2019s chief executive, Brendan Sydes, said: \u201cThis information should put the brakes on the proposal that the Australian public should finance Adani\u2019s coal railway through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. \u201cOur research into the Adani Group\u2019s legal compliance history and environmental record identified a number of serious issues that should be of concern to potential financiers.\u201d \u201cThe new [allegations] that a complex web of companies with connections to the Adani Group has massively inflated prices of equipment reinforces existing concerns.\u201d A spokeswoman for Naif said it did not comment on specific proposals in Naif\u2019s pipeline. \u201cWe point out that because a project has moved into a due diligence phase it does not follow that Naif is actively engaged in due diligence,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Naif board takes its responsibilities seriously and has every intention to comply with its duties and obligations in considering and making any investment decisions.\u201d A spokesman for the Queensland government said: \u201cNaif is a matter for the Turnbull government. The Palaszczuk government\u2019s resource policy applies to all greenfield projects in the Galilee and Surat basins and the north-west minerals province. Under this policy, all proponents will pay royalties in full and with interest.\u201d",
