The two stakes, each of about 30%, had been owned by the Green family, wealthy property investors, and by the struggling Irish property tycoon Derek Quinlan. However, accusations that the Barclays' tactics were illegal have been thrown out by the courts.</p> <p>But McKillen has seized upon aspects of Wednesday's appeal court decision in relation to the distressed borrowings of Quinlan. He believes that, for technical legal reasons, the judges' findings on this matter give him another opportunity challenge the Barclays' dominance.Since 2011 McKillen, who still holds a 36% interest in Coroin, has fought a pitched battle against the Barclays' efforts to seize control of these two stakes, pursuing three major legal claims in the high court, and on to the court of appeal, at an estimated cost to all parties of \u00a318m.</p> <p>At the heart of his claim has been an agreement between the original Coroin shareholders designed to keep their interest aligned by preventing stakes being sold to outsiders without first being offered to existing investors \u2013 a common arrangement known as \"pre-emption rights\".</p> <p>The Barclays entered into a flurry of deals in January 2011 which saw them take effective control of the business.

Again, however, the courts found against McKillen's claims that these arrangements amounted to a contractual side-deal linked to Coroin.</p> <p>Sir Frederick Barclays, who declined invitations to give evidence in person at court last year, set the court a written statement, in which he claimed payments to the Quinlan family were made out of compassion for a friend in need. \"My brother and I deeply resent the suggestion that we have been party to an unlawful conspiracy,\" the statement said. \"Helping the Quinlan family in their time of need was something that I will never regret and I would not hesitate to do it again if necessary, regardless of anything to do with Coroin.\"McKillen's latest plans for a crunch board meeting at Coroin come after the appeal court ruled that certain of Quinlan's extensive loans had become so distressed that his creditors could act to seize control of the security pledged. This determination, which overturns a high court decision from Mr Justice Richards last August, has been seized upon by McKillen.</p> <p>He believes the Coroin shareholder agreement requires that, when a shareholder's circumstance becomes financially distressed in this manner, the directors must ensure pre-emption rights are triggered. This would force a sale of Quinlan's stake, even though it is currently controlled by the Barclays.Even though McKillen looks certain to be out-voted on any board meeting resolution, he believes he has the weight of the law behind him and plans to return to the high court yet again should the directors not act as he believes they must.</p> <p>Meanwhile, lawyers in the Barclays camp were yesterday bracing themselves for McKillen's last assault. They are believed to be confident that, even in the event that McKillen successfully requisitions a meeting and is able to take a new claim back to court, he will ultimately be unable to show that his interest have been prejudiced.</p>",

Despite the court of appeal throwing out much of McKillen's legal arguments, in a 51-page decision two of the three judges sitting on the appeal bench have given him hope that he can now insist that, under a long-standing agreement between shareholders, a one-third stake controlled by Sir David and Sir Frederick should be sold.

Sir Frederick Barclays, who declined invitations to give evidence in person at court last year, set the court a written statement, in which he claimed payments to the Quinlan family were made out of compassion for a friend in need. \"My brother and I deeply resent the suggestion that we have been party to an unlawful conspiracy,\" the statement said. \"Helping the Quinlan family in their time of need was something that I will never regret and I would not hesitate to do it again if necessary, regardless of anything to do with Coroin.\"McKillen's latest plans for a crunch board meeting at Coroin come after the appeal court ruled that certain of Quinlan's extensive loans had become so distressed that his creditors could act to seize control of the security pledged. This determination, which overturns a high court decision from Mr Justice Richards last August, has been seized upon by McKillen. He believes the Coroin shareholder agreement requires that, when a shareholder's circumstance becomes financially distressed in this manner, the directors must ensure pre-emption rights are triggered. This would force a sale of Quinlan's stake, even though it is currently controlled by the Barclays.Even though McKillen looks certain to be out-voted on any board meeting resolution, he believes he has the weight of the law behind him and plans to return to the high court yet again should the directors not act as he believes they must. Meanwhile, lawyers in the Barclays camp were yesterday bracing themselves for McKillen's last assault. They are believed to be confident that, even in the event that McKillen successfully requisitions a meeting and is able to take a new claim back to court, he will ultimately be unable to show that his interest have been prejudiced.",

      "bodyText": "Primark, Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer were among 20 retailers summoned to a UK government summit as ministers sought steps to prevent a repeat of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh that killed over 1,000 people. The government wants to use its muscle to help drive up standards in factories supplying UK retailers after the disaster at a complex that supplied clothing bought by British shoppers. About 20 retailers, including Primark, which bought clothing from a factory within Rana Plaza, Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Topshop's owner, Arcadia, were called into the Department for International Development (DfID) on Wednesday to discuss how to avoid another catastrophe in future. Justine Greening, the secretary of state for international development, and the cabinet minister Alan Duncan hosted a \"frank\" and \"robust\" discussion about how clothing could be produced responsibly. Greening said: \"Bangladesh's tragic factory collapse earlier this year was a wake-up call about the urgent need to improve safety standards for employees in developing countries.\" One idea raised at the meeting was a quality assurance scheme similar to the Kitemark, which would help shoppers identify products made with the best ethical standards.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stock markets were spooked by Portugal's descent into political chaos on Wednesday as the threat of a government collapse sent the country's borrowing costs into critical territory and threatened a new phase in the eurozone crisis. The FTSE fell 74 points, or 1.2%, while the German Dax and French CAC tumbled 1.5% as markets digested rumours that the resignation of Portugal's finance minister and foreign minister could be followed by more colleagues. Market unease over the health of the world economy was exacerbated by the political drama unfolding in Egypt and a weakening in China's growth. The Portuguese ministers quit the coalition government this week in a row over the ruling party's handling of the country's economic plight, amid fears that they will be followed by two ministerial colleagues who are members of the junior coalition partner. If that happened, observers fear that they could take down the centre-right government. However, the junior coalition party, CDS-PP, said this evening that there would be no more ministerial resignations. European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, a former Portuguese premier, said the indebted nation risked damaging its hard-earned financial credibility after two years of closely following its \u20ac78bn (\u00a366.4bn) bailout programme, co-ordinated by the International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank. \"This delicate situation requires a great sense of responsibility from all political forces and leaders,\" he said. The government's future hung in the balance after president An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva's office said he would meet the leader of the main opposition Socialists and other parties to discuss the deepening schism in the coalition. Under the constitution, he has the power to dissolve parliament and can invite opposition parties to form a government. Speaking in Berlin, where he was attending the EU summit on youth unemployment, prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho reiterated that he had no plans to resign. He said: \"I am confident that we will be able to surpass this difficulty \u2026 I hope this internal crisis can be overcome very quickly.\" With no solution imminent, the euro fell and the interest rate on Portuguese government debt soared past the 7% level \u2013 where debts are considered unsustainable \u2013 to hit 8.1% at on point, before settling back at 7.5%. The PSI 20 stock index in Lisbon fell by 5%, led by sharp losses of over 10% in bank shares Only last month the IMF said Portugal's ability to meet the terms of a 2011 rescue package was \"fragile\" and the coalition was finding it difficult pushing through spending cuts and labour market reforms. In recent months the IMF has appeared at odds with its bailout partners, preferring to take a more lenient stance than Brussels and the ECB. However, the German government, which is the largest lender under the bailout terms, has forced the trioka to maintain a hard line. Portugal appeared to be on track to meet its obligations and had hoped to return to the international money markets next year to fund its debts, but without a lower interest rate on its debt or a longer payback timetable, that prospect looks under threat. Jan Randolph, director of sovereign risk at IHS Global Insight, said Portugal had won strong support in Berlin for its efforts, but it could only expect further bailout funds if it maintained the pace of reform. He said the situation in the eurozone remained difficult while Spain and Italy struggled to grapple with economic and labour market reforms. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said the combination of surging yields and political uncertainty \"reduces the prospects of Portugal regaining full market access in the next year\", leading to expectations of a new bailout being required. That, in turn, could send Portuguese bond yields even higher as a second bailout could involve Greece-style losses forced upon debt holders, the analysts said. Meanwhile, a report showing slowing growth in China's service sector also weighed on markets. The National Bureau of Statistics reported that China's services PMI, a measure of activity, had fallen to a nine-month low of 53.9 in June from May's 54.3. Oil prices recovered some of the lost ground on Wednesday following fears that turmoil in Egypt will undermine stability in the Middle East and hold up supplies. In the US, the Dow Jones Index closed up 0.4% as investors digested stronger-than-expected private sector jobs data.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Some late breaking news out of Lisbon... the CDS-PP party (the junior coalition partners) have just announced that no more ministers will resign (following rumours this morning that the agriculture and social security ministers might quit). Instead, CDS-PP say they hope to reach a deal to preserve the government. This follows the party's meeting to discuss the way forward, and may mean Pedro Passos Coelho's position is strengthening.... Here's the news flashes from Reuters: 19:04 PORTUGAL'S CDS-PP PARTY SAYS NO MORE MINISTERS WILL RESIGN FROM GOVT 19:05 PORTUGAL CDS-PP PARTY SAYS TO MEET WITH GOVT COALITION PARTY TO AIM TO PRESERVE GOVERNMENT We'll find out more in the morning..... Time to stop this rolling chronicle of the eurozone crisis for the day. Here's a brief closing summary: Portugal's prime minister has vowed to ride out the crisis that has engulfed Lisbon this week, after a day of heavy losses in Europe's stock markets. Pedro Passos Coelho told reporters in Berlin (5.23pm) that: I am confident that we will be able to surpass this difficulty... I hope this internal crisis can be overcome very quickly. Coelho was speaking as his junior coalition partners held talks on whether to withdraw their support, which could trigger a general election. Local media reported that the CDS-PP party had not taken a final decision, but were prepared to 'renegotiate' their relationship with Passos Coelho (details at 6.10pm). The turmoil in Portugal hit the country's bonds hard, driving the yield on 10-year bonds over 8% at one stage in a sign of faltering confidence in its \u20ac78bn bailout programme. The yields slid back to 7.5% tonight, up from 6.5% on Tuesday. Portugal's president is due to hold talks with key party leaders, including the PM, tomorrow in an attempt to hammer out a deal. Some City analysts fear that Passos Coelho's government could collapse, although he could technically carry on at the head of a minority government (see 3.13pm onwards for a round-up of expert reaction) The Portuguese stock market tumbled by more than 5%, while in London the FTSE 100 lost 74 points (see 5.20pm onwards). Other European markets posted heavy losses too. Here's our earlier lunchtime summary I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks and goodnight all. GW Early close on Wall Street, ahead of the Independence Day celebrations tomorrow. Traders seem to have shrugged off the drama in the eurozone, concentrating on today's better-than-expected private sector jobs data (see 1.40pm) and slightly weaker service sector growth. The Dow Jones closed up 56 points, or 0.38%, at 14988. Back to Portugal, and the meeting of the CDS-PP party -- whose leader quit as foreign minister last night to kick off this crisis -- has finished, without clear progress. According to local reports, CDS-PP hasn't taken a formal decision on whether to quit the coalition. The door apparently remains open...... Via Sky's Ed Conway, a graph showing how far Portugal's economic output has fallen since the crisis began. The downturn has been particularly severe since it entered its bailout programme, and agreed to make tough spending cuts and tax rises: (Greece not included) And here's a photo of Pedro Passos Coelho at tonight's press conference, where he struck a defiant tone (see 5.23pm): Finally, political developments, with Portugal's prime minister insisting that he can remain in power. Speaking in Berlin, where he was attending the EU summit on youth unemployment, Pedro Passos Coelho reiterated that he had no plans to resign. Passos Coelho told reporters: I am confident that we will be able to surpass this difficulty... I hope this internal crisis can be overcome very quickly. The PM added that all parties in Portugal have an obligation to maintain political stability. As this photo shows, chancellor Merkel chatted to Passos Coelho during the photoshoot -- and appeared to be offering warm wishes at this difficult time. Europe's stock markets all finished in the red, although Portugal's 5% tumble was avoided. Spain's market suffered the biggest falls. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 74 points at 6229, -1.17% \u2022 German DAX: down 81 points at 7829, -1% \u2022 French CAC: down 40 points at 3702, -1.1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 122 points at 7763, -1.56% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 82 points at 15282, -0.5% Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG, said we should expect 'a summer of market volatility'. Political upheaval in Egypt and an austerity backlash in the Portuguese government... have lead to a strongly negative sentiment today. Portugal's stock market has closed having tumbled by almost 5.2%, down 286 points at 5,244. Every share on the PSI 20 lost ground, with banks leading the selloff -- the three biggest fallers, all financial stocks, lost over 10% each. That is the biggest points fall on the PSI 20 since August 2011, but in percentage terms it looks like the biggest drop since October 2008... With no fresh news from Lisbon this afternoon, the financial markets continue to post heavy losses. The FTSE 100 is down 95 points at 6208, a fall of 1.5%, with 30 minutes of the trading day to go. Portugal's government bonds have recovered a little, though, but are still down sharply. This has pushed up the yield on its 10-year bonds to 7.5%, from 6.5% overnight. That's still deep in the 'danger zone', where borrowing costs aren't sustainable. CMC Markets' Michael Hewson commented: The prospects for further unrest in Egypt appear to have increased with talk that the Egyptian army is set to step in, and President Mursi refuses to step down, while the re-emergence of the European debt crisis, from its previously dormant state has seen the Portuguese government start to come apart at the seams as austerity fatigue pulls at the political fabric of the bailed out country. The selloff in Portuguese bonds has seen yields shoot up by over 100 basis points as the political uncertainty throws into doubt the continuation of the current austerity package and the credibility of the current government. Buffeted by all of this uncertainty we\u2019ve seen Europe\u2019s markets trade lower throughout the day with the biggest fallers being mining stocks and banks. Opponents of the current Portuguese government have taken their message to the streets: City analyts are divided over the chances of the Portuguese prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, holding his government together in the face of today's crisis (see 1.20pm for a round-up of today's developments) Steen Jakobsen, chief economist with Saxo Bank, reckons the administration will call within days, saying: Expect the government to fall in the course of the next 48 hours. A new election will be called amid a huge drive towards \u2018anti-austerity. This is EXACTLY what German Chancellor Angela Merkel does not need. Germany goes to the polls in September, and Merkel must have been hoping for a quiet eurozone summer. Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank said Portugal was \"the key event risk to watch\" in the eurozone, but was optimistic that its European partners could cut it some slack: Some tweaking of the Portuguese program should be possible over time, helping Portugal to stay the course whatever the precise outcome of the political crisis. We remain fundamentally optimistic, especially as the positive results of reforms are starting to show up in the economic data. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group also believes early elections are likely, and that could mean Portugal needs more financial help: While the big question regarding program exit [from its bailout] is still too early to call, it will certainly be complicated by current political developments. While the government has built significant cash buffers to help them manage 2013 financing needs should market appetite wane, ambiguity over the medium term financing plans is still something of a challenge. What is clearer is that the less onerous options-such as an extension of the current program with no increase in the financial envelope and/or conditionality, or a simple surveillance post-program follow-up-become less likely the longer and more comprehensive the political mess in Portugal becomes. While BNP Paribas's Ricard Santos says Portugal could well smudge its eurocrisis copybook, even it it survives the current crisis: The political process is likely to be bumpy and we could see some brinkmanship over the next few months. Portugal could end with another [international support] programme but may lose its image of being a \u2018good student\u2019. The political crisis in Lisbon shows that the eurozone crisis is not over, says the BBC's Gavin Hewitt, who points out that Portugal has tried its best to meet the demands of its euro partners: The government in Lisbon has been zealous in following the Brussels/Berlin script by cutting spending and implementing reforms. Portugal has applied some of the fiercest tax rises and budget cuts. In Brussels it was feted as an example of a country doing everything asked of it It appears, however, that the austerity drive has reached its limits. Even within the government ministers are having doubts. The recession has shown no sign of ending. Unemployment is at 17.6%. There are 932,000 people without jobs. Thousands of graduates are leaving the country. Last week Portugal endured another general strike. More here: Eurozone crisis: Why Portugal matters In Portugal, the CDS-PP party has been holding a meeting to discuss its next move following the resignation of party leader Paulo Portas last night. Several scenarios are possible. CDS ministers could resign from the coalition government, but still promise to support it. Or they could withdraw their support altogether, which would strip prime minister Passos Coelho of his majority. A minority government wouldn't be too unusual for Portugal, but it would run the constant risk of collapse. Open Europe, the think tank, explains there are three ways that Passos Coalho could be ousted. Prime Minister Passos Coelho chooses to resign. He said yesterday he does not want to, but could be forced to quit at some point if he loses his majority in parliament. A no-confidence motion is adopted by the parliament. The key would again be how CDS-PP votes. If the party abstained, Passos Coelho\u2019s party would have enough votes to win. Interestingly, opposition parties in Portugal can only submit one no-confidence motion per parliamentary year. The new parliamentary year starts on 15 September. The Socialist Party, the Communist Party and the Left Bloc have already submitted a joint motion earlier this year, but the Greens have not. This government has already survived four no-confidence votes since it took office in 2011, five may be a step too far. Passos Coelho requests a vote of confidence and loses it. The Prime Minister could decide to test his majority. However, he would have no chance of winning the vote if CDS-PP votes against him. More here: The forgotten man of the eurozone returns to the headlines as Portuguese government struggles to stay afloat Thought for the afternoon: Not forgetting an economic and social crisis, right?.... While Europe's economy struggles, America's private sector created another 188,000 new jobs last month -- the best performance since Febuary. That's more than the City had expected (160,000 was pencilled in). Economists reckon it could mean the offical US jobs figure, due on Friday, is better than forecast, as the US economy continues to heal. Time for a catch-up on events in Portugal this morning. \u2022 World markets have fallen sharply today and Portuguese government borrowing costs have soared as the political crisis in Lisbon threatens to bring down its government, inflaming the eurozone crisis again. Investors were shaken by last night's resignation of the Portuguese foreign minister, Paulo Portas, who also leads the junior partner in Portugal's increasingly shaky coalition (see 7.59am for the background). \u2022 The yield, or interest rate, on Portugal's ten-year bonds roared over the 8% mark for the first time in 2013, from under 6.5% at the start of the week. That shows City traders were driving down the value of its bonds as they lost faith in Portugal's ability to exit its bailout next year. \u2022 Amid rumours that two other ministers, both members of Portas's conservative party, might also resign (see 8.38am), the country's president called talks later this week with the main party leaders (12.12pm). President Anibal Cavaco Silva may manage to broker a deal to hold the government together -- otherwise, there is the risk of early elections. \u2022 While Portuguese bonds slumped, shares also fell across Europe. The UK, French and German stock markets all tumbled around 1.6%, with the FTSE 100 shedding 102 points at 6201. Portugal's own stock index, the PSI20, plunged by over 5%, led by its banking stocks. \u2022 Although Portugal's prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho vowed to fight on last night (video at 11.02am), analysts fear that his government's days may be numbered. David Madden of IG Index warned that the crisis showed unpopularity of European austerity programmes : Portugal had, until now, succeeded in keeping out of the limelight, quietly getting on with tough reforms while everyone fretted about the bigger worries of Spain and Italy. Markets don\u2019t like to return to problems they thought had been solved, but the slow-motion disintegration of the Portuguese coalition and the alarming spike in bond yields shows that the medicine of austerity is still a very tough pill to swallow. The slump in European markets was also due to events in Egypt, where the deadlline set by its army expires this afternoon (live coverage here). Portas said he was resigning in protest at Passos Coelho's decision to promote Treasury Secretary Maria Luis Albuquerque to become Portugal's new finance minister, succeeding Vitor Gaspar who resigned on Monday night. \u2022 The crisis in Portugal has alarmed top European officials in Brussels. Jose Manuel Barroso, head of the European Commission, issued a statement urging political parties on all sides to act responsibly (details at 11.51am). But following last night's anti-government protest in Lisbon, many economists warned that the eurozone financial crisis was inflamed again. And Portugal isn't the only area of concern.... ...It looks increasingly unlikely that the Greek government will satisfy its Troika of lenders that it is meeting its own bailout targets in time for a meeting of eurozone finance ministers next Monday. That raises the chance that Athens' next aid tranche, worth \u20ac8.1bn, might only be dolled out in stages. (see 11.42am) \u2022 We've also had mediocre economic data from the eurozone private sector (9.39am) \u2022 and strong UK service sector data (see 9.44am) Portugal's president is taking steps to address the political crisis gripping Lisbon, and spooking the world's financial markets (see 10.11am). Amid rumours this morning that two more ministers could resign soon, president Anibal Cavaco Silva will meet with the leader of the main opposition Socialist party later today. He's then planning to told talks with embattled prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho on Thursday, followed by other parties (presumably including CDS-PP, whose leader resigned as foreign minister last night to precipate the crisis). Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, has issued a statement urging Portugal's political leaders to show a 'great sense of responsibility'. Barroso said he was watching events unfold in Portugal \"with very serious concern\" following the resignation of its foreign minister last night, and its finance minister on Monday. Here's Barroso's full statement: The European Commission and I personally are following the political crisis in Portugal with very serious concern. The initial reaction of the markets shows the obvious risk that the financial credibility recently built up by Portugal could be jeopardized by the current political instability. If this happens it would be especially damaging for the Portuguese people, particularly as there were already preliminary signs of economic recovery. This delicate situation requires a great sense of responsibility from all political forces and leaders. The political situation should be clarified as soon as possible. We trust that Portuguese democracy will deliver a solution ensuring that the sacrifices the Portuguese people have made until now will not have been in vain. Regarding those 'preliminary signs of economic recovery' - the latest GDP data showed that Portugal's economy shrank by -0.4% in the first three months of this year, and was 4% smaller than a year ago. Meanwhile in Greece, there is growing acceptance that it won't satisfy its lenders that it is hitting its bailout targets, in time for the meeting of eurozone ministers on Monday. In particular, Athens looks highly unlikely to meet demands to shake up and slim down its civil service, by moving over 12,000 to a new pool where they'd be parked on lower wages. After meeting top officials from the Troika (the IMF, European Central Bank and EC) last night, administrative reform Kyriakos Mitsotakis said it would take \"several months\" to get the scheme right And a senior finance ministry official has warned this morning: There is no chance that we will satisfy the current demands as they are set out. Greece needs to satisfy the Troika to qualify for its next aid payment, worth \u20ac8.1bn. As we've been writing for days, there's a very strong chance that it will only be paid in installments. Over in Brussels, eurozone officials have been telling the press pack that Greece might need to wait three months until it gets its aid tranche. The WSJ's Matina Stevis has the details: Meanwhile, the Troika are continuing their mission to Athens today: The unfolding crisis in Portugal underlines that the eurozone's problems are fundamentally political, points out Stephen King, HSBC's chief economist, on Twitter. King also points out that the political instability in Portugal shows the flaws within the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme (the Outright Monetary Transactions scheme). Countries can apply to the OMT if they agree to meet tough conditions on economic reforms -- but how can they persuade the ECB that they'll stick to them? Here's a video clip of Portugal's' PM addressing the nation last night: And here's the details of Jeroen Dijsselbloem's comments on Portugal this morning, from Reuters: Eurogroup chair Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Wednesday he expected the situation in Portugal to stabilise and for the country to remain committed to the terms of its bailout.\"The situation in Portugal is worrying,\" Dijsselbloem told a Dutch parliamentary committee when questioned about the latest crises in the euro zone. \"I assume the political situation in Portugal will stabilise and that Portugal will stay committed to the undertakings that are part of its programme.\" As Eurogroup chief, Dijsselbloem will also chair next Monday's meeting when eurozone finance ministers will consider whether Greece is meeting the terms of its bailout package (of which more shortly....). News flashes from Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the eurogroup: \u2022 EUROGROUP'S DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS SITUATION IN PORTUGAL IS WORRYING BUT ASSUMES IT WILL STABILISE \u2022 EUROGROUP'S DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS EXPECTS PORTUGAL TO REMAIN COMMITTED TO ITS BAILOUT PROGRAMME (via Reuters) The latest eurozone retail sales, just released, include a reminder of how much damage has been caused to the Portuguese economy since its austerity programme began. On an annual basis, Portugal's customers spent 3.6% less on retail goods than a year ago -- with only Spain (-6.3%) and Romania (-4.4%) suffering more. But the data, from Eurostat, did also provide some hope. Eurozone retail sales rose for the first time in four months in May, by 1% \u2013 that's a bigger jump than expected. On an annual basis, though, sales were 1.5% lower. European stock markets are in retreat this morning. Portugal's political crisis (see 7.59am onwards), escalating protests in Egypt (liveblog), and weak Chinese data made a \"toxic cocktail of bad news\", as my colleague Nick Fletcher explains here: Markets tumble on Portuguese fears and tension in Egypt The FTSE 100 has been flirting with a triple-digit loss this morning, led by mining shares after China's service sector data showed slower growth. And with Portugal's stock market down 7% and heading for its worst days trading in five years, traders across the eurozone are selling heavily. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 95 points at 6208, - 1.5% \u2022 German DAX: down 146 points at 7764, -1.8% * French CAC: down 62 points at 1.67% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 222 points at 7664, - 2.8% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 289 points at 15076, -1.88% Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, says the Portuguese crisis is a real worry, but not the only one: Concerns over instability in Egypt are well founded given the swell of unrest in recent weeks, and with political in-fighting rearing its ugly head in Portugal the market breathed a collective sigh of disappointment as once more we\u2019re forced to contemplate the impact of political incompetence on asset prices. Very decent UK data this morning -- Britain's service sector posted its strongest growth in over two years in June, according to Markit's monthly survey. At 56.9, the UK service sector PMI was the highest since March 2011. This shows the UK continues to outperform the eurozone economy -- and probably grew by at least 0.5% in the second quarter. More details here (pdf) The eurozone's private sector suffered another drop in activity last month, but it may be bottoming out. That's the message from today's PMI surveys from Markit -- its monthly measure of output across Europe's service and manufacturing sectors). Markit's monthly measure of eurozone private sector output came in at 48.7 for June, the highest reading since March 2012. That still indicates another contraction, though. Here's the highlights: (anything above 50=growth) Ireland: 53.2 -- 5-month high Germany: 50.4 -- 3-month high Spain: 48.1 -- 24-month high France: 47.4 -- 10-month high Italy: 47.0 -- 21-month high Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, believes the data shows the eurozone recession continued in the last three months, but should finally end before 2014. The sub-50 PMI reading for June indicates that the euro area recession has extended into a record seventh consecutive quarter. The survey is broadly consistent with GDP falling by 0.2% in the second quarter, similar to the decline seen in the first three months of the year. However, there is good reason to believe that the region is stabilizing and on course to return to growth during the second half of the year. More details here. Today's rout in Portuguese debt comes just two months after it sold \u20ac3bn of 10-year bonds, in a popular auction. Investors are now sitting on hefty losses, as this chart shows: Regaining market access is a key step for Portugal towards exiting its bailout, which ends next year. Today's events suggest that will be rather harder... Traders have been dashing to sell Portuguese debt this morning, driving down its price - and thus pushing up the interest rate (yield) on the bonds. From below 6.5% on Monday morning, the yield on 10-year Portuguese debt has now hit 8%, according to Tradeweb data. That means it is seen as increasingly risky. The crisis in Portugal was sparked by the resignation, on Monday afternoon, of finance minister Vitor Gaspar - who appeared to have lost faith in the austerity programme he'd help create and implement. Demonstrators took to the streets of Lisbon last night to show their anger, carrying banners and chanting for prime minister Passos Coelho to step down. Portuguese local media are reporting that Agriculture Minister Assuncao Cristas and Social Security Minister Pedro Mota Soares are preparing to resign this morning (via Reuters). They're both members of the Conservative Popular party, the junior coalition partner led by Paulo Portas (who quit as foreign minister last night - see 7.59am). As the BBC's Gavin Hewitt tweets, the Lisbon government is looking shakier and shakier. The political crisis appears to be worsening by the hour. According to Reuters, local media in Portugal say that more ministers are considering resigning.... * PORTUGUESE LOCAL MEDIA SAYS MORE GOVERNMENT MINISTERS READY TO RESIGN Shares are sliding on the Portuguese stock market in early trading, sending the PSI 20 index of leading stocks tumbling by almost 6%. The sell-off is lead by the banks, which are suffering double-digit falls. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Portugal has been dragged deeper into the eurozone crisis after its government was rocked by its second resignation last night. Portuguese government debt is falling sharply in early trading, as investors react to the news that prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho is fighting to hold his administration together after his foreign minister dramatically quit. Last night Passos Coelho refused to resign, telling the country that he would deliver a \"rapid return to stability\", and pledging: I will not resign or abandon my country. But the resignation of Paulo Portas, the leader of the conservative Popular Party which is the junior partner in the coalition government, could have major political and economic ramifications. Portas's resignation has raised new questions on whether Portugal can push on with its unpopular programme of spending cuts and tax rises. With austerity fagitue rife in Portugal, can Passos Coelho hold things together? The early reaction from the City isn't encouraging: Portuguese sovereign debt has slumped in value this morning. This has driven the yield (or interest rate) on its 10-year bonds up sharply. It's now above the 7% mark, from less than 6.5% at the start of the week. That 7% mark is significant. In the history of the eurozone crisis, countries have looked in peril once their borrowing costs have moved above that level (although both Spain and Italy looked into the abyss and survived without a bailout). The market is saying that Portugal's chances of escaping its own bailout programme are falling.... It's going to be a busy day, I think. Away from Portugal, the Troika continue their visit to Greece, and there's a swathe of economic data due - this time covering the world's service sectors. Plus Eurozone retail sales later this morning. I'll be covering all the action through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke was not at the Aspen Ideas Festival, but he's all anyone can talk about \u2013 or rather, not talk about. At the Ideas Festival, the various economic and financial luminaries simultaneously privately wondered about Bernanke and publicly refused to speculate. Both current Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and a former one, Bob Rubin, were badgered about Bernanke's plans several times. They stubbornly refused to allow even a wisp of an answer. Take this exchange (pdf) between Secretary Lew and his interviewer, David Leonhardt of the New York Times. Leonhardt: \"Are you playing a major role in helping the president decide who to nominate for the next term at the Fed? Not monetary policy.\" Lew: \"David, I think I'm going to stick to my answer on monetary policy, which is my conversations on this with the president should remain private.\" Leonhardt also interviewed Rubin, who evaded the question of Bernanke's term quickly: \"I think I'm going to leave that subject.\" If it's any comfort, however, the absent Bernanke received rave reviews. David Rubenstein, the co-founder of the Carlyle Group, said: \"Ben Bernanke reinvented the Federal Reserve system \u2026 the Fed decided that because Congress was dysfunctional, the only way to get the economy going again was QE1, QE2 and QE3 \u2026 he's done a wonderful job.\" Rubin credited Bernanke with saving the economy with QE1, which he called \"critical to getting off the abyss\".

      "bodyText": "Nicole Farhi, the upmarket British fashion label, has become the latest high street casualty, collapsing into administration and putting more than 100 jobs at risk. The collapse of the label, which has six stores, 10 concessions in department stores and a wholesale business selling to major stores like John Lewis, is the latest in a wave of retail casualties in recent days including Dwell, the furniture retailer, and Modelzone, the toy store. More than 2,000 jobs have been put at risk in the past fortnight as retailers tumble in the face of a tough economic environment, competition from the internet and rising business rates. The problems facing those that have been struggling increased last week as retailers faced quarterly rent bills on 26 June. The Nicole Farhi label was founded in 1982 under the umbrella of French Connection, the high street retailer, still run by the designer's former husband, Stephen Marks. French Connection sold the brand in 2010 for \u00a35m. Since then, the company has had two separate private equity owners. Kelso Place Asset Management promised to invest more than \u00a315m in the business when it took over in January last year. But on Wednesday Peter Saville, Fraser Gray and Anne O'Keefe at Zolfo Cooper were appointed administrators. Nicole Farhi will continue to trade while administrators try to find a buyer. Saville said discussions were being held with a \"huge\" number of interested parties. Nicole Farhi herself is rumoured to want to buy the label, although the designer has not been involved in the business for some time. The stores will continue to accept gift vouchers and returned goods. Saville said: \"Nicole Farhi is a very powerful retail brand. Unfortunately, as with many other fashion retailers, the decline in high street spend coupled with rising costs has led to increased financial pressures on the business.\" He added that the label had been caught between a dash for either high-level luxury or cheap high street brands such as Primark and so had not been able to attract enough shoppers. Nicole Farhi has also stuck largely to the UK and Saville said that several potential buyers were interested in overseas expansion. The company had revenues of \u00a311.75m but made an operating loss of \u00a32.33m for the year to January 2011, according to the latest accounts available at Companies House. The Dwell chain was bought out of administration on Wednesday by its founder Aamir Ahmad in a deal that could save 150 jobs. Several of the chain's 23 stores are expected to reopen this weekend.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stealing electricity to power cannabis farms is costing consumers millions of pounds a year, and the industry must do more to investigate, according to the regulator Ofgem. Overall, there are around 25,000 cases of electricity theft each year, costing customers \u00a3200m, or the equivalent of \u00a37 each a year. Up to a third of the electricity stolen goes to heat premises used to grow cannabis, Ofgem said. The regulator is proposing new rules to reduce the instances of theft, with fines for suppliers who do not comply. Under the proposals, suppliers would have to set up a national theft risk assessment service to help them target premises where there are strong suspicions that electricity is being stolen. Suppliers and network companies would also be required to create an industry code of practice governing how theft investigations should be carried out, to ensure a consistent approach across the industry. They would have to share \"best practice\" methods and knowledge about how cases of theft are identified, and liaise with agencies such as the police and Home Office over how to tackle electricity theft relating to cannabis farms, Ofgem suggested. Andrew Wright, chief executive of Ofgem, said: \"We want to make sure consumers are paying no more than they need to for their electricity, and lives are not put at risk. \"It is critical that suppliers do all they can to clamp down on theft. This is why Ofgem is introducing new rules to encourage better detection.\" Energy UK, the trade association of the energy industry which represents more than 80 companies, said the proposals were welcome. A spokesman said: \"Electricity theft is dangerous and illegal. Contact with live electricity cables can kill, and tampered meters cause fires. Theft also costs honest customers money, which is why energy companies take this \u2013 and gas theft \u2013 very seriously. \"Every year our members detect and prosecute criminals. When energy companies find electricity thieves, they will prosecute.\" Rising numbers of consumers are finding they are subject to thieves who tamper with their gas and electricity meters to redirect some of their supply. One 70-year-old British Gas customer received a bill for more than \u00a31,200 for four months electricity supply. After an investigation, it was clear the meter had been tampered with before she moved in, and the bill was wiped.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hopes of an economic recovery are growing as the UK's dominant services sector expanded at its fastest rate in more than two years, according to monthly data. Service sector firms, which account for three-quarters of the economy, reported surging workloads in June, prompting the biggest increase in new staff hires since before the financial crisis hit in August 2007. The purchasing managers' index soared to 56.9 in June, up from 54.9, its highest level for 27 months. A figure above 50 means growth, according to Markit, which compiles the survey. The strong demand for services comes as Mark Carney, the new Bank of England governor, starts his first monetary policy committee meeting buoyed by a slew of positive economic data. This week saw confirmation that British manufacturers enjoyed their strongest growth for two years in June, while the construction sector grew for the second consecutive month. The figures confirm that the UK continues to outperform the eurozone, where combined manufacturing and services output continues to fall. \"The buoyant picture for June means the economy is on course to expand by at least 0.5% in the second quarter, with more growth to come,\" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist. \"New orders and job creation across all sectors are now rising at the fastest rates for almost six years, led by the vast services economy, boding well for robust growth momentum to be sustained as we move into the second half of the year.\" David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the figures confirmed that services were leading the UK out of recession. \"I don't believe that the economy is booming, but the figures confirm the recovery is under way,\" he said. The recovery is widely spread, he added, although the service sector is performing better than other parts of the economy. \"It would be wrong to say we can relax now,\" he said, warning of risks from renewed problems in the eurozone, the fallout from the US Federal Reserve's decision to wind down financial stimulus, and in the UK, rising inflation and tight access to credit. \"Many small firms are still finding it difficult in getting finance on acceptable terms; there is a bottleneck.\" The surging demand for services has dampened expectations that the Bank of England will opt for more financial stimulus when it concludes a two-day monetary policy meeting on Thursday. The data reinforces the view that the Bank will sit tight on quantitative easing, said Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight. But he predicted the bank would not give up on QE and forecast an injection of \u00a325bn into the economy in August. \"This reflects our belief that Mark Carney is likely to be keen to build up escape velocity from extended economic weakness.\"",
