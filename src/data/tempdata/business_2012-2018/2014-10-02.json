    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England wants powers to intervene in the mortgage market which would allow policymakers to limit the value of loans to homeowners and prevent a housing bubble disrupting the financial system. Threadneedle Street is asking the chancellor, George Osborne, for powers to restrict the size of mortgages compared with the value of a property and borrowers\u2019 income, in what is a major policy shift following the 2008 banking crisis. The buy-to-let market will also be part of its considerations when deciding to apply any restrictions. The move follows the chancellor\u2019s request in June that the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC), established by the coalition in response to the 2008 crash, consider what tools it might need to contain any future crisis. The Bank is keeping a close eye on the housing market because two-thirds of the 46 systemic banking crises globally were preceded by housing boom-bust cycles. The FPC added that \u201ccyclical exuberance in the buy-to-let sector can bolster house price increases, thereby amplifying risks from the housing market more broadly\u201d. But economists at Capital Economics said the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers were unlikely to use any future intervention soon as there was evidence that the housing market was cooling. Recent data from Nationwide shows house prices fell last month for the first time in 17 months, although average London prices reached another record high of \u00a3401,000 \u2013 31% above their 2007 peak. The Bank had already taken steps in June to recommend that lenders restrict the amount of lending to borrowers asking for loans of above 4.5 times their income. But as a result of the new powers it is asking for - which could be legislated for by May - the Bank will now be able to direct lenders to make changes to their lending policies. The FPC rejected asking for a more sophisticated set of tools to cool a potential housing bubble but made clear it intended to focus on help to buy, a market has expanded from 4% of lending in 2000 to 12% in the second quarter of 2014. It took no new immediate steps to restrain the market as it did not recommend any changes to the help-to-buy mortgage guarantee scheme which the International Monetary Fund had warned could make families vulnerable to a rate rise. The FPC, chaired by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said the fees being charged by lenders to access help-to-buy need not change. \u201cThe committee does not see a case for changing the fee or the house price cap on financial stability grounds at this point,\u201d the FPC said. Osborne said: \u201cI was pleased to see the committee\u2019s conclusions that the scheme does not pose material risks to financial stability in the UK and has not been a material driver of recent house price growth.\u201d The Council of Mortgage lenders said it did not believe help-to-buy was stoking any bubbles. \u201cIt is reaching its intended target, but not stoking disproportionate levels of activity in low-deposit lending nor acting as any significant influence on house prices,\u201d said Paul Smee, the group\u2019s director. The FPC was publishing its views on the mortgage restrictions after its last quarterly meeting, in which it revealed that it had discussed how \u201cgeopolitical and event risks appear more marked\u201d than when it met in June. The committee had been briefed on the risks surrounding the Scottish referendum. The FPC said markets had been \u201cremarkably resilient\u201d to risks in the financial system and it was looking at liquidity levels.",

      "bodyText": "OK, that\u2019s all for tonight. Our summary of today\u2019s ECB press conference is here: ECB press conference - what we learned Coverage of the protests in Naples starts here: Anti-austerity protests in Naples as ECB governing council meets And our round-up of the heavy losses in Europe is here: European stock markets suffer heavy falls Back tomorrow. G\u2019nite! GW One final splash of news, retail billionaire Mike Ashley has increased his stake in Debenhams. Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct told the City tonight that it has bought more than 56 million Debenhams shares, equal to a 4.6% stake. Added to the \u2018put option\u2019 taken out earlier this year (the right to buy shares at a certain value), and Ashley controls 11.2% of Debs. So what\u2019s he up to? With Ashley, you can never be sure if he\u2019s playing the market or pulling off something strategic. Officially, the line is that: Sports Direct is already working together with Debenhams and looks forward to building this relationship. Over in Buenos Aires, the main stock market has tumbled almost 9% following the resignation of Argentina\u2019s central bank governor, Juan Carlos F\u00e1brega, last night. That photo of Mario Draghi and his fellow governing council members in Naples has prompted some debate on Twitter, along the lines of \u2018where\u2019s the diversity?\u2019: Ouch. Europe\u2019s major stock markets have just closed with heavy losses across the board, with the FTSE 100 tumbling by over 100 points. Disappointment that the ECB didn\u2019t sound bolder today has mixed with ongoing worries over the protests in Hong Kong, and geopolitical troubles in the Middle East. Fresh falls on Wall Street also hit sentiment in Europe. The FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip companies shed 111 points to 6,446, down 1.69%. That\u2019s its lowest level since early February, so almost an eight-month low. The Italian MIB led the fallers, shedding almost 4% in a nervy selloff in Milan. Traders appear disappointed that Mario Draghi didn\u2019t give more details about the ABS stimulus programme; does this mean it won\u2019t be big enough to make a difference? Here\u2019s how the markets closed a few minutes ago: Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says geopolitical fears and the ECB have driven shares down: Commodity stocks dependent on Asian demand have suffered as traders continue to view images of unrest on the streets of Hong Kong. Fears that this could escalate have instigated a selloff, with investors looking to reduce their risk exposure. Following the latest ECB press conference and Mario Draghi\u2019s Q&amp;A session European equity markets have shown how uninspired they are, falling across the board. Spanish and Italian government bonds have also weakened in value, pushing up the interest rates on the debt. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, blames the European Central Bank: Mario Draghi gave an extraordinarily non-committal performance at the latest ECB press conference, avoiding any firm indication of the size of the its purchase programme. Eurozone sovereign debt markets tell a tale of disappointment, with prices falling and yields rising, suggesting that markets had priced in hopes of sovereign debt purchases. Over in Washington, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, has warned that the global economy risked having mediocre growth for some time to come. Lagarde also announced that her Washington-based organisation would trim its growth forecasts when it meets next week. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Ahead of the Fund\u2019s annual meeting, Lagarde urged action - including an easing of austerity, job creation programmes and higher spending on infrastructure - to boost growth. \u201cOur main job now is to help the global economy shift gears and overcome what has been so far a disappointing recovery: one that is brittle, uneven, and beset by risks\u201d, Lagarde said in a speech. The Fund\u2019s half-yearly world economic outlook in April predicted growth of 3.6% in 2014, rising to 3.9% in 2015, but Lagarde said: \u201cOverall, the global economy is weaker than we had envisaged even six months ago. Only a modest pickup is foreseen for 2015, as the outlook for potential growth has been pared down. \u201cYes, there is a recovery but as we all know\u2014and can all feel it\u2014the level of growth and jobs is simply not good enough.\u201d Are markets simply being too impatient, and making unacceptable demands on the European Central Bank? Nick Gartside, international CIO for Fixed Income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, reckons investors should cut Draghi and co some slack: What investors take away from today\u2019s announcement is that markets need to give the ECB a little bit of a break. After all, we\u2019ve had big measures in June, big measures in September. It\u2019s imminently realistic for markets to give this some time to see how things will work in practice. Draghi was very explicit on one key performance indicator \u2014 the evolution of inflation expectations \u2013 which he was clear to say will be monitored over years (not months). Importantly he also repeated the willingness to engage in \u2018other measures\u2019 available, which to us is a significant signal of the ECB\u2019s commitment to utilise the entire toolkit as/if it becomes necessary. Analysts at Berenberg bank say Mario Draghi disappointed some investors today, even though he gave more details about the plan to buy bundles of debt from eurozone banks. In a note to clients, Christian Schulz say: As expected, the ECB put flesh to the bones of the asset purchase programmes pre-announced at the September meeting. However, it did not deliver a single big number and did not go beyond these announcements. That may come as a disappointment to some observers. In particular, the language on purchases of sovereign bonds did not change. Schulz also reckon France should be worried by Draghi\u2019s comments about \u2018delivering on commitments\u2019: Draghi gave a stark warning to France to live up to the fiscal adjustment commitments it made in previous budget rounds. Since the ECB is involved in reviewing the budgets as part of the European semester which starts in mid-October, France could be headed for stiff headwinds, up to financial penalties being imposed by the EU Commission. Since these could only be averted by a qualified majority of the member states, France faces an uphill battle and will probably have to make significant concessions. If not on fiscal targets, than on structural reforms. European stock markets have suffered deeper losses, following the ECB\u2019s failure to say how big its asset purchase scheme will be. The FTSE 100 is down 57 points, or 0.88%, to 6499, and there\u2019s a serious selloff underway in Milan where the Italian MIB has shed 3.5%. But while the ECB was meeting in Naples\u2019 Capodimonte palace, this was the scene outside: If you want to seriously annoy a top policymaker, tell them people feel they\u2019re doing a bad job. Mario Draghi\u2019s most animated moment in today\u2019s press conference (coverage starts here) came when he was asked to comment on the protests that have been taking place in Naples today. His passionate defence of the ECB\u2019s role in the crisis \u2013 look at our interest rate cuts, our liquidity measures \u2013 suggests that the sight of his fellow Italians holding banners declaring \u201cBlock the ECB\u201d and \u201cJob insecurity, poverty, unemployment, speculation. Free us from the ECB!\u201d may have hurt him. Draghi urged critics to remember the situation in 2011 and 2012, when \u201cthe financial system seemed on the verge of collapsing\u201d. As the ECB president put it: I find that this description of the ECB as the guilty actor needs to be corrected. 2) Draghi also said that the rise of euroscepticism in Europe is understandable given economic conditions: \u201cIt\u2019s very understandable that people are Eurosceptical because things are not going well... In this part of the world (southern Europe) things are not going well because you have pervasive unemployment and you have very weak economic activity with ... in some countries, with a recession that seems to never end.\u201d While in Northern Europe, people are unhappy because they feel they are paying for everyone else, he added. But given current conditions, will either end of Europe feel happier soon? 3) The meat of today\u2019s news is that the ECB will start buying covered bonds from banks this month, and launch its asset-purchase scheme before the end of the year. Draghi insisted that this QE-style programme, which will run for two years, will help to push inflation towards target. \u201cAs all our measures work their way through to the economy they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to our aim.\u201d 4) But the ECB has also decided that it will only buy junk-rated bonds from Greek and Cypriot banks if their national governments are in a \u2018programme\u2019 with the EU. That could be awkward for Athens, which has vowed not to take a third bailout. And Draghi also refused to say how large the ABS programme will be, disappointing those who had expected a big announcement. 5) Several time during the press conference, Draghi insisted that European governments must implement structural reforms and stick to the EU\u2019s deficit rules. He declared that France needs to deliver on its pledges; just a day after Paris announced a budget that won\u2019t bring its deficit under 3% until 2017. And he also denied that there is a \u2018grand bargain\u2019 between the ECB and national governments. 6) The ECB appears to be more concerned about the weak inflation levels, after seeing CPI hit just 0.3% last month. Draghi flagged up that low energy prices and a high euro cannot be blamed any longer. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. No major shockers today. Key points to follow..... The details of the new stimulus scheme, based on ABS and covered bond purchases, are coming out now.... Q: What message does the ECB have to the protestors on the streets of Naples? Draghi launches a pretty impassioned defence of the European Central Bank, and his role in the crisis. We understand the reasons behind the protests, he says, and \u201cfrankly\u201d they have to do with the weak situation of this country, and its weak economy. He then insists that the idea that the ECB is somehow guilty, and is the origin of the situation, needs to be correct. He tells Italians to: Go back and ask yourself how were you two and a half, 3 years ago. The financial system seems on the verge of collapsing. We have slashed interest rates until they can\u2019t be cut any more. We are charging banks negative interest rates. We have injected large amounts of liquidity into the system. I find that this description of the ECB as the guilty actor needs to be corrected. Is Mario feeling a little unloved in his homeland? Q: Is the ECB worried about the decline in core inflation last month? We are closely monitoring these developments, Draghi replies. For a while, the drop in energy prices was the main factor behind weak inflation. Then it was the strong appreciation of the exchange rate. Now, more recently, it can\u2019t be blamed just on oil prices, food prices, and the exchange rate. There is clearly another level - partly based on unemployment. The longer we stay in a low-inflation environment, the longer that cyclical factor influences the inflation rate. Q: What does Mario Draghi think about France\u2019s decision to not hit its deficit target until 2017? (a decision support by Italy\u2019s PM today)? Draghi replies that the ECB, the EU, all major players in Europe, all have \u201can enormous interest\u201d in France returning to growth and lowering unemployment. We do trust the government to take all the necessary reforms.... starting with a forceful implementation of the responsibility pact. We\u2019ve been talking about these measure for a long time - the time for implementation is now. Reporters are trying to get more details out of Mario Draghi about the ABS programme. He says that the \u201cground work\u201d for having a sizeable impact is there, along with other programmes such as the TLTRO programme of cheap loans launched recently. Q: What does Mario Draghi think about the rise of eurosceptic parties in Europe? The ECB president replies that it is \u201cunderstandable that people are eurosceptic because things are not going well, in opposite directions\u201d Here in Italy...you have high unemployment and a weak economy. In other countries, there are recessions that never seem to end. In the other part of Europe, they feel that they are paying for everyone else. That\u2019s another reason to not being happy. He argues, though, that you can\u2019t blame the eurozone. Countrie that need to do structural reforms, consolidate their finances, would have to do it regardless of whether they are in the euro or not. Q: Can you clarify the point about only buying junk-rated asset-backed securities from Greek banks if Greece government is in a programme with the EU? There must be a programme. No programme, no purchases, Draghi replies. The euro has gained in value during the press conference, up around 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.266. Perhaps investors had expected more action today (there\u2019s not been any fireworks yet) Q: Is there a policy target for the value of the euro, and how can Mario Draghi explain to people in the shops and at the pump that higher inflation would be good for them? Daghi insists that there is no explicit target for the euro (which has fallen in recent weeks). On the merits of inflation, yes, the low inflation rate has meant a boost in real incomes. Draghi says there are signs of a slight fall in slack in the labour market (although from a high level). And the ECB hopes that \u201cwhen we see some price pressure back in economy we\u2019d also, at the same time, we\u2019d like to see some strengthening in the economy\u201d. What kind of structural reforms are needed? Mario Draghi takes a swipe at red tape, citing the example of someone who wants to open a new shop but is forced to apply for various permissions. By the time he gets these permissions, he has been overwhelmed by taxes, Draghi bemoans. Q: Do Mario Draghi\u2019s comments about governments needing to do more mean he is running out of instruments? There\u2019s no grand bargain here, Draghi insists. The point is that our measure only work if other things happen too. We need demand policies, and we need structural reforms. There is no bargain here. Each actor has its role to perform Q: By how much does the ECB want to expand its balance sheet (it has cited 2012 levels, but it varied during that year): Mario Draghi says he understands why we want a precise number. But he\u2019s not going to provide one! Our mandate is to get inflation back to just below 2% - that\u2019s how we\u2019ll measure success, he says. That\u2019s one question ducked Next question, does the ECB think that inflation expectations are still well-anchored? We don\u2019t use one measure, Draghi replies, we use a range. And yes, our expectations have gone down, if you use the five-year vs five-year inflation expectations measure (this is the measure he cited in his Jackson Hole speech in August) Inflation expectations have worsened, and risks have increased, Draghi says. That\u2019s why we are launching the ABS and covered bond purchase programme, to underpin inflation expectations. First question: can we have more details about the ABS programme please, and will it allow the ECB to bundles of Greek and Cypriot bank loans with Junk ratings? Draghi: You\u2019ll get full details after the press conference. It\u2019s hard to give a precise figure because the programme is tied up with other ECB programmes (such as the new TLTRO loan offer). In total, all our efforts will have a sizeable impact on the balance sheet, he insists. Draghi points out that the ECB has been accepting asset-backed securities (bundles of loans) for a while as collateral. But some structured ABSs that are acceptable as collateral will not be suitable for outright purchase, he says. And on Greek and Cyprus junk bonds... they could be included, but with \u2018caveats\u2019. These ABS\u2019s need to be adjusted, so that the assets bought there will be risk-equivalent to assets bought elsewhere. And, those countries would still need to have a programme with the EU. So, the ECB wouldn\u2019t accept assets from Greece and Cyprus if they weren\u2019t in a bailout programme..... Mario Draghi is now taking questions (that was a quicker statement than usual). European countries must not let progress unravel, and should stick to the responsibility pact, says Draghi. That\u2019s a signal to France, I feel, which isn\u2019t planning to hit its 3% deficit target until 2017, several years late. Credit supply growth also remains weak, says the ECB president. Not much cheer in today\u2019s statement! Draghi also gives politicians a nudge, saying that insufficient reform progress is another downward risk. The ECB appears to have changed its language on inflation expectations.... Recent data confirms that the growth momentum is weakening, says Draghi. On economic conditions, Draghi warns that risks remain to the downside. Inflation is subdued (it hit a five-year low of just 0.3% last month), and unemployment is still too high (at 11.5% in August) Mario Draghi says the ECB governing council unanimous on the use of additional unconventional measures if necessary -- a signal that a full-blown sovereign bond-buying QE programme is still possible. Important -- we are getting details of the ECB\u2019s new QE-style stimulus programme (which was agreed in principle last month) The covered bond operation will start in October, Draghi says. The ABS will begin in the fourth quarter of this year. And these programmes will run for two years, and substantially increase the ECB\u2019s balance sheet. These programmes will support our monetary policy transmission, support the broader econony, and have \u2018positive spillovers\u2019 to other markets, he adds. And they will help get inflation back to our long-term target, Draghi says. Mario Draghi begins reading his statement -- confirming that the ECB left interest rates unchanged. The ECB has also agreed on the key operational details of its new asset purchase programme, and covered bonds (announced last month). The ECB press conference is underway, after that slight delay.... (livefeed here) Mario Draghi\u2019s late! Another photo from Naples -- an anti-austerity protester dressed as Saint Gennaro (Januarius, Naples\u2019 saint patron) taking part in a demonstration on the sidelines of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank meeting. OK, it\u2019s nearly time for the European Central Bank\u2019s press conference from Naples. Mario Draghi is expected to outline the asset purchase scheme announced (despite German opposition) last month. The press conference will be streamed on the ECB\u2019s web site (right-click to open in new tab). I\u2019ll try to cover the key points, and instant reaction, here. Reuters reports that the Italian police say there were around 600 protests on the streets of Naples, fewer than the demonstrators estimated earlier (scroll back to 12.11pm BST for our report): Demonstrators face off riot police in Naples as ECB meets Hundreds of protesters faced off riot police on Thursday outside the Capodimonte palace in the southern Italian city of Naples where the European Central Bank is holding one of its regular rate-setting meetings. Television pictures showed police in riot gear barring the protesters from the grounds of the 18th century former royal palace, where ECB President Mario Draghi will hold a news conference after the meeting. Demonstrators chanted slogans and marched behind a banner reading \u201cJob insecurity, poverty, unemployment, speculation. Free us from the ECB!\u201d and speakers attacked spending cuts, job losses and austerity policies they said were imposed by Brussels. Helicopters flew above the crowd which police officials estimated at around 600. There were some scuffles and masked demonstrators threw firecrackers and smokebombs while police responded with teargas and a water cannon. Italy, in its third recession in six years, is going through a slump which the government says has now led to an economic contraction deeper than the Great Depression of 1929 with the south of Italy particularly severely affected. The ECB has cut its main interest rate close to zero and is planning a major asset-buying programme to stimulate lending to the euro zone economy. Draghi has also called on governments to do their part to boost confidence by making their economies more productive and competitive Two or three years ago, the anti-austerity protests that are gripping Naples today were a regular feature of the eurozone landscape. They\u2019ve been pretty rare in 2014, as the euro crisis eased. But while the single currency looks more secure, Europe\u2019s economy remains in a bad way, with unemployment near a record high and little growth. Italy, for example, is back in recession. These protest in Naples are a reminder to politicians and central bankers that Europe\u2019s problems, and public anger over the events of the last few years, haven\u2019t abated. Here\u2019s a snap of the ECB governing council meeting in Naples, where they voted to leave rates unchanged: Away from the protests, the ECB\u2019s governing council has voted to leave interest rates unchanged. That\u2019s not a surprise at all. This means the headline cost of borrowing remains at a record low of just 0.05%, while banks are charged -0.2% to leave money at the ECB. Next up, Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference in just under 45 minutes... Today\u2019s demonstrators are using the #blockbce hashtag to co-ordinate on Twitter This man carried a placard declaring: \u2018#Block BCE (ECB) We\u2019ll be inflexible\u2019, at today\u2019s protests in Naples. And here\u2019s a demonstrator wearing a mask during todays\u2019 protest against the ECB. Here\u2019s another photo from Naples, of an Italian policeman with a camera on his uniform at today\u2019s protests: The demonstrators in Naples were ready for Mario Draghi and the governing council, as this poster shows: There\u2019s a live video-feed showing the protests in Naples here (right-click to open in new tab) Over in Naples, thousands of demonstrators are marching as the European Central Bank holds its monthly monetary policy meeting. From Italy, my colleague Lizzy Davies reports: Mario Draghi may not quite catch the cries from inside the splendid confines of Naples\u2019s Capodimonte museum, but the anti-austerity protesters massing today in Italy\u2019s third-biggest city will do their best to make their voices heard nonetheless. The protesters in Naples have declared that a total of 4,000 people are marching, according to news agency Ansa. And there are photos of tear gas being used: Ansa quotes them as saying at the rally: \u201cToday all Italians should stage a protest as the start of a season of struggle. All Europeans must say: basta[enough].\u201d They reportedly urged the protesters to \u201cunite and take back our dignity.\u201d Some of them carrying a banner reading \u201cprecariousness poverty unemployment [property] speculation. Let\u2019s free ourselves from the ECB\u201d. Other banners carried messages ranging from \u201cMore houses for everyone, but bankers in the cellar\u201d and \u201cNo ECB, no austerity\u201d to \u201cBlock the ECB because we decide our governments\u2019 spending\u201d. One protest leader has rejected the idea today\u2019s demonstration could turn violent. The man, identified only as \u201cMauro from the 081 Collective\u201d told the Italian news agency Ansa that: \u201cA huge climate of fear has been built up around this protest. We\u2019ve been obliged in recent days to explain that it is the young people of this city who are protesting, young people who want to have a future.\u201d But as ever the composition of the rally was mixed, from students and the jobless to mothers and \u201cordinary citizens\u201d, reported Ansa, who are there to highlight their economic woes. (Let\u2019s remember that Italy found out this week that youth unemployment hit a fresh high of in 44.2% in August, even if the overall joblessness rate decreased slightly to 12.3%.) While Wonga was dominating our attention, the Bank of England was revealing that it wants more controls to help steer the UK\u2019s housing market. Its Financial Policy Committee has asked chancellor George Osborne for the legal power to cap the value of loans to homeowners related to the value of a property, and borrowers\u2019 income. The FPC also concluded, in its latest report, that housing does not represent a \u201cmaterial risk\u201d to financial stability in the UK. Full story: Bank of England asks for powers to intervene in housing market MPs have called for Wonga to be hauled before parliament for questioning, after the Financial Services Authority forced the payday lender to make major changes to its service and stop lending money to people who can\u2019t afford to pay it back. Around 330,000 Wonga customers who are at least 30 days in arrears are having their loans wiped off; a total of \u00a3220m of outstanding borrowing. Another 45,000 who are less than a month in arrears will not have to pay any more interest. Full coverage starts here. John Mann MP has told the Guardian that Wonga should be recalled to parliament to explain how so much money was loaned to so many people. And the Labour Party is also pushing for a levy on the payday industry to fund credit unions. The FCA declared that Wonga was not taking adequate steps to assess whether customers could repay their loans. Clive Adamson, the FCA\u2019s director of supervision, said: \u201cWe are determined to drive up standards in the consumer credit market and it is disappointing that some firms still have a way to go to meet our expectations. This should put the rest of the industry on notice \u2013 they need to lend affordably and responsibly.\u201d Here\u2019s the FCA\u2019s statement. Wonga has agreed to \u201cstrengthen\u201d its lending criteria, and make serious. Here\u2019s Wonga\u2019s full statement. Wonga\u2019s chairman, Andy Haste, has admitted there is \u201creal and urgent\u201d need for change at the company: There is much to do in order to make Wonga a sustainable and accepted business, and today\u2019s announcement is a significant step forward in that process.\u201d A majority of readers in our poll think Wonga is doing the right thing. Consumer group uSwitch has warned that the shake-up will not fix the need for short-term lending from people who can\u2019t borrow from the banks. And expert Carl Packman points out that Wonga\u2019s much-vaunted algorithms failed to prevent poor lending. Full reaction starts here. Cathy Jamieson MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has welcomed the FCA\u2019s move to \u201cdrive up standards\u201d in the payday loans industry. But she also argues that payday lenders should be hit with a levy, with the proceeds used to fund credit unions: \u201cIt is right that Wonga, in agreement with the FCA, has taken action to help customers affected and strengthened their lending and affordability criteria. \u201cWe believe that more should be done. A Labour Government will extend the levy on the profits of payday lenders and use the additional money to double the level of Government funding for credit unions.\u201d MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills committee did quiz Wonga last November, as part of an inquiry into the payday loan sector. Wonga defended itself robustly at the time. Chief operating officer, Niall Wass, declared in an interview that: \u201cI am not sitting here today saying that everything we do is perfect; what we are trying to do is use great technology to give a really fair, transparent service to customers.\u201d John Mann MP, another member of the Treasury Committee, has declared that Wonga should be recalled to parliament to explain what went so badly wrong. Speaking to my colleague Rupert Neate, Mann said Wonga has used \u201cunderhand tactics\u201d to lend to these 330,000 people whose debts are now being wiped away. Mann also suggested that action should be taken against Wonga\u2019s founder and former CEO, Errol Damelin. Carl Packman, who has written two books on the payday lending industry, points out that Wonga\u2019s much-vaunted software failed to live up to its claims. He says: \u201cWonga has always been able to hide behind the excuse that it is an innovative tech company before its a payday lender, but they are admitting today that their \u201calgorithm\u201d hasn\u2019t stopped the company from lending to those people who are least able to afford high cost credit. \u201cThe problem with payday lenders is that for so long they have been motivated to lend money without carrying out affordability assessments because this is what draws a profit. Not carrying out credit checks saves the firms money and if borrowers are struggling to pay off their loans then lenders can cash in on rollover options. \u201cI\u2019m glad the FCA are working with Wonga to improve their affordability assessments. We now have to work on improving the ethical alternatives such as credit unions and community banks who will outcompete the payday lending industry out of business.\u201d David Mann, head of Money at uSwitch.com, says Wonga\u2019s new affordability rules are \u201ca great victory for consumers\u201d, but they don\u2019t fix the wider issue of why customers were put in this vulnerable position in the first place. \u201cThe new affordability criteria put in place by Wonga goes some way to address these questions as payday lenders need to have the same controls in place as banks and building societies before issuing credit. \u201cToday\u2019s news doesn\u2019t solve the escalating need for short term loans. Those most in need of money, often with poor credit ratings, have been turned away from the banks and left to feel they have no other option. There is a bigger question that needs to be asked around the growing need for short term credit.\u201d Labour MP Pat McFadden has told the BBC that Wonga could be called to the Treasury Committee (he\u2019s a member) to explain today\u2019s changes. Is Wonga doing the right thing, or is it rewarding people for reckless borrowing? Vote here: Poll: is Wonga right to let people off their loans? It would be a mistake to think that Wonga are doing this out of the goodness of their heart. It\u2019s clear that these loans aren\u2019t compatible with the new lending criteria agreed with the FCA, and therefore shouldn\u2019t have been made in the first place. Wonga\u2019s own statement declares that this new lending criteria meant it will accept \u201csignificantly fewer loan applications\u201d, and that some existing customers would no longer be able to use the service. Wonga sources are briefing that the actual cost of writing off all these loans is \u00a335m. That\u2019s almost double the \u00a318.8m wiped out in \u201cremediation costs\u201d after it sent fake lawyers\u2019 letters to customers in arrears. And it\u2019s nearly as large as the \u00a339m of pre-tax profits it reported on Tuesday. The total value of the debt being written off is \u00a3220m, or around \u00a3667 for each of the 330,000 Wonga customers whose debts are being written off. Of course, we don\u2019t know how much they initially borrowed.... Here\u2019s the full statement from the Financial Conduct Authority, outlining how Wonga has now entered a voluntary requirement (VREQ). When it took over regulation of consumer credit in April of this year, the FCA requested information about the volume of Wonga\u2019s relending rates. The information received suggested that Wonga was not taking adequate steps to assess customers\u2019 ability to meet repayments in a sustainable manner. Thus the decision to write off 330,000 customers\u2019 debts, and wipe away the interest on another 45,000 loans. Another staggering fact is that there are a third of a million people in the UK who have taken out loans with Wonga that they simply cannot pay back. No wonder the FCA is taking action.... The BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed reports that Wonga is writing off \u00a3220m of debt (which it now admits it shouldn\u2019t have loaned in the first place). Wonga\u2019s shock decision to write off the debts of 330,00 customers is part of a deal with the Financial Conduct Authority, designed to clean up the payday lending industry. Clive Adamson, director of supervision, has declared: \u201cWe are determined to drive up standards in the consumer credit market and it is disappointing that some firms still have a way to go to meet our expectations. This should put the rest of the industry on notice \u2013 they need to lend affordably and responsibly. \u201cIt is absolutely right that Wonga\u2019s new management team has acted quickly to put things right for their customers after these issues were raised by the FCA.\u201d Big news breaking in the UK. Wonga, the payday lender, has just announced that it is writing off all outstanding debt on 330,000 customers who are at least 30 days late in their repayments. And a further 45,000 customers who are in arrears of up to 29 days will be asked to repay their debt without interest and charges. They\u2019ll also be allowed to repay their debt over an extended period of four months. The move is part of a major customer forbearance programme, which will also see the company tighten up its lending practices. It appears to have been forced by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator. The 375,000 people whose debts, or interest, are being written off not qualify for a loan under Wonga\u2019s new rules. That\u2019s effectively an admission that the company has been lending money to people who weren\u2019t in a position to pay it back -- something campaigners have been warning about for months. Wonga\u2019s new chairman, Andy Haste, admitted that Wonga\u2019s lending practices simply weren\u2019t good enough. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that the need for change at Wonga is real and urgent. Our regulator is determined to improve standards in consumer credit and I share that determination. There is much to do in order to make Wonga a sustainable and accepted business, and today\u2019s announcement is a significant step forward in that process. Here\u2019s the statement: Wonga announces major customer forbearance programme and strengthens affordability checks to ensure sustainable lending Mario Draghi set the scene for today\u2019s ECB meeting in Naples last night, by declaring that the central bank faces a \u2018Herculean task\u2019. The ECB president told a dinner that reviving growth and fighting unemployment was like fighting the many-headed Hydra. Draghi declared (via the WSJ): \u201cAs policymakers in Italy and in the euro area, it often feels like we face a Herculean task to revive growth and bring down unemployment. \u201cAnd just like Hercules confronting the Hydra, it sometimes seems as though just as we defeat one challenge, such as the sovereign debt crisis, two new challenges spring up, such as low inflation and a weak recovery.\u201d Hercules\u2019s various Labours took 12 years; the ECB\u2019s challenge is to avoid Europe\u2019s lowflation-lowgrowth malaise lasting as long. Draghi also told last night\u2019s dinner that monetary policy alone cannot fix the eurozone\u2019s problems. Governments must do more to boost investment, he said: Monetary policy can play a role here by lowering the cost of capital. But investment also depends on certainty over public finances. And lower interest rates will not encourage firms to borrow to invest if their returns are reduced by rising taxes, or eaten away by hidden costs linked to unnecessary regulations. Thus, fiscal and structural policies must also do their part. Over in Brussels, former French finance minister Pierre Moscovici is being grilled by the European Parliament over his appointment as a new economy commissioner. Moscovici is promising that he will apply the EU\u2019s budget rules to his home country -- which yesterday declared that it would not hit its deficit target until 2017, two years late. MEPs are also giving Moscovici a rough ride. Europe\u2019s stock markets have begun where they left off yesterday, with losses across the board. It\u2019s a fairly subdued selloff, with the FTSE 100 dropping another 26 points or 0.4% to 6529, having hit a five-month low last night. Those geopolitical and economic fears (see opening post) also knocked another 0.5% off Germany\u2019s DAX in early trading. Here\u2019s the situation: And here\u2019s a flavour of the mood on the trading floors: A quick-round up of the other early morning news. Pizza supplier Domino\u2019s has reported strong sales again, with underlying turnover in the last 13 weeks jumping by 12.9%. Its mobile app, and a new website, are luring customers in. However, Germany remains a problem -- sales are down 9.9%. Investors are pleased - shares have jumped 2% in early trading. Tui Travel has reassured the City that it\u2019s on track to hit its profit targets, with average prices for summer holidays in 2015 up on last summer. Most of its holidays have now been sold, with strong demand in the UK and Germany. However, TUI is also booking a \u00a327m provision against loans made to its \u201cjoint venture entity\u201d in the Russia-Ukraine region. Shares are up 0.5% this morning. Fashion brand Ted Baker has reported a 24% jump in pre-tax profits, with its e-commerce sales leaping 48.9%. Shares are down 0.6%. It\u2019s been a good morning for staff at Virgin Money, one of the UK\u2019s new \u2018challenger\u2019 retail banks. Virgin Money announced that it plans to raise \u00a3150m by floating on the stock market. And each employee will receive \u00a31000 of free shares too. Virgin Money bulked itself up by buying Northern Rock\u2019s \u2018good\u2019 assets after the financial crisis. The plan to float means the UK taxpayer will receive \u00a350m, taking the total paid by Virgin to \u00a31.02bn. The float comes seven years after Northern Rock was driven to near collapse by the credit crunch. Sir David Clementi, chairman of Virgin Money, says: \u201cI am pleased we have reached the point where Virgin Money is ready to start life as a listed company. We have built a safe, sound and secure bank supported by a strong Board. The Company has an extremely positive future and I am delighted the business is in such a good position.\u201d Back in 2011, we calculated that the taxpayer had made a loss of around \u00a3400m on the Northern Rock rescue (having injected around \u00a31.4bn when the crisis erupted). But it\u2019s a complicated issue -- while Virgin got the \u2018good\u2019 assets, the rest of Northern Rock was packaged up with mortgages from Bradford &amp; Bingley, which was also stricken by the credit crunch. That bad bank, supported by \u00a328bn of government loans, will wind down those assets over decades as people pay off their mortgages. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. There\u2019s a real sense of nervousness in the financial markets today, after a heavy selloff on Wall Street last night. With the FTSE 100 having hit a six-month low yesterday, investors are wondering if the market may, finally, be running out of steam. Geopolitical risks, disappointing economic data, and the looming end of America\u2019s huge bond-buying programme appear to be weighing on the markets. Asian stock markets have followed Wall Street\u2019s lead, and dropped overnight. And we\u2019re expecting Europe\u2019s main stock markets to dip a little further this morning. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: Europe gets set for lower open this morning after a sharp sell-off on Wall Street overnight exacerbated fears that we could be about to embark on the long feared global equity market sell-off, after a five year bull market rally. With the Federal Reserve set to end its QE program this month and economic data deteriorating globally, particularly in Europe the concern is whatever the ECB [European Central Bank] does won\u2019t be anywhere near enough to fill the gap left by the US central bank, against an uncertain geopolitical back drop and a slowing world economy. The ECB is the main show in town today, as it meets for its monthly policy meeting. And for a change, the governing council is meeting in Naples. It is expected to announce the details of its new QE-style asset asset purchase scheme, its new weapon to fight deflation. And with the inflation rate hitting just 0.3% last month, Mario Draghi and colleagues should be feeling the pressure..... The ECB\u2019s press conference is at 1.30pm BST. Also coming up today... The Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee is publishing a statement at 9.30am. Data firm Markit will release its report on how the UK\u2019s construction sector fared in September, also at 9.30am. And the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde, is giving a speech this afternoon, at 4pm BST. And we\u2019ll also be watching Greece, after the prime minister announced a confidence vote will be held next week to allay (he hopes!) fears of an early election While in the City, Virgin Money has confirmed plans to float on the stock market. More on that shortly....",

The loyalty scheme would help reassure shoppers so they did not feel the need to spend time visiting several stores to get the best deal, he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are neutralising price so the rest of our offer can really shine through,\u201d he said. \u201cThe discounters have been growing strongly but they only have one thing \u2013 price. We are saying we can guarantee price, but you also get 10 times the range, big brands and our butchers, bakers and cheesemongers.\u201d</p> <p>He refused to reveal exactly how much Morrisons expect the scheme to cost, but said it would be within the existing \u00a3300m budget that the retailer has set itself to invest in its prices and product offer during its current financial year.</p> <p>It has so far spent \u00a3135m on cutting more than 1,200 prices and upgrading the quality of some own-label products.</p> <p>All the major supermarkets except Asda have seen sales and profits slide as cash-strapped shoppers hunt around for bargains. Sainsbury\u2019s recently stopped matching its prices against Tesco and now only matches against Asda. However, neither Tesco nor Asda compare prices with the discounters.</p> <p>The new Morrisons\u2019 Match &amp; More scheme will launch in 11 stores on Friday morning and will be rolled out across the entire chain by Christmas. For participants who spend a minimum of \u00a315, it offers 10 points for every 1p where Morrisons is more expensive than its rivals. Points can also be collected by buying specific items and fuel. The scheme wil not, however, include the company\u2019s M Local convenience stores, where prices are higher.</p> <p>Shoppers who amass 5,000 points will receive a \u00a35 voucher which will be valid for up to a year.</p> <p>Morrisons said it had been testing the concept in a number of stores since April and it was based on technology it had been installing over the last two years. Prices will be checked via the independent company Profitero, which will use online research and visit discounters\u2019 stores around the country twice a week to collect data.</p> <p>Philips said the scheme would result in the vast majority of the items Morrisons stocked being compared against rivals. He said discounters\u2019 own-label ranges would be set against the Bradford-based chain\u2019s main own-label rather than its M Savers value range, in a bid to compare like with like. Packs of goods that are up to 20% bigger or smaller will also be scooped into the comparison.</p> <p>Clive Black at Shore Capital said: \u201cMorrisons has turned up the heat on the discounters another notch. The free lunch that the limited assortment discounters, Aldi and Lidl, have had in recent years in the UK is coming to an end in our view as imploding superstore groups finally react.\u201d</p> <p>However, Black said Morrisons\u2019 price-matching scheme seemed too complex and the loyalty scheme was already looking outdated. Black pointed out that Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco\u2019s loyalty cards were not helping them fight off competitors.</p>",

We are saying we can guarantee price, but you also get 10 times the range, big brands and our butchers, bakers and cheesemongers.\u201d He refused to reveal exactly how much Morrisons expect the scheme to cost, but said it would be within the existing \u00a3300m budget that the retailer has set itself to invest in its prices and product offer during its current financial year. It has so far spent \u00a3135m on cutting more than 1,200 prices and upgrading the quality of some own-label products. All the major supermarkets except Asda have seen sales and profits slide as cash-strapped shoppers hunt around for bargains. Sainsbury\u2019s recently stopped matching its prices against Tesco and now only matches against Asda. However, neither Tesco nor Asda compare prices with the discounters. The new Morrisons\u2019 Match &amp; More scheme will launch in 11 stores on Friday morning and will be rolled out across the entire chain by Christmas. For participants who spend a minimum of \u00a315, it offers 10 points for every 1p where Morrisons is more expensive than its rivals. Points can also be collected by buying specific items and fuel. The scheme wil not, however, include the company\u2019s M Local convenience stores, where prices are higher. Shoppers who amass 5,000 points will receive a \u00a35 voucher which will be valid for up to a year. Morrisons said it had been testing the concept in a number of stores since April and it was based on technology it had been installing over the last two years. Prices will be checked via the independent company Profitero, which will use online research and visit discounters\u2019 stores around the country twice a week to collect data. Philips said the scheme would result in the vast majority of the items Morrisons stocked being compared against rivals. He said discounters\u2019 own-label ranges would be set against the Bradford-based chain\u2019s main own-label rather than its M Savers value range, in a bid to compare like with like. Packs of goods that are up to 20% bigger or smaller will also be scooped into the comparison. Clive Black at Shore Capital said: \u201cMorrisons has turned up the heat on the discounters another notch. The free lunch that the limited assortment discounters, Aldi and Lidl, have had in recent years in the UK is coming to an end in our view as imploding superstore groups finally react.\u201d However, Black said Morrisons\u2019 price-matching scheme seemed too complex and the loyalty scheme was already looking outdated. Black pointed out that Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco\u2019s loyalty cards were not helping them fight off competitors.",

Next, however, sent a chill through fashion retailers on Tuesday when it announced that sales of its winter clothes had been lower than expected last month. The Ted Baker chairman, David Bernstein, said: \u201cThe second half has started well for the group, with a good performance from our autumn/winter collections, despite unusually warm weather in September.\u201d He made his upbeat trading statement as the company reported that pretax profits and exceptional items rose 24% to \u00a314.4m in the six months to 9 August. The strongest retail sales growth, which includes online sales, was in the UK and across Europe, where revenues rose 15% to \u00a3105.4m. Group online sales increased 49% to \u00a314m. Ted Baker led UK clothes retailers out of the doldrums in June as fashion chains enjoyed their first full quarter of growth for four years. Since then, the sector has resorted to discounts to attract shoppers amid unusually warm and dry weather.

While our results for the full year will be dependent on the more weighted second half, we continue to look forward with confidence as we further develop Ted Baker as a leading global lifestyle brand.\u201d Retail profits increased by 14% in North America and by 16% in Asia; wholesale revenues rose 27% to \u00a342.1m.",

It is taking its promise to champion consumer\u2019s interests to heart. Although there is nothing about the excessive interest rates charged in the FCA\u2019s statement. That is left to the press release from Wonga where Andy Haste says the firm is addressing the \u201ctotal cost of credit\u201d. <br>  Andy Haste also clearly warns that under the new lending criteria, many of Wonga\u2019s past customers will no longer be able to borrow from them. The hope is that these individuals learn to live within their means. But the fear is that they turn to loan sharks and other unregulated lenders where the terms can be a lot more harmful. In driving out the regulated players the FCA may make room for far worse.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cooper added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shouldn\u2019t we be educating Britons, especially the young at school to understand basic finance. Everyone complained about moral hazard in bailing out the banks. There is clearly moral hazard in telling people who have borrowed way too much that don\u2019t worry all your debts will disappear. <br>  And what about other Wonga customers who meet the new stricter lending criteria. They still have to pay capital and interest back in full. So if you exercised a little sense, cut back on spending and only borrowed a little, then you have to pay it all back. But if you went wild and took all the cash on offer from Wonga and spent it all, then don\u2019t worry, someone else picks up the cost. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Consumer organisations welcomed Wonga\u2019s move, but were cautious in their response. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd</strong> said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wonga\u2019s announcement is better late than never for struggling borrowers but it\u2019s clearly a result of the regulator taking a tougher approach. The FCA must keep payday lenders on a tight leash. <br><br>We have long called for more responsible affordability checks and better advice. The next step must be a clamp down on excessive fees and charges across the board to show lenders that the FCA will continue to clean up the credit market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity which runs National Debtline, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These moves are a welcome step in the right direction. Nevertheless we know that there will remain a large number of borrowers with payday loans who are struggling to cope with their debts, and it is essential that these customers are signposted to free debt advice.</p> </blockquote> <p>Consumer organisation uSwitch said Wonga\u2019s new affordability rules are \u201ca great victory for consumers\u201d. But<strong> David Mann, head of Money at uSwitch.com</strong>, added that they don\u2019t fix the wider issue of why customers were put in this vulnerable position in the first place.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe new affordability criteria put in place by Wonga goes some way to address these questions as payday lenders need to have the same controls in place as banks and building societies before issuing credit.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s news doesn\u2019t solve the escalating need for short term loans. Those most in need of money, often with poor credit ratings, have been turned away from the banks and left to feel they have no other option.

      "bodyText": "Here is a round-up of instant reaction to Wonga, the controversial payday lender which in a surprise move announced that it would write off the debts of 330,000 customers. Labour MPs John Mann and Pat McFadden, members of the Treasury Committee, want Wonga to be recalled to parliament to explain what happened. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, said: Many consumers are still being treated badly by financial firms\u2014new cases just keep coming. We will want reassurance that these firms have cleaned up their act, and Wonga may well be one of them. Mann also suggested action should be taken against Wonga\u2019s founder and former CEO, Errol Damelin. The Labour Party is pushing for a levy on the payday industry to fund credit unions. Independent City analyst Louise Cooper said: Today\u2019s announcement may be a sign that the FCA has a few more teeth than the old FSA. It is taking its promise to champion consumer\u2019s interests to heart. Although there is nothing about the excessive interest rates charged in the FCA\u2019s statement. That is left to the press release from Wonga where Andy Haste says the firm is addressing the \u201ctotal cost of credit\u201d. Andy Haste also clearly warns that under the new lending criteria, many of Wonga\u2019s past customers will no longer be able to borrow from them. The hope is that these individuals learn to live within their means. But the fear is that they turn to loan sharks and other unregulated lenders where the terms can be a lot more harmful. In driving out the regulated players the FCA may make room for far worse. Cooper added: Shouldn\u2019t we be educating Britons, especially the young at school to understand basic finance. Everyone complained about moral hazard in bailing out the banks. There is clearly moral hazard in telling people who have borrowed way too much that don\u2019t worry all your debts will disappear. And what about other Wonga customers who meet the new stricter lending criteria. They still have to pay capital and interest back in full. So if you exercised a little sense, cut back on spending and only borrowed a little, then you have to pay it all back. But if you went wild and took all the cash on offer from Wonga and spent it all, then don\u2019t worry, someone else picks up the cost. Consumer organisations welcomed Wonga\u2019s move, but were cautious in their response. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: Wonga\u2019s announcement is better late than never for struggling borrowers but it\u2019s clearly a result of the regulator taking a tougher approach. The FCA must keep payday lenders on a tight leash. We have long called for more responsible affordability checks and better advice. The next step must be a clamp down on excessive fees and charges across the board to show lenders that the FCA will continue to clean up the credit market. Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity which runs National Debtline, said: These moves are a welcome step in the right direction. Nevertheless we know that there will remain a large number of borrowers with payday loans who are struggling to cope with their debts, and it is essential that these customers are signposted to free debt advice. Consumer organisation uSwitch said Wonga\u2019s new affordability rules are \u201ca great victory for consumers\u201d. But David Mann, head of Money at uSwitch.com, added that they don\u2019t fix the wider issue of why customers were put in this vulnerable position in the first place. \u201cThe new affordability criteria put in place by Wonga goes some way to address these questions as payday lenders need to have the same controls in place as banks and building societies before issuing credit. \u201cToday\u2019s news doesn\u2019t solve the escalating need for short term loans. Those most in need of money, often with poor credit ratings, have been turned away from the banks and left to feel they have no other option. There is a bigger question that needs to be asked around the growing need for short term credit.\u201d And payday loans expert Carl Packman, who has written a book on the industry, noted that Wonga\u2019s much-vaunted algorithms failed to prevent poor lending. Wonga has always been able to hide behind the excuse that it is an innovative tech company before its a payday lender, but they are admitting today that their \u201calgorithm\u201d hasn\u2019t stopped the company from lending to those people who are least able to afford high cost credit. The problem with payday lenders is that for so long they have been motivated to lend money without carrying out affordability assessments because this is what draws a profit. Not carrying out credit checks saves the firms money and if borrowers are struggling to pay off their loans then lenders can cash in on rollover options. I\u2019m glad the FCA are working with Wonga to improve their affordability assessments. We now have to work on improving the ethical alternatives such as credit unions and community banks who will outcompete the payday lending industry out of business. Professor Andre Spicer of Cass Business School says Wonga\u2019s move may \u201cseem like business insanity, but there is method to the firm\u2019s madness\u201d. Following waves of negative publicity and unwanted attention from the regulator the firm has decided to rethink its business model. It is becoming clear payday lending premised on usurious interest rates is no longer either legitimate or particularly profitable. Instead of being a rogue, the firm wants to become responsible. Forgiving debts is one drastic way it can mark out this break. The move will not just generate positive publicity, but much of the debt was probably costly to recover. It would have been sold on to debt recovery companies at a huge discount. This means Wonga may not be missing out on much. Wonga\u2019s move today is akin to debt jubilees in ancient civilizations where on a particular day, rulers would free subjects of their debts. This had the effect of currying favour but also spurring economic activity. What remains to be seen is how much Wonga will actually change in the future. For instance, what information will be provided to customers, will their knowledge be checked and what rates of interest will be paid. What happens if new customers don\u2019t pay their debts in 30 days? Will debt forgiveness encourage moral hazard on the part of borrowers? Many of these issues are uncertain. But ethical payday lending may remain an oxymoron.

      "body": "<p>This week, in response to the opening of the eastern <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas\">liquefied natural gas</a> (LNG) market to exports, the <a href=\"http://www.reserveourgas.com.au/\">Australian Workers Union</a> (AWU) has launched a campaign for the government to reserve an amount of LNG for local producers and households. But while such a populist policy may have a marginal impact by lowering gas prices, it would do so by subsidising inefficient industries and reducing incentives for renewable energy.</p> <p>Back <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/21/why-increasing-coal-seam-gas-supply-will-result-in-higher-gas-prices\">in March</a>, I wrote how the opening of the eastern gas market to the world through the Gladstone port facility would increase gas prices for those living in the eastern states. So it was, with a bitter sort of validation, to receive <a href=\"http://www.actewagl.com.au/About-us/Media-centre-and-reports/2014/06/13/Changes-to-electricity-and-gas-prices.aspx\">a letter</a> from my gas supplier in June that \u201cfrom 1 July 2014, there will be a 14.5 per cent increase in ACT gas prices.\u201d The reason given was \u201cthe increasing influence of international markets on Australia\u2019s gas prices\u201d.</p> <p>To understand this impact we need to look at the current world market for gas. It is effectively divided into three sections \u2013 Europe, Asia and North America. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s market is Asia, although predominately Japan and South Korea, as neither produces natural gas but together account for 5.1% of the world\u2019s consumption. </p> <p>Also, as with everything in Australia\u2019s economy, China is important. Its consumption of natural gas has exploded in the past decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/0bGuu/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Japanese consumption has increased markedly in the past three years due to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster\">Fukishima</a> nuclear power station disaster causing the country to switch its reliance on electricity generation from nuclear to gas. </p> <p>Australia is currently the second biggest supplier of LNG to China and the biggest to Japan:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/qpbx5/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"600\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The increase in Japanese natural gas consumption caused the price of natural gas in the Japanese market to rise significantly above that of Europe and well above the US:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/uRyiK/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the past this had no impact on eastern states consumers of gas, but this year shipping of LNG from Gladstone in Queensland to Japan is set to begin. </p> <p>It means that not only will Australian gas production more than double by 2020 from 43 bcm to 102bcm, but that producers can now sell LNG for higher prices in Japan than they have previously received from domestic consumers. </p> <p>The price for LNG in Japan is around US$15 per gigajoule (GJ) \u2013 that includes shipping and converting gas into LNG and back again, which comes to around US$5-US$6 per GJ. Thus the equivalent price in Australia would be around $9 per GJ\u2013 well above the current price of around $4 per GJ. </p> <p>And thus householders are receiving letters like I did informing them of big price increases. </p> <p>Over the past couple years, manufacturing employer groups and the AWU have made noises about the need for the government to protect Australian businesses and households from rising gas prices. </p> <p>This week the AWU launched its \u201c<a href=\"http://www.awu.net.au/news/reserve-our-gas\">Reserve our Gas</a>\u201d campaign, which argues that a certain percentage of LNG production should be set aside for domestic use. Such a policy is already in place in Western Australia, where 15% of output from LNG projects within the state must be reserved for sale in the domestic gas market.</p> <p>The campaign coincides with the <a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/research/commission/gas-markets\">Productivity Commission</a> commencing a research project into the gas markets that will \u201cinvestigate the implications of linking to global markets for various gas market participants\u201d.</p> <p>The case for a reserve is based on the view that other countries have similar policies and thus Australia should too. Advocates compare us to Canada and the US, although really they\u2019re poor comparisons. </p> <p>Canada exports its gas via pipeline to the US rather than ship to the more expensive Asian market. And while the US does currently have export restriction, these are likely to be reduced with the US looking to increase its exports of LNG over the coming decade. If this occurs, its much lower gas prices will likely rise as well, though given the size of the US domestic market, it is likely to be more muted than will happen in Australia. </p> <p>The other justification for a reserve policy is that WA already has one, so it could just be extended to the rest of Australia. </p> <p>But while gas prices in WA for a time rose at similar or lower rates than in the eastern states, since the boom in LNG prices after the GFC, WA\u2019s gas price increases have outstripped that of the eastern states. </p> <p>Indeed, WA gas prices are currently higher than those in the eastern states and are forecast to be higher still in 2020, suggesting that the reserve policy has only a limited affect on limiting gas price rises. </p> <p>The Grattan Institute\u2019s <a href=\"http://grattan.edu.au/report/getting-gas-right-australias-energy-challenge/\">Getting Gas Right</a> paper argues that reserving gas for domestic production subsidises domestic manufacturers and households in much the same way as tariffs once protected Australian industries. But, it argues, such protectionism only serves to breed inefficient industries and reduce our competiveness. </p> <p>The reserve policy also has environmental implications. </p> <p>While gas generated electricity produces fewer emissions than black or brown coal, long-term cheaper gas would serve to make renewable energy supply from sources such as wind less competitive. Keeping gas prices low encourages a switch from coal to gas generated electricity, whereas if gas prices were to rise in line with the international market, renewable energy becomes a more attractive alternative. </p> <p>Given <a href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/renewables-now-cheaper-than-coal-and-gas-in-australia-62268\">there is evidence</a> that building new wind farms is already more cost effective than building new gas or coal fired power generators, a reserve policy would in effect subsidise fossil fuel energy at a time when renewable energy technology is driving lower costs. </p> <p>It is perhaps not a surprise that a gas reserve policy would have a negative impact on the renewable energy industry given that the <a href=\"http://www.awu.net.au/news/awu-calls-aluminium-industry-exemption-ret\">AWU has also campaigned</a> for the aluminium industry be made exempt under the Renewable Energy Target. </p> <p>Instead of imposing a reserve on gas production, it would be far better for the government to instead put in place better tax arrangements to capture revenue from this boom in production. <a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Petroleum-resource-rent-tax/\">In 2012, the Petroleum Resources Rent Tax</a> was amended to include coal seam gas and yet due to the design of the tax, most companies expect to pay little <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/new-tax-wont-hit-us-say-gas-and-oil-giants/story-fn59niix-1226457776822\">extra tax</a>. A reserve policy only provides benefits to households, whereas governments could use the tax revenue for wider community benefit.</p> <p>Australians are going to be paying more for gas in the future whether we like it or not. But establishing a gas reserve policy would do little to alter this fact. Even if it keeps gas prices low, it would do so only through the heavy long-term cost of subsidising inefficient industries and supporting fossil-fuels over renewable energy. </p>",

Its consumption of natural gas has exploded in the past decade: Japanese consumption has increased markedly in the past three years due to the Fukishima nuclear power station disaster causing the country to switch its reliance on electricity generation from nuclear to gas. Australia is currently the second biggest supplier of LNG to China and the biggest to Japan: The increase in Japanese natural gas consumption caused the price of natural gas in the Japanese market to rise significantly above that of Europe and well above the US: In the past this had no impact on eastern states consumers of gas, but this year shipping of LNG from Gladstone in Queensland to Japan is set to begin. It means that not only will Australian gas production more than double by 2020 from 43 bcm to 102bcm, but that producers can now sell LNG for higher prices in Japan than they have previously received from domestic consumers. The price for LNG in Japan is around US$15 per gigajoule (GJ) \u2013 that includes shipping and converting gas into LNG and back again, which comes to around US$5-US$6 per GJ. Thus the equivalent price in Australia would be around $9 per GJ\u2013 well above the current price of around $4 per GJ. And thus householders are receiving letters like I did informing them of big price increases. Over the past couple years, manufacturing employer groups and the AWU have made noises about the need for the government to protect Australian businesses and households from rising gas prices. This week the AWU launched its \u201cReserve our Gas\u201d campaign, which argues that a certain percentage of LNG production should be set aside for domestic use. Such a policy is already in place in Western Australia, where 15% of output from LNG projects within the state must be reserved for sale in the domestic gas market. The campaign coincides with the Productivity Commission commencing a research project into the gas markets that will \u201cinvestigate the implications of linking to global markets for various gas market participants\u201d. The case for a reserve is based on the view that other countries have similar policies and thus Australia should too. Advocates compare us to Canada and the US, although really they\u2019re poor comparisons. Canada exports its gas via pipeline to the US rather than ship to the more expensive Asian market. And while the US does currently have export restriction, these are likely to be reduced with the US looking to increase its exports of LNG over the coming decade. If this occurs, its much lower gas prices will likely rise as well, though given the size of the US domestic market, it is likely to be more muted than will happen in Australia. The other justification for a reserve policy is that WA already has one, so it could just be extended to the rest of Australia. But while gas prices in WA for a time rose at similar or lower rates than in the eastern states, since the boom in LNG prices after the GFC, WA\u2019s gas price increases have outstripped that of the eastern states. Indeed, WA gas prices are currently higher than those in the eastern states and are forecast to be higher still in 2020, suggesting that the reserve policy has only a limited affect on limiting gas price rises. The Grattan Institute\u2019s Getting Gas Right paper argues that reserving gas for domestic production subsidises domestic manufacturers and households in much the same way as tariffs once protected Australian industries. But, it argues, such protectionism only serves to breed inefficient industries and reduce our competiveness. The reserve policy also has environmental implications. While gas generated electricity produces fewer emissions than black or brown coal, long-term cheaper gas would serve to make renewable energy supply from sources such as wind less competitive. Keeping gas prices low encourages a switch from coal to gas generated electricity, whereas if gas prices were to rise in line with the international market, renewable energy becomes a more attractive alternative. Given there is evidence that building new wind farms is already more cost effective than building new gas or coal fired power generators, a reserve policy would in effect subsidise fossil fuel energy at a time when renewable energy technology is driving lower costs. It is perhaps not a surprise that a gas reserve policy would have a negative impact on the renewable energy industry given that the AWU has also campaigned for the aluminium industry be made exempt under the Renewable Energy Target. Instead of imposing a reserve on gas production, it would be far better for the government to instead put in place better tax arrangements to capture revenue from this boom in production. In 2012, the Petroleum Resources Rent Tax was amended to include coal seam gas and yet due to the design of the tax, most companies expect to pay little extra tax. A reserve policy only provides benefits to households, whereas governments could use the tax revenue for wider community benefit. Australians are going to be paying more for gas in the future whether we like it or not. But establishing a gas reserve policy would do little to alter this fact. Even if it keeps gas prices low, it would do so only through the heavy long-term cost of subsidising inefficient industries and supporting fossil-fuels over renewable energy.",
