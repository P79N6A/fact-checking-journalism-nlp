      "bodyText": "The status of Bond Street as the UK\u2019s most exclusive shopping destination is under threat, as one in four retailers on the famous street consider shutting up shop and moving out as a result of high rents and business rates. About 25 of the 100 top fashion brands with stores on Old and New Bond Street are understood to have flagged to the property market that they are ready to quit the world-famous fashion district. Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Hugo Boss, De Beers and DKNY are among the big brands understood to be considering their options. Bond Street is the most expensive place in Britain to run a store, with fashion brands paying top dollar to be located alongside the biggest names in luxury including Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior and Herm\u00e8s. Many shops have decided to leave despite the surge in well-heeled tourists shopping in the capital since the Brexit vote, which slashed the value of the pound and overnight made London cheaper for foreign tourists. Paul Souber, of property consultancy Colliers International, said a number of Bond Street leases were being \u201cquietly marketed\u201d. In a sign that demand for expensive stores in the West End of London is faltering, Souber said potential tenants are no longer required to stump up millions of pounds of \u201ckey money\u201d that had become standard \u2013 the premium a brand hands over to the existing retailer to buy their lease, in addition to the rent agreed. In 2014, Watches of Switzerland sold its Bond Street lease for \u00a310m. \u201cThose premiums are not achievable today,\u201d said Souber. \u201cLondon is still a phenomenally strong shopping environment, but the market has cooled. Retailers are looking at their stores and asking do we need to be on Bond Street or should we go somewhere else and get more bang for our buck? Last year Polo Ralph Lauren set a new retail rent record on New Bond Street after it agreed to pay a staggering annual rent of \u00a32,225 per sq ft for its store following a rent review. But a recent industry report by Walpole, which represents 200 British luxury brands, suggested the super-prime rental levels were becoming a problem. One prominent Bond Street occupier described the landlords as ruthless and only interested in the most profitable tenants. \u201cSome sites are now so costly that there is a debate over whether it is possible to make a profit on them,\u201d said the report. Souber said the recent business rate revaluation had been the final straw for some international brands, which are comparing the cost of operating a store on Bond Street with Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue in New York, or Canton Road in Hong Kong. According to business rates experts CVS, Bond Street was one of the biggest victims of the shake-up in business rates, with luxury retailers on Old and New Bond Street required to find an extra \u00a3160m over the next five years. The biggest loser from the changes was Louis Vuitton, which has seen its rates bill increase by \u00a310m. Both Dolce &amp; Gabbana and DKNY\u2019s bills have increased by more than \u00a33m. Business rates are calculated as a proportion of the rental value. The rental value is supposed to be measured every five years, but the previous revaluation was controversially delayed by the government in 2015 for two years, making the changes that came into effect in April more pronounced, particularly in central London, where property values have surged. Earlier this year David Fischel, the chief executive of Intu \u2013 which owns some of the UK\u2019s biggest shopping centres, including the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Metrocentre in Gateshead \u2013 told the Guardian that the \u201cextreme\u201d business rates climate was a bigger deterrent to international retailers opening shops here than the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. The makeup of the West End\u2019s key shopping district is also changing as brands choose larger, more economic stores on nearby Regent Street, which is enjoying a renaissance. Mount Street in Mayfair has also become a big draw thanks to a line-up that includes Marc Jacobs, Balenciaga and C\u00e9line. While the majority of Britons may not be able to afford to shop on Bond Street, where the designer handbags can cost far more than a monthly mortgage payment, the luxury market is worth more than \u00a332bn to the economy and employs more than 113,000 people. The devaluation of the pound has triggered a boom in sales for brands like Burberry, with around 25% of cash spent in the West End of London coming from the wallets of overseas visitors. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, a group that represents retailers in the area, admitted that \u201cCentral London costs are rising, particularly as a result of the recent business rates review, which hit Bond Street very hard.\u201d But he said a \u00a310m investment in the street is already under way, to improve its appearance, and insisted: \u201cBond Street remains the centre of London\u2019s luxury quarter.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Murdoch's Sky takeover bid: culture secretary's verdict due this week", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch is about to learn whether the government has cleared his latest bid to buy Sky or whether concerns about competition could yet derail the deal. The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, will this week deliver her verdict on whether to greenlight 21st Century Fox\u2019s proposed \u00a311.7bn takeover of the satellite broadcaster, or refer the deal to the competition authorities for further scrutiny. Bradley is deliberating on the findings of Ofcom\u2019s investigation into the deal, which include whether the deal will give Murdoch too much control of UK news and whether the media mogul is a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner. The media regulator is also considering whether Fox, which owns the rightwing Fox News channel, will adhere to existing standards of accuracy and impartiality once it takes full control of broadcasting assets including Sky News. Bradley has been weighing Ofcom\u2019s findings since last Tuesday and has promised to announce the decision she is \u201cminded to\u201d take by Thursday. The culture secretary will then give Fox and other parties an opportunity to have their say over her findings before making a final decision. She can decide to wave the deal through, discuss various options with Fox to address any issues raised by Ofcom, or refer the takeover to the Competition Markets Authority for a lengthy investigation. A number of analysts and observers believe that Ofcom\u2019s reports will have raised concerns and issues about the takeover. But they also expect that the Murdochs will probably be able to gain clearance for the deal, six years after withdrawing an earlier bid at the height of the phone-hacking scandal. When the proposed takeover was announced last December James Murdoch, the chief executive of Fox and chair of Sky, bullishly said the company would not have to make any \u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d to complete the takeover. However, since then the Murdochs have come under pressure as allegations of sexual harassment have blown up at Fox News in the US \u2013 which have so far claimed the jobs of the late chief executive Roger Ailes, co-president Bill Shine and top presenter Bill O\u2019Reilly. They also face the spectre of the phone-hacking scandal, as the Sun faces a new trial later this year. During its investigation after Murdoch\u2019s previous attempt to take over Sky, Ofcom found it remained a fit and proper owner of a broadcast licence. However, the regulator published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch, the then chief executive of his father\u2019s newspaper group and chair of Sky, finding that his conduct had repeatedly fallen short of the standards expected. The political fallout saw him stand down as chairman of Sky and decamp for the US to run Fox, the film and TV operation, and rehabilitate his tarnished corporate image. A number of observers believe that Ofcom\u2019s report will raise concerns about the issues facing the Murdoch empire, but because there is more distance between James Murdoch and those directly running facing Fox News and the Sun than last time round, ultimately they will pass the \u201cfit and proper\u201d test. In recent years the only business to have its licence revoked by Ofcom was adult TV company Bang Media, which runs channels including Tease Me, in 2010. Ofcom has also had a chance to air any \u201cfit and proper\u201d concerns about James Murdoch and investigate his role since January, when news broke that he would be returning as Sky chairman and, significantly, following the highly publicised revolt at Sky\u2019s annual meeting when more than 50% of independent shareholders voted against his reappointment. Fox currently owns a 39% stake in Sky, and is trying to buy the outstanding 61% of shares. Campaigning groups worry about a potential so-called \u201cFoxification\u201d of Sky News if Rupert Murdoch takes full control. In the past decade Fox has notched up 22 breaches of its licence and Ofcom\u2019s codes and rules. Of those, seven were against Fox News, with four last year including against a programme which featured a guest who said that Birmingham was a city \u201cwhere non-Muslims just simply don\u2019t go\u201d. Fox News was taken off air between 5am and 11pm on election day to avoid any issues with Ofcom. The company has never had a more serious sanction handed down by Ofcom, unlike UK broadcasters including ITV and the BBC which have both been fined for serious breaches. Fox also argues that since the aborted bid in 2010 News Corporation has split into two different companies. Its newspaper assets are in one, News Corp, while its TV and film assets are in the other, with independent boards. The company argues that this move neutralises media plurality concerns. During Rupert Murdoch\u2019s previous bid Jeremy Hunt, the then culture secretary, accepted an offer to spin-off Sky News to allay media plurality issues raised by Ofcom. Critics of the Murdochs argue that the family will still be the ultimate owner of assets including the Sun, Times and Wall Street Journal as well as Fox News and Sky News that will give them too much control over UK news media. Fox also argues that over the past seven years media plurality has exploded with the rise of digital rivals such as Google and Facebook and news distributors and new outlets such as Vice, Buzzfeed and Huffington Post while traditional newspaper sales decline. Critics say that plurality issues remain because of the media power Murdoch maintains. In February, it emerged that senior executives from Rupert Murdoch-owned companies met the prime minister or chancellor 10 times in a year \u2013 more than any other media organisation. And in September, Theresa May had a private meeting with Rupert Murdoch during a flying visit to New York. Ofcom\u2019s task to ensure plurality is defined as \u201cpreventing any one media owner, or voice, having too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda\u201d and \u201cpreventing too much influence over the political process being exercised by any one media owner\u201d. Many observers believe that Ofcom\u2019s media plurality report will raise concerns, and that Fox will have to offer up Sky News again. However, if Fox does so this time, the company is likely only to offer a legal separation of the business with a separate board and editorial independence guarantees \u2013 not a full-scale spinoff. Analysts say that Fox would point to Ofcom accepting BT\u2019s plan to legally separate its subsidiary Openreach to put it at arms\u2019 length as enough of a remedy to address competitors\u2019 concerns over control. \u201cIn terms of potential remedies, should the issues arise we continue to think Fox could revisit a spinoff of Sky News, as it did with the original bid for Sky in 2010-11,\u201d said Polo Tang, an analyst at UBS, in a recent note to investors. \u201cSeparately, James Murdoch could step down as chairman of Sky, but remain chief executive of Fox.\u201d The worst case scenario for Fox would be if Bradley says she believes there are plurality or broadcasting standards issues but refuses any remedy offered to push the deal through, instead calling in the Competition Markets Authority. The CMA would then have 24 weeks to launch an in-depth investigation that could trigger Fox having to pay a special dividend of about \u00a3172m for failing to get the deal done this year. If the deal were to fall through Fox has also guaranteed to pay a break fee of \u00a3200m. With a weakened Tory government failing to win a parliamentary majority there is also a view that Bradley may go for the safe option of calling in the CMA for full scrutiny. \u201cThe risk is that the DCMS refers the deal to the CMA as it could be politically expedient to do so,\u201d said Wilton Fry, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. The key questions Are the Murdochs \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners of a broadcasting licence for Sky? Ofcom is responsible for monitoring all broadcasters to make sure they remain \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a broadcasting licence in the UK. Critics argue that phone hacking and scandal at Fox News in the US means that they should fail the test and not be allowed to take full control of Sky. Would the deal give the Murdochs too much control of UK news media? The Murdochs say the Sun and Times are in a different, independent company, News Corp, to where Sky News would be run at Fox. They add that the rise of media outlets such as BuzzFeed and Huffington Post, against a backdrop of declining newspaper sales, means there is plenty of plurality. Critics argue that the Murdochs effectively still control both companies and that they maintain a huge media influence. If the Murdochs take full control of Sky and Sky News, will they adhere to existing standards of accuracy and impartiality? There is overlap here with the subject matter of the \u201cfit and proper\u201d test, except in this case it will be up to Bradley, not Ofcom, to decide what action to take on the outcome of the media regulator\u2019s report. In the past decade Fox News has notched up seven breaches of the Ofcom code, a low number with no serious breaches involving fines recorded.",

Its newspaper assets are in one, News Corp, while its TV and film assets are in the other, with independent boards. <br></p> <p>The company argues that this move neutralises media plurality concerns. During Rupert Murdoch\u2019s previous bid Jeremy Hunt, the then culture secretary, accepted an offer to spin-off Sky News to allay media plurality issues raised by Ofcom.<br></p> <p>Critics of the Murdochs argue that the family will still be the ultimate owner of assets including the Sun, Times and Wall Street Journal as well as Fox News and Sky News that will give them too much control over UK news media.<br></p> <p>Fox also argues that over the past seven years media plurality has exploded with the rise of digital rivals such as Google and Facebook and news distributors and new outlets such as Vice, Buzzfeed and Huffington Post while traditional newspaper sales decline.<br></p> <p>Critics say that plurality issues remain because of the media power Murdoch maintains. In February, it emerged that senior executives from Rupert Murdoch-owned companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/05/rupert-murdoch-access-to-downing-street-theresa-may-david-cameron\">met the prime minister or chancellor 10 times in a year</a> \u2013 more than any other media organisation. <br></p> <p>And in September, Theresa May had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/29/theresa-may-meeting-rupert-murdoch-times-sun\">private meeting with Rupert Murdoch during a flying visit to New York</a>.<br></p> <p>Ofcom\u2019s task to ensure plurality is defined as \u201cpreventing any one media owner, or voice, having too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda\u201d and \u201cpreventing too much influence over the political process being exercised by any one media owner\u201d. </p> <p>Many observers believe that Ofcom\u2019s media plurality report will raise concerns, and that Fox will have to offer up Sky News again. <br></p> <p>However, if Fox does so this time, the company is likely only to offer a legal separation of the business with a separate board and editorial independence guarantees \u2013 not a full-scale spinoff. Analysts say that Fox would point to Ofcom accepting BT\u2019s plan to legally separate its subsidiary Openreach to put it at arms\u2019 length as enough of a remedy to address competitors\u2019 concerns over control.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of potential remedies, should the issues arise we continue to think Fox could revisit a spinoff of Sky News, as it did with the original bid for Sky in 2010-11,\u201d said Polo Tang, an analyst at UBS, in a recent note to investors. \u201cSeparately, James Murdoch could step down as chairman of Sky, but remain chief executive of Fox.\u201d</p> <p>The worst case scenario for Fox would be if Bradley says she believes there are plurality or broadcasting standards issues but refuses any remedy offered to push the deal through, instead calling in the Competition Markets Authority. </p> <p>The CMA would then have 24 weeks to launch an in-depth investigation that could trigger Fox having to pay a special dividend of about \u00a3172m for failing to get the deal done this year. If the deal were to fall through Fox has also guaranteed to pay a break fee of \u00a3200m.</p> <p>With a weakened Tory government failing to win a parliamentary majority there is also a view that Bradley may go for the safe option of calling in the CMA for full scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cThe risk is that the DCMS refers the deal to the CMA as it could be politically expedient to do so,\u201d said Wilton Fry, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.</p> <h2>The key questions</h2> <p><strong>Are the Murdochs \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners of a broadcasting licence for Sky?</strong><br></p> <p>Ofcom is responsible for monitoring all broadcasters to make sure they remain \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a broadcasting licence in the UK. Critics argue that phone hacking and scandal at Fox News in the US means that they should fail the test and not be allowed to take full control of Sky. <br></p> <p><strong>Would the deal give the Murdochs too much control of UK news media?</strong></p> <p>The Murdochs say the Sun and Times are in a different, independent company, News Corp, to where Sky News would be run at Fox. They add that the rise of media outlets such as BuzzFeed and Huffington Post, against a backdrop of declining newspaper sales, means there is plenty of plurality. Critics argue that the Murdochs effectively still control both companies and that they maintain a huge media influence.</p> <p><strong>If the Murdochs take full control of Sky and Sky News, will they adhere to existing standards of accuracy and impartiality?</strong><br></p> <p>There is overlap here with the subject matter of the \u201cfit and proper\u201d test, except in this case it will be up to Bradley, not Ofcom, to decide what action to take on the outcome of the media regulator\u2019s report. In the past decade Fox News has notched up seven breaches of the Ofcom code, a low number with no serious breaches involving fines recorded. <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Italian government is stepping in to wind up two failing lenders and prevent a bank run, at a total cost of up to \u20ac17bn (\u00a315bn). After an emergency cabinet meeting on Sunday, ministers agreed to a decree splitting Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza into \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 banks, keeping branches open. The \u2018good\u2019 assets are being acquired by Italy\u2019s biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, with the Italian government handing about \u20ac5bn to Intesa as part of the deal. The lenders will then be liquidated, which leaves the state footing the bill for bad loans on both banks\u2019 books, plus restructuring costs. The Italian government would provide state guarantees worth up to \u20ac12bn to cover potential losses at the \u2018bad\u2019 bank, Pier Carlo Padoan, the finance minister, told reporters in Rome. That means the total cost could reach \u20ac17bn. Padoan added that both banks would operate normally on Monday. The deal is meant to ward off the threat of a bank run, by reassuring nervous savers and deterring them from withdrawing their funds when branches reopen. Paolo Gentiloni, Italy\u2019s prime minister, insisted that the decree fully respected EU rules, even though taxpapers are no longer meant to stump the cost to rescue a failing bank. The funds will come from a \u20ac20bn fund created last year to help struggling lenders, so will not affect Italy\u2019s public borrowing, according to the government. The deal appears to protect depositors and senior creditors of the two banks. But it is not clear how many jobs will be lost, or how many branches Intesa could decide to close. On Friday, the European Central Bank ruled that the two lenders, based in the Veneto region of Italy, were \u201cfailing, or likely to fail\u201d. That ended months of uncertainty, and failed attempts to raise fresh capital, and forced the Italian government to commence insolvency proceedings and wind them up. The government had spent months trying to avoid liquidation, by using a mixture of state funds and private investment to recapitalise both lenders. But the plan failed to win support from investors, and the ECB ultimately concluded that time had run out to present \u201ccredible solutions\u201d to keep the two lenders operating. Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza are key players in the industrial heartland, in the north-east of Italy. As well as bad loans, they have also been dragged down by a mis-selling scandal. Shares in the two companies have slumped in value, hurting small shareholders across the region. Italy\u2019s government has been sparring with the ECB for months, over how to clean up its banking system. It is currently implementing a precautionary recapitalisation of the world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena.",

    "webTitle": "Central banks raise alarm over new crash after steep rise in lending", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "World leaders have been warned to guard against another financial crash after a steep rise in risky bank lending over the past year that could threaten the stability of the global financial system. The international body that represents central banks said a recovery in global trade this year and improving levels of GDP in most countries could create complacency and convince policymakers to ignore warning signs of excessive lending coming from the financial sector. With only two weeks until the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) said politicians and central banks needed to keep financial markets in check to prevent another crash. Soaring stock markets, which have become detached from underlying values, were another sign that unjustified exuberance had replaced last year\u2019s overly pessimistic reaction to political events such as the US election and the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, BIS cautioned in its annual report published on Sunday. The warning comes as Donald Trump, the US president, is expected to resist attempts by G20 members and his German hosts for closer co-operation in tackling reckless lending at a meeting on 7 July. Angela Merkel, bruised from Trump\u2019s decision to reject the Paris climate change deal, is understood to be keen to get the US to sign up to tough regulations on banks put forward by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an arm of the G20. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor and boss of the FSB, wrote to Berlin in March demanding greater efforts to tackle the riskier parts of the financial system. Carney, who will attend the Hamburg summit, said politicians needed to adopt tougher rules to bring shadow banking into the mainstream financial system and make derivatives markets safer. He warned that a raft of reforms proposed in the wake of the 2008 crash had yet to be enacted while \u201cnew and emerging vulnerabilities\u201d were piling up and adding to the number of risks that need to be tackled. Claudio Borio, the chief economist at the BIS, welcomed a turnaround in global growth over the past year that had \u201cstrengthened considerably and [was] forecast to return to long-term averages soon\u201d. He said: \u201cEconomic slack in the major economies has diminished further; in some, unemployment rates have fallen back to levels consistent with full employment. And inflation has moved closer to central bank objectives.\u201d But he warned that financial markets and policymakers were too quick to forget the risks that brought about the 2008 financial crash. The disconnect between the exuberance of stock market investors and bond investors who lend funds to nation states was also a destabilising factor. \u201cThere is tension between stock markets, which have soared, and sovereign bond yields [the interest rate on the debt], which have not risen much as economic prospects have brightened. And, unfortunately, the unwelcome long-term developments we termed \u201cthe risky trinity\u201d in last year\u2019s report are still with us: unusually low productivity growth, unusually high debt, and unusually narrow room for policy manoeuvre,\u201d Borio said. \u201cLeading indicators of financial distress point to financial booms that in a number of economies look qualitatively similar to those that preceded the great financial crash.\u201d He said the countries at risk were not those that were at the centre of the previous crisis, such as Britain. Instead he pointed to mature economies such as Canada and Sweden that largely avoided the last crash but have since allowed huge borrowing and property booms that make their economies vulnerable to a crash. The largest emerging economies of China, India and Brazil were also vulnerable after a period of rapid growth, much of it based on cheap credit. \u201cThe strong post-crisis growth of foreign currency debt adds to vulnerabilities in some countries. Indeed, given the dominant global role of the US dollar, dollar funding remains a potential pressure point in the international monetary and financial system.\u201d Central bankers largely support moves by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates over the past 18 months, from 0.25% to 1.25%, but have reservations about the knock-on effect to countries that have borrowed excessively in dollars. The rising cost of borrowing in dollars is widely expected to increase bankruptcy rates in countries such as Turkey and Brazil, where private companies have expanded quickly using dollar-denominated debt. But despite these dangers, BIS warned that \u201ckeeping interest rates too low for long could raise financial stability and macroeconomic risks further down the road, as debt continues to pile up and risk-taking in financial markets gathers steam.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Few predicted it at the time, but the real effect of the EU referendum a year ago has been political rather than economic. One prime minister has resigned and another has been so badly mauled that she may not survive much longer. Britain is closer to having a Labour government with a radical leftwing agenda than it has been for decades. All this has been going on while the economy has been growing at a respectable, if unspectacular, rate, averaging growth of 0.5% a quarter since the Brexit vote. The recession so confidently predicted by the Treasury ahead of the vote has not happened. There have been economic consequences of the referendum. The pound\u2019s fall has made imports dearer and contributed to a squeeze on living standards, but it has helped manufacturers who, according to the CBI, have the strongest order books in three decades. Britain\u2019s unbalanced economy needs higher exports and less reliance on consumer spending, unpopular though that combination is. Some in the remain camp have taken heart from the fact that France is growing more quickly than the UK, hopeful that this might engender the much-anticipated buyers\u2019 remorse. There is not yet much sign of this, perhaps because voters are smart enough to realise that one quarter does not make up for decades of slow growth and high unemployment in France, and perhaps also because countries are sometimes willing to accept some short-term economic pain for a political objective. Germany at the time of reunification is a case in point. The Tories own Brexit. It was their decision to hold a referendum and it is their responsibility to deliver it at a time when there is a distinct lack of a feelgood factor. In one sense, this is good news for Jeremy Corbyn because he can watch the Conservatives struggle. But it is also a challenge, because the possibility of another election will focus attention on what a Labour Brexit would look like. Labour\u2019s approach has thus far been one of studied ambiguity. To put up a decent show in the general election in June, Corbyn needed to hold together a coalition of leave voters in the north and Midlands with remain voters in London and the other big cities. So the line was that Labour accepted the result of the referendum but would seek to secure access to the single market in any negotiations. Despite the loss of a handful of seats where the leave vote was strong, the strategy worked. One option for Corbyn would be to say that the result of the referendum was a terrible mistake and that the whole Brexit thing should be called off. What might be called Labour\u2019s hardline remain faction says Britain could have the best of both worlds: it could have the political upheaval caused by Brexit, which has weakened the Conservatives, while at the same time maintaining the economic status quo. The UK would be back where it was before the referendum, only with Corbyn and John McDonnell running things instead of David Cameron and George Osborne. There are, though, one or two drawbacks to this approach. One is that quite a lot of the 17 million people who voted leave in the referendum were cheesed off with the status quo and don\u2019t want it resurrected. A second is that many of the measures that a Labour government might want to introduce to remedy Britain\u2019s structural weaknesses \u2013 increased state aid, infant industry protection, public ownership \u2013 would be harder to implement, or actually prohibited, inside the EU. A third is that it would be profoundly anti-democratic. The liberal left\u2019s approach to the Grenfell Tower fire has been to demand that poor people have a voice, yet this sits oddly, to say the least, with the idea that the result of the EU referendum should be overturned because the poor people who voted for Brexit didn\u2019t know what they were doing. Giving people a voice means giving people a voice. It doesn\u2019t mean only giving them a voice when they agree with you. A slightly milder version of hardline remain is the one canvassed by the TUC: to retain the option of staying in the European single market. This would be Brexit but the mildest Brexit possible. Moving leftwards on the spectrum, there are those who think Britain should stay in the EU but only if it is reformed. This gets round the problem of simply turning the clock back to the state of affairs that existed before the referendum and also recognises that the shortcomings of the eurozone \u2013 the one-size fits all single currency, the austerity imposed on Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the ingrained unemployment and the perpetually slow growth \u2013 might have had something to do with last year\u2019s result. Those who say a different Europe is needed are right in their analysis. The problem they have is in explaining how this different Europe comes about, particularly given that the direction of travel for decades has been entirely in the opposite direction, towards a destination where budgets have to balanced, where countries have to deflate their way back to growth, where the nation state must bend the knee to market forces and competition and where neoliberal ideas hold sway. A Corbyn-led government could make a success of reform and remain, but only if it could win the support of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and a Council of Ministers, none of which are exactly awash with kindred spirits. It would require treaty change to bring about a different Europe, which seems unlikely. Finally, there are those who favour left exit or Lexit, a group that sees the EU as anti-democratic, pro-big business and steeped in conservative economics. Lexiteers see Brexit not as a threat but as an opportunity to use trade, procurement, tax, ownership, and public investment to transform the economy along socialist lines. So that\u2019s the choice. At one end of the spectrum are those who want Brexit to be as soft and messy as possible to prevent what they fear will be serious economic damage from leaving. They think the EU has been a success, the single currency\u2019s travails are simply teething troubles, that Emmanuel Macron heralds a new dawn for European social democracy and that socialism in one country is a fantasy. At the other end are those who think the EU embodies neo-liberalism, that the euro should be broken up, that Macron will deliver more for his former employers at Rothschild than for the French working class, and that radical socialism is possible even in the teeth of violent opposition from the financial markets. With a different leader, Labour would almost certainly be heading in a more soft Brexit direction. But before 2015\u2019s leadership contest, Labour\u2019s hard Lexiteers would have been able to count on support from Corbyn and McDonnell. Hence the ambiguity.",

    "webTitle": "Trump could use alternate routes to roll back bank reforms", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On the campaign trail and in office, Donald Trump has promised to replace the Dodd-Frank Wall Street regulations, triggering fears that he could unleash a new wave of reckless bankers armed with dangerous and loosely regulated financial practices. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2010, in response to the financial meltdown of 2008. On Tuesday, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said that if he was king for a day, he would indeed repeal it. But six months into the Trump presidency, the Republican-controlled Congress appears nowhere close to passing a reform bill, in part because no Democratic senators will help any such bill reach a necessary 60-vote threshold. The bankers remain on the leash. Earlier this month, the House passed the Financial Choice Act bill, drafted by financial services committee chairman Jeb Hensarling. Hansarling\u2019s bill proposes relieving small regional banks from Dodd-Frank regulations; repealing the Volcker Rule, which restricts bankers from making speculative bets using a bank\u2019s money; and reducing the burden of annual \u201cstress tests\u201d. Since Hensarling\u2019s bill has little chance of becoming law, the Trump administration is instead moving to enact reform through bank regulators. Mnuchin recently said that 80% of proposals he considers \u201ccritical\u201d to overhauling bank rules could be achieved without legislation. Some experts think this approach lessens the change the Trump administration can effect. \u201cBetween the election and now, we have seen a narrowing and lessening of expectations regarding bank reforms,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, policy analyst at Compass Point Research and Trading. \u201cExpectations have shifted from broad legislative reform to targeted administrative reform that can be done by regulators.\u201d Others think the administration can still inflict major, damaging change. \u201cThere is very little question that this administration is engaged in a project to massively deregulate the financial services industry,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a nonpartisan Wall Street watchdog group. \u201cIf they only do half of what they say they\u2019re going to do through the regulatory agencies, the likelihood of another catastrophic financial crash is high.\u201d Last week, two Trump regulatory appointees told legislators they supported dismantling the Volcker Rule within the framework of existing Dodd-Frank legislation. Such words stood at odds with Trump campaign promises to dismantle \u201celite\u201d Wall Street banks, as he sought the votes of \u201cordinary Americans\u201d. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve governor in charge of financial regulation, said he supported adjusting regulations \u201cin common sense ways that will simplify rules and reduce unnecessary regulatory burden\u201d. Acting comptroller of the currency Keith Noreika, meanwhile, told senators that smaller banks could be solely overseen by his agency; that new banks should not require approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); and that supervision of lenders should be removed from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and placed under banking regulatory bodies. \u201cWe need to avoid imposing unnecessary burden and creating an environment so adverse to risk that banks are inhibited from lending and investing in the businesses and communities they serve,\u201d Noreika said. The administration also named Jim Clinger, a former aide to Hensarling, to chair the FDIC. Kelleher, of Better Markets, said: \u201cTrump-appointed regulators are already re-interpreting rules, implementing them differently or clearly signalling they\u2019re not going to enforce some of the rules. \u201cRegulators on their own have a massive amount of discretion on how they apply and enforce laws. It\u2019s the combination of those two things that enables the banks to engage in high-risk activities that threaten the financial stability of the United States.\u201d Boltansky, of Compass Point Research and Trading, countered that the US remains a long way from recreating the kind of conditions that caused the 2008 crisis, namely permitting egregious mortgage underwriting. \u201cWe now have very detailed rules about how you underwrite a mortgage and they are not going away,\u201d he said. In Congress, meanwhile, Democrats and some Republicans, among them senators Elizabeth Warren and John McCain, are looking for ways to revive a version of the Glass-Steagall Act, the 80-year-old statute that kept investment banking and consumer lending separate until it was scrapped under Bill Clinton in 1999. The Republican party included support for a \u201c21st-century Glass-Steagall\u201d in its election platform. Mnuchin has distanced himself from that pledge, prompting a heated exchange between the secretary and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during a Senate budget committee hearing. Mnuchin said Trump opposed actions that would break up big banks. \u201cWe think that that would hurt the economy,\u201d he told Sanders, \u201cthat would ruin liquidity in the market. What we are focused on is safe and prudent regulation for the large banks so we don\u2019t have taxpayer risk.\u201d Kelleher argued that a high-risk environment was precisely what the administration risks creating: \u201cThe Trump administration talks as if there was no crash and no need to protect the American people from recklessness on Wall Street when we know that recklessness on Wall Street almost caused a second Great Depression.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean Dodd-Frank should not be tweaked, Boltansky said. \u201cOne of the problems we\u2019ve had with regulatory reform is that it\u2019s been impossible to do basic tweaks because the political climate is so toxic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of Dodd-Frank was thoughtful and well-contoured but of course there are areas that need to be recalibrated.\u201d",

The debate centres on when to raise borrowing costs from their record low and whether the economy \u2013 and squeezed consumers \u2013 can take it. This week it will be the turn of the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee to hold forth. Its twice-yearly financial stability report will be presented by the governor, Mark Carney, on Tuesday and he is likely to use the health check to highlight the problem of consumer debt burdens in the UK. With real incomes squeezed, households have been dipping into savings and maxing out their credit cards. The Bank has raised its concerns about what this means for the broader financial system before, and could well use this update to flag the risks to the system if individuals overstretch themselves. Investors will be watching for any hints from the Bank on what it plans to do about rising consumer borrowing. Carney is also likely to use the report to give himself and committee colleagues a pat on the back for the steps already taken by the FPC to rein in the mortgage market, which in turn give monetary policymakers scope to raise interest rates without inflicting too much harm on borrowers. Will Brexit dethrone Crown Estate? The royal family\u2019s commercial property arm has had full confidence in the resilience of the market in the West End of London despite the Brexit vote. Even though investment in commercial property sank to its lowest levels in four years in the aftermath of the referendum, the Crown Estate said it was pushing ahead with a \u00a3100m development of Duke\u2019s Court, a mixed retail and office block in St James\u2019s, because it believed in \u201cthe fundamentals of London\u2019s West End\u201d. Six months and an election later, and with the Brexit negotiations having just started, what will the view of the Crown Estate be now? On Monday, chief executive Alison Nimmo will reveal the annual results for the estate, which owns London\u2019s Regent Street and the entire UK seabed, among many other holdings. Last year the property empire delivered a record \u00a3304.1m to Treasury coffers and saw the value of its portfolio rise 9.7% to \u00a312bn. The post-Brexit market is very different for commercial property, however, and a report from Deloitte found high levels of construction, but with less than half of the space being built let. Duke\u2019s Court is due to be completed in the spring of 2019 \u2013 around the same time that article 50 negotiations are also due to complete.

On Tuesday, anyone interested in fracking \u2013 including supporters \u2013 has been invited to a town-hall-style gathering at the 450-seat Lowther Pavilion theatre in Lytham St Annes, organised by engineer Mike Hill, one of the most vocal opponents of fracking in Lancashire.

      "bodyText": "So Travis Kalanick finally took a one-way cab. The ejection of the founder of Uber as its chief executive last week was that rarest of Silicon Valley events: shareholders taking action to repair a tech company\u2019s culture by removing an executive. The shareholders were venture capitalists who owned chunks of the business, so this was not like the public shareholder revolts seen at British Gas owner Centrica or WPP. But for a Silicon Valley company to admit that it has a cultural and leadership problem at the top is a black-swan event \u2013 the rarest of the rare. The problem goes wider than Uber, though. The Silicon Valley mindset is that it\u2019s better to ask forgiveness later than permission first. Then when a tech business has a run-in with regulation, it just ploughs ahead, and lets someone else make amends afterwards. Uber has form in this regard: it faced multiple accusations around the world of breaching taxi regulations, and also over its tests of self-driving cars, which it did without the correct certification. It\u2019s hardly alone: Google\u2019s gigantic book-scanning project ignored the text at the front of every book saying you need the copyright holder\u2019s permission to scan and store its content, and was eventually let off by the courts on the basis that it might be useful. Sexism is also emerging \u2013 an iceberg\u2019s mass coming into view \u2013 as an endemic problem that has undermined progress both within and by these companies. Ellen Pao sued a venture capital company for sexual harassment (she lost) and then was forced out at Reddit by user reaction after introducing measures to stifle hateful content. Sheryl Sandberg, second-in-command at Facebook, encourages women to \u201clean in\u201d, but the complaint is that it shouldn\u2019t be the woman\u2019s job to be more accepted. It\u2019s the lack of women in middle management that points to the inherent problems in the system. It was complaints about sexism that first pushed Uber into a proper examination of its many internal flaws. But reports last week suggest that sexism is far more widespread among both companies and venture capitalists. Tech\u2019s \u201cbrogrammer\u201d culture \u2013 a testosterone-driven competition not just to win, but to see others fail \u2013 is becoming toxic. There are broader problems too. A service like Uber brings short-term benefits to the people being transported, who like the comparatively low costs and greater convenience. However, the savings in your pocket come from somewhere. Almost all come from the money poured into the company by venture capitalists (Uber still operates at a loss overall), but some comes from taxi drivers cut out of business. However, to Silicon Valley, those people were just in the way; someone else can make amends. That tends to be governments, which the companies first ignore and then rely on to clean up the damage. There\u2019s an arrogance at work in Silicon Valley, and it\u2019s not just about business models, or even the treatment of women. These companies are by definition young and trying to create businesses in entirely new fields. When they want to wipe away privacy for the world\u2019s population, or get people to take photos with strange spectacles, there\u2019s no useful advice to be had from dentists, psychiatrists or lawyers \u2013 the professions of the parents of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Snapchat chief Evan Spiegel. Their children are the astronauts of business. But just because the companies are young doesn\u2019t mean the principles of running good businesses should be thrown away. The lesson that Silicon Valley should really take from Uber and Kalanick\u2019s downfall is that while it\u2019s good to want to change the world, the world will still be there afterwards, and you\u2019ll want it to be a place that\u2019s fit to live in. If all that\u2019s left is a sexist, devil-take-the-hindmost wasteland which treats people as disposable and interchangeable, perhaps the world doesn\u2019t really need your great new idea. War of words at the Bank but rates stay low City traders are not the only people to follow the twists and turns of policymakers at the Bank of England. Plenty of middle-income families, coping with mega-mortgages, car loans and ballooning credit card bills, are concerned about the cost of credit. This week was particularly confusing for anyone who tries to read the Threadneedle Street runes. On Tuesday morning at the Mansion House in the City of London, Mark Carney was clearly worried about the impact of Brexit, Britain\u2019s low productivity and slow wages growth. The Bank\u2019s governor would vote against raising rates for a long time to come, he said in a speech that sent the pound plummeting. The currency rallied on Wednesday when the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, usually a nailed-on supporter of low rates, said the time was nearing when he might vote for a rise. Despite agreeing with Carney that the UK economy was entering choppy waters during the Brexit negotiations, he warned that without higher interest rates the Bank would be impotent when the next crash came along. The time for a rise was therefore imminent. Kristin Forbes, who is about to be replaced by London School of Economics academic Silvana Tenreyro, has long argued for higher rates as a way of arming the central bank for the next financial war. She popped up on Thursday to accuse her colleagues on the monetary policy committee of keeping rates low by virtue of a colossal misjudgment. They had failed to understand that inflation would soon rocket, demanding a rise in rates to calm the situation. Also, the use of regulation to keep the banking sector in check denied the central bank a significant reason for raising rates. When macro-prudential tools were used aggressively, there was no need for higher rates to curb excessive bank lending. But all this antagonistic energy appears to cancel itself out, leaving the situation unchanged. And that looks like being the case for some time. Maybe the infighting shows that, after almost 10 years without a rate rise, the MPC is getting bored. More likely, the majority of members can see consumers and businesses need all the help they can get at the moment, and ultra-cheap credit is worth fighting for. HS2 needs high-speed experts from overseas The uproar over the shortlist of foreign firms battling to run Britain\u2019s high speed HS2 trains from 2026 needs a little perspective. First, those Chinese, Italian and French rail companies have already operated trains in such far-flung places as Essex and south London without arousing concern. Second, the Department for Transport stipulated that bidders should have experience of running high-speed services. In Britain, such trains have only ever been run by Govia, operator of the High Speed 1 route but better known as the arch-villains behind the Southern network. Yes, Govia is partly French too, with ownership of the company split between France\u2019s SNCF \u2013 also bidding for HS2 \u2013 and the UK\u2019s Go-Ahead Group. But SNCF has an enviable reputation as a high-speed pioneer; Trenitalia is likewise an experienced operator; and Guangshen Railway has teamed up with Hong Kong\u2019s excellent MTR. Britain\u2019s long-suffering commuters should get on board.",

      "body": "<p>So Travis Kalanick finally took a one-way cab. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns\" title=\"\">ejection of the founder of Uber as its chief executive </a>last week was that rarest of Silicon Valley events: shareholders taking action to repair a tech company\u2019s culture by removing an executive.</p> <p>The shareholders were venture capitalists who owned chunks of the business, so this was not like the public shareholder revolts seen at British Gas owner Centrica or WPP. But for a Silicon Valley company to admit that it has a cultural and leadership problem at the top is a black-swan event \u2013 the rarest of the rare.</p> <p>The problem goes wider than Uber, though. The Silicon Valley mindset is that it\u2019s better to ask forgiveness later than permission first. Then when a tech business has a run-in with regulation, it just ploughs ahead, and lets someone else make amends afterwards. Uber has form in this regard: it faced multiple accusations around the world of breaching taxi regulations, and also over its tests of self-driving cars, which it did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/21/uber-cancels-self-driving-car-trial-san-francisco-california\" title=\"\">without the correct certification</a>. It\u2019s hardly alone: Google\u2019s gigantic book-scanning project ignored the text at the front of every book saying you need the copyright holder\u2019s permission to scan and store its content, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/19/authors-guild-google-scanning-denied\" title=\"\">was eventually let off by the courts</a> on the basis that it might be useful.</p> <p>Sexism is also emerging \u2013 an iceberg\u2019s mass coming into view \u2013 as an endemic problem that has undermined progress both within and by these companies. Ellen Pao sued a venture capital company for sexual harassment (she lost) and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/17/ellen-pao-harassment-feminist\" title=\"\">was forced out at Reddit</a> by user reaction after introducing measures to stifle hateful content. Sheryl Sandberg, second-in-command at Facebook, encourages women to \u201clean in\u201d, but the complaint is that it shouldn\u2019t be the woman\u2019s job to be more accepted. It\u2019s the lack of women in middle management that points to the inherent problems in the system.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/24/uber-manager-sexism-systemic-tech-kamilah-taylor\" title=\"\">complaints about sexism</a> that first pushed Uber into a proper examination of its many internal flaws. But reports last week suggest that sexism is far more widespread among both companies and venture capitalists. Tech\u2019s \u201cbrogrammer\u201d culture \u2013 a testosterone-driven competition not just to win, but to see others fail \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.theneweconomy.com/technology/silicons-sexist-brogrammer-culture-is-locking-women-out-of-tech\" title=\"\">becoming toxic</a>.</p> <p>There are broader problems too. A service like Uber brings short-term benefits to the people being transported, who like the comparatively low costs and greater convenience. However, the savings in your pocket come from somewhere. Almost all come from the money poured into the company by venture capitalists (Uber still operates at a loss overall), but some comes from taxi drivers cut out of business.
