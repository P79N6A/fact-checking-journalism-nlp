    "webTitle": "Lib Dem alarm grows as house price inflation outstrips OBR's forecasts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Liberal Democrat concerns over the impact of the Help to Buy scheme have been intensified by new figures from the Office of Budget Responsibility showing house price inflation is continuing to soar. The increase is likely to peak in the third quarter of this year at an annualised rate of 9.2%, the official forecaster said. That figure is substantially higher than the OBR was forecasting only four months ago, and means house prices are on course to reach pre-crash levels. Business secretary Vince Cable has repeatedly questioned whether Help to Buy \u2013 which provides state support for people buying homes \u2013 is fuelling a property boom that could lead to an unsustainable recovery. In a Commons debate on the budget, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, goaded Cable about his previous warnings over Help to Buy, claiming he had become enslaved in government and urging him to get out before it was too late. Cable conceded it was \"spot on\" to say that a lack of productivity and investment in the economy was casting a very long shadow over the length of the recovery. \"All recoveries tend to start with consumer spending, but lack of investment is a deep-rooted problem in the United Kingdom,\" he told MPs. His political allies have pointed to passages in the OBR report showing how house price inflation was worsening, saying: \"This proves Vince was right and the Bank's financial policy committee needs to look at this.\" Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrats' president, warned: \"Help to Buy threatens to stoke the London property market and pull the chance of home ownership away from thousands.\" The OBR report said: \"House prices have continued to accelerate since our December forecast with annual growth reaching 5.5 % in December 2013. \"We expect house prices to peak earlier than in our December forecast at 9.2% in the third quarter of 2014, with prices rising by around 30% by 2018-19. \"House prices will grow by 8.6% in 2014-15, 2.7% higher than forecasted in December.\" It adds: \"By the end of the forecast period [2018-19] house prices will be only 0.5 % below their pre-crisis peak\". At present the second part of the Help to Buy scheme \u2013 aimed at helping people buy any home, not just newbuild homes \u2013 is set to finish after December 2016. The astonishing impact of rising house prices on government tax receipts is also spelt out in the OBR report. It suggests ministers will recoup more than \u00a370bn in stamp duty in the five years to 2018-19; the annual income is due to rise from \u00a39.5bn in 2013-14 to \u00a318.1bn in 2018-19. The figures also show that one in 10 estates will be liable for inheritance tax within five years, as opposed to the current figure of one in 20. London accounted for 40% of stamp duty income last year. The OBR suggests the number of houses that will be taxed at 3% due to being valued at over \u00a3250,000 will rise sharply, saying it now expects that the average house price will exceed the 3% threshold for the first time this year. Balls also told parliament that Labour would vote for the permanent welfare cap in the Commons next Wednesday, amid signs that the cap may not prove to be the budget political trap for Labour that Osborne intended. Labour sources said they expected only a small number of its MPs would vote against the cap next week, and some shadow cabinet members even believe that backing it will help the party defend itself from the charge that is \"soft on welfare\". This relaxed stance is partly due to the Liberal Democrats' insistence that the cap should not be set too tightly. Welfare payments \u2013 except the state pension and benefits linked to cyclical unemployment rates \u2013 will be not be able to exceed \u00a3119.5bn in 2015-16, Osborne announced. The cap is forecast to rise in line with inflation to \u00a3126.7bn in 2018-19. Gavin Kelly, chief executive of thinktank the Resolution Foundation, said: \"It's unclear how much difference the proposed cap would really make to the behaviour of a future government. If the government of the day wants to constrain welfare spending then it would be able to do that with or without the cap. \"Equally, if it wants to get out of the cap, in all likelihood it wouldn't be very hard to adjust it.\" Kelly also questioned how the cap would function if universal credit, the government's new welfare benefit, becomes operationally nationwide. He said: \"One of the points in favour of universal credit is that it is supposed seamlessly to integrate in-work and out-of-work support, but the logic of the welfare cap points in the opposite direction. \"We are yet to hear from the government what the welfare cap might mean for the operation of universal credit.\" As it stands, some part of universal credit linked to those who are out of work will remain outside the cap, but those parts of it paid to those in work will come inside it. Any party wanting to breach the limit would have to go back to parliament for approval. The approach is hardly tougher than the requirement for ministers to explain whether they are going to reach child poverty targets. Osborne plans to go into the election promising to reduce the cap further, something that the Liberal Democrats say they will oppose. Labour said it supported the idea in principle as early as last year and would back a three-year cap.",

      "body": "<p>Liberal Democrat concerns over the impact of the Help to Buy scheme have been intensified by new figures from the Office of Budget Responsibility showing house price inflation is continuing to soar.</p> <p>The increase is likely to peak in the third quarter of this year at an annualised rate of 9.2%, the official forecaster said. That figure is substantially higher than the OBR was forecasting only four months ago, and means house prices are on course to reach pre-crash levels.</p> <p>Business secretary Vince Cable has repeatedly questioned whether Help to Buy \u2013 which provides state support for people buying homes \u2013 is fuelling a property boom that could lead to an unsustainable recovery.</p> <p>In a Commons debate on the budget, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, goaded Cable about his previous warnings over Help to Buy, claiming he had become enslaved in government and urging him to get out before it was too late.</p> <p>Cable conceded it was \"spot on\" to say that a lack of productivity and investment in the economy was casting a very long shadow over the length of the recovery.</p> <p>\"All recoveries tend to start with consumer spending, but lack of investment is a deep-rooted problem in the United Kingdom,\" he told MPs.</p> <p>His political allies have pointed to passages in the OBR report showing how house price inflation was worsening, saying: \"This proves Vince was right and the Bank's financial policy committee needs to look at this.\" Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrats' president, warned: \"Help to Buy threatens to stoke the London property market and pull the chance of home ownership away from thousands.\"</p> <p>The OBR report said: \"House prices have continued to accelerate since our December forecast with annual growth reaching 5.5 % in December 2013.</p> <p>\"We expect house prices to peak earlier than in our December forecast at 9.2% in the third quarter of 2014, with prices rising by around 30% by 2018-19.</p> <p>\"House prices will grow by 8.6% in 2014-15, 2.7% higher than forecasted in December.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"By the end of the forecast period [2018-19] house prices will be only 0.5 % below their pre-crisis peak\".</p> <p>At present the second part of the Help to Buy scheme \u2013 aimed at helping people buy any home, not just newbuild homes \u2013 is set to finish after December 2016.</p> <p>The astonishing impact of rising house prices on government tax receipts is also spelt out in the OBR report.</p> <p>It suggests ministers will recoup more than \u00a370bn in stamp duty in the five years to 2018-19; the annual income is due to rise from \u00a39.5bn in 2013-14 to \u00a318.1bn in 2018-19. The figures also show that one in 10 estates will be liable for inheritance tax within five years, as opposed to the current figure of one in 20. London accounted for 40% of stamp duty income last year.</p> <p>The OBR suggests the number of houses that will be taxed at 3% due to being valued at over \u00a3250,000 will rise sharply, saying it now expects that the average house price will exceed the 3% threshold for the first time this year.</p> <p>Balls also told parliament that Labour would vote for the permanent welfare cap in the Commons next Wednesday, amid signs that the cap may not prove to be the budget political trap for Labour that Osborne intended.</p> <p>Labour sources said they expected only a small number of its MPs would vote against the cap next week, and some shadow cabinet members even believe that backing it will help the party defend itself from the charge that is \"soft on welfare\".

      "bodyText": "BAE Systems, which runs Scotland's largest military shipyards in Glasgow, has said a no vote in the independence referendum would be better for its business. The defence group, the latest major employer in Scotland to warn about the risks of independence, said in its annual report it believed that remaining in the UK \"offers greater certainty and stability\" for its operations. BAE's two yards on the Clyde were at the centre of a bitter political row last year after the company said it was phasing out shipbuilding at its Portsmouth yard in favour of the Clyde sites. But UK ministers said the future of those yards and of all Royal Navy shipbuilding there hinged on the vote in September. The Clyde yards are helping build the MoD's two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers and are expected to build a new destroyer. Joining other firms such as Standard Life, Shell, Lloyds and RBS in voicing anxieties about the potential risks of independence, BAE said: \"The decision on independence from the UK is a matter for the people of Scotland. However, BAE Systems has significant interests and employees in Scotland, and it is clear that continued union offers greater certainty and stability for our business.\" Hinting that it would take its lead from the UK government about its future in Scotland, BAE added: \"In the event that Scotland voted to become independent, we would need to discuss the way forward with the Ministry of Defence and UK government, and work with them to deliver the best solution in those circumstances.\" The Scottish government insists it wants to protect shipbuilding, arguing it \"regards support for our shipbuilding industry as a priority given our focus on maritime defence capabilities\". Its independence white paper states that Scotland would need its own military vessels and would want to build four new frigates on the Clyde, preferably through a joint warship procurement partnership with the UK after independence, as well as needing maintenance yards for Scotland's small navy post-independence. Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran said BAE's warning was worry and highly significant: \"Thousands of jobs in Scotland rely on shipbuilding. [It's] time that the SNP came clean with people across Scotland and admitted that their plans for shipbuilding just don't add up.\"",

He drilled into staff the importance of being friendly to customers and the firm's internal mantra \"we don't believe in bad manners, fashion egos or size zeros\" was an antidote to austere Bond Street boutiques.</p> <p>Back then, Mulberry's classic Bays-water bag, costing \u00a3500, was within touching distance for many British women.

Recent initiatives include a collaboration with model Cara Delevingne unveiled at London fashion week and included a bag inspired by her lion tattoo.</p> <p>But with more than 60% of Mulberry's sales rung up in the UK, its traditional shoppers were priced out of the market and have since defected to fast-growing brands such as Michael Kors and Coach whose arm candy are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals.</p> <p>When Guillon took over in 2012 Mulberry could do no wrong for shoppers or investors. It was the sleeper success of the luxury goods sector, having quietly metamorphosed from a staid brand, adopted by the green welly brigade in the 1980s, into a fun and unpredictable label capable of conjuring up \"it-bags\" that \"it-girls\" such as Chung were happy to sling over their shoulders. Like many brands it owes a debt to Kate Moss, a friend of Hill's, who lit a fuse in the fashion press when she stepped out with a Bayswater in the crook of her arm a decade ago. Moss's patronage proved a turning point for the brand, putting it on the radar of Grazia readers.</p> <p>Lorna Hall, head of retail at trend consultancy WGSN, said it can be very hard for fashion brands to move upmarket and even more so in the glare of the stock market where executives are forced to publish regular sales updates. \"When you make this kind of shift there is always a danger of alienating your existing customers,\" she said. \"Mulberry has made a big shift in its prices. It had customers who were willing to pay \u00a3500 but they won't go above that. She was Mulberry shopper - not a Louis Vuitton or a Chanel shopper.\"</p> <p>Davis has rescued the brand before. He took charge in 2002, when after years of losses, Mulberry's biggest shareholder, the Singaporean billionaire Christina Ong, ousted the founder, Roger Saul, in a bloody boardroom coup. History repeated itself on Thursday but there were no tears, from investors anyway, with the shares closing the day up more than 5%.</p>",

But with more than 60% of Mulberry's sales rung up in the UK, its traditional shoppers were priced out of the market and have since defected to fast-growing brands such as Michael Kors and Coach whose arm candy are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals. When Guillon took over in 2012 Mulberry could do no wrong for shoppers or investors. It was the sleeper success of the luxury goods sector, having quietly metamorphosed from a staid brand, adopted by the green welly brigade in the 1980s, into a fun and unpredictable label capable of conjuring up \"it-bags\" that \"it-girls\" such as Chung were happy to sling over their shoulders. Like many brands it owes a debt to Kate Moss, a friend of Hill's, who lit a fuse in the fashion press when she stepped out with a Bayswater in the crook of her arm a decade ago. Moss's patronage proved a turning point for the brand, putting it on the radar of Grazia readers. Lorna Hall, head of retail at trend consultancy WGSN, said it can be very hard for fashion brands to move upmarket and even more so in the glare of the stock market where executives are forced to publish regular sales updates. \"When you make this kind of shift there is always a danger of alienating your existing customers,\" she said. \"Mulberry has made a big shift in its prices. It had customers who were willing to pay \u00a3500 but they won't go above that. She was Mulberry shopper - not a Louis Vuitton or a Chanel shopper.\" Davis has rescued the brand before. He took charge in 2002, when after years of losses, Mulberry's biggest shareholder, the Singaporean billionaire Christina Ong, ousted the founder, Roger Saul, in a bloody boardroom coup. History repeated itself on Thursday but there were no tears, from investors anyway, with the shares closing the day up more than 5%.",

Even if taken literally, a six-month gap might mean that rates are on hold until April 2015 (assuming QE ends in October this year). But it could also still mean June 2015 (assuming QE ends in December), which is when rates were widely expected to be hiked first anyway.</p> <p>Finally, this is of course all still dependent on the incoming economic data, notably a continued recovery in the labour market.

The UK\u2019s fiscal challenge remains large relative to most high-grade sovereigns. Most of the remaining consolidation will fall to the next parliament, making it somewhat less certain. <br><br>According to OBR forecasts, the 2014 Budget is fiscally neutral and the projections for public borrowing and debt are marginally better than forecast in December\u2019s Autumn Statement. The OBR now expects gross general government debt to peak at 93.1% of GDP in 2015-2016, 1.6pp lower than in December. However, the government\u2019s \u201csupplementary debt target\u201d of a falling public sector net debt ratio in 2015-2016 is still forecast to be missed by a year despite the better growth outlook and slightly lower deficits and debt over the period.<br><br>The government is reviewing the current fiscal policy framework, as announced last December. This will not be concluded until this year\u2019s Autumn Statement, but the Budget document emphasises long-term public debt dynamics, a key rating factor in our view. The public debt ratio will need to be lower and steadily declining before any upgrade to \u2018AAA\u2019, if warranted by other credit factors (see \u201c\u2019AAA\u2019 Sovereign Characteristics and Public Debt Ratios\u201d, available at www.fitchratings.com).</p> <p> This is unlikely in the near term, which is reflected in the Stable Outlook. The UK\u2019s public debt dynamics remain sensitive to shocks. <br><br>The OBR\u2019s economic outlook remains similar to our baseline. The OBR revised up its 2014 growth forecast to 2.7% from 2.4%. We also recently revised up our 2014 forecast, to 2.5% from 2.3%, in light of a more balanced growth profile, especially the acceleration of business investment. The economic policy announcements made by the Chancellor on Wednesday do not materially alter our growth expectations. <br><br>We remain cautious about further acceleration of growth. First, fiscal consolidation will continue over the coming years, as confirmed by the Chancellor yesterday. Second, consumption growth is likely to follow real disposable income changes over the longer run, as UK household indebtedness remains one of the highest among major advanced economies, constraining future falls in the savings rate. <br><br>Our affirmation of the UK\u2019s \u2018AA+\u2019 ratings with a Stable Outlook on 18 December 2013 reflected the strengthening economic outlook and credible fiscal strategy. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-20T15:45:56.560Z\">at 3.45pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-532aee9ce4b0d364d9befdd7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-20T14:38:05.886Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Civil servants hold protest march in Athens - photos</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>In Athens, hundreds of striking civil servants have marched through the capital to protest against the government\u2019s austerity measures.</b></p> <p>They are demonstrating against plans to lay-off thousands of public sector workers.

S&amp;P just cut the outlook on the Russian Federation\u2019s BBB credit rating to negative, from stable. The move comes shortly after President Obama extended financial sanctions against Russia to include wealthy supporters of Vladimir Putin and a bank close to the Kremlin, in a bid to deter Russian military incursions into eastern and southern Ukraine. Obama extends sanctions against Russia to include wealthy Putin allies European stock markets clawed their way back by the close, after a survey of US manufacturing activity beat forecasts - and sent Wall Street bouncing back. The London market, though, continued to be dragged down by yesterday\u2019s budget. Insurance firm Resolution shed another 5%, leading the FTSE 100 fallers, after analysts warned that the personal annuity market could be toast (see 12.21pm). Closing prices: FTSE 100: down 30 points at 6542, - 0.5% German DAX: +0.2% French CAC: + 0.46% Italian FTSE MIB: down 0.13% Spanish IBEX: down 0.3% Markets came back after the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index burst back into positive territory, at +9.0, from -6.3 in February. It\u2019s the latest sign that America\u2019s economy is putting its winter weakness behind it. In New York, the Dow Jones is now up 124 points, or +0.7%. But traders are still pondering what Janet Yellen meant, when she suggested US rate rises could come six months after the Fed stops buying US Treasuries (perhaps in October). Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, commented: UK and European markets spent most of the day bogged down in US interest rate concerns only to follow US markets higher after the Philadelphia Fed Index came in at 9 months highs with a sign that US business sentiment is improving. In the era of global zero interest rate policy (ZIRP), international stock markets are more correlated than ever. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing policy has benefited not just US stocks but stocks worldwide. Any change in US interest rate policy has strong implications for European markets. That\u2019s all for today. The other key points are that... Fitch has said the UK is unlikely to get its AAA rating back soon Mulberry has lost its CEO Majestic Wine has issued a profit warning UK manufacturers found it harder to export this month A bond trader has been fined and banned for manipulating the gilt market Civil servants have protested in Greece, and we have pictures Reminder, all the UK Budget action is here in Andy Sparrow\u2019s blog. Cheers, and goodnight. GW Back to Janet Yellen\u2019s suggestion last night that the Fed might raise rates six months after ending its bond purchases.... Julian Jessop of Capital Economics reckons investors have read too much into the comments: For a start, the big picture is essentially unchanged: the Fed remains on course to end its asset purchases towards the end of this year, is likely to begin to raise interest rates some time in 2015, and will probably move only gradually thereafter, keeping rates relatively low for an extended period. What\u2019s more, Yellen\u2019s remark was only an indication (in response to a question) rather than a formal statement of policy. Even if taken literally, a six-month gap might mean that rates are on hold until April 2015 (assuming QE ends in October this year). But it could also still mean June 2015 (assuming QE ends in December), which is when rates were widely expected to be hiked first anyway. Finally, this is of course all still dependent on the incoming economic data, notably a continued recovery in the labour market. Provided inflation remains subdued, the Fed will continue to err on the side of caution. The US dollar, though, remains stronger. This has pushed the euro down almost half a cent, to $1.378, and the pound down 0.3 cents at $1.651. We\u2019ve now added Majestic Wine to our rolling list of companies who have issued profit warnings in recent months, alongside the likes of Debenhams, Shell, RBS, and Mulberry (which led the exit of its CEO today). After a run of decent financial results, Majestic Wine gave investors a nasty shock this morning with an unexpected profits warning. The company said trading since Christmas had been disappointing, and now expects full-year profits and sales to be flat, rather than sparkling. Shares in the company have tumbled like a well-refreshed drinker struggling home after last orders (I imagine), down 18% in late trading. More here. Rating agency Fitch has just warned that it won\u2019t upgrade UK to AAA anytime soon, in its official response to the UK budget. Fitch, which became the second agency after Moody\u2019s to downgrade Britain last year, said the country\u2019s finances still don\u2019t merit a top credit rating. It also said it was cautious about the prospects of UK growth accelerating, given the scale of future fiscal consolidation and the state of household indebtedness. Her\u2019s the full statement UK Budget Confirms Assumptions, Fiscal Challenge Remains The UK budget and latest Office for Budget Responsibility projections are in line with Fitch Ratings\u2019 view that economic growth will improve in the near term and that the government\u2019s overall fiscal stance will remain broadly unchanged. The UK\u2019s fiscal challenge remains large relative to most high-grade sovereigns. Most of the remaining consolidation will fall to the next parliament, making it somewhat less certain. According to OBR forecasts, the 2014 Budget is fiscally neutral and the projections for public borrowing and debt are marginally better than forecast in December\u2019s Autumn Statement. The OBR now expects gross general government debt to peak at 93.1% of GDP in 2015-2016, 1.6pp lower than in December. However, the government\u2019s \u201csupplementary debt target\u201d of a falling public sector net debt ratio in 2015-2016 is still forecast to be missed by a year despite the better growth outlook and slightly lower deficits and debt over the period. The government is reviewing the current fiscal policy framework, as announced last December. This will not be concluded until this year\u2019s Autumn Statement, but the Budget document emphasises long-term public debt dynamics, a key rating factor in our view. The public debt ratio will need to be lower and steadily declining before any upgrade to \u2018AAA\u2019, if warranted by other credit factors (see \u201c\u2019AAA\u2019 Sovereign Characteristics and Public Debt Ratios\u201d, available at www.fitchratings.com). This is unlikely in the near term, which is reflected in the Stable Outlook. The UK\u2019s public debt dynamics remain sensitive to shocks. The OBR\u2019s economic outlook remains similar to our baseline. The OBR revised up its 2014 growth forecast to 2.7% from 2.4%. We also recently revised up our 2014 forecast, to 2.5% from 2.3%, in light of a more balanced growth profile, especially the acceleration of business investment. The economic policy announcements made by the Chancellor on Wednesday do not materially alter our growth expectations. We remain cautious about further acceleration of growth. First, fiscal consolidation will continue over the coming years, as confirmed by the Chancellor yesterday. Second, consumption growth is likely to follow real disposable income changes over the longer run, as UK household indebtedness remains one of the highest among major advanced economies, constraining future falls in the savings rate. Our affirmation of the UK\u2019s \u2018AA+\u2019 ratings with a Stable Outlook on 18 December 2013 reflected the strengthening economic outlook and credible fiscal strategy. In Athens, hundreds of striking civil servants have marched through the capital to protest against the government\u2019s austerity measures. They are demonstrating against plans to lay-off thousands of public sector workers. The deadline for dismissed employees to be put into a special labour reserve and forced to survive on 75 per cent of their wage is tomorrow. Our correspondent Helena Smith is there, and reports that personnel from the unemployment agency OAED are among those protesting about the lay-offs. This photo shows a group carrying a barrier, reading: \u201cSuccess story with 1,500 jobless. And dismantlement of OAED with lay-offs of workers.\u201d It\u2019s a big day for protests in Athens. Doctors and nursing staff at state hospitals also took part in today\u2019s strike, while the Union of Secondary School Teachers (OLME) is holding a two-day walkout. And elsewhere in the capital, hundreds of pensioners gathered at the central Athens Kotzia Square, to march towards the Ministry of Health to demonstrate against changes to the public health sector. The main US stock indices are dropping a little in early trading, amid the uncertainty over the future path of US interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 29 points, or 0.2%, to 16193 points. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has predicted that yesterday\u2019s budget will be remembered when many others have been forgotten, as it gives its assessment of George Osborne\u2019s latest package of tax and spending plans. Our economics editor Larry Elliott is there. He reports that IFS director Paul Johnson told the assembled economics journalists that: This is a budget which will be remembered long after most of Osborne\u2019s other budgets have been forgotten, and it will be remembered for one of the biggest shake ups in the tax treatment of private pensions we have seen in a long time. Johnson says pension changes will give people freedom to manage and make choices over their own affairs but says there are \u201cgenuine\u201d uncertainties\u201d about the effect of the policy. It will make annuities more expensive for those who do want to buy them, he says. The IFS calculates that there will be 5.3 million higher rate taxpayers in 2015-16, against 3.3 m in 2010-11. Johnson also suggested the budget might not be as neutral as it looks. \u201cA set of definite and permanent tax cuts look to have been matched by more unspecified spending cuts, some changes in the timing of tax receipts, and our old friend tax avoidance measures.\u201d Johnson also warned that despite \u201cbold changes\u201don pensions, and some welcome changes to the taxation of savings, the budget \u201cleaves us with as little sense as we had before of quite how the very large public spending cuts still in the pipeline will actually be delivered.\u201d Reminder, Andy Sparrow is tracking all the post-budget action here: Budget 2014 - reaction and Osborne\u2019s Today programme interview: Politics live blog Britain\u2019s factories suffered a drop in export orders last month, according to the CBI\u2019s monthly industrial trends survey. 18% of firms said their export order books were above normal and 27% said they were below normal, giving a rounded balance of -10%. Total order books came in at +6, showing firms picked up more new orders at home. But output across sector grew at its slowest rate since October 2013, with a balance of +15. As economics Larry Elliott writes, it shows the challenge facing George Osborne to drive Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector. Fall in exports illustrates current trade problems for UK The CBI said activity remained \u201crobust\u201d, although there were signs that parts of the industry were cooling. Carl Williamson, manufacturing sector lead at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, agreed: \u201cThe CBI\u2019s research shows that manufacturers have had mixed fortunes in selling their goods abroad in recent months. The Chancellor\u2019s commitment to back export funding, increase the investment allowance and reduce energy bills will instil some confidence in UK factories to make capital investments and look beyond their domestic markets for growth opportunities.\u201d Analysts are lining up to predict the death of the annuities market today, after George Osborne announced that retirees will get much more control of their own pension pots. Shares in the insurance sector fell again (see above), as Barclays said the plan has \u201cthe potential to lead to the demise of the UK individual annuity market\u201d. It cut its price targets on all the main insurance firms. Barclays predicted that the individual annuity market will shrink from \u00a312bn per year to just \u00a34bn within the next 18 months, as savers put their money into other assets, or perhaps choose to spend it? Gordon Aitken, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, also lined up to bury the UK annuities life insurance business. We expect the individual annuity market to shrink by 90%. While annuities have not been mandatory for several years, there has never been the option to take the cash. We forecast that only 10% of customers will now buy an annuity, 10% will choose income drawdown while the remaining 80% will take cash. More here: Budget 2014: pensions shakeup could kill off annuity market, say analysts The WSJ\u2019s Katie Martin flags up more details of the gilt trader ban: For the first time ever, a bond trader has been fined and banned from the industry for manipulating the price of a UK government bond, or gilt. The Financial Conduct Authority said Mark Stevenson\u2019s conduct was \u201cparticularly egregious\u201d, after hitting him with a \u00a3662,700 penalty for trying to profit unfairly from the UK\u2019s quantitative easing programme (in which it bought gilts from commercial banks). Tracey McDermott, the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s (FCA) director of enforcement said: \u201cStevenson\u2019s abuse took advantage of a policy designed to boost the economy with no regard for the potential consequences for other market participants and, ultimately, for UK tax payers. He has paid a heavy price for his actions. Fair dealing is at the heart of market integrity. This case sends a clear message about how seriously the FCA views attempts to manipulate the market.\u201d This is the first enforcement action for attempted or actual manipulation of the gilt market. So what did he do?... Back in 2011, Stevenson build up a large holding in a particular gilt, anticipating that the Bank of England would buy it as part of QE. On October 10 the BoE confirmed his theory, at which point he \u201csignificantly\u201d increased his stake in a bid to drive up the gilt\u2019s price, meaning the BoE would pay him more for it. Other traders spotted him, though, alerting the Bank within minutes -- and after the gilt\u2019s price jumped the BoE took the \u201cunprecedented\u2019 step of abandoning its plans to buy it. Stevenson, who had 30 years experience in the industry, got a 30% discount for settling the case at an early stage. Full statement A landmark moment in UK retail - Next\u2019s profits have probably overtaken rival Marks &amp; Spencer for the first time ever, following last year\u2019s strong performance (see 9.07am). Here\u2019s the story. The FTSE 100 is now down almost 60 points, as traders ponder whether US interest rates are really going to be hiked as soon as March 2015, as the Fed chair implied last night (see opening post). IG\u2019s Chris Beauchamp comments: Sometimes all it comes down to is a single sentence. Janet Yellen will be pondering over her performance last night, after she spooked markets with talk of an earlier-than-expected rise in US interest rates. Although the Fed\u2019s statement implied there would be a \u2018considerable\u2019 gap between the end of QE and the first rate hike, Yellen\u2019s definition of considerable as \u2018around six months\u2019 wasn\u2019t as long as some had hoped. The upshot is that tightening jitters are abroad in markets once again; traders had hoped for a decent breathing space of around a year between the two events, but now June 2015 looks to be the starting point. Maybe Yellen is made of sterner stuff than her predecessor \u2013 it does look as if she is willing to stare down markets rather than being blindly carried along by events. Japanese manufacturer Hitachi has given the UK economy a fillip this morning, by moving its rail business to Britain from Japan. Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Breakfast that it was \u201cfantastic\u201d news: \u201cFor people like me who have grown up with news of manufacturing jobs leaving Britain, isn\u2019t it fantastic that manufacturing jobs are coming back to Britain.\u201d Business secretary Vince Cable called it \u201ca huge vote of confidence in Britain, its workers and its rail industry\u201d, although it\u2019s not clear how many extra jobs will be created. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that it\u2019s good news. Overnight, officials in Brussels finally hammered out the terms of a banking union deal -- and it looks like a win in extra time for Germany. After 16-hour talks that lasted until dawn, negotiators from the EU and European Parliament reached an agreement. It paves the way to create a single system to shut failing banks and a \u20ac55bn shared resolution fund. The FT says the deal \u201clargely bends to Germany\u2019s red lines\u201d, and was greeted with applause from bleary-eyed staffers. The compromise means it will take eight years to build up the rescue fund -- down from a decade, but still longer than some analysts would like: Reuters has more details: The details of the compromise are outlined in a draft agreement and were confirmed by people involved in the talks.Under the compromise reached, a fund made up by levies on banks will be built up over eight years, rather than 10 as originally envisaged. It will also be possible for countries to share 40 percent of the fund from its first year.The deal also envisages giving the European Central Bank the primary role in triggering the closure of a bank, making it harder for the new \u2018resolution\u2019 agency to do so and limiting the scope for country ministers to challenge such a move. High street chain Next continues to outperform rivals, posting an 11.8% jump in underlying profits for 2013 -- dubbing it \u201ca great year for NEXT\u201d. But the firm, run by Conservative donor Lord Simon Wolfson, remains rather edgy about the prospects for the UK economy, saying: The consumer economy has steadily improved over the course of the last year. This modest improvement looks set to continue. However, conditions are likely to remain far from buoyant and there are real risks to the sustainability of the current recovery. Next cautioned that recent sales growth has been driven by credit not higher wages. If anything has been learnt from the last ten years it is that credit cannot continue to grow faster than wages forever. Until we see significant increase in the supply side of the economy (profitable investment and improved productivity), we cannot bank on a return to sustained growth. In the corporate world, the CEO of luxury brand Mulberry has fallen on his sword (or perhaps his handbag). Bruno Guillon has resigned with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d, two months after the company issued its third profits warning under his leadership after being forced into forced into heavy price-cutting over Christmas. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: Godfrey Davis, the chairman who was previously the chief executive during a period of strong growth, will run the company as executive chairman until a successor is found. His focus is on finding a new CEO as well as a new creative director, after the highly regarded Emma Hill left last summer. Guillon joined the company in 2012 from Hermes and has come under fire for putting up prices to make the label more upmarket. That strategy backfired and its shares have halved to \u00a36.36 from \u00a313 over the last year. Over Christmas Mulberry was forced to slash its prices, prompting its third profit warning in 18 months. Mulberry chief executive steps down in wake of profits warning Andy Sparrow is up and running with full coverage of reaction to yesterday\u2019s budget, starting with the chancellor\u2019s appearance on the Today Programme this morning: And the infamous \u201cBeer and Bingo\u201d picture tweeted by Tory chairman Grant Shapps last night is getting plenty of attention: George Osborne\u2019s budget continues to reverberate around the City, particularly his radical shake-up of the pensions industry. Resolution, the life insurance group, is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 -- down 2.2%. It issued a statement this morning saying the changes are \u201cpositive\u201d for the retirement market, but warned that changing the annuity rules will have \u201cnegative implication for new business flows\u201d. And Ladbrokes shares have dropped another 3.5%, hit by the chancellor\u2019s decision to hike the levy on controversial fixed-odds gambling machines. Europe\u2019s stock markets are following Wall Street and Asia by falling in response to the prospect of a US rate hike in March 2015. The FTSE 100 is down 0.5%, or off 30 points at 6541 (I\u2019ll round up the big moves in a moment) The German DAX fell 0.7%, the French CAC lost 0.8%, while the Italian FTSE MIB and the Spanish IBEX are down 0.5%. Government bond prices are also dropping, which has pushed up the yield on UK 10-year debt to 2.76%, from 2.7% last night. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Investors are a little perturbed this morning, after the new chair of the Federal Reserve suggested last night that US interest rates could rise sooner than widely expected, next spring. In her first press conference since succeeding Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen caused a stir by indicating that the first hike in borrowing costs could come as early as March 2015. If you missed it -- the Fed tapered its bond-buying stimulus programme by another $10bn to $55bn/month, putting it on course to end the purchases by October. So far, so predictable. But then....Yellen was asked at her debut press conference how long the Fed might then wait until raising rates, and replied: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to define but, you know, it probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing. What the statement is saying is it depends what conditions are like.\u201d Eagle-eared traders homed in on the \u201csix months\u201d rather than the \u201cit depends\u201d, sending shares sliding on Wall Street and driving up the yield (interest rate) on US Treasuries. Asian markets have also been hit, with losses of 1% to 2% across the board. It\u2019s a curious situation -- as the Fed had otherwise seemed quite dovish last night. It cut its growth forecasts, and also dropped its 6.5% unemployment target in favour of a range of economic indicators (ala the Bank of England). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons Yellen threw \u201ca curveball\u201d, adding: Whether she intended to be taken so literally is open to debate but it was enough to prompt a sharp reversal, and as such we can expect to see a lower open in Europe this morning..... If Janet Yellen had intended to make an impression in her first meeting as Fed Chairwoman then she certainly succeeded yesterday, begging the question as to whether she intended to come across as hawkish as she did. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities, though, says Wall Street got what it deserved: Given the complacency that markets had been displaying in recent weeks, this can be said to be a long overdue shake-out, though one should note overstate the reaction. It\u2019s a reminder that Central Banks face quite a struggle extricating themselves from the hugely accommodative monetary policy they\u2019ve delivered to put the global economy back on its feet. As the FT put it: In a matter of seconds, the S&amp;P 500 shed about 1 per cent and yields on Treasury securities soared. If Ms Yellen did not already realise the awesome power of her every word as Fed chair, she does now. I suspect Professor Yellen she had a pretty good idea already.... Anyway, I\u2019ll be tracking all the key news through the day, and should also have half an eye on the reaction to yesterday\u2019s UK budget, although our politics liveblogger Andrew Sparrow will be focused on that.",

      "bodyText": "Back in 2008, when Marks &amp; Spencer reported pre-tax profits a shade over \u00a31bn, Next was announcing \u00a3498m. Going back a decade, when M&amp;S's profits hit their absolute peak of \u00a31.17bn in 1998, Next stood at just \u00a3184m. Yet Next's \u00a3695m this year should eclipse M&amp;S by about \u00a380m. It has been a mighty swing in fortunes. As you would expect, the divergence in share prices has been just as stark. M&amp;S's shares still stand below their level in 1998, those far-off days when internet access at home was a novelty. By contrast, Next shareholders have enjoyed a ninefold gain since then, not counting a steadily rising flow of dividends. How has it happened? Plainly Next has proved itself a better judge of mass-market fashion; the jibe that it sells \"school uniforms for the office\" is heard less often these days. Beyond that, there are probably four prime reasons. First, it's good for the corporate soul to have a near-death experience, as Next did in 1990. The day when the share price fell to 7p (it's \u00a367.30 now) is still remembered. A last-minute deal to sell its mail order business, Grattan, saved it from its creditors but it was obliged to make itself lean in a hurry. Second, chief executive Simon Wolfson, who joined his father at Next in 1991, runs the business on commendably straightforward financial lines. Sales are kept to a minimum. Shops that struggle to earn their keep are closed as soon as possible. The hurdle for capital payback on new stores is 24 months. Third, Next has had Next Directory, its catalogue business, since 1988, meaning it never faced the same agonies as M&amp;S and others in adapting to an online world. Next already had the warehouses and logistics skills in place. Directory, for the first time, contributed more in profits than the shops last year. Fourth, financial discipline extends to the use of surplus cash. M&amp;S vaingloriously splurged \u00a3600m on a share buyback at exactly the wrong moment in 2007-08, as mentioned here last week. Lord Wolfson, by contrast, prefers the steadier course of spending a little consistently on buybacks unless, as now, the shares are so high that special dividends make sounder economic sense. That's the advantage of having a boss whose personal fortune is tied up in the company, it might be said: Wolfson's stake is worth \u00a3100m. Can it last? There's a fair argument that Next is overpriced at current levels. Its core customer base of mortgaged 25-to-40 year-olds would be exposed to any rise in interest rates. \"Like John Lewis it has benefited from benign disposable income conditions for a long time now,\" comments Tony Shiret, analyst at Espirito Santo. Even Wolfson worries that last year's increase in consumer spending appears to have been driven by increased credit. On the other hand, Next was never expected to breeze through the 2008-09 recession as comfortably as it did. These days, the group also has a promising international online operation, which doubled sales to \u00a3100m last year. Compared with M&amp;S, Next's medium-term prospects still look superior: a couple of decades of outperformance counts as a pretty solid trend.",

      "bodyText": "BP has been sucked into the row over Russia's annexation of Crimea with calls for the delisting from the London Stock Exchange of Rosneft, the Moscow-based oil company in which the British group has a 20% holding. The demand came from Bruce Misamore, the former chief financial officer at Yukos \u2013 the oil company that was founded by former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and later absorbed into Rosneft while Khodorkovsky was in jail. As Barack Obama announced new sanctions targeting 20 officials and Russia's Bank Rossiya, Misamore said hurting Rosneft would be a good way of punishing Vladimir Putin for his actions in the Ukraine because it remains a largely state-owned energy group. The former Yukos executive, now retired, also suggested a travel ban on Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Russia's biggest oil producer. \"Why not do something that sends a strong commercial message: delisting Rosneft?\" asked Misamore on Thursday by phone from his home in Houston. The former oilman accepted that the LSE is run by a private company but said the Rosneft shares were only given permission to list in 2006 after a review by the government-sponsored City watchdog of the day, the Financial Services Authority. \"At that time there were not the decisions that there have been since by international arbitration panels which have ruled that some of the assets under the control of Rosneft were appropriated by Rosneft.\" Misamore said he witnessed at first hand how Yukos was forced into a sham bankruptcy orchestrated by Sechin and the Russian state with 70% of Rosneft's value being made up of former Yukos assets. The 2006 flotation of Rosneft in London was only undertaken by the Kremlin as a way of giving credibility to the enlarged business, said Misamore, and would have flopped without BP and Chinese support. BP took a small stake which was widened to a 20% holding in Rosneft last summer as part of a wider transaction under which the British company sold its half share in TNK-BP to Rosneft. BP declined to comment on the claims by Misamore. It was not possible to obtain a response from Rosneft but the Moscow-based company has in the past repeatedly denied that it unfairly obtained the Yukos assets, a position that was accepted by the FSA, since replaced by the Financial Conduct Authority. Sechin warned the west earlier this week that expanding sanctions over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region would only make the political situation deteriorate further, according to Reuters. \"Looking into expanding sanctions is something that will only make the conflict worse,\" Sechin, a longstanding ally of Putin, said during a panel discussion at a forum for investment between Japan and Russia.

      "bodyText": "Tax giveaways in the budget will be paid for by savings that are uncertain or will only occur decades from now, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned. The thinktank said the chancellor's reliance on a clampdown on tax avoidance and making savings from public sector pensions left projections for the public finances on an uncertain footing. In the first in-depth response to George Osborne's budget plans, the IFS said the government was only able to boost the personal tax threshold to \u00a310,500 and double relief for business investment after it forecast savings on Whitehall budgets and extra income from less tax avoidance. IFS boss Paul Johnson said the possibility that savings will fail to materialise showed that the budget might not be as neutral as it looked. \"A set of definite and permanent tax cuts look to have been matched by more unspecified spending cuts, some changes in the timing of tax receipts, and our old friend tax avoidance measures,\" he said. Johnson singled out plans to recoup a rise in the long-term costs of public service pensions from public sector employers, which he said worsens the public finances. \"The Treasury is, probably sensibly, 'charging' spending departments for these increased costs. Because it is taking money from them, it is saying it has extra money to spend. Hey presto. \"A worsening of long run public finances gives the Treasury extra money to spend now. That is not a sensible way to think about fiscal policy,\" he said. The government announced a broad de-regulation of the private pensions market that Johnson described as \"one of the biggest shakeups in the tax treatment of private pensions we have seen in a long time\". He said pension changes will give people freedom to manage and make choices over their own affairs, but added there were \"genuine uncertainties\" about the effect of the policy. He pointed out that a drop in demand for annuities, which are purchased to provide an income for life, will make them more expensive for those who do want to buy them. The Treasury expects newly wealthy pensioners to spend more of their savings in the early years of retirement, generating extra income for the exchequer. But Johnson said this was another uncertain area of the government's finances because the outcome of pensioner spending habits after de-regulation was unknown. It would also mean a loss for the Treasury in 20 years, when the number of new pensioners begins to decline and this group will have smaller incomes and lower spending. The IFS also pointed out that a 1% rise in the threshold for the 40p tax rate would drag more people into the higher rate bracket.

No wonder he could afford to doze off during the budget speech \u2013 he knows how effective the government's job in killing off renewables has been.</p> <p>These guys are being heavily lobbied by the traditional dirty and dangerous energy companies, who know full well the existential threat that renewables represent to them. They fail to realise that decentralised energy, where individuals or communities can produce their own energy, should be a natural Tory theme, not something to be feared.</p> <p>\u2022 Ashley Seager is a former Guardian economics correspondent and now director of solar energy firm <a href=\"http://sun4net.co.uk/front-page/\" title=\"\">Sun4net Ltd</a></p>", 
      "bodyText": "George Osborne quietly moved to kill off Britain's renewable revolution in Wednesday's budget as he stealthily enacted David Cameron's rumoured call to his cabinet to kill off the \"green crap\". With such stealth that it went almost entirely unspotted by environmentalists and journalists, who were busy focusing on his move to reduce fossil-fuel energy costs for big business, Osborne at a stroke abolished a key tax break that has attracted hundreds of millions of pounds of private money to help build Britain's green energy future. Tucked away in the budget's red book is an innocuous-looking line that Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) tax breaks will no longer be available for companies benefiting from the renewables obligation certificate (ROC) scheme or the renewable heat incentive (RHI). Of these, the ROC scheme is the big one. It underlies all the big wind, solar and other renewable technologies in the UK. The EIS tax breaks are available to investors who put money into all sorts of start-up companies. Until now that has also included firms building wind and solar farms. Now, after royal assent to the legislation in July, it will not be. One City fund manager on Wednesday predicted that many funds would simply have to hand back money to investors that they could not deploy into solar or wind projects by then. This will mean a big slowdown in the deployment of renewables in Britain, a crying shame because renewable investment and deployment have picked up sharply in recent years, after a decade of delay, as Britain finally seemed to be taking European renewable energy targets seriously. The point about the chopping and changing of support for renewables is that it creates uncertainty among investors, as countries such as Spain and Italy have found to their cost. They made retroactive changes to laws that left many investors high and dry, so they will not consider other investments there. Energy expert Dan Lewis of thinktank Future Energy Strategies puts it thus: \"No wonder some utility analysts are starting to call the UK energy sector \"uninvestable\".The paradox is that any simplification or benefit cut to Britain's deep, multi-layered and overly complex energy policy framework means that even a small adjustment has major yes or no investment implications right across the board.\" Before you decry \"subsidies\" to renewables, remember that much bigger subsidies have gone to North Sea oil and gas, coal and every other dirty fuel for decades, to say nothing of the ruinously expensive decision to build the new \u00a316bn Hinkley Point nuclear reactor which, if built, will burden future generations with expensive electricity until nearly 2060.

It is also much cheaper than nuclear, and safer. It soon will require no support \u2013 in many countries it has already reached \"grid parity\". This is what the economist Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, has completely failed to grasp. The systems of \"feed-in tariffs\" used by many countries, especially Germany, have built in big annual cuts, thus rapidly forcing down costs, something subsidies in the usual sense do not do. The company I run, for example, built its first solar project only four years ago, at a cost of close to \u20ac4,000 (\u00a33,300) per kilowatt installed. We now build at about \u20ac1,000 per kW. We can produce solar power in the UK at about 8p per kW hour \u2013 not far above the wholesale price of 5p and about half the level consumers pay for their power. In sunnier countries, that 8p price can be halved. You would think, especially given how the Russian crisis has exposed the danger of being reliant on unstable regions for our energy supplies, that politicians would have woken up to the fact that producing our own energy cuts our import bill, improves our trade balance and improves our energy independence. And yet the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, is running round tearing up planning approvals for wind and solar farms. No wonder he could afford to doze off during the budget speech \u2013 he knows how effective the government's job in killing off renewables has been. These guys are being heavily lobbied by the traditional dirty and dangerous energy companies, who know full well the existential threat that renewables represent to them. They fail to realise that decentralised energy, where individuals or communities can produce their own energy, should be a natural Tory theme, not something to be feared. \u2022 Ashley Seager is a former Guardian economics correspondent and now director of solar energy firm Sun4net Ltd",

      "bodyText": "Majestic Wine has surprised markets with a profits warning after a slowdown in consumer spending took the fizz out of its sales. The news sent its shares tumbling nearly 20%. Its chief executive, Steve Lewis, said: \"Christmas went pretty well, but immediately Christmas finished the consumer went very quiet indeed. It took us by surprise. February was much quieter than we expected, and that's what's dampened profits.\" The wine retailer said profit before tax would be flat for the year to the end of March. Despite a \"satisfactory\" Christmas with like-for-like sales growth of 2.8% and more customers splashing out on fine wines at more than \u00a320 a bottle, the company now expects like-for-like sales to be flat for the year as a whole. A tough 2015 lies ahead with subdued growth, Majestic also admitted. This is partly because it is pumping money into staff training, a new in-house web development team, a larger distribution centre in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire and a new head office in Watford. Majestic's buying director, Justin Apthorp, took advantage of the shares' plunge to spend \u00a3210,000 on 50,000 shares at 420p \u2013 giving him a total stake worth more than \u00a32.2m. Britain's big four supermarkets have also seen sales go into reverse in recent months as shoppers buy less or switch to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Sainsbury's became the latest group to report a slide in quarterly sales this week, ending nine years of consistent growth. Latest market data from Nielsen indicated Majestic has held on to its market share of 4.1%, having benefited from the recession when staying at home became the new going out. Lewis said the trend towards people entertaining at home was set to continue.Majestic, which opened its 200th store in November, is still aiming to have 330 shops, which will take up to eight years to achieve. Kate Calvert, an analyst at the house broker Investec, said: \"Despite a solid Christmas performance, Majestic could not buck a material market slowdown.\" She added: \"Growth should resume in 2016. This is a disappointing setback in what is a well-run and highly cash generative business.\"",
