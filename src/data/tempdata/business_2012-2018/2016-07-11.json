      "bodyText": "Twelve energy providers have pulled fixed-rate tariffs and replaced them with more expensive deals since 23 June, in signs that the pound\u2019s fall in the wake of the Brexit vote could push up household bills. Comparison website uSwitch found a dozen dual-fuel deals had been replaced since the referendum, with new offers costing up to \u00a3105 a year more for the average customer. It said wholesale energy costs had been rising for the past three months, and that the UK\u2019s position as a net importer of energy meant the falling pound was pushing up prices. British Gas, EDF and Scottish Power are among the firms to have repriced a fixed-rate gas and energy deal, although the biggest increase was by small provider Extra Energy, which replaced its Fresh Fixed Price October 2017 deal, typically costing \u00a3770 a year, with one fixed until August 2017 costing \u00a3875 for an average energy user. Tom Lyon, energy expert at uSwitch, said: \u201cFor nearly three years, wholesale gas and electricity prices have been falling, leading to cheaper and cheaper fixed-term deals for consumers. But with concerns about future UK energy supply, the impact of Brexit, and a weaker pound, we are starting to see some suppliers increase the price of their cheapest deals.\u201d Before the referendum, the government had claimed that a leave vote would push up prices for households. In March, the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, talked of an \u201celectric shock\u201d, with prices rising by \u00a3500m a year \u2013 or \u00a320 for every household. However, leave campaigners suggested a Brexit vote would allow the government to scrap VAT on fuel, bringing down costs. The new deals launched since the vote vary hugely in price. Utilita\u2019s Premium Energy deal has fallen in price, by \u00a331, but remains more expensive than some of those that have risen in cost, at \u00a31,136 a year for a typical energy user. British Gas\u2019s HomeEnergy Fixed offer is just \u00a325 a year more than the supplier\u2019s previous version, but costs \u00a31,044. The wholesale prices of gas and electricity fell during 2015 and winter saw providers cut their standard tariffs and launch low fixed-rate deals. There were still \u201csome very competitive\u201d deals on the market, said uSwitch, and the average price of the 10 cheapest deals on the market was \u00a399, or 11%, lower than in July 2015. It said that alongside one-year fixed-rate tariffs suppliers were also launching longer-term deals. First Utility, for example, has launched a three-year deal with a typical cost of \u00a3999 a year.",

      "bodyText": "Consumer spending grew at its slowest rate since the depths of the 2008-09 recession in the three months leading to the EU referendum, but retailers have blamed bad weather for the tough trading conditions. The monthly survey of high street and online sales from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG found that sales in the second quarter of 2016 were up 0.5% on the first quarter and 1.2% up on an annual basis. The BRC said this was the weakest performance since May 2009, when the economy was contracting during its longest and deepest postwar recessions. In June alone, total sales were 0.2% higher than in the same month last year, but were 0.5% lower on a like-for-like basis, which takes account of increased retail capacity over the past 12 months. David McCorquodale of KPMG said: \u201cAs consumer attention shifted indoors to escape autumnal downpours, furniture and home accessories bounced back in the month, with bigger-ticket items proving relatively resilient in the days immediately following the EU referendum. \u201cWith May sunshine a distant memory, however, summer wardrobes remained bare as sales of women\u2019s fashion and footwear plummeted following one of the wettest and dullest starts to a UK summer since records began.\u201d A separate report from the British Chambers of Commerce showed that companies were finding business conditions tough even before the result of the 23 June vote led to heightened anxiety about the outlook for the economy. In its quarterly report, the BCC reported that weakening domestic and overseas sales for the services sector and continuing poor performance by manufacturing would have required action from the government even had the UK voted to remain in the EU. Adam Marshall, BCC acting director general, said: \u201cEven before the EU referendum, both business confidence and economic growth were softening in many parts of the UK. Our latest survey results, captured just before the vote, suggest that many businesses have been operating in something of a holding pattern for some time.\u201d Marshall said it was too early to say what impact the leave vote had had on most firms, with only anecdotal evidence from those facing a more challenging environment and those seizing new opportunities. He added: \u201cAt a time of transition, all the businesses I speak to want Westminster to lead by example \u2013 by making bold decisions to progress key infrastructure and construction projects, by guaranteeing that EU workers can stay in British firms, and by seeking the best possible future terms of trade for the UK.\u201d Speaking before Theresa May was announced as the next prime minister, Marshall said: \u201cBusiness confidence would be buoyed by strong and clear leadership, both on the timeline for EU negotiations and on the big decisions unrelated to our future relationship with the EU.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high on Monday as stock markets across the world rebounded from recent losses caused by global uncertainty following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. The S&amp;P index closed up 7.26 points, or 0.3%, to 2,137.16 topping its previous record of 2,132.80 set on 21 May 2015. The Dow Jones industrial average and technology-heavy Nasdaq index also performed strongly as investors digested Friday\u2019s strong jobs data. The Dow Jones added 80 points, or 0.4%, to 18,226 points and close to its record high of 18,312.39. The Nasdaq briefly broke through the 5,000-mark for the first time in 2016, before ending the day up 0.6% to 4,989 points. Strong market performance in the US followed gains in markets across Europe and Asia. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index rose 1.4% to 6,682 points, and entered bull market territory \u2013 rising 20% since February\u2019s low. The UK index surged higher after Theresa May emerged as successor to Prime Minister David Cameron, removing concern over the months of possible uncertainty during a leadership contest. The FTSE 100 has now risen by 1,145 points since it hit a 2016 nadir of 5,537 on 11 February, when investors were anxious about the low oil price and threat of global recession. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX was up 1.7%, France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1.5% and Spain\u2019s IBEX 30 was up 1.5%. Analysts said Andrea Leadsom\u2019s withdrawal from a contest that was set to last for almost two months had helped remove some of the uncertainty that has been worrying investors since the UK decided to sever its 43-year membership of the EU, and before it the EEC. Connor Campbell of Spreadex, a spread betting firm, said: \u201cTheresa May is clearly the market\u2019s preferred choice for Britain\u2019s top job, as evidenced by the reaction that greeted Leadsom\u2019s stand-down statement. May\u2019s lack of interest in rushing to activate article 50 and her relatively less contentious relationship with the EU when compared with her (now long gone) rivals, as well as the general cheer at the mere fact of the UK once again having a PM, is arguably responsible for the rise from the FTSE and pound, both of which improved on their morning performances.\u201d The FTSE 100 is now higher than it was before the Brexit vote, although that in part reflects the fact that the index contains a large number of companies with high US dollar earnings, which will now be worth more in sterling terms due to the fall in the value of the pound. However, the FTSE 250 \u2013 which is viewed as more representative of UK business \u2013 is still below where it was before the close of trading on 23 June, when the city expected the remain side to win. The FTSE 250 was up 2% and is showing a gain of 11% since February\u2019s low point. On the currency markets, the pound briefly rose above $1.30 on the news that May now had no leadership challenger, but later fell back in anticipation of action from the Bank of England on interest rates. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at investment advisor Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe FTSE has been tipped into a bull market by the emergence of Theresa May as prime minister, though the whiff of some loose monetary policy coming from the Bank of England this Thursday probably helped the index over the line, too. The role played by the commodity behemoths should not be underestimated either, these stocks are now trading at much higher prices than in the depths of the market in February. \u201cOverall, the FTSE has proved resilient in the face of all the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, though that really is testament to the international makeup of the index, and the long-standing faith in central bankers to come to the rescue by turning on the printing presses. If Mark Carney fails to act on Thursday, the market will be disappointed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight (although I might pop back and add some front pages later). Here\u2019s our latest news story about the markets: Goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting! GW And finally tonight.... America\u2019s stock market has hit a new alltime high, as global markets continue their relief rally. The S&amp;P 500 index closed 7 points higher, or 0.33%, at 2,136.95 points. That narrowly breaches the previous high set in May 2015. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, reckons that traders are feeling more optimistic about the global economy (after last Friday\u2019s decent US employment report). Paulsen says: \u201cYou have Brexit and global stagnation, but underneath that we keep getting really good economic numbers and that is forcing the (stock) market to new highs.\u201d The tantalising scent of fresh stimulus packages in Britain and Japan soon also worked its usual magic, of course. So, record highs on Wall Street. The London stock market back in bull market territory (thanks to the weak pound) and even Europe shaking off its Brexit fears. Not a bad day, but also not a reason to think the Brexit crisis is over. This chart of the FTSE 250 index of smaller UK companies this year shows how it has scrambled back from the Brexit shock last month (red for down, green for up): Ken Odeluga, market analyst at trading firm City Index, says companies most focused on the UK got the biggest boost today from Theresa May\u2019s rise to the top. We believe \u2018pure-play\u2019 UK equities have rallied on relief that the more pragmatic, less conspicuously ideological and more experienced candidate has emerged as Britain\u2019s next Prime Minster, ahead of difficult and multi-faceted discussions with a wounded and potentially vengeful EU. Investors were pleased to focus on political developments, rather than the Bank of England\u2019s promises to cushion the impact of Brexit. As Odeluga puts it: We note markets shrugged off revolving doors in the Conservative leadership contest and Labour\u2019s failure to open a trapdoor under its own chief. It has taken the withdrawal of the last right-leaning Eurosceptic standing, Andrea Leadsom, to raise an unmistakably positive reaction in the City. There\u2019s real anticipation in the City tonight about whether the Bank of England will cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday. The BoE has already hinted that more stimulus will be needed this summer to help the economy. But given the inflationary impact of a weak pound, it may be reluctant to lower borrowing costs (and weaken sterling further). Kallum Pickering says the Bank could decide to leave its powder dry until August, when governor Mark Carney will present the new quarterly inflation report. He writes: We see a 60% chance that the nine member MPC votes to cut the bank rate, if so, probably by 25 basis points. However, there is a chance that the MPC holds for now, and instead opts to send a dovish signal that the bank will ease monetary policy three weeks later at the August Inflation Report when it is due to publish its revised economic forecasts. The pound is getting a late lift tonight, as Theresa May prepares to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister, on Wednesday afternoon. Sterling is hovering just below $1.30, up half a cent today. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, says: Markets will be hopeful that the prospect of Theresa May becoming Prime Minister will soon bring some clarity to the UK political landscape as well as a more conciliatory approach towards Europe. May has already insisted, though, that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, so she\u2019s not hinting at a referendum u-turn... European stock markets have also enjoyed a May-bounce. The STOXX Europe 600 .STOXX closed up 1.6% at 332.72, its highest close since June 23. However it is still 4% below its pre-referendum levels, due to concerns that Brexit will hurt the European economy. The news that Theresa May would replace David Cameron on Wednesday seemed to bring relief to European trading floors. Ankit Gheedia, equity and derivative strategist at BNP Paribas, reckoned that May was a safer pair of hands than Andrea Leadsom (who stepped down from the leadership race today) \u201cThe difference between Theresa May and her counterpart was that she has a disciplined approach and a proper strategy for Brexit. The alternative was uncertain. \u201cWe know she has experience, and is a bit more strategic, so the market is relieved on the back of that.\u201d (Thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Some late newsflashes from Brussels, where eurozone finance ministers have been meeting. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup, says the Brexit vote is hurting eurozone confidence: And European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has revealed that the EC is dialling down its growth forecasts for the UK and the eurozone next year: The global rally in shares today has sent America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index to a record high today: Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, believes the S&amp;P 500 will keep climbing: So, the S&amp;P 500 is rallying to fresh unchartered territories today. Where do we go from here? Well, the monthly chart suggests onwards and upwards. America\u2019s tech index has hit its highest level of the year: The FTSE 100 burst into Bull Market territory moments before Theresa May was crowned as the new leader of the Conservative Party. May will become prime minister on Wednesday, and investors have welcomed this sudden outbreak of certainty in UK politics. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says shares are also benefiting from expectations of an interest rate cut on Thursday. Here\u2019s his take: \u2018The Footsie has been tipped into a bull market by the emergence of Theresa May as Prime Minister, though the whiff of some loose monetary policy coming from the Bank of England this Thursday probably helped the index over the line too. The role played by the commodity behemoths should not be under-estimated either, these stocks are now trading at much higher prices than in the depths of the market in February. The Tories may be starting to get their house in order, but the stock market has hardly followed in the mould of the one-nation conservatism espoused by the party. There have been very divergent fortunes amongst the big blue chips, with some airlines, house builders and banks being left behind by the rest of the market. Here\u2019s the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 tonight: The FTSE 250 used to be the ugly duckling of the City, full of companies not big enough to make the Footsie 100. Now, though, it\u2019s blossomed into everyone\u2019s favourite stock market index (or so it feels, anyway). It\u2019s official! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is back in bull market territory. The blue-chip index of the largest firms listed on the London stock market has just closed 92 points higher tonight, at 6682, a gain of 1.4% today. That means the Footsie has risen by over 20% since 11 February, when global investors were fretting about China\u2019s slowing economy tipping the world into recession. That was a simpler time, before Brexit became the word on everyone\u2019s lips and British politics entered a period of remarkable upheaval (which ain\u2019t over yet, judging by events in the Labour party today). Mining firm Anglo American is the biggest gainer, closing 8.5% higher, followed by building supply firm Travis Perkins (up 7.8%). However, this does not mean that Britain\u2019s economy is suddenly rosy. Remember... Most of the FTSE 100 constituents are international companies, so they\u2019re not a good gauge of the UK economy The weak pound drives up their earnings (as the dollars, yen and euros they collect as profits are worth more in sterling terms). The value of these firms has been hit hard by the 10% slump in the value of the pound. The smaller FTSE 250 is still below its pre-referendum levels (despite jumping by over 2% today). Two surveys today have shown that investor confidence has been hit very hard by the Brexit vote (see Moody\u2019s warning here....and also Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s alarming survey here..). But still, investors will be relieved to see the index up, not down. Chris Beauchamp of IG explains that events in Westminster have boosted confidence in the City. UK politics continues to provide the most compelling TV viewing of the year so far, as Teresa May\u2019s last opponent abandons the field. The bounce in UK mid-caps is more than partly due to hopes that, with Remainer May as PM, talks with Europe may be smoother, while the disappearance of a summer leadership contest has helped clear road ahead for UK equities. Shares in many smaller UK companies are also strongly higher today. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why: The FTSE250 has also enjoyed a decent bounce, up nearly 3% hitting its highest levels since its plunge from its 23rd June peaks. This removal of one element from the mix of political uncertainty is likely to bring into sharp relief the next stage of the \u201cBrexit\u201d process and in particular the timings of when Article 50 is likely to get triggered. However, the FTSE 250 index is still below its pre-referendum levels, unlike the FTSE 100 (which gets that weak pound boost) Here\u2019s another sign that the Brexit vote has hurt the European economy. A new survey by Moody\u2019s Analytics reports that: Global business confidence has slumped in the wake of the Brexit vote in late June. European sentiment continues to sink and is now consistent with an economy that is on the verge of stalling out. More than one-fourth of the survey responses by European businesses are negative, the highest that has been on a consistent basis since the European debt crisis. Encouragingly, sentiment in the United States and Pacific Rim haven\u2019t been materially impacted by British exit vote. Weak business confidence often leads to lower investment, and less new hiring, so it could be quite damaging.... City traders are pleased that at least some of the political uncertainty sitting over Britain like a heavy fog is lifting. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains: Theresa May is clearly the market\u2019s preferred choice for Britain\u2019s top job, as evidenced by the reaction that greeted Leadsom\u2019s stand-down statement. May\u2019s lack of interest in rushing to activate Article 50 and her relatively less contentious relationship with the EU when compared to her (now long gone) rivals, as well as the general cheer at the mere fact of the UK once again having a PM, is arguably responsible for the rise from the FTSE and pound, both of which improved on their morning performances. The former jumped by nearly 1%, sitting firmly at 2016 (and indeed 11 month) highs; the latter, meanwhile, managed to climb away from its earlier lows, even if the currency remains haunted by the spectre of a Bank of England rate cut on Thursday. The chancellor is watching events unfold from across the Atlantic, and tweets: The FT reckons that foreign secretary Phillip Hammond could become finance minister in Theresa May\u2019s government.... London shares have extended their gains this afternoon, as Wall Street opened strongly on the back of Friday\u2019s forecast-busting non-farm payrolls. The S&amp;P 500 set a record high, while the Dow was up 92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,240 within the first half hour of trading, with banks leading the charge. \u201cReaching a new high may see money moving from the sidelines of safety trades, like Treasury bonds and gold, back into the equity markets,\u201d Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, told Reuters. \u201cThe emphasis of the markets will be how fast and how long the S&amp;P remains above the record today.\u201d By 3pm, the FTSE 100 had extended its gains to just over 70 points, or 1.1%, at 6664 points. A quick recap: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is poised to smash into bull market territory, after being boosted by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit referendum. It has jumped 1% today, meaning it is 20% higher than in February. The smaller FTSE 250 index is also romping higher, on expectations that UK interest rates will be cut to fresh record lows on Thursday. But the pound has been volatile today, as Theresa May moved to the brink of becoming UK prime minister. May has called for a new clampdown on executive pay and predatory capitalism, getting a \u2018better late than never\u2019 welcome from the unions. Film studio Pinewood has declared that it should benefit from the weak pound, as Britain will become a more attractive place to make films. Chancellor George Osborne has landed in America, in an attempt to reassure US investors that they should still invest in Britain. In non-Brexit news: Shares in Nintendo have surged, on the back of the Pokemon Go craze Burberry has ended Chris Bailey\u2019s tenure as CEO, and hired a senior fashion chief Some non-Brexit news.... Fashion chain Burberry have just announced a new chief executive. It\u2019s Marco Gobbetti, currently CEO of fashion chain C\u00e9line. This means that Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s creative mastermind, is moving to become president, after two years as CEO. He\u2019ll be chief creative officer too - but effectively he\u2019s losing day-to-day control of the company It\u2019s not a great surprise; City investors were concerned that Bailey couldn\u2019t do both jobs, especially as trading has deteriorated in recent months. Burberry shares have jumped 6%... Chancellor George Osborne has now landed New York, for his mission to reassure America that Britain is still open for business despite the Brexit vote (as we covered earlier). He\u2019ll be on US TV shortly, in an early-morning treat for America..... Enjoy the pound\u2019s rally while it lasts, says Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex. He predicts that sterling will soon weaken again, possibly later this week when the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision \u201cSterling pushed higher today as pro-Brexit candidate Angela Leadsom pulled out of the contest to be the next prime minister. The pound pushed up through $1.30 against the US dollar on the news, but the rally is likely to be short-lived, as Mark Carney is expected to cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% this Thursday. \u201cShould he decide to cut rates to zero, we will likely see another multi-year low for sterling as we head towards a probable recession in the second half of the year.\u201d Almost every company on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK companies has risen today. Property companies are leading the rally, driving the FTSE 250 up by 2.7% right now. Investment group St. Modwen Properties has jumped 9%, and British housebuilding company Crest Nicholson are up 7.6%. Earlier today, Theresa May identified housebuilding as a key priority if she became prime minister (which now seems an imminent prospect). This graph shows how shares in big companies on the FTSE 100 (red line) have roared back since the referendum, thanks to the slump in the pound. Smaller UK companies are shown on the blue line (the FTSE 250), and Germany\u2019s DAX is the pink line. In exquisite timing, confidence among small investors has hit its lowest level since the heights of the eurozone crisis in 2012 - just as shares keep rallying. Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial services firms, reports that its Investor Confidence Index has suffered its sharpest monthly fall in 5 years. The survey of retail investors took place on 30 June, a week after the EU referendum result, and asked them to give their view of the UK stock market over the next three years. The index fell from 92 points in May to 67 in June; the biggest one month percentage fall since June 2011. The index now stands at a four year low - in May 2012 it stood at a level of 61, as Greece looked like it might be on the brink of leaving the eurozone. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says confidence appears to have \u201ccollapsed\u201d after the Brexit vote, among investors, consumers and businesses. The dwindling faith in the UK\u2019s future financial prospects has the potential to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, if companies and individuals start to assume a bunker mentality, and delay or cancel spending and investment. Investors are naturally twitchy about what Brexit means for the future of the stock market in the coming months and years. However continued low interest rates will remain supportive of shares, not least because there is really nowhere else for investors to go for income. Commercial property is one other option, though we have seen problems that can arise for investors in that market over the last week or so. The pound just put its nose back over the $1.30 mark, on the prospect of Theresa May becoming Britain\u2019s next PM sooner than expected. Britain\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index is smashing into Bull Market territory. The Footsie has jumped by 60 points to 6650, a new 11-month high, as Andrea Leadsom confirms that she is withdrawing from the Tory party leadership battle. Crucially, more than 20% above the 5,537 level hit in mid-February, when markets had been driven down by fears over the global economy. So if it closes there tonight, the Footsie will be in bull market territory. Mining stocks are leading today\u2019s rally, with Anglo American up 5%. UK building companies are also sharply higher; Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon have both gained 6%. The usual provisos apply; the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling (which is worth 10% less than last month). And it is dominated by international firms, not UK ones. The smaller FTSE 250 is still 5% below its pre-referendum levels, following a 2% jump this morning. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says investors are expecting the Bank of England to ease monetary policy on Thursday. Last Friday\u2019s upbeat US employment report is also cheering the City. Mahony adds: Amid a sea of green in the FTSE, it is interesting to see the housebuilders and banks gaining heavily, in what has become a proxy for risk appetite across financial markets. There is no doubt that the housebuilders and banks are currently a risky play, given the severity of their recent devaluation. However, in days when the market is in the green, the performance of these sectors will reflect how far reaching that optimism really is. The pound is suddenly jumping, clawing back most of today\u2019s losses, as rumours sweep Westminster that Andrea Leadsom is about to quit the Tory leadership race. Caution is needed, as it\u2019s only at a three-hour high.... Maybe traders aren\u2019t sure what happens next. And they\u2019re not alone... Our politics liveblog have full coverage of Theresa May\u2019s speech: Theresa May, one of the two candidates to replace Cameron, is preaching a progressive message this morning. May is arguing that ordinary families need more help. Wages have only grown slowly, energy bills have rocketed, and monetary stimulus measures have helped those on the property ladder - but not those who can\u2019t [who wrote this speech, Ed Miliband?]. May is also promising a crackdown on executive pay, giving workers more power, and improving UK productivity. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says it\u2019s better late than never.... \u201cThe TUC has long argued for workers to be given seats on company boards and remuneration committees. Workers have a clear interest in the long-term success of their companies and deserve a bigger say. \u201cThis move would inject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms, as well as putting the brakes on the multi-million pay and bonus packages which have done so much to damage the reputation of corporate Britain. \u201cIf politicians are serious about making chief executives more accountable this is a common sense approach. I stand ready to meet Theresa May to discuss these proposals.\u201d David Cameron also told the Farnborough Airshow that it is in Britain\u2019s \u201cfundamental interest\u201d to remain very close to the EU. Prime minister David Cameron is urging Britain to use the Brexit vote to tackle the country\u2019s productivity problems. Speaking at the Farnborough Air Show, Cameron calls for a \u201cmassive national effort\u201d to build a strong dynamic economy.. He points out that output per hour in the UK is lower than US, Germany or France, and cites high speed rail, superfast broadband and housebuilding as key infrastructure areas to work on. Now we are leaving the EU, Britain must rapidly explore all possible supply-side reforms, such as tax reforms, Cameron continues. And he\u2019s singling out pharmaceuticals, life sciences, technology, and fintech as important areas where Britain can lead the world. One problem, of course... Cameron won\u2019t be in power in two month\u2019s time. So for all his talk about the \u201cground work\u201d being underway, his successor must actually do the heavy lifting.... The AFP newswire have a good take on George Osborne\u2019s trip to America: British finance minister George Osborne was Monday holding talks with Wall Street investors, kicking-off a series of visits to leading international financial centres to build post-Brexit economic ties. \u201cVital work will begin today on building stronger economic and trade relationships with the UK\u2019s closest trading partners,\u201d the Treasury said in a statement as Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne headed to New York to meet investors on Wall Street. And Osborne will next week lead a trade mission to Singapore and China after Britain last month voted in a referendum to exit the European Union, the Treasury added. \u201cWhile Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges, we now have to do everything we can to make the UK the most attractive place in the world to do business,\u201d Osborne, who voted for Britain to remain in the EU, said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue to be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever.\u201d They also point out that the UK is considering easing the tax bill on companies: Following the Brexit vote, Osborne is planning to slash corporation tax over fears of an exodus by big business. According to the Treasury, he could extend planned cuts to Britain\u2019s levy on company profits to under 15 percent. Prior to the vote, the tax rate on corporate profits was already set to be cut from 20 percent to 19 next year and to 17 percent in 2020. Britain\u2019s business minister Sajid Javid on Friday held post-Brexit talks on the country\u2019s future trade relationship with India, the first of many such discussions he plans with world powers. Britain is left with the huge task of forging fresh trade agreements with individual countries as a non-bloc member. Javid has said that the British government, which will soon be led by a new prime minister after the post-Brexit vote resignation of David Cameron, plans to have up to 300 specialist staff by the end of the year to aid in the new trade negotiations. The jump in the FTSE 100 doesn\u2019t tell us much about the UK economy, except that it may trigger bonus payments to chief executives.... Japanese bank Nomura are predicting that sterling could hit a new 31-year low by Friday: The pound may be losing its shock value... Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, confirms that the prospect of fresh stimulus from the Bank of England is driving shares up (and the pound down) The prospect of looser monetary will help equities but it\u2019s another nail in sterling\u2019s coffin. Homebuilders, which rallied on Friday after a turbulent week, are on the up again today. Miners are also rising again as investors price in an interest rate cut. Encouragingly for UK firms, the FTSE 250 is trading up 1%, beating the FTSE 100\u2019s 0.5% rise. European markets are up across the board as they react to Friday\u2019s upbeat jobs report from the US, which spurred the Dow to a 1% gain and saw the S&amp;P 500 close within one point of its record high. Asian stock markets have now closed at one-month highs. Traders are betting that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe can now implement new structural reforms to make the economy more productive, having won a key election victory over the weekend. British film studio Pinewood has emerged as one of the winners from the Brexit vote. The company told shareholders this morning that the 10% tumble in the pound since the referendum was good for business. It said: The result of the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU is now known. In the context of our business, the decline in the \u00a3sterling exchange rate is undoubtedly positive for our international customers. We will continue to monitor sentiment around the issue going forward. Pinewood has played a vital role in the UK film industry for decades. Everything from the Carry On and Pink Panther series to James Bond and the later Harry Potter films were produced at its sites. Maybe they\u2019ll make Brexit, The Movie one day too (rating PG). There were astonishing scenes on the Tokyo stock market today, as shares in console maker Nintendo surged by 25% following the runaway success of the new Pok\u00e9mon Go game. It\u2019s particularly notable, as Nintento is only indirectly linked to the game (which has sent users racing around, squinting into their phones, looking for the monsters) Sterling is weakening this morning, down over half a percent against the US dollar at $1.288. That underlines how the City expect a UK interest rate cut this week. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit is confident that the Bank of England will do something this week: City investors are expecting the Bank of England to cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday, to fight the dangers of recession following the Brexit vote. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says this is helping to drive shares up in London today: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is starting the week with some solid gains as Friday\u2019s upbeat unemployment data from the US and hopes of further stimulus measures out of Japan continue to buoy sentiment. There\u2019s also the spectre of a rate cut and further QE being unveiled at the Bank of England later in the week which is again delivering some cause for cheer and gains are eye-catchingly broad-based as a result. European stock markets have jumped in early trading, as last Friday\u2019s knockout US jobs report continues to cheer the City. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 45 points, or +0.7%, at 6636. That\u2019s the highest level since mid-August. Mining companies, banks, and UK housebuilders are the top risers, suggesting trader are less worried about the global economy and a UK recession. The FTSE 100 isn\u2019t the best gauge of the UK economy, as it is full of international companies whose overseas earnings are boosted by the weak pound. And also... the index is valued in sterling (so it\u2019s not at an 11-month high in US dollar terms). Encouragingly, the FTSE 250 index is up 0.7% this morning too. It contains more UK companies than the blue-chip FTSE 100. Top risers include retail chain Sports Direct and bank Virgin Money. Other European markets are also in the green: George Osborne may get a rough ride as he tries to woo America\u2019s top politicians and financiers this week: Bloomberg\u2019s reckons he faces a \u2018tall order\u2019 to persuade the US that all is well in the UK: He\u2019ll be mounting a public relations exercise at a time when the pound has slumped to a 31-year low against the U.S. dollar and real-estate funds are beingfrozen to avoid fire sales. Further undermining sentiment in the country is the two-month wait to discover the identity of the next prime minister, and discord gripping the opposition Labour Party. There\u2019s also no guarantee that Osborne will have high office once his close ally, David Cameron, has been replaced by either Theresa May or Andrea Leadsom. UK chancellor George Osborne is urging international investors not to give up on Britain, as the fallout from the EU referendum continues to hit the global economy. Osborne is flying to New York today, to meet with top Wall Street bankers. And his message is that Britain is not \u201cquitting the world\u201d, even though it has voted to leave the European Union. He has set the scene with an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal this morning, arguing that Britain will still play a key role on the world stage. Quitting the EU (something Osborne campaigned in vain against) must mean closer links with the rest of the world, starting with America. He writes: \u200eThe question now is not what Britain is leaving; it is what Britain will become. There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place. Similar forces are at work in other Western nations. We must not be afraid to confront them head-on. I am determined that \u2014 on the contrary \u2014 we now set out to build a more outward-looking, global-facing Britain, with stronger links with its friends and allies around the world. That must start with a closer economic relationship with North America. President Obama had warned that Britain would be at the \u2018back of the queue\u2019 for a trade deal. Osborne, though, hopes we can squeeze our way to the front. For first time in 40 years, the U.K. will be setting its own trade terms. So we should begin the conversation now with the U.S., and with the members of the North American Free Trade Agreement, about how we can deliver even closer economic ties. I have spoken to House Speaker Paul Ryan several times in the past two weeks about a stronger trading relationship\u2014and this week I will welcome Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to London to see what more we can do together. It is now in the overwhelming interest of both countries to do so. We are each other\u2019s largest investors, with almost $1 trillion invested in each other\u2019s economies. U.S. investment in the U.K. is around 10 times U.S. investment in China; British investment in the U.S. is around 50 times Chinese investment in the U.S. And that \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the US needs strengthening: Our economic trade ties with North America must now become stronger. My message is simple: Britain may be leaving the EU, but we are not withdrawing from the world. Britain will be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever. Here\u2019s the full piece: WSJ: Britain Is Open for Business Osborne\u2019s mission makes sense; this would be an awful time for US companies to pull investment out of the UK. But he\u2019d better expect some tough questions about Britain\u2019s plans for Brexit, the Tory leadership battle, and the prospects for the pound.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. At first glance, all looks calm this morning. Asia\u2019s stock markets have hit a one-month high overnight after Japan\u2019s prime minister romped to election victory, potentially paving the way for constitutional changes and perhaps more stimulus measures. Investors are still feeling a warm glow after last Friday\u2019s US employment report, which showed many more jobs were created last month than expected. But beneath the surface, nasty things are lurking. The Brexit vote continues to dominate the UK, although we could be in limbo until Conservative Party members have appointed our next prime minister. And worries are mounting about Italy\u2019s banks, after Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s chief economist predicted that the sector may need a \u20ac150bn bailout. David Folkerts-Landau told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that: \u201cEurope is extremely sick and must start dealing with its problems extremely quickly, or else there may be an accident. I\u2019m no doomsday prophet, I am a realist.\u201d Also coming up today.... UK chancellor George Osborne is meeting with US financial chiefs on Wall Street Eurozone finance ministers will hold a eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon It\u2019s the Farnborough Airshow We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Quitting the EU (<em>something Osborne campaigned in vain against</em>) must mean closer links with the rest of the world, starting with America.</p> <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u200eThe question now is not what Britain is leaving; it is what Britain will become. There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place. Similar forces are at work in other Western nations.</p> <p>We must not be afraid to confront them head-on. I am determined that \u2014 on the contrary \u2014 we now set out to build a more outward-looking, global-facing Britain, with stronger links with its friends and allies around the world. That must start with a closer economic relationship with North America.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>President Obama had warned that Britain would be at the \u2018back of the queue\u2019 for a trade deal. Osborne, though, hopes we can squeeze our way to the front.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For first time in 40 years, the U.K. will be setting its own trade terms. So we should begin the conversation now with the U.S., and with the members of the North American Free Trade Agreement, about how we can deliver even closer economic ties.</p> <p>I have spoken to House Speaker <a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/R/Paul-Ryan/6420\">Paul Ryan</a> several times in the past two weeks about a stronger trading relationship\u2014and this week I will welcome Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to London to see what more we can do together.</p> <p>It is now in the overwhelming interest of both countries to do so. We are each other\u2019s largest investors, with almost $1 trillion invested in each other\u2019s economies. U.S. investment in the U.K. is around 10 times U.S. investment in China; British investment in the U.S. is around 50 times Chinese investment in the U.S.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And that \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the US needs strengthening:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our economic trade ties with North America must now become stronger.

On Monday, a congressional report published letters and emails from Osborne and Financial Services Authority (FSA) officials to their US counterparts warning that launching criminal action against HSBC in 2012 could have sparked a \u201cfinancial calamity\u201d. The House financial services committee report said the UK interventions \u201cplayed a significant role in ultimately persuading the DoJ [Department of Justice] not to prosecute HSBC\u201d. Instead of pursuing a prosecution, the bank agreed to pay a record $1.92bn (\u00a31.4bn) fine. The report revealed that Osborne wrote to Ben Bernanke, who was then the Federal Reserve chairman, and Timothy Geithner, the then treasury secretary, to warn that prosecuting a \u201csystemically important financial institution\u201d like HSBC \u201ccould lead to [financial] contagion\u201d and pose \u201cvery serious implications for financial and economic stability, particularly in Europe and Asia\u201d. The report said the FSA was \u201cproblematic\u201d, \u201cweighed in very strongly\u201d and caused a \u201cfirestorm\u201d, which led the then attorney general, Eric Holder, to overrule the advice of his own prosecutors and not pursue criminal action. \u201cFSA has been on the phone for the criminal discussions,\u201d officials wrote in emails released in the House report. \u201cThat\u2019s what has caused the latest firestorm. The contents of that discussion are included in the Chancellor\u2019s letter.\u201d If HSBC had been found guilty of the potential charges, the US government would have been required to review and possibly revoke its charter to do business in the US. The FSA repeatedly warned that even the threat of possible charter withdrawal could have caused a fresh global financial crisis. The House report said Holder \u201cmisled\u201d Congress about the justice department\u2019s reasoning for declining to prosecute. It said the department had enough evidence to pursue criminal charges against HSBC and pointed out that the bank had already admitted to the US government that it broke money laundering rules. The report said: \u201cRather than lacking adequate evidence to prove HSBC\u2019s criminal conduct, internal treasury documents show that DoJ leadership declined to pursue [its legal team\u2019s] recommendation to prosecute HSBC because senior DoJ leaders were concerned that prosecuting the bank \u2018could result in a global financial disaster\u2019\u2013 as the FSA repeatedly warned.\u201d The 2012 settlement detailed how Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa drug cartel and Colombia\u2019s Norte del Valle cartel laundered $881m through HSBC and a Mexican unit. In some cases, Mexican branches had widened tellers\u2019 windows to allow big boxes of cash to be pushed across the counters. HSBC also violated US sanctions by working with customers in Iran, Libya, Sudan, Burma and Cuba. HSBC, the justice department and the US treasury declined to comment on the report.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 index burst into bull market territory after Theresa May emerged as successor to David Cameron, providing a further boost to surging stocks on both sides of the Atlantic. Within minutes of Andrea Leadsom announcing that she was leaving the field clear for May to become leader, the index of Britain\u2019s biggest listed companies rose to the point where it had gained more than 20% since February\u2019s low \u2013 the technical definition of a bull market. The FTSE100 has now risen by 1,145 points since it hit a 2016 nadir of 5537 on 11 February, when investors were anxious about the low oil price and threat of global recession. Share prices had already been supported by growing speculation that the Bank of England is ready to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% on Thursday as a confidence-building measure at the first meeting of its nine-strong monetary policy committee since the Brexit result. London\u2019s rise was part of a worldwide uplift in share prices that saw Wall Street\u2019s S&amp;P500 hit a new record and the technology-heavy Nasdaq index break through the 5000-mark for the first time in 2016 as US investors digested Friday\u2019s strong jobs data. Analysts said Leadsom\u2019s withdrawal from a contest that was set to last for almost two months had helped remove some of the uncertainty that has been worrying investors since the UK decided to sever its 43-year membership of the EU, and before it the EEC. Connor Campbell of Spreadex, a spread betting firm, said: \u201cTheresa May is clearly the market\u2019s preferred choice for Britain\u2019s top job, as evidenced by the reaction that greeted Leadsom\u2019s stand-down statement. May\u2019s lack of interest in rushing to activate article 50 and her relatively less contentious relationship with the EU when compared with her (now long gone) rivals, as well as the general cheer at the mere fact of the UK once again having a PM, is arguably responsible for the rise from the FTSE and pound, both of which improved on their morning performances.\u201d The FTSE 100 is now higher than it was before the Brexit vote, although that in part reflects the fact that the index contains a large number of companies with high US dollar earnings, which will now be worth more in sterling terms due to the fall in the value of the pound. The FTSE 100 ended the day 92 points higher at 6682, with only seven firms seeing their share prices fall. Mining firm Anglo American was the biggest gainer, closing 8.5% higher, followed by building supply firm Travis Perkins, which rose 7.8%. But the FTSE 250 \u2013 which is viewed as more representative of UK business \u2013 is still below where it was before the close of trading on 23 June, when the City expected the remain side to win. The FTSE 250 was up 2% and is showing a gain of 11% since February\u2019s low point. On the currency markets, the pound briefly rose above $1.30 on the news that May now had no leadership challenger, but later fell back in anticipation of action from the Bank of England on interest rates. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at investment advisor Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe Footsie has been tipped into a bull market by the emergence of Theresa May as prime minister, though the whiff of some loose monetary policy coming from the Bank of England this Thursday probably helped the index over the line, too. The role played by the commodity behemoths should not be underestimated either, these stocks are now trading at much higher prices than in the depths of the market in February. \u201cOverall, the Footsie has proved resilient in the face of all the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, though that really is testament to the international makeup of the index, and the long-standing faith in central bankers to come to the rescue by turning on the printing presses. If Mark Carney fails to act on Thursday, the market will be disappointed.\u201d Chris Beauchamp of IG, a spread betting firm, said events in Westminster had boosted confidence in the City. \u201cUK politics continues to provide the most compelling TV viewing of the year so far, as Theresa May\u2019s last opponent abandons the field. \u201cThe bounce in UK mid-caps is more than partly due to hopes that, with remainer May as PM, talks with Europe may be smoother, while the disappearance of a summer leadership contest has helped clear the road ahead for UK equities.\u201d",

May\u2019s lack of interest in rushing to activate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jun/29/what-is-article-50-brexit-video-explainer\">article 50</a> and her relatively less contentious relationship with the EU when compared with her (now long gone) rivals, as well as the general cheer at the mere fact of the UK once again having a PM, is arguably responsible for the rise from the FTSE and pound, both of which improved on their morning performances.\u201d</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is now higher than it was before the Brexit vote, although that in part reflects the fact that the index contains a large number of companies with high US dollar earnings, which will now be worth more in sterling terms due to the fall in the value of the pound.<br></p> <p>The FTSE 100 ended the day 92 points higher at 6682, with only seven firms seeing their share prices fall. Mining firm Anglo American was the biggest gainer, closing 8.5% higher, followed by building supply firm Travis Perkins, which rose 7.8%.</p> <p>But the FTSE 250 \u2013 which is viewed as more representative of UK business \u2013 is still below where it was before the close of trading on 23 June, when the City expected the remain side to win. The FTSE 250 was up 2% and is showing a gain of 11% since February\u2019s low point.<br></p> <p>On the currency markets, the pound briefly rose above $1.30 on the news that May now had no leadership challenger, but later fell back in anticipation of action from the Bank of England on interest rates.</p> <p>Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at investment advisor Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe Footsie has been tipped into a bull market by the emergence of Theresa May as prime minister, though the whiff of some loose monetary policy coming from the Bank of England this Thursday probably helped the index over the line, too. The role played by the commodity behemoths should not be underestimated either, these stocks are now trading at much higher prices than in the depths of the market in February.</p> <p>\u201cOverall, the Footsie has proved resilient in the face of all the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, though that really is testament to the international makeup of the index, and the long-standing faith in central bankers to come to the rescue by turning on the printing presses. If Mark Carney fails to act on Thursday, the market will be disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Beauchamp of IG, a spread betting firm, said events in Westminster had boosted confidence in the City.<br></p> <p>\u201cUK politics continues to provide the most compelling TV viewing of the year so far, as Theresa May\u2019s last opponent abandons the field.<em><br></em></p> <p>\u201cThe bounce in UK mid-caps is more than partly due to hopes that, with remainer May as PM, talks with Europe may be smoother, while the disappearance of a summer leadership contest has helped clear the road ahead for UK equities.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "Theresa May's plans to curb boardroom excess receive mixed reaction", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s new proposals to crack down on boardroom excess and rebuild trust between corporate Britain and voters have received a mixed reaction from business leaders. The moves, announced by the incoming prime minister just minutes before her rival, Andrea Leadsom, pulled out of the leadership contest, include allowing employee and consumer representatives to sit on company boards, and making shareholder votes on executive pay legally binding. \u201cIt is not anti-business to suggest that big business needs to change,\u201d she said. However, Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the Confederation of British Industry, gave May\u2019s plans a lukewarm response on behalf of the big business lobby. He said: \u201cChanges to pay reporting rules that have already taken place, including a binding shareholder vote on executive pay policies, have struck a good balance ... To ensure the most effective proposals are considered, it\u2019s important that issues \u2013 such as putting employees on boards, whether they would need to sit on the full board, and how they would use their voting rights \u2013 are discussed between the government and business.\u201d A leading figure in the retail and consumer industry, who did not want to be named, added: \u201cOn what basis can a prime minister, who has no popular acclamation either through party members or a general election, pursue policies unconnected to the manifesto on which her party was elected? How contractually will binding votes on pay work? Look at what happened with employee representatives at the Co-op.\u201d Another said: \u201cLook, she gave a speech in the morning that was a campaign speech, and when she sat down she was prime minister. Bloody hell.\u201d Others, who have personal experience of boardroom employee representatives, warned of potential pitfalls. Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of engineering multinational Siemens and whose supervisory board consists of 50% employee representatives, said: \u201cIn Germany we\u2019ve seen companies where workers\u2019 representatives thought they co-managed the company \u2013 that obviously is a bit too much ... You need to get used to it but if it\u2019s being practised well it has its benefits. \u201cA board member needs to act in the best interests of [his or her] company no matter which region they are from. So if you have workers\u2019 representatives that are hypothetically from the UK, they also need to act in the best interests of the company if [the issue] is about job cuts in the UK and creating new jobs in China because demand has shifted. This typically puts quite a strain on the workers\u2019 representatives.\u201d May\u2019s speech on Monday echoed several corporate responsibility themes championed by the former Labour leader Ed Miliband during the 2015 election campaign and came after a EU referendum result that many viewed as a protest over inequality in the UK. The issue has been raised in some surprising parts of the business world, with Bank of America and the international investment firm Pimco last month warning their clients that the gulf between rich and poor could spark a further anti-establishment backlash. Sir Mike Rake, the chairman of BT and Worldpay, hinted that the attitude of business leaders might have changed since last year\u2019s general election. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me 18 months ago I would have said business leaders were not at all receptive but there is now a huge awareness among people I speak to, who are mainly in the FTSE 100, that we need to do something about this gap,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was shown in stereophonic sound in the referendum that there is a lack of trust in the establishment, politicians and business.\u201d Tim Martin, the chairman and founder of pubs chain JD Wetherspoon, added: \u201cThe current system is up the spout. It\u2019s far too much of an old boys\u2019 network. Boards need to be more aware of what consumers think and in most businesses like ours you need to be aware of what your employees think. \u201cInstinctively yes [it could work] as long as it doesn\u2019t become a muddle. What has worked in Britain is we have got relatively high employment. What hasn\u2019t worked in France [where they have employee representatives on boards] is moving to the other end of the spectrum and making the system too employer unfriendly.\u201d First Group, which has faced numerous shareholder revolts over executive pay in recent years, although without suffering absolute defeats, can claim at least to be a step ahead of May, whose constituency is served by its Great Western trains. \u201cIn most of First Group\u2019s UK businesses, bus and trains, an employee director chosen by the workforce is on the board, up to and including the group plc board \u2013 it\u2019s a well-established practice,\u201d a company spokesman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found it helpful to have an employees\u2019 voice on the board.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has refused to guarantee the future of the Port Talbot works, saying there are \u201cmultiple elements\u201d that need to be overcome in order to secure a rescue deal for its UK business. Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel Europe, warned on Monday that the steel industry faced immense challenges and the company needed to build a sustainable business. The Indian company announced on Friday night that it was halting the sale of its UK business, which employs 11,000 people. Instead it is looking to keep Tata Steel UK by merging its European steel operations with another steel company and is in talks with German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp. However, Chatterjee said the future of the Port Tablot plant and its 4,000 employees could not be guaranteed even if a joint venture was agreed. \u201cI think it is important to look at it from the prism of a competitive business rather than sitting on any firm guarantees because at the end of the day the volatility of the market and the risks to performance have to be mitigated by building a structurally competitive business \u2026 There are a lot of stakeholders in this whole issue and we would like to find a balance in ensuring that we find the right outcome.\u201d Chatterjee declined to put a time frame on completing a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp or another steel company. He warned that any deal is subject to reaching an agreement with the UK government about financial support and restructuring its pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a3700m and liabilities of almost \u00a315bn. He denied that Tata Steel was waiting for the government to confirm its financial support before guaranteeing the future of Port Talbot. \u201cIt is about three or four things together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about own internal plan being made more robust, it is about the government policy of both the Welsh government and the UK government, and then we have to get to the answer on pensions and look at a satisfactory conclusion to our engagements with the unions.\u201d Asked if he had a message for workers at the plant, Chatterjee said: \u201cI think from a Port Talbot employee perspective, it\u2019s best that they continue to work as hard as they always do, ensuring the performance of the business makes a great case for the future sustainability of Port Talbot.\u201d He also played down the threat of Brexit harming the future of its UK business, saying it is \u201ctoo early to make a call on whether it is good, bad or otherwise\u201d. Tata Steel announced in March it was considering pulling out of its UK business, sparking heavy criticism of the government for not dealing with the crisis in the steel industry. The company began a sales process and seven potential bidders were shortlisted. However, it decided to work on a deal to keep its UK concern after the government pledged to offer financial support. Chatterjee said the talks with ThyssenKrupp did not represent a change of strategy because Tata had always said it would look at all options. The government has said a package of financial aid worth hundreds of millions of pounds is still available to the Port Talbot works despite Tata Steel scrapping plans to sell the site. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said the government was committed to securing the future of the steelworks in south Wales and was in \u201cclose contact\u201d with Tata Steel. In a written statement to parliament, Javid said he had met the chairman of Tata, Cyrus Mistry, in Mumbai on Friday and been assured that the company was committed to securing a deal with \u201cthe best long-term prospects for a competitive and sustainable future\u201d for Port Talbot and the rest of its UK business. The government has offered loans on commercial terms of up to \u00a31bn to support Tata Steel UK, potentially in return for a 25% stake in the business. Javid has also revealed plans to restructure the pension scheme. The government has drawn up a plan with trustees and trade unions that would see the scheme spun off into a new shell company and the inflation-linked annual increase benchmarked against the consumer price index rather than the retail price index, potentially saving billions of pounds in future liabilities. However, the Pension Protection Fund and some MPs have said this could create a dangerous precedent and encourage other companies to walk away from their pension liabilities. A consultation on the changes finished last month, but the government is yet to make a further announcement. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose constituency covers Port Talbot, said: \u201cSteelworkers and their families have been put through hell over the last weeks and months, and they will be forgiven for greeting today\u2019s announcement with a degree of scepticism, and concern. \u201cAny developments that offer the possibility of investment and engagement that would secure a sustainable future for the British steel industry are welcome, in principle. However, in practice there are serious questions to be answered around the joint venture proposal.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Burberry's Christopher Bailey makes way for new CEO", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry\u2019s chief executive, Christopher Bailey, is to cede control of the company\u2019s day-to-day management as part of a boardroom overhaul amid criticism from investors. The luxury goods veteran Marco Gobbetti will take over as chief executive in 2017, leaving his position at the helm of French luxury brand C\u00e9line. Bailey will hand over the daily running of the business to become president. He will also retain his role as chief creative officer, a position he previously held alongside the CEO job, to the dissatisfaction of some investors. Investors and retail experts welcomed the handover, which they said would help Burberry cope with falling profits due to flagging demand for luxury goods in markets such as China and Russia. Burberry also announced it had poached Julie Brown from medical supplies group Smith &amp; Nephew to serve as chief operating officer and chief financial officer. Burberry\u2019s annual meeting, at which investors were expected to lodge a protest vote against Bailey continuing as chief executive, takes place on Thursday. Gobbetti will start on a pay arrangement that could be worth up to \u00a311.5m a year, depending on performance, including an \u00a380,000 allowance for clothing, car and travel. The deal includes shares worth \u00a34.2m as compensation for stock he forfeited on leaving C\u00e9line. There are no performance conditions attached to the award. Brown\u2019s deal is worth up to \u00a37.4m and includes an award free of performance conditions, made up of shares currently worth \u00a32.95m. Burberry did not say how Bailey\u2019s move out of the chief executive\u2019s chair he has occupied since May 2014 would affect his pay arrangements. Burberry\u2019s chairman, Sir John Peace, pointed to Gobbetti\u2019s track record at the helm of luxury brands, having served as chief executive of Moschino and Givenchy before taking charge at C\u00e9line. \u201cMarco brings incredible experience and skills in luxury and retail with him that will be invaluable to us,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has an outstanding track record of delivering growth in the luxury industry, and his vision for the sector and how it will evolve is extremely impressive.\u201d The company is due to release a quarterly trading update on Wednesday. Burberry\u2019s share price rose more than 6% on Monday after the appointments were announced, before falling to close up about 4.5% at \u00a312.12. Despite early concerns over whether he could cope with being the firm\u2019s creative chief as well as its boss, investors backed Bailey at the firm\u2019s last annual meeting. But anxiety over his leadership \u2013 and the pay deal that came with it \u2013 has grown in recent months, fuelled by worries about the company\u2019s financial performance, after pre-tax profit fell 10% to \u00a3421m for the year to the end of March. Several investors were understood to be prepared to vote against Bailey\u2019s reappointment, despite his announcement of a review aimed at trimming \u00a3100m off the company\u2019s annual costs by 2019. Sources familiar with the situation said Bailey had realised during talks with investors that it would be better for the company to bring in a new face. Richard Marwood, an equity fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, which owns a stake in Burberry worth nearly \u00a325m, welcomed the change. \u201cIt tidies up what was a slightly unusual situation. The combined roles looked a little bit peculiar and the skillsets of both roles are not necessarily the same. \u201cMany people have been concerned that you need someone with vision, but you also need someone who does the mundane day-to-day tasks, making sure that everything is done properly.\u201d Analyst Mario Ortelli said the rise in Burberry\u2019s share price was a reflection of investors\u2019 desire for the firm to find new leadership without losing Bailey\u2019s creative spark. \u201cWe appreciate the fact that Bailey stays as creative officer, which gives continuity to the stylistic direction,\u201d he said. But Ortelli warned that the fact that the new management would not be installed until next year left some cause for concern. \u201cThe big question mark is in the next month how the incumbent management will be able to deal with the brand in the current business environment. That\u2019s six months in which the management faces a turbulent environment. \u201cIn the short term, there\u2019s a big relief in the weakness of the British pound but they cannot get that advantage without also working on the business model of the company.\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Rogerio Fujimori said: \u201cBurberry is moving back to the successful arrangement in place before Angela Ahrendts left Burberry to join Apple a couple of years ago.\u201d Anusha Couttigane, senior retail analyst at Kantar, said Burberry was now better placed to deal with slackening demand in the luxury sector. Chinese sales have slowed, while Russian buyers have been slapped with economic sanctions and Middle East demand has cooled. \u201cWhile Christopher Bailey is still highly respected for his creative talents, these have been difficult challenges to face for someone with little experience leading a business in its totality,\u201d said Couttigane.",

Here are some of the winners and losers so far from Brexit. Winners Primark\u2019s owner, Associated British Foods, said the clothing chain\u2019s UK profit margins would be hit by sterling\u2019s fall but this would be offset by fatter margins at its sugar business. Profits earned outside the UK will be better than expected because of the weak pound, it added. The group scrapped its earlier prediction that annual earnings would fall. Rentokil International has been one of the big gainers from the plunging pound. The pest control company makes 90% of its revenue outside the UK and if currency rates stay the same it will make up to \u00a315m extra this year, it said. Pinewood Studios, home to the James Bond and Star Wars films, said that its international customers would benefit from the fall in the pound, which will make Pinewood\u2019s services cheaper to overseas producers. Bookmakers had their biggest non-sporting event ever at the referendum, with punters placing \u00a3100m in bets. Most of that money went on Britain staying in the EU, suggesting the bookies did pretty well, at least in the short term. Accountants and law firms will be busy as companies caught off guard by the referendum result seek to rearrange their businesses. KPMG, one of the big four accountants, has appointed a head of Brexit while rivals have set up specialist teams. Aveva, the software maker, said the pound\u2019s weakness against the euro and the dollar would increase the value of its overseas earnings if rates remain stable at current levels. Ocado is a potential beneficiary of the pound\u2019s fall. The online grocer has been trying to do a deal with an overseas retailer to use its technology for more than a year. The company said the weaker pound could make such a deal more attractive to buyers. Losers Sports Direct has warned of a tough year ahead, made worse because of Brexit. Weakening consumer confidence is likely to hit sales and failure to insure against the pound\u2019s fall will make products bought in dollars more expensive and incur losses on hedging contracts taken out on sterling against the euro. Foxtons shares plunged to a record low when the estate agent said the referendum result would depress property sales for the rest of the year in London, its main market. It had been hoping for a pick-up in activity after the referendum. Reporting its worst fall in clothing sales since the 2008 banking crisis, Marks &amp; Spencer said consumer confidence had weakened as the referendum approached but that it had not noticed a further decline since 23 June. The retailer said it was forecasting a tough trading environment. Shares in Carpetright lost a fifth of their value when the flooring retailer said the referendum result had probably worsened tough trading conditions by increasing consumer uncertainty. The weak pound will also push up prices it pays for materials, analysts said. Banks have been affected by worries about the post-Brexit economy and a probable cut in interest rates. Royal Bank of Scotland said the government will have to wait two years or more to sell a further stake after its shares plunged. With the Bank of England expected to reduce rates from record lows, it will become still harder for banks to make money on lending. British Airways\u2019 owner, International Airlines Group, said annual profit would be lower than expected because of weak trading caused by the referendum. EasyJet warned three days later that the vote to leave had added to existing problems such as cancelled flights and that short-term profit would be affected. C&amp;C, the beverage maker, warned that the pound\u2019s weakness could wipe out gains from improved trading and cost reductions so far this year. The Irish company, whose shares are traded in London, makes almost half its profits in sterling but reports in euros, leaving it exposed to the pound\u2019s sharp fall.",

    "webTitle": "Over 70 banks and City firms to link bonuses to senior jobs for women", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 70 banks and other City firms have agreed to link their bosses\u2019 bonuses to the appointment of women to senior jobs in a push to break with male-dominated executive teams. Britain\u2019s big four retail banks, including Lloyds and Barclays, and insurers such as Legal &amp; General and Prudential have signed up to the government\u2019s women in finance charter. Others among the 72 backers include Lloyd\u2019s of London, the US investment bank Morgan Stanley and fund managers Fidelity and Schroders. The charter contains a set of voluntary proposals designed to improve gender balance at financial companies following recommendations by Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money. Gadhia found that women made up 23% of boards at City firms but only 14% of executive committees. The Davies review of women on boards has increased the number of female directors at UK companies, but most of the rise has been in the number of non-executives rather than in top management jobs. Companies subject to the charter will seek to promote women to senior management jobs and to work on getting more women into middle management so they can progress through the ranks. The charter commits companies to: Link pay packages for their top executives to gender diversity targets. Set internal targets for female representation in senior management. Publish annual progress reports against the targets. Make a senior executive responsible for gender diversity and inclusion. Companies signed up to the charter must publish targets online by the end of September. They will have a year to report on the targets to the Treasury and will do so annually after that. They will also have to explain the link between executive pay and progress against targets to the Treasury, though they can choose not to make this information public. Gadhia said the charter marked a turning point for the financial industry, whose long hours and uncompromising culture make it one of the most male-dominated industries. She said: \u201cA growing number of chief executives and boards within the sector are taking the issue seriously and recognise the strong link between greater gender balance and improved productivity and performance.\u201d When Gadhia unveiled the proposed charter in March, she argued there was an economic and business \u2013 as well as a moral \u2013 case for promoting women in the finance industry. She quoted findings from Credit Suisse that the average return on equity of companies with at least one woman on the board between 2006 and 2012 was 16% compared with 12% for firms without female board representation. The financial crisis also raised concerns about \u201cgroupthink\u201d among the mainly male leadership teams of banks whose risky behaviour caused a near-meltdown of the financial system. Harriett Baldwin, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cBy signing the charter, firms are committing to driving change at the senior levels of the male-dominated financial services industry. Such widespread commitment will make a genuine difference to gender diversity in financial services.\u201d Gadhia decided against recommending quotas for companies, arguing firms had different starting points and should be left to work out the details of internal targets and how to link pay to diversity.",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/29/a-third-of-boardroom-positions-should-be-held-by-women-uk-firms-told\">Davies review of women on boards</a> has increased the number of female directors at UK companies, but most of the rise has been in the number of non-executives rather than in top management jobs. </p> <p>Companies subject to the charter will seek to promote women to senior management jobs and to work on getting more women into middle management so they can progress through the ranks.</p> <p>The charter commits companies to:</p> <ul> <li>Link pay packages for their top executives to gender diversity targets.<br></li> <li>Set internal targets for female representation in senior management.<br></li> <li>Publish annual progress reports against the targets.<br></li> <li>Make a senior executive responsible for gender diversity and inclusion.<br></li> </ul> <p>Companies signed up to the charter must publish targets online by the end of September. They will have a year to report on the targets to the Treasury and will do so annually after that. They will also have to explain the link between executive pay and progress against targets to the Treasury, though they can choose not to make this information public.</p> <p>Gadhia said the charter marked a turning point for the financial industry, whose long hours and uncompromising culture make it one of the most male-dominated industries.</p> <p>She said: \u201cA growing number of chief executives and boards within the sector are taking the issue seriously and recognise the strong link between greater gender balance and improved productivity and performance.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/22/major-uk-banks-sign-charter-pledging-tackle-gender-gap\">When Gadhia unveiled the proposed charter</a> in March, she argued there was an economic and business \u2013 as well as a moral \u2013 case for promoting women in the finance industry. She quoted findings from Credit Suisse that the average return on equity of companies with at least one woman on the board between 2006 and 2012 was 16% compared with 12% for firms without female board representation.<br></p> <p>The financial crisis also raised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/03/city-needs-senior-women\">concerns about \u201cgroupthink\u201d</a> among the mainly male leadership teams of banks whose risky behaviour caused a near-meltdown of the financial system. </p> <p>Harriett Baldwin, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cBy signing the charter, firms are committing to driving change at the senior levels of the male-dominated financial services industry. Such widespread commitment will make a genuine difference to gender diversity in financial services.\u201d<br></p> <p>Gadhia decided against recommending quotas for companies, arguing firms had different starting points and should be left to work out the details of internal targets and how to link pay to diversity.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Until the people of the UK voted to leave the European Union, the refugee crisis was the greatest problem Europe faced. Indeed, that crisis played a critical role in bringing about the greater calamity of Brexit. The vote for Brexit was a great shock; the morning after the vote, the disintegration of the European Union seemed practically inevitable. Brewing crises in other EU countries, especially Italy, deepened the dark forecast for the EU\u2019s survival. But as the initial shock of the British referendum wears off, something unexpected is happening: the tragedy no longer looks like a fait accompli. Many British voters have started to feel a degree of \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d as the hypothetical becomes real. Sterling has plunged. Another Scottish referendum has become highly likely. The erstwhile leaders of the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign have engaged in a peculiar bout of internecine self-destruction, and some of their followers have started to glimpse the bleak future that both the country and they personally face. A sign of the shift in public opinion has been a campaign, supported by more than 4m people so far, to petition Parliament to hold a second referendum. Just as Brexit was a negative surprise, the spontaneous response to it is a positive one. People on both sides of the cause \u2013 most important, those who didn\u2019t even vote (particularly young people under 35) \u2013 have become mobilised. This is the kind of grassroots involvement that the EU has never been able to generate. The post-referendum turmoil has highlighted for people in Britain just what they stand to lose by leaving the EU. If this sentiment spreads to the rest of Europe, what seemed like the inevitable disintegration of the EU could be instead creating positive momentum for a stronger and better Europe. The process could start in Britain. The popular vote can\u2019t be reversed but a signature collecting campaign could transform the political landscape by revealing a newfound enthusiasm for EU membership. This approach could then be replicated in the rest of the European Union, creating a movement to save the EU by profoundly restructuring it. I am convinced that as the consequences of Brexit unfold in the months ahead, more and more people will be eager to join this movement. What the EU must not do is penalise British voters while ignoring their legitimate concerns about the deficiencies of the Union. European leaders should recognise their own mistakes and acknowledge the democratic deficit in the current institutional arrangements. Rather than treating Brexit as the negotiation of a divorce, they should seize the opportunity to reinvent the EU \u2013 making it the kind of club that the UK and others at risk of exit want to join. If disaffected voters in France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Poland and everywhere else see the EU benefitting their lives, the EU will emerge stronger. If not, it will fall apart faster than leaders and citizens currently realise. The next trouble spot is Italy, which is facing a banking crisis and a referendum in October. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is caught in a \u201cCatch-22\u201d situation: if he cannot resolve the banking crisis in time, he will lose the referendum. That could bring to power the Five Star Movement, a partner of the pro-Brexit Ukip in the European parliament. To find a solution, Renzi needs the assistance of the European authorities, but they are too slow and inflexible. Europe\u2019s leaders must recognise that the EU is on the verge of collapse. Instead of blaming one another, they should pull together and adopt exceptional measures. First, a clear distinction must be drawn between membership of the EU and of the eurozone. Those fortunate countries that are not members of the eurozone should not face discrimination. If the eurozone wants to be more closely integrated, as it should be, it needs to have its own treasury and budget, to serve as a fiscal authority alongside its monetary authority, the European Central Bank. Second, the EU should put its excellent and largely untapped credit to use. Leaders would be acting irresponsibly if they failed to employ the EU\u2019s borrowing capacity when its very existence is at stake. Third, the EU must strengthen its defences to protect itself from its external enemies, who are liable to take advantage of its current weakness. The EU\u2019s greatest asset is Ukraine, whose citizens are willing to die in defence of their country. By defending themselves, they are also defending the EU \u2013 rare in Europe nowadays. Ukraine is fortunate to have a new government that is more determined and more likely to deliver the reforms for which both its citizens and its outside supporters have been clamouring. But the EU and its member states are not providing the support that Ukraine deserves (the US is much more supportive). Fourth, the EU\u2019s plans for dealing with the refugee crisis need to be thoroughly revised. They are riddled with misconceptions and inconsistencies that render them ineffective. They are woefully underfunded. And they use coercive measures that generate resistance. I have proposed a detailed remedy for these problems elsewhere. If the EU makes progress along these lines, it will become an organisation to which people will want to belong. At that point, treaty change \u2013 and further integration \u2013 will once again become possible. If Europe\u2019s leaders fail to act, those who want to save the EU in order to reinvent it should follow the lead of the young activists in Britain. Now more than ever, the EU\u2019s defenders must find ways to make their influence felt. \u2022George Soros is chairman of Soros Fund Management and the Open Society Foundations, and a pioneer of the hedge-fund industry. \u00a9 Project Syndicate",

Opening the airshow, Cameron said leaving the EU \u201cwent against what I recommended\u201d but said the economy could recover and the UK would \u201cplay to its strengths.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t resile from what I said, from my warnings of a short-term shock, medium-term uncertainty and some long-term risks,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed we have already had a taste in the turbulence of global markets and the value of the pound. There will be other problems ahead. But I want to be clear we will deal with them from a position of strength.\u201d Cameron said the UK was in \u201ca new reality now, we must accept and we must make it work\u201d and that leaving the EU was the biggest challenge faced by government in 40 years. \u201cThe key things we need to get right are our future relationship with Europe, Britain\u2019s underlying productivity challenge, the need to grow exports faster and encourage more inward investment,\u2019 he said, saying the focus must now be on a new relationship with Europe, the productivity gap and trade and investment. The US manufacturer will build its new facility for P-8A Poseidon military aircraft at RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, and make the UK its base for defence exports to Europe and the Middle East, as well as for the maintenance and training for its defence fixed-wing and rotary platforms.

      "bodyText": "A second ratings agency has warned it will take a keen interest in fiscal consolidation in the new parliament as Malcolm Turnbull returned to Canberra for incoming government briefings. The Moody\u2019s rating agency said on Monday the likelihood of the Coalition forming government had provided \u201csome clarity\u201d about the direction of policy in Canberra. But it warned it would be watching keenly for indications that the Coalition could not work with the new Senate. Any difficulties in passing deficit-reduction measures through parliament would be \u201ccredit negative\u201d for the commonwealth. Conversely, Australia\u2019s credit position would improve if it looked as though the deficit was starting to come down substantially, and if government debt began to stabilise. \u201cMoody\u2019s expects fiscal consolidation to remain a key policy objective of the government,\u201d said Marie Diron, Moody\u2019s Investors Service senior vice president. \u201cEconomic momentum is likely to remain robust. The positive effects of the weaker Australian dollar on services exports, and the resilience of private consumption in an environment of stable unemployment and low interest rates, will support GDP growth. \u201cIndications that under a Coalition government with a split Senate, little agreement can be reached on fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic policy measures would be credit negative.\u201d After declaring victory in the election on Sunday, the prime minister returned to Canberra on Monday for government briefings with his departmental head, Martin Parkinson. The Nationals party room will meet in Canberra on Tuesday to resolve its collective stance on a new Coalition agreement that will need to be negotiated between Turnbull and the Nationals leader, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce. Turnbull and Joyce are expected to meet on Wednesday, but it is already clear the junior Coalition partner will push for more representation within the ministry on the basis that its parliamentary representation has increased. Behind the scenes there is also jockeying ahead of Liberals returning to Canberra for their party room meeting next Monday. Internal pushback on the government\u2019s superannuation policy was a feature of the recent election campaign, and it is emerging as something of a proxy war, with budget implications. On Sunday the cabinet secretary, Arthur Sinodinos, said the government had a mandate for key budget measures and he would \u201ccontinue to argue the importance and the merit of those superannuation changes\u201d. But the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has warned the government should not have a \u201ctin ear\u201d about issues that cost the Coalition support, including superannuation changes. Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, has warned Malcolm Turnbull should drop the retrospective $500,000 limit on non-concessional super contributions, arguing there is \u201cno way this will get through the party room in its present form\u201d. That measure delivers $550m in savings to the budget over four years. During the campaign, Labor said it would not support government super changes that had retrospective effect, but would support changes to the system equalling the value of the revenue raised by the government\u2019s proposals. Bill Shorten said on Monday: \u201cI think it\u2019s probably appropriate to get an independent expert review to examine whether or not the changes are retrospective.\u201d Moody\u2019s commentary follows Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s warning last week that it might lower Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating within two years. It said the chances of pushing tough reforms through parliament over the next three years were slim, so the chance of a credit downgrade had increased. It said there was a one-in-three chance that it would lower the credit rating for Australia within the next two years.",

    "webTitle": "Free trade is viewed as economic catnip, but the benefits are not for everyone | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There has been a great deal of chin-scratching of late about how the current political situation is anathema to \u201creform\u201d and how recent elections here and overseas signify a turn against the wonderful economic glories of the 1980s and 1990s, and towards a more protectionist trade policy. Perhaps politicians and some in the media just need to remember one important thing: trade is essential, but it\u2019s not a one way street. As with productivity, economists view trade as a requirement for improved living standards. Under the Abbott and Turnbull governments, free trade agreements have been come to be viewed as economic catnip that will somehow create jobs and spur growth. As I have noted a few times, while the productivity commission is in favour of more open trade it is rather skeptical of the many benefits politicians suggest come via our free-trade agreements. Most of the claims are complete bollocks \u2013 like Turnbull suggesting the China Free-trade agreement is the reason why Chinese tourism will hit record numbers this year. The problem with trade is when economists talk of it improving our living standards, they are mostly talking about imports. And yet when talking about the benefits of free trade, politicians like to mostly talk about exports. The Abbott government realised this, and rather ham-fistedly started calling the China free-trade agreement the \u201cChina free trade export deal\u201d. The reason that imports are a big driver of our standard of living improvements is that standard of living looks at how much you can buy with what you earn. If the cost of what you buy falls then your standard of living rises (unless your income falls by more). Free trade allows us to import goods at a cheaper price because someone somewhere else either makes them more efficiently than we do, or for a cheaper cost. Take the cost of cars. In the 1970s and \u201880s the price of cars rose mostly in line with full-time earnings. But as the tariffs on the imports of the cars fell, so too did the price of cars: Cars now cost roughly what they did in the late 1980s. An article in The Canberra Times from December 1989 refers to a limited edition Holden Commodore with a price of $43,140. You can pick up a 2016 Holden Commodore for $43,120. In December 1989 the average annual full-time earnings were $26,850, compared to the current average of $80,932. Now that is a standard of living improvement. And if you don\u2019t think trade improves your own standard of living, best consider where the device you\u2019re reading this on came from, the big arse flat TV you have in your lounge room, your kids\u2019 toys, probably even your furniture you\u2019re sitting on. Trade generally looks a lot better when you just think about people as consumers. But it does come at a cost. There are now actually fewer people working in manufacturing now than in 1989: And a comparison of exports for manufacturing and the services sector over the past 30 years gives an indication of winners and losers from trade: At the start of the century, trade in the services sector was about 1.3 times that of manufacturing, now it is nearly twice the size. But while manufacturing employment may have fallen, overall employment has of course increased, and young workers who would have gone into manufacturing in the 1980s now go elsewhere \u2013 construction perhaps. But it is easy to understand why workers in some areas of the country get a bit eye-rolly when they hear talk of the wonders of free-trade agreements. Celebrating the cheap price of cars is not so great when you\u2019ve just lost your job making cars \u2013 as is happening to 320 more workers in the Adelaide Holden plant. It a situation not only difficult for those pursuing a more open trade agenda. Progressives who believe there needs to be a price on carbon might be able to point to the benefits to the environment, and the greater investment into renewable energy, but \u2013 as Hillary Clinton pointed out to much controversy \u2013 that will also lead the loss of a lot of jobs in coal reliant industries. There are economic benefits from having open trade, but that does not necessarily mean more of it is better for all. It\u2019s no surprise that there are winners and losers in any economic \u201creform,\u201d but neither should it be a surprise that those who stand to lose are making their voice heard via the ballot box. That doesn\u2019t mean we should bring back tariffs \u2013 they\u2019re actually just a consumption tax by proxy. But it does mean that perhaps political leaders need to focus more on people\u2019s concerns. Selling trade is much easier when the standard of living improvements are both rising income and lower prices from imports. And for the past five years we\u2019ve been seeing falling exports prices, and Australia\u2019s overall national income has been stagnant. In such a situation you can\u2019t just assume people will agree the benefits are obvious \u2013 either to the nation\u2019s standard of living, or their own.",

      "body": "<p>There has been a great deal of chin-scratching of late about how the current political situation is anathema to \u201creform\u201d and how recent elections here and overseas signify a turn against the wonderful economic glories of the 1980s and 1990s, and towards a more protectionist trade policy. </p> <p>Perhaps politicians and some in the media just need to remember one important thing: trade is essential, but it\u2019s not a one way street.</p> <p>As with productivity, economists view trade as a requirement for improved living standards. </p> <p>Under the Abbott and Turnbull governments, free trade agreements have been come to be viewed as economic catnip that will somehow create jobs and spur growth. </p> <p>As I have noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/nov/20/why-isnt-the-government-being-held-to-account-on-the-china-free-trade-deal?CMP=soc_568%20%20%E2%80%8B\">a few</a> times, while the productivity commission is in favour of more open trade it is rather skeptical of the many benefits politicians suggest come via our free-trade agreements. Most of the claims are complete bollocks \u2013 like <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-15/jericho-politicians-beware-when-full-time-work-begins-to-slip/7511706\">Turnbull suggesting</a> the China Free-trade agreement is the reason why Chinese tourism will hit record numbers this year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/nov/20/why-isnt-the-government-being-held-to-account-on-the-china-free-trade-deal\">Why isn't the government being held to account on the China free trade deal?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem with trade is when economists talk of it improving our living standards, they are mostly talking about imports. </p> <p>And yet when talking about the benefits of free trade, politicians like to mostly talk about exports. The Abbott government realised this, and rather ham-fistedly started calling the China free-trade agreement the \u201c<a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F93a1fa0d-0b2c-453c-bbeb-b700dd4555c5%2F0105%22\">China free trade export deal</a>\u201d. </p> <p>The reason that imports are a big driver of our standard of living improvements is that standard of living looks at how much you can buy with what you earn. If the cost of what you buy falls then your standard of living rises (unless your income falls by more).</p> <p>Free trade allows us to import goods at a cheaper price because someone somewhere else either makes them more efficiently than we do, or for a cheaper cost.</p> <p>Take the cost of cars. In the 1970s and \u201880s the price of cars rose mostly in line with full-time earnings. But as the tariffs on the imports of the cars fell, so too did the price of cars:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Inflation and the price of motor vehicles\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZDrOI/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Cars now cost roughly what they did in the late 1980s. </p> <p>An article in <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/120865317?searchTerm=Holden%20commodore&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y\">The Canberra Times</a> from December 1989 refers to a limited edition Holden Commodore with a price of $43,140. You can pick up a <a href=\"http://www.carsguide.com.au/car-valuation/specs/TM616A/HOLDEN/COMMODORE/2016\">2016 Holden Commodore for $43,120</a>.</p> <p>In December 1989 the average annual full-time earnings were $26,850, compared to the current average of $80,932. </p> <p>Now that is a standard of living improvement. </p> <p>And if you don\u2019t think trade improves your own standard of living, best consider where the device you\u2019re reading this on came from, the big arse flat TV you have in your lounge room, your kids\u2019 toys, probably even your furniture you\u2019re sitting on. </p> <p>Trade generally looks a lot better when you just think about people as consumers. </p> <p>But it does come at a cost. There are now actually fewer people working in manufacturing now than in 1989:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australian employment - past 30 years\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kmrJM/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And a comparison of exports for manufacturing and the services sector over the past 30 years gives an indication of winners and losers from trade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual value of exports - current dollars\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yVUD4/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>At the start of the century, trade in the services sector was about 1.3 times that of manufacturing, now it is nearly twice the size. </p> <p>But while manufacturing employment may have fallen, overall employment has of course increased, and young workers who would have gone into manufacturing in the 1980s now go elsewhere \u2013 construction perhaps. </p> <p>But it is easy to understand why workers in some areas of the country get a bit eye-rolly when they hear talk of the wonders of free-trade agreements. Celebrating the cheap price of cars is not so great when you\u2019ve just lost your job making cars \u2013 as is happening to <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-08/holden-to-cut-another-320-adelaide-workers/7581572?section=business\">320 more workers</a> in the Adelaide Holden plant. </p> <p>It a situation not only difficult for those pursuing a more open trade agenda. Progressives who believe there needs to be a price on carbon might be able to point to the benefits to the environment, and the greater investment into renewable energy, but \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/may/10/context-hillary-clintons-comments-about-coal-jobs/\">Hillary Clinton pointed out to much controversy</a> \u2013 that will also lead the loss of a lot of jobs in coal reliant industries. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/feb/08/were-spending-less-than-we-did-two-years-ago-not-a-great-sign-for-the-economy\">Growth in spending is the slowest in two years \u2013 not a great sign for the economy | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are economic benefits from having open trade, but that does not necessarily mean more of it is better for all. </p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise that there are winners and losers in any economic \u201creform,\u201d but neither should it be a surprise that those who stand to lose are making their voice heard via the ballot box. </p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean we should bring back tariffs \u2013 they\u2019re actually just a consumption tax by proxy. But it does mean that perhaps political leaders need to focus more on people\u2019s concerns. Selling trade is much easier when the standard of living improvements are both rising income and lower prices from imports. And for the past five years we\u2019ve been seeing falling exports prices, and Australia\u2019s overall national income has been <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-06/jericho-economic-theory-can't-match-lived-experience/7572508\">stagnant</a>. </p> <p>In such a situation you can\u2019t just assume people will agree the benefits are obvious \u2013 either to the nation\u2019s standard of living, or their own.</p>",
