      "bodyText": "Plunging levels of home ownership and an increased reliance on state benefits to top up salaries have meant that Britain\u2019s middle-income families increasingly look like the poor households of the past, according to one of the UK\u2019s leading thinktanks. A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that the old link between worklessness and child poverty had been broken, with record levels of employment leading to a drop in the number of poor children living in homes where no adult works. However, the study found that by 2014-15, two-thirds of children classified as living below the poverty line had at least one parent who was working. If Theresa May wanted to take forward David Cameron\u2019s \u201clife chances\u201d strategy, the IFS said, the prime minister needed to focus on lifting the incomes of working households. \u201cIn key respects, middle-income families with children now more closely resemble poor families than in the past,\u201d the IFS said. \u201cHalf are now renters rather than owner-occupiers and, while poorer families have become less reliant on benefits as employment has risen, middle-income households with children now get 30% of their income from benefits and tax credits, up from 22% 20 years ago.\u201d The report divided the population into five groups according to income and found that for the middle 20% of children, half were living in an owner-occupied house, down from 69% two decades ago. It also found that mothers\u2019 earnings were increasingly important for households with children. More than 25% of the incomes of middle-income households came from mothers in 2014-15, up from less than 20% in 1996, while this figure doubled from 7% to 15% for the poorest group over the 20-year period. Britain\u2019s economy since the recession of 2008-09 has been marked by a large increase in the numbers employed, coupled with a much more modest rise in incomes. The IFS said this had changed the dynamic of poverty, with the least well-off households much more vulnerable to economic downturns, such as that likely to be caused by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, than in the past. Earnings from employment made up 50% of the total income for the poorest 20% of households in 2014\u201315 \u2013 excluding pensioners \u2013 up from less than one-third 20 years ago. \u201cVirtually all serious analysis suggests that the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU will lead to a smaller economy, and hence lower living standards over the next few years, than we would otherwise have had,\u201d the IFS said. \u201cBut precisely how this will feed through into employment, earnings, and tax and benefit policy is impossible to predict with confidence.\u201d There had been strong growth in incomes during 2014-15, the thinktank said, which had finally taken living standards for the median household 2% above their pre-crisis levels. But this was due to higher incomes for the elderly, with no increase for workers aged 31-59 and a 7% decline for those aged between 22 and 30. The IFS said it was \u201chighly unusual\u201d to see no growth in working-age incomes over a seven-year period. The report found that there had been a decrease in income inequality during the post-financial crisis years due to an increase in the hours worked by those on low incomes and weak earnings growth for those on higher incomes. Between 2011\u201312 and 2014\u201315, real weekly earnings grew by 4.4% for the poorest 10% of households, but fell by 1.2% for the top 10%. Andrew Hood, an IFS research economist and an author of the report, said: \u201cGiven the economic recovery and cuts to benefits over the last few years, we might have expected inequality to rise. But the combination of strong employment growth, some earnings growth for low-paid workers and a lack of earnings growth for others has kept inequality below its pre-recession level.\u201d Julia Unwin, the chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which funded the report, said: \u201cThis report paints a stark picture of the new face of poverty in the UK. Falling unemployment has helped many families to keep their heads above the water, but slow wage growth, benefit squeezes and rises in the cost of essentials means there are still a shamefully high number living in poverty in the UK today. \u201cThe fact that an increasing number of people in work are living in poverty shows that we need urgent, wide-ranging action to make a real difference in the living standards of low-income households. It is vital that politicians work with business, individuals and local communities to solve UK poverty once and for all.\u201d Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to build a Britain that works for everyone, not just the privileged few, and this report shows we\u2019re making progress. We now have record numbers of people in work, falling unemployment and wages rising faster than inflation. But we need to go further, which is why we have committed to increase the \u2018national living wage\u2019 to benefit the poorest in society, we are taking the lowest paid out of income tax and our welfare reforms are ensuring it pays to be in work. \u201cAs our economy grows, we will also be building our skills base, developing a proper industrial strategy and improving education to help everyone reach their full potential.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sterling rose and the City\u2019s leading share index closed at its highest level for 11 months after a Bank of England policymaker said a lack of panic since Britain\u2019s shock Brexit vote called into question the need for a knee-jerk cut in interest rates. Speculation that next month\u2019s meeting of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee would unanimously back a comprehensive package of measures to boost growth was called into question when Martin Weale, one of its nine members, voiced doubts about the need for cheaper borrowing. Weale, who has been one of the hawkish members of the MPC, said he wanted to weigh up the impact of Brexit on the economy before making up his mind on how to vote. His remarks made in his last speech as an MPC member came ahead of an expected rise in the annual rate of inflation on Tuesday and as a flurry of reports provided a mixed picture about the prospects for the economy in the aftermath of last month\u2019s referendum. Weale said the Bank would have to balance the likely reduction in demand against upward pressure on inflation when it makes its decision. He said: \u201cFor there to be a case for easing policy I will need to expect weakness in output to be large enough to compensate for any overshoot in inflation on the assumption that policy is unchanged in the near term.\u201d Sterling rose after Weale\u2019s remarks at a conference in London, since they were seen as less supportive of action to underpin growth than interventions last week by two other MPC members \u2013 Andy Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe. Haldane called for a big package of measures to support the post-Brexit economy and stressed the need for a prompt and robust response to the uncertainty. Vlieghe was the only MPC member to back a rate cut at the July meeting. The pound ended the day 0.4% higher against the US dollar at $1.3250 having earlier traded at almost $1.33. The FTSE 100, boosted by the takeover bid for Cambridge-based technology company ARM, ended 26 points higher at 6695, its highest level since August 2015. Weale said the result of the referendum on 23 June had led to a \u201cvery high degree of uncertainty\u201d about the implications of Brexit, and this meant there was a case for waiting to see what the implications might be. Weale added that he thought the short-term impact on demand would be greater than that on the economy\u2019s supply capacity, which would dampen inflation. In his valedictory speech as an MPC member, Weale rejected two of the arguments used to justify lower borrowing costs. First, he dismissed the notion that markets would be disappointed were there to be no easing in August, noting that market participants should remember that the MPC sets policy each month, not in advance. \u201cThe Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is not a nurse to markets,\u201d he said. Weale also gave short shrift to the idea that early action was needed to reassure people. \u201cIn contrast to the experience of 2008, I do not have any sense that either consumers or businesses are panic-struck and \u2026 there have been no material signs of financial panic.\u201d Manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF said there had been no immediate impact on trading from the Brexit vote, but said confidence has been dented and companies expected trading conditions over the next six months to weaken. Most firms surveyed by EEF said order books were unchanged or that it was too early to gauge the effect, but companies were braced for conditions to worsen markedly. Terry Scuoler, CEO of EEF, said: \u201cRather than an immediate storm, it is clear that manufacturers see the real risks from the referendum outcome presenting over the next six months to a year. While many are acutely aware that we are still in the early days, exchange rate volatility, political uncertainty and the danger of increased costs are already on their risk radar, and subsequently we can already see confidence starting to drain away.\u201d The financial services company PwC predicted that UK growth would slow markedly over the winter, but said Britain was likely to avoid the two successive quarters of negative growth that would constitute a recession. PwC said growth would be cut to around 1.6% in 2016 and 0.6% in 2017, but should gradually recover thereafter as the initial shock from the Brexit vote fades. UK house price growth was expected to decelerate to around 3% in 2016 and around 1% in 2017, but the company said there would be no major house price crash. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: \u201cThe Bank of England has already taken action to steady the ship, however, and we do not expect the post-Brexit economic downturn to be anything like as severe as that following the global financial crisis of 2008-9 or indeed the deep recession of the early 1980s. \u201cOur main scenario projections suggests that the UK should narrowly avoid a recession over the next year, although we recognise that risks are weighted somewhat to the downside at present.\u201d The online jobs site reed.co.uk said employment had been holding up since the Brexit vote. It said the number of new jobs was up 8% on the same period in 2015, with 83% of companies saying they would not be freezing recruitment.",

      "bodyText": "Disney Princess and Frozen dolls and Star Wars action figures have continued to boost sales for US toymaker Hasbro. Revenues rose 10% to $879m (\u00a3663m), beating analysts\u2019 expectations, in the three months to 26 June as sales of partner brands such as Disney rose 15%. Excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues were up 12%. The strongest growth came from products aimed at girls \u2013 up 39% \u2013 such as dolls based on Elsa, the heroine of Frozen, and new Disney Princess toys deriving from the likes of Cinderella and Snow White. Hasbro took over the global rights to make these dolls from rival Mattel from 1 January 2016 under a licensing deal with Disney. Chief executive Brian Goldner said the sales performance of the dolls had been better than expected. However, shares in Hasbro slumped 7.5% in New York on worries about the future for the boys market as the company prepares to start delivering toys linked to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story in the run-up to Christmas. Analysts believe Hasbro is unlikely to get the same boost to sales as that generated by the previous film in the franchise \u2013 The Force Awakens \u2013 one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Sales of toys aimed at boys, the group\u2019s biggest market, and accounting for 40% of the business, rose just 6% at constant currency rates compared with double-digit rises in the previous quarter. Without help from new film releases this year, Transformers toy sales slid by 20% and items related to dinosaur franchise Jurassic Park fell by more than that. Goldner said Hasbro would stop selling Jurassic Park toys from the end of 2017 after failing to come up with a \u201cmutually beneficial financial arrangement\u201d to do so. He said demand for Star Wars-related items remained \u201cvery strong\u201d. But he admitted that total sales for the year were likely to be the same as last year, at $500m, as the toys would hit shelves in late September, almost a month later in the year than those linked to the previous Star Wars film in 2015. Jefferies analyst Trevor Young said the slowdown in the boys category was \u201csomewhat worrisome\u201d. On a positive note, Goldner said the company had not seen any negative impact on business in the UK since the country\u2019s decision to leave the European Union despite the \u201cnear-term uncertainty\u201d created by the referendum result. Europe was the fastest-growing region in the quarter, with sales up 24%, excluding exchange rate fluctuations, which included a 25% rise in the UK. Goldner said Hasbro continued to enjoy \u201cpositive momentum\u201d in the UK and Europe as a whole. Another source of growth is mobile gaming. Fans spent 80% more on Hasbro\u2019s branded mobile games in the first half of 2016 compared with the first half of last year. The company saw strong growth from its Yahtzee with Buddies social dice game and is now developing a mobile gaming and Apple TV version of Pie Face, a suspense game involving trying to avoid being slapped in the face with whipped cream or a wet sponge. Hasbro is increasingly trying to create its own content and online games, spurring it to buy Irish animation firm Boulder Media, the company behind Disney Channel\u2019s Wander Over Yonder, and the BBC\u2019s rebooted Danger Mouse. Over time, the company is expected to take on animations of Hasbro\u2019s own brands such as My Little Pony.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest technology company is set to fall into foreign ownership after ARM Holdings accepted a \u00a324.3bn offer from Japanese group SoftBank. The deal poses an early headache for Theresa May, the new prime minister, who has pledged to draw up an industrial strategy for Britain but is also keen to attract investment into the country after the EU referendum. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said that the deal showed that Britain \u201chas lost none of its allure to international investors\u201d, but industry leaders warned it was a setback for the country. ARM designs the chips that power more than 95% of smartphones around the world and its technology is effectively the brains behind the iPhone. SoftBank\u2019s offer would represent the biggest-ever investment from Asia into the UK and the second-largest foreign takeover of a UK-listed company, behind only ABInBev\u2019s deal to buy SABMiller. \u201cBritain is open for business, and open to foreign investment,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cSoftBank\u2019s decision confirms that Britain remains one of the most attractive destinations globally for investors to create jobs and wealth.\u201d However, Hermann Hauser, who helped to found ARM in 1990, criticised the deal. \u201cARM is the greatest achievement of my life. This is a sad day for ARM and a sad day for technology in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the last technology company that is relevant in the UK. There will now be strategic decisions taken in Japan that may or may not help ARM in the UK. \u201cTheresa May is on record as saying she wants an industrial strategy. Given the financial rules, I think it is difficult for her to stop it, but if she wants an industrial strategy and a world-leading technology company, then she should try.\u201d Masayoshi Son, the founder and chief executive of SoftBank, said he was willing to make a legally binding commitment to at least double the workforce at ARM headquarters in Cambridge within the next five years. ARM employs 1,600 people, primarily engineers, at its base at present. \u201cThat specific process is going to be discussed with the Takeover Panel in the next several days and we would like to convert this intention to be legally binding,\u201d Son said, speaking in London on Monday. \u201cWe did not need to do that. It\u2019s just my way of showing commitment to the UK. \u201cAt the end of the fifth year, if we have not doubled the number of employees in UK, the court will have the right to enforce us to do that. I am willing to go that far in my commitment.\u201d Such a legal commitment would be unprecedented and it was welcomed by the government and ARM. A spokeswoman for the prime minister denied that government support for the deal contradicted May\u2019s pledge for an industrial strategy. She said: \u201cWe don\u2019t see it like that. The point she was making was that we should look clearly at each case. This is a \u00a324bn investment into the economy, a commitment to keeping the company in Cambridge and doubling the number of jobs in five years.\u201d The board of ARM has recommended that shareholders accept the offer from the Japanese telecoms and tech group, which controls US mobile phone network Sprint and Yahoo Japan. ARM shareholders will vote on the deal at a meeting scheduled to take place before November, with 75% approval needed for the agreement to be completed. Simon Segars, chief executive of ARM, said the deal was good for Britain. \u201cWhen I look at Masayoshi\u2019s investment history that to me and my board looks like a good environment for ARM to be in right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis allows us to increase our ambition and do more faster.\u201d Son said he wanted to \u201cenhance the winning formula\u201d that ARM had established and maintain its \u201cneutrality and independence\u201d. He denied that the takeover bid is an opportunistic attempt to buy ARM on the cheap following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, despite only starting talks with the UK company two weeks ago. The fall in the value of sterling since the referendum means the pound is now down almost 30% against the Japanese yen compared with a year ago, making it cheaper for SoftBank to invest in the UK. However, shares in ARM have rise by 17% since the referendum because it makes most of its profit in dollars. This means that SoftBank is actually paying more for ARM than it would have done before the 23 June vote. \u201cBrexit did not affect my decision,\u201d Son said. \u201cMany people are worried about Brexit and concerned about the complex situation of the country, but in a good or bad way it did not affect it. I did not make the investment because of Brexit.\u201d Instead, the Japanese tycoon said he was proposing the deal now because he believes ARM can lead the \u201cinternet of things\u201d revolution, in which everyday electrical devices such as fridges are connected to the internet and fitted with chips. \u201cThe next big paradigm shift is coming in IoT [the internet of things],\u201d he said. \u201cARM is going to be everywhere in the internet of things.\u201d Son spoke to the prime minister and chancellor on Sunday before flying to the UK to announce the deal, then met Hammond for face-to-face talks on Monday morning. \u201cI talked about doubling the employment in the UK, keeping the headquarters in the UK, and enhancing the ecosystem in the UK. They said \u2018wow, that\u2019s good\u2019,\u201d Son said. \u201cMany people don\u2019t understand the complicated situation in the country. I am one of the very few people to bet with big cash, not just talk. Talking is easy. The price we are paying is almost 68 times last year\u2019s income. That means the company has to sustain its growth and success for many years to come. I cannot hit and run. I have to truly believe in the future of the UK, the power of engineers in the UK. This is my big bet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The ARM deal may have boosted the UK markets, but elsewhere the mood was fairly uninspired. French and German markets dipped slightly while Italy edged higher and Wall Street struggled to gain ground. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 26.18 points or 0.39% higher at 6695.42, but that was more than accounted for by the gain in ARM (26.5 points). It still represents the highest close since August last year Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.04% to 10,063.13 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.34% lower at 4357.74 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.08% to 16,762.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.08% at 8524.4 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.38% to 555.26 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 4.79 points or 0.03%. Meanwhile after the hawkish comments from MPC member Martin Weale, the pound has added 0.49% to $1.3255. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It has ended up being a fairly uninspiring day on the markets, with only the \u00a324bn deal to buy UK chip designer ARM giving a boost to leading shares. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: There\u2019s really only one story driving the rally in London today, and that\u2019s the bid for ARM Holdings that\u2019s been received from Japan\u2019s SoftBank. Shares in the microchip company are up around 40% and if it hadn\u2019t been for this news, the day\u2019s performance would have been a whole lot more pedestrian. Hawkish comments from BoE policymaker Martin Weale have also done little to buoy sentiment for UK stocks today, although the confidence this kind of message imparts has at least managed to cheer the housebuilders. At the other end of the board, TUI is markedly lower off the back of the weekend\u2019s events in Turkey amidst fears of holidaymakers changing plans for the summer, whilst BHP Billiton is also struggling with word that a subsidiary has seen its debt rating downgraded to junk weighing here. Oil prices are now down around 2% as new data showed a hike in US crude supplies. Market data firm Genscape reported a stock build of 26,460 barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub, following a surge in US supplies of gasoline and distillate last week. Brent crude is currently down $1.03 a barrel at $46.58 while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is down 2.1% at $44.98 a barrel. Wall Street has edged ahead in early trading, continuing to head towards record highs but only gradually. A drop in the oil price has taken the shine off some reasonable company results, with Bank of America beating expectations with its second quarter figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.12% at 18538, compared to its lifetime high of 18557. The proposed takeover of ARM by Japan\u2019s Softbank is an illustration of the consequences of volatility in the global currency markets, says John Haynes, head of research at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment: The announcement of an agreed bid for ARM Holdings by Softbank of Japan is the clearest illustration possible of the consequences of the current global currency volatility. Assuming the bid price, Softbank is paying over 25% less in yen terms compared to over a year ago to acquire this crown jewel of UK, and indeed global, intellectual property. The devaluation of sterling will continue to provide interesting investment opportunities for overseas investors to buy UK assets, including central London property, at a discount. The repercussions of the Brexit decision have yet to be felt. Over the next six to nine months we will see not only the direct effect on growth in the UK and Europe of this blow to business confidence, but also the impact it has on the political landscape. We should take some reassurance from recent market action as it was a high profile challenge to the resilience of the European financial system. The measures central banks have put in place to address outside \u201cshocks\u201d passed an important test, which is an endorsement of the progress made since the Eurozone crisis. Furthermore, as last week\u2019s non-European data indicated, the world economic picture still has many bright spots. The US remains highly resilient whilst the picture in emerging markets is improving. If the last two weeks has taught us anything, it is that Britain is not as important to the world as the world is to Britain, hence the importance of retaining a global perspective when making investment decisions. Our view prior to Brexit was that the world would \u201cmuddle through\u201d and risk takers would be rewarded for their steely nerve. Our view now is the same, but there is less margin for error and a higher level of background political risk. In another sign that Britain remains open for business, US bank Wells Fargo is to buy an 11-storey office block development in the heart of the City in one of the largest real estate deals since the Brexit vote. It has bought the development - 33 Central at 33 King William Street - from property company HB Reavis. The deal will allow the US bank to consolidate its 850 London-based staff in a single location when construction is completed in the third quarter of 2017. Terms of the deal were not revealed but a source told Reuters it was likely to be worth around \u00a3300m. A quick recap. One of the Bank of England\u2019s top policymakers has dampened expectations that UK interest rates will be slashed to fresh record lows next month. Martin Weale argued that Britain may not need immediate reassurance from the BoE, and argued that central bankers shouldn\u2019t act as nursemaids to the markets\u2019 every whim. Weale also predicted that the Brexit vote will make the country poorer, as firms slash spending and hiring. The warning came after a flurry of data showing that the Brexit vote has hurt the economy. The EY Item Club predicted a recession next year. Deloitte reported that business confidence has suffered its worst knock in at least a decade. RightMove warned that asking price for home sales have dipped in the last month. Societe Generale predicted that house prices in some London areas could halve! Elsewhere... The UK government has thrown its backing behind Japanese corporation SoftBank\u2019s \u00a324bn takeover of the tech firm ARM Holdings. Downing Street says the deal is in the national interest, while SoftBank\u2019s CEO Masayoshi Son claims to have wowed Theresa May and Philip Hammond with his pledges to invest in the company and hire more staff. Cambridge\u2019s MP, though, is worried... Turkey\u2019s stock market has now slumped by over 5%, following last week\u2019s coup attempt. The Turkish lira has recovered some of Friday night\u2019s heavy losses, as the Erdogan government asserts control. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, predicts more lira losses: Over time, interest rates will need to be reduced significantly in order to stimulate demand in the economy. But at the same time, this will reduce the appeal of the lira as a higher yielding currency for foreign investors. So whichever way you look at it, the outlook for the Lira looks dire unfortunately. Unsurprisingly, the Adam Smith Institute thinks overseas firms shouldn\u2019t be blocked from buying UK ones. Their head of research, Ben Southwood, says it would be a blunder to consider blocking deals such as the SoftBank/ARM takeover. Here\u2019s his argument: \u201cVetting all foreign bids for British firms represents yet another step on the risky road to \u2018Italyification\u2019 of the UK economy, where inefficient national champions are propped up and those putting money into our growth are scrutinised based on their national origin. \u201cThe fact you can later sell your business to a wider pool of investors\u2014and attract capital from everywhere in the world\u2014is a major driver behind British investment. It is also the foundation of Britain\u2019s world-beating finance industry, which provides an outsized portion of UK output, and UK tax revenues. \u201cBritish economic success has been based on openness to trade and investment for hundreds of years. Theresa May must not put an end to that.\u201d Is he right? Well, ARM is hardly a failing company in need of some foreign expertise. It\u2019s already hugely successful, providing key chips for the iPhone (for example). SoftBank are paying 43% over last week\u2019s share price precisely because ARM is such a good company. Also, SoftBank\u2019s insistence that really wants ARM\u2019s technology, and will help the company grow, should allay fears in Westminster. The Labour MP for Cambridge doesn\u2019t share the Conservative government\u2019s enthusiasm for the \u00a324bn takeover of ARM \u2013 Britain\u2019s preeminent tech company. Daniel Zeichner is concerned about ARM\u2019s long-term future under Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, and isn\u2019t totally convinced by its pledge to double the UK workforce. He told ITV News that: \u201cWell of course the promises are great, but how are those promises going to be guaranteed? Do we know what will happen in 6 months or a year? Do we know much about SoftBank? And they seem to be making some pretty big deals across the world. This is a Cambridge success story upon which the future of the United Kingdom is probably depends because this is what we\u2019re good at.\u201d Holiday firm TUI is the worst-performing stock on the FSTE 100 so far today, shedding over 2%. Traders are calculating that the turmoil in Turkey is going to deter holidaymakers from jetting to its resorts; although recent terrorist attacks had already had an impact. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: TUI is also struggling with that news from Turkey likely to further disrupt travel to the country this summer, although there has been a shift in bookings by holidaymakers for some months now to resorts in the Western Mediterranean. The shock Brexit vote has taken the world\u2019s attention off other issues, such as the ongoing economic crisis in Greece. But the eurozone\u2019s most troubled member hasn\u2019t gone away. And European Comissioner Pierre Moscovici has popped to Athens today, for high-level talks about its current bailout programme. He\u2019s met with prime minister Alexis Tsipras, and discussed the labour reforms and spending cuts that Greece needs to enforce, to get its next tranche of bailout funds (worth around \u20ac2.8bn). Over in Downing Street, Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has told lobby reporters that SoftBank\u2019s takeover of ARM is in the national interest (that\u2019s via Reuters) SoftBank\u2019s CEO, Masayoshi Son, has denied that the Brexit vote prompted him to launch today\u2019s massive \u00a324bn takeover of UK chipmaker ARM. Speaking to reporters in London, Son says the EU referendum did not affect his decision. He says SoftBank is determined to have a big role in the development of the Internet of Things -- the next major area of technology. The FT\u2019s Arash Massoudi is tweeting the key points: Son also declared that Britain\u2019s new political masters are impressed by the deal - and his pledge to double ARM\u2019s UK workforce. Readers with expensive houses in the heart of London should take a deep breath, and stay sitting down. French bank Societe Generale has predicted that house prices in the capital could plunge by over 30%, due to the vote to leave the European Union. That\u2019s based on the idea that highly paid City workers will be forced out of London, if Britain loses access to the single market. That would end the \u2018passporting\u2019 which lets banks in the UK sell services across the EU, and mean banks have to shift overseas. SocGen analyst Marc Mozzi explains the gloomy prognosis: \u201cWhile in recent stress tests, the major U.K. banks were assessed with declines of around 30 percent in commercial real estate prices, we fear that London residential could experience an even more severe downturn. \u201cBrexit will damage the U.K. economy, and some companies will almost certainly have to relocate parts of their business to retain access to the EU single market.\u201d Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, reckons Martin Weale may decline to support an interest rate cut in August: Sky\u2019s Ed Conway isn\u2019t too surprised; Weale is one of the more hawkish MPC members. Buzzfeed\u2019s Simon Neville flags up that the rapid appointment of Theresa May as prime minister may calm the situation: Martin Weale has also warned that the Brexit vote will make the UK population poorer. The Bank of England rate-setter tells his audience in London that: My own view is that, despite any savings resulting from a lower contribution to the EU budget, the nation\u2019s income, and thus people\u2019s incomes, are likely to be reduced as a result of the choice made on 23rd June. Weale is concerned that Britain may not retain full access to the single market, which has delivered useful economies of scale. A failure to retain them would amount to a worsening of Britain\u2019s supply conditions reducing both productivity and household incomes. International competition may also have had the effect of stimulating productivity improvements in domestic firms. He also warns that everyone could suffer, if London\u2019s financial sector takes a hit (perhaps because banks are forced to move operations into the EU): Should life become harder for the financial sector then....that may fall disproportionately on London and the South-East. But, if taxable capacity declines disproportionately as a result, the effects of this on people\u2019s incomes will be spread across the country more evenly than the effects on output. He also produces these two charts, showing how UK business confidence has declined in the last few weeks. Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale has just fired a warning shot at the City, saying interest rates might not be cut in August. Speaking in London, Weale revealed that he is not convinced - yet anyway - that rates need to be slashed from 0.5% to fresh record lows to calm Brexit fears. Weale (who has previously voted to raise interest rates), says: the Bank shouldn\u2019t be worried about disappointing the markets. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is not a nurse to markets. People who trade in markets know that the Monetary Policy Committee sets policy month by month in the way that its members think appropriate. It does sometimes, as we did in our July meeting, give an indication of where policy may go in the future. But that is no more than the best judgement at the time and not in any sense a commitment; the public understand that. Weale also argues that the Bank doesn\u2019t need to act early to reassure households and businesses. In contrast to the experience of 2008, I do not have any sense that either consumers or businesses are panic-struck and, as I observed, there have been no material signs of financial panic. Last week, the Bank of England surprised many economists by voting to leave interest rates on hold. The minutes of the meeting showed that many members of its monetary policy committee expect to agree on a new stimulus package in August. However, that might not necessarily include a rate cut. The MPC could vote to boost quantitative easing (buying bonds from banks with newly created money), or launch new measures to encourage banks to lend to businesses and consumers. The UK will fall into a \u201cshort, shallow recession\u201d around the turn of the year as Brexit hits house prices, jobs and spending, according to forecasters at the EY Item Club. In another dose of gloom, they have slashed their 2017 growth estimate to 0.4% from 2.6%, and warned that Britain\u2019s economy will suffer permanent harm from the decision to leave the EU. The group says: \u201cThere are likely to be severe confidence effects on spending, only partially cushioned by a fall in the pound. \u201cWe would expect a permanent reduction in the level of U.K. output and productivity.\u201d Britain\u2019s new digital minister is also backing the ARM takeover, underlying that SoftBank are not going to be blocked by Westminster. \u201cInvestment\u201d is a funny way of describing a takeover bid -- surely Hancock knows that the money goes to ARM\u2019s shareholders? The government\u2019s eagerness to support the deal is also ironic, as prime minister Theresa May has pledged to protect UK firms in \u2018strategic\u2019 industries from foreign takeovers. Proof that a week really is a long time in politics... Brexit fears have now hit Britain\u2019s housing market, according to the latest data from Rightmove. UK property asking prices have dropped 0.9% over the last month, suggesting that the EU referendum is hitting demand for property. Some sellers may also be trying to get a deal before Britain\u2019s economy has deteriorated. Jeremy Duncombe, director of the Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, reckons its not a reason to panic: \u201cGiven the uncertainty that has followed the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU, it\u2019s not surprising that house prices have decreased month-on-month for the first time in a while. We need however to look at the annual trend and not a month in isolation. House prices are still rising faster much than inflation over a 12 month period, and a slowing of this growth is not necessarily a bad thing. Turkey\u2019s stock market has slumped by 3% in early trading, failing to match the gains in other markets. Traders at the Istanbul Stock Exchange are understandably nervous following last weekend\u2019s failed coup, which is likely to deter businesses from investing in Turkey and holidaymakers from visiting the country. There\u2019s huge trading in the Turkish lira too. It tumbled on Friday night as military officers tried to overthrow president Erdo\u011fan, falling from 2.88 lira to the $1 to 3.04. The lira has now bounced back a bit, as Turkey\u2019s government rounds up thousands of suspected coup plotters. Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence fears Turkey faces further instability: This highlights that Erdogan is eager to exploit the event to expand his power and continue the witch-hunt, further worsening the state of Turkey\u2019s crumbling democracy. Moreover, there is a growing risk of a snap election, as the AKP might seize the opportunity to enlarge its parliamentary majority with the aim of introducing an executive presidency via a constitutional revision. With two opposition parties (the MHP and the HDP) undergoing significant internal turmoil, an early election could deliver the necessary numbers for Erdogan\u2019s dream to be fulfilled. On the external front, the already strained relationship with the US could worsen as a result of Ankara\u2019s increased determination to request the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, who has been quickly accused by the Turkish government of being behind the failed putsch. ARM\u2019s soaring share price has helped to drive the FTSE 100 towards the 11-month intraday high hit last week. The Footsie is up 45 points in early trading to 6715, while the smaller FTSE 250 has gained 1%. Other European stock markets are also up in early trading, as traders remain sanguine despite Brexit concerns and the instability in Turkey. Overnight, a top City fund manager warned that Brexit will be \u201chorrible\u201d for the UK economy. Richard Buxton, the chief executive and head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors (OMGI), says the referendum vote is \u201cstupendously final.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t always agree with Martin Wolf [the Financial Times columnist], but when he wrote the day after that this is probably the single worst event in British postwar history, yeah, I don\u2019t disagree Buxton also laid into the Leave campaign for failing to have a strategy for actually leaving the EU: \u201cYou can criticise the Brexit team for a) an utterly mendacious campaign and b) not expecting that they would really win, so never having a plan. I mean the whole thing is literally unbelievable. It is extraordinary how we have ended up where we are.\u201d Shares in chipmaker ARM Holdings have surged by 45% at the start of trading, as the City reacts to SoftBank\u2019s takeover offer. They\u2019re changing hands for \u00a317.32 each, slightly over the Softbank offer of \u00a317. That suggests investors expect the deal to go through, and there may be some speculation of a rival offer (even though Softbank are paying a 43% premium). Britain\u2019s new finance minister has decided that the takeover of ARM Holdings by SoftBank is a jolly good thing. Philip Hammond argues that the deal shows that the Brexit vote hasn\u2019t hurt Britain\u2019s place in the world, saying: \u201cBritain has lost none of its allure to international investors. Britain is open for business - and open to foreign investment.\u201d He\u2019s tweeting the same message: The deal is also a reminder that the slump in the pound makes UK assets more affordable to overseas investors. The yen has surged by almost a third against the pound over the last year, including a 12% spike since the referendum. However... ARM\u2019s share price has also been boosted by the weak pound (as it earns most of its revenues in foreign currencies). British firms are slashing their spending plans in the face of uncertainty following last month\u2019s EU referendum vote. In a worrying signal, anxiety among UK bosses has hit a five year high, according to accountancy firm Deloitte. Its survey found that 82% of chief financial officers from FTSE 350 and large private companies are planning to cut capital spending in the next year. That\u2019s the biggest amount since the survey began a decade ago, up from 34 percent in the first quarter. And 83% are planning to rein in their hiring plans, in a blow to workers seeking new jobs. Alarmingly, businesses are more pessimistic than after the financial crisis in 2008. Ian Stewart, Deloitte\u2019s chief economist, sums up the situation: \u201cPerceptions of uncertainty have soared to levels last associated with the euro crisis five years ago. \u201cThe spike in uncertainty has had a toxic effect on business sentiment, with optimism dropping to the lowest level since our survey started in 2007 -- lower, even, than in the wake of the failure of Lehman in late 2008.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There are three things on the agenda in the City today. Firstly, the Brexit vote, as companies continue to chew through the implications of last month\u2019s EU referendum. Second, investors are watching the situation in Turkey closely after last weekend\u2019s failed coup attempt. President Erdo\u011fan remains in power, and is now pledging to purge the Turkish state of dissidents. But the sight of tanks on the streets may shake confidence in the country, which is already facing high inflation and a troubled tourism industry. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: Following a turbulent weekend, markets are actually quite calm. The weekend\u2019s main highlight was the failed attempt to overthrow the Turkish government in a military coup d\u2019etat and the subsequent mass detentions of military and judiciary personal. And thirdly, we have some early morning takeover action. ARM Holdings, Britain\u2019s biggest technology company, is being taken over by Japan\u2019s SoftBank in a \u00a324bn deal. Encouragingly, SoftBank are promising to at least double the number of UK employees at ARM, in what looks a massive bet on the Internet of Things [the idea that every object will be linked to the web] We\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day.",

Assuming the bid price, Softbank is paying over 25% less in yen terms compared to over a year ago to acquire this crown jewel of UK, and indeed global, intellectual property.

Over the next six to nine months we will see not only the direct effect on growth in the UK and Europe of this blow to business confidence, but also the impact it has on the political landscape. We should take some reassurance from recent market action as it was a high profile challenge to the resilience of the European financial system. The measures central banks have put in place to address outside \u201cshocks\u201d passed an important test, which is an endorsement of the progress made since the Eurozone crisis. Furthermore, as last week\u2019s non-European data indicated, the world economic picture still has many bright spots. The US remains highly resilient whilst the picture in emerging markets is improving. If the last two weeks has taught us anything, it is that Britain is not as important to the world as the world is to Britain, hence the importance of retaining a global perspective when making investment decisions.</p> <p>Our view prior to Brexit was that the world would \u201cmuddle through\u201d and risk takers would be rewarded for their steely nerve. Our view now is the same, but there is less margin for error and a higher level of background political risk.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578cdcf5e4b08239dbab7cc8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-18T13:45:22.999Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wells Fargo buys City office block development for \u00a3300m</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In another sign that Britain remains open for business, US bank Wells Fargo is to buy an 11-storey office block development in the heart of the City in one of the largest real estate deals since the Brexit vote.<br><br>It has bought the development - 33 Central at 33 King William Street - from property company HB Reavis.

So called \u201cconduct costs\u201d for the 20 banks rose 4.1%, or \u00a310bn, compared with the previous rolling five-year period, 2010-2014. UK-based financial institutions Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays accounted for \u00a311.3bn of extra costs while charges at five other banks fell. The figures were compiled by the CCP Research Foundation, one of the few organisations to collate data published by banks. The numbers include money set aside for future penalties by the 20 banks, selected because they are important for the stability of the financial system. The five-year total is up almost 28% on CCP\u2019s first survey, which covered 2008 to 2012 and began in the early stages of the financial crisis. Costs have increased as regulators have clamped down and unearthed scandals such as the rigging of Libor rates and foreign exchange markets. However, after rising for the previous four years, the single-year total for all banks in the survey fell in 2015 to \u00a328bn from a peak of \u00a363.6bn in 2014. CCP provisions against future costs of \u00a366bn meant the costs of misconduct would continue to affect banks\u2019 profits. But fines against banks appear to have peaked with the record $5.7bn (\u00a34.3bn) doled out last year to six banks for rigging foreign exchange, including \u00a31.5bn for Barclays and \u00a3430m for RBS. British banks were responsible for \u00a366.5bn of the total, up from \u00a354.6bn in the previous five-year period. The main contributor to the rise was Lloyds, where costs rose \u00a34.7bn to \u00a320.2bn \u2013 the biggest increase in the survey. The bank has paid large fines and took a \u00a34bn charge last year for mis-selling of payment protection insurance. RBS\u2019s costs had the next biggest increase, up \u00a33.8bn to \u00a314.7bn, while Barclays\u2019 costs rose \u00a32.8bn to \u00a315.4bn. Taken together, the three British banks\u2019 conduct costs rose 29%. HSBC\u2019s costs rose \u00a31.2bn to \u00a39.9bn and Santander\u2019s fell by \u00a3720m to \u00a36.23bn. Barclays\u2019 increase was matched by Deutsche Bank, whose costs rose to \u00a312.2bn from \u00a39.4bn. All other banks had smaller increases or falling costs. Bank of America had the biggest decrease, with costs dropping almost \u00a310bn to \u00a354.8bn, although that was the biggest total. Roger McCormick, CCP\u2019s managing director and head of the conduct costs report, said: \u201cIt remains to be seen whether banks can truly claim that these problems are now behind them (whether or not the costs themselves may be) and reassure us that they are legacy issues. \u201cWe look forward to the time when we can report on marked and sustained falls in conduct costs. Not even the largest banks can now settle for regarding them merely as costs of doing business. The public would hardly condone such an attitude or see it as consistent with a desire to regain trust.\u201d Fines imposed by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority plunged more than 99% in the first half of 2016 to \u00a37.2m from \u00a3819m a year earlier. CPP said this suggested provisions were for costs other than fines. The FCA, whose chief executive Andrew Bailey started on 1 July, may face questions on the drop-off in fines at its annual public meeting on Tuesday.",

Okaaaaay, maybe that\u2019s not familiar to you at all. But it seems to be for some people: following pressure from anti-porn groups, McDonald\u2019s has moved to block sexual content from most of its US (and all of its UK) restaurants. Starbucks is set to follow suit \u2013 terrible news for anyone who enjoys watching a bit of smut with their salted caramel mocha. But if porn is off the menu at McDonald\u2019s, then just what is available? Have they become totalitarian overlords dictating our entire browsing history? Or do they just not want customers to pleasure themselves in public while they eat a McChicken sandwich? Armed with nothing but an iPhone and a McCaf\u00e9 coffee, I set out to see just how much freedom I\u2019m allowed. I kick things off with some quick Googling: \u201cIs McDonald\u2019s an unethical global slaughterhouse?\u201d Ping! Up come the results. I log on to YouTube and stream Supersize Me, Morgan Spurlock\u2019s documentary where he made himself sick eating nothing but food from McDonald\u2019s for a month. On the down side, it shows a man staggering around ashen-faced while doctors inform him he\u2019s severely damaging his health, which tends to put you off your cheeseburger. But on the plus side, the Wi-Fi here is superb. I can download songs, films and even the entire Chilcot report, the first 157 pages of which appear in my browser almost instantaneously. I attempt to visit some virulently anti-McDonald\u2019s websites \u2013 McSpotlight, McCruelty and the Facebook group I Am Vomitin It \u2013 and they all come up no problem. Where to go from here? I find a site that tells me how to dispose of a dead body (use sulphuric acid, then pour it down a storm drain, apparently).

Okaaaaay, maybe that\u2019s not familiar to you at all. But it seems to be for some people: following pressure from anti-porn groups, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/15/news/companies/starbucks-mcdonalds-wifi-porn/\">McDonald\u2019s has moved to block sexual content</a> from most of its US (and all of its UK) restaurants. Starbucks is set to follow suit \u2013 terrible news for anyone who enjoys watching a bit of smut with their salted caramel mocha.</p> <p>But if porn is off the menu at McDonald\u2019s, then just what is available? Have they become totalitarian overlords dictating our entire browsing history? Or do they just not want customers to pleasure themselves in public while they eat a McChicken sandwich?</p> <p>Armed with nothing but an iPhone and a McCaf\u00e9 coffee, I set out to see just how much freedom I\u2019m allowed. I kick things off with some quick Googling: \u201cIs McDonald\u2019s an unethical global slaughterhouse?\u201d Ping! Up come the results. I log on to YouTube and stream Supersize Me, Morgan Spurlock\u2019s documentary where he made himself sick eating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/16/foodanddrink.shopping\">nothing but food from McDonald\u2019s for a month</a>. On the down side, it shows a man staggering around ashen-faced while doctors inform him he\u2019s severely damaging his health, which tends to put you off your cheeseburger. But on the plus side, the Wi-Fi here is superb. I can download songs, films and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/12/chilcot-report-reveals-lessons-forgotten-since-1945\">even the entire Chilcot report</a>, the first 157 pages of which appear in my browser almost instantaneously. I attempt to visit some virulently anti-McDonald\u2019s websites \u2013 McSpotlight, McCruelty and the Facebook group I Am Vomitin It \u2013 and they all come up no problem.</p> <p>Where to go from here? I find a site that tells me how to dispose of a dead body (use sulphuric acid, then pour it down a storm drain, apparently). I glance up at the staff and start to get a bit paranoid in case anyone is checking my history. I scale things down and watch some Sky Sports News for a bit.

      "bodyText": "When a courier rings your doorbell with the latest delivery from the virtual high street, there\u2019s a good chance they work for Hermes, the German-owned delivery giant that is on course to deliver more than a quarter of a billion parcels to British households this year. Such is the UK consumer\u2019s appetite for online shopping, Hermes\u2019 parcel load is increasing by as much as 15% a year. Hermes couriers, alongside workers at the Royal Mail\u2019s ParcelForce and other companies such as Yodel, are the footsoldiers of the internet shopping boom. But while most of ParcelForce\u2019s deliverers earn an hourly wage with sick pay and paid holiday, every one of Hermes\u2019 10,500 couriers is self-employed. They are paid per parcel \u2013 48p is common, but it can be more. Yodel, with 8,000 couriers, operates a similar system. They are all part of the \u201cgig economy\u201d made famous by Uber, the most valuable private company in the world despite none of the taxi drivers that work under its flag being employees. For the business owners, the perfectly legal arrangement allows expensive risk to be transferred to the drivers. If they get sick, crash their vehicle, need a holiday or want to retire on a pension, they \u2013 not the business \u2013 will have to pay for it. The quid pro quo, the companies argue, is that these individuals have no obligation to work set hours and are free to stop and start as it suits them. Hermes calls them \u201clifestyle couriers\u201d. For John, a courier in a Yorkshire former mining town, the Hermes lifestyle starts early. At 5.15am one morning last month, he stirred a cup of instant coffee and logged on to find out how many parcels he had for the day: 92. He jumped into his battered hatchback and drove to the sub-depot, where for the next 90 minutes he helped sort the overnight deliveries for the couriers to collect. It was hard work at an unsociable hour for no money, and not work he was required to do, but John did it so he could start his round on time. The alternative is to wait around unpaid. Hermes says that it has \u201cmechanisms in place to pay couriers for their assistance\u201d. At 7.45am, he crammed parcels of every shape and size into his car. There was a garden fountain, piles of clothes, a shower tidy and a mattress topper. He drove quickly through his route, leaping from his car seat, sprinting up paths, scanning barcodes with the handheld terminal strapped to his wrist and lugging big 16kg boxes, getting progressively more out of breath as the hours wore on. Couriers supply their own cars and tyres wear out fast, handbrakes fail from the repeated stopping and starting and exhausts are sometimes ripped from undercarriages on rough lanes delivering to remote addresses. Last year, John calculated he spent \u00a35,417 of his \u00a321,006 earnings on fuel and other running costs. He is one of the fastest couriers at his depot and so is among the highest earners, but he still said he felt \u201ccheated\u201d by not being covered by the minimum wage. \u201cMy pay seems to have decreased over the past year,\u201d he said. \u201cHermes get round these cuts by introducing bonus payments. But they are so difficult to achieve that it is effectively a pay cut.\u201d Hermes\u2019 system of pay is complex. Each courier has different rates for different-sized parcels. Marie, a mother of three who delivers in the Greater Manchester area, gets 48p per parcel and packet, 85p for a heavy package and \u00a31 for anything defined as heavy and large. If she collects a parcel, she gets 50p. Earlier this year, Hermes promised to boost earnings with up to \u00a34 a day in bonuses, though they are easy to miss. If Hermes receives more than one customer inquiry per 280 parcels delivered because the courier is \u201cat fault/non-compliant\u201d, the courier loses a \u00a31 bonus. The target for a \u00a32 bonus for delivering parcels in two-hour windows requested by customers is equally tough \u2013 95% delivered or attempted delivery. To get the final pound, couriers must deliver or attempt to deliver 97.5% of parcels each day. If more than 10% of parcels have to be carried over to the next day the bonus is also lost. Hermes delivers seven days a week and all the couriers the Guardian spoke to routinely worked six days a week. The job can be gruelling. Earlier this month, one man complained to John that he was driving too fast and threatened that \u201cbefore long I would be lying in a hospital bed, because he\u2019ll have put me there\u201d. Time off for injuries \u2013 dog bites are not uncommon \u2013 is not paid by Hermes. Cherie Nolan, a long-term Hermes courier from Manchester, quit recently when a regular customer threatened violence in a dispute over whether a parcel had been delivered. \u201cI was physically shaking,\u201d she said. \u201cI said I am not going to be put in this situation for 45p a parcel. The job\u2019s too stressful and for not enough money. \u201cThe last time I had two weeks off together was seven years ago. I had three weekends off two years ago and that was to go to my grandparents\u2019 funerals. I never take time off. You can\u2019t, because if you do and your cover courier lets you down, you are coming back to no work.\u201d This is perhaps the biggest concern among many couriers: the lack of cover so they can take time off. Asked about the pressure to find cover, Hermes insisted couriers are \u201cfree to negotiate \u2026 the number of days they work, including weekends,\u201d and that there are about 4,000 \u201ccover couriers\u201d available to step in. But the experience of some couriers is different. Marie claimed her local Hermes manager took half of her work away as a punishment for not working 28 December last year, a bank holiday, even though she had given two months\u2019 notice. \u201cThe day I came back, there were no rounds available when I logged on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said because I didn\u2019t come in on 28 December and a couple of Sundays in the run-up to Christmas, because I don\u2019t work Sundays, they took half my round off me. I was very angry. I was getting just 15 parcels a day. It wasn\u2019t even covering my bills.\u201d Hermes gave her the round back after two months, she said. Hermes said most couriers have substitutes to cover their rounds and field managers specifically recruit \u201ccover couriers\u201d. After expenses, taking into account the number of parcels she delivers and the time it takes her to do it, she earns about \u00a37.70 an hour, just above the national living wage. But that does not include any time waiting at the depot for parcels, sick pay or holidays, or the \u00a31,000 handbreak repair her car needed recently. Lucy, a courier in Derbyshire, said many Hermes couriers \u201clive in constant fear of WYW \u2013 withdrawal of your work\u201d. She provided figures that suggested she earned less than \u00a36 an hour. \u201cYou can only have holiday if you can find someone to do your job for you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can have our work withdrawn in a heartbeat,\u201d said Nina, another courier in Yorkshire. \u201cThere is no stability, no security. We are all treading water trying to stay afloat. You never know when the phone is going to ring and they withdraw your work.\u201d Hermes operates in a highly competitive industry where consumers are expecting to pay less and less for deliveries and retailers want higher levels of service. Hermes\u2019 own research found that 43% of UK shoppers now expect to pay nothing for deliveries, while Next is narrowing its timeslots for home deliveries to two-hour windows from December. Uber, which also relies on self-employed drivers, is rumoured to be considering entering the market. \u201cThe cost per parcel is going down in real terms,\u201d said John Nicholson, a parcel industry consultant. \u201cCompanies have achieved that by moving from an employee model to a self-employed model. If an employee has to try and deliver a parcel twice they get paid both times. In the Hermes and Yodel model, they only get paid once.\u201d Nicholson said Hermes\u2019 rising profitability \u201cis on the back of the lifestyle couriers who have had little or no increase in what they get per parcel for the last three years\u201d. \u201cThey have no commitment to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey only pay them when deliveries are made. There is no holiday, no sick pay, any training is done in the person\u2019s own time and if they need to downsize they can do that without any redundancy costs. They don\u2019t have to pay the minimum wage and the people supply their own transport. They would argue that the pressure to respond to low pricing by the retailers and competition in the industry means they can\u2019t afford an employee model.\u201d The names of the couriers called by only a first name have been changed.",

I was very angry. I was getting just 15 parcels a day. It wasn\u2019t even covering my bills.\u201d</p> <p>Hermes gave her the round back after two months, she said.

Apparently it shows that \u201cBritain has lost none of its allure to international investors\u201d since the EU referendum. Philip Hammond\u2019s response to SoftBank\u2019s planned purchase of ARM Holdings was ludicrous, or at least grossly superficial. SoftBank is indeed making a big bet on a British company. But the gamble is on ARM\u2019s ability to find riches in the \u201cinternet of things\u201d, the idea that cars and buildings will be adorned with more and better microchips in the coming years. The specifically UK angle is different. It is not the post-Brexit vote currency factor, which is debatable, since dollar-earning ARM\u2019s share price has risen by 17% since the referendum. Rather, it\u2019s the timing of SoftBank\u2019s approach, which looks highly suspicious. The Japanese company might simply have wanted to get in quickly before May\u2019s government puts in place a national interest test for foreign takeovers. It was, after all, only a week ago that May said she would cut all the political platitudes about \u201cstakeholder societies\u201d and do something radical. The prime minister was damning on how David Cameron\u2019s government almost allowed AstraZeneca to be sold to Pfizer, the US pharmaceuticals company that May described as having a \u201ctrack record of asset stripping and whose self-confessed attraction to the deal was to avoid tax\u201d. She concluded: \u201cA proper industrial strategy wouldn\u2019t automatically stop the sale of British firms to foreign ones, but it should be capable of stepping in to defend a sector that is as important as pharmaceuticals is to Britain.\u201d For pharmaceuticals, read technology. ARM and AstraZeneca, in different ways, are cornerstones of a vision of Cambridge as a 21st-century centre of excellence in research-led, advanced technology. May\u2019s government, following her welcome remarks last week, should explain in detail why the Pfizer and SoftBank proposals are different in character. As it happens, a fair argument could be constructed that the SoftBank deal is superior. Pfizer had a grim record of cutting research budgets at every turn. SoftBank\u2019s history is different. Its founder and chairman, Masayoshi Son, is long-termist in outlook and tends to give his shareholders and bondholders heart attacks with the boldness of some of his bets. In any case, soft-pedalling on investment would probably be self-defeating for SoftBank. ARM\u2019s leadership in designing chips for microprocessors is sustained by big research and development budgets, and the recruitment of top-class engineers. SoftBank, currently a non-player in the chip market, is also a credible guarantor of ARM\u2019s neutrality, another of the British company\u2019s competitive advantages. Neutrality, meaning that ARM does not discriminate between customers, is one reason why it has been able to grab a 95% share of the chips used in mobile phones. Thus, SoftBank might pass most versions of a credible national interest test. There are long-term risks to the UK in allowing ARM to be consumed by a large foreign owner with competing claims on its investment resources. On the other hand, technology entrepreneurs might be less inclined to launch businesses in the UK if they believed that they did not have a free hand when selling. Maybe the SoftBank deal would fall on the right side of that tradeoff. But Hammond, before attempting to massage headlines, should demonstrate that the government has done some serious work. It is absurd to opine about the benefits for Britain before you have heard from people with harder intelligence, such as UK technology leaders and investors, many of whom are already lamenting the takeover of ARM. Here are two basic questions that the chancellor should have answered before tweeting glib soundbites. First, is SoftBank\u2019s intention to double the number of ARM employees in the UK over five years worth the paper it isn\u2019t yet written on? The Takeover Panel will police the promise, but what penalty would non-adherence bring? The UK courts haven\u2019t yet tested this new system. Even a punishment of a few million quid wouldn\u2019t hurt a company of SoftBank\u2019s size. In practice, then, SoftBank\u2019s pledge seems no more binding than those that Cameron attempted to extract from Pfizer. Indeed, SoftBank may be \u201ccommitting\u201d to do something that ARM would have done under its own steam. Second, what happens if there is a counter-bid for ARM from a less long-termist company? Would Hammond be so welcoming if, say, the would-be buyer was a consortium of US private equity barons? What about a South Korean microchip manufacturer that licenses ARM\u2019s designs? Such an owner might jeopardise ARM\u2019s neutrality and damage long-term investment in the UK. Would Hammond want to intervene? If so, what would he actually do? At the very least, May and Hammond should draw an early lesson from the bid for ARM: if you are going to abolish or refine the UK\u2019s open doors takeover regime, get on with it. SoftBank might pass a light sniff test, but others will not. And the grubbier brigade may interpret Hammond\u2019s verbal gymnastics as powerlessness.",

      "bodyText": "Less than a month after the abrupt resignation of Masayoshi Son\u2019s anointed successor raised questions about SoftBank\u2019s appetite for overseas investments, the group has made its ambitions clear with a \u00a324bn move on ARM Holdings, Britain\u2019s most successful technology company. Monday\u2019s cash deal marks the start of the mobile technology company\u2019s quest to add semiconductors to its eclectic business portfolio and be a key part of the shift towards artificial intelligence, something that Son, SoftBank\u2019s chief executive, has described as \u201cthe biggest paradigm shift in human history\u201d. While declaring his determination to devote the rest of his career to AI and the \u201cinternet of things\u201d, Son has specialised in the acquisition of things since he founded the company 35 years ago. In the years leading up to what was supposed to be his retirement, just over a year from now, he has overseen an array of overseas investments, culminating in the agreed takeover of ARM, SoftBank\u2019s biggest acquisition, on Monday. SoftBank previously acquired Vodafone\u2019s Japanese business and is attempting to transform the fortunes of the lossmaking US telecoms company Sprint, after taking a $20bn (\u00a315bn) majority stake in 2013, in what was the biggest foreign acquisition by a Japanese company at the time. \u201cThis is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank\u2019s growth strategy going forward,\u201d Son said. \u201cARM will be an excellent strategic fit with the SoftBank group as we invest to capture the very significant opportunities provided by the internet of things.\u201d In Japan, overseas acquisitions are a sign of weakening confidence in the outlook for the domestic economy, as the country deals with more than two decades of stagnation and faces long-term population decline. Despite a group portfolio that includes Yahoo Japan, the country\u2019s third-largest mobile carrier, and a humanoid robotics unit, Son has spoken of his hunger to explore \u201ca few more crazy ideas\u201d, funded by the $18bn war chest that SoftBank accumulated by offloading some of its assets, including part of a stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba. Son took a $20m stake in Alibaba, founded by Jack Ma in 1999. The bet paid off handsomely, with the value of SoftBank\u2019s stake soaring to $65bn after Alibaba\u2019s record IPO in the US in 2014. However, as recently as last month, corporate Japan had been readying itself for his exit, as he prepared Nikesh Arora to lead the company into the next information revolution. Arora\u2019s shock resignation in June, nearly two years after he moved to SoftBank from Google, came after Son indicated that he was going to renege on an agreement to hand over the reins on his 60th birthday next year. Many consider Son, 58, born in Japan but of Korean heritage, to be a rarity in the Japanese business world: charismatic, visionary and willing to take on the establishment. With an estimated net worth of $14.9bn, Japan\u2019s second-richest man has also built a reputation as a philanthropist, having pledged to donate 10bn yen and all his salary until retirement to support victims of the country\u2019s triple disaster in March 2011. Last month, Son stood before 2,000 SoftBank shareholders, still reeling from Arora\u2019s departure, and admitted that he had been \u201csomewhat greedy\u201d in wanting to stay on for at least another five to 10 years. \u201cI asked myself whether I have run out of energy and ambition,\u201d he said. As ARM prepares to sell up for \u00a317 a share, 43% more than its closing share price on Friday, and for the promised doubling of its UK workforce, Son has answered his own question in typically emphatic fashion.",

      "bodyText": "Doubts about the need for a cut in interest rates have been voiced by a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee before next month\u2019s meeting. Martin Weale, who will be stepping down from the MPC after six years, said he wanted to weigh up the impact of Brexit on the economy before making up his mind on how to vote. Weale said the Bank would have to balance the likely reduction in demand against upward pressure on inflation when it make its decision. Weale said: \u201cFor there to be a case for easing policy I will need to expect weakness in output to be large enough to compensate for any overshoot in inflation on the assumption that policy is unchanged in the near term.\u201d Sterling rose on the foreign exchanges after Weale\u2019s remarks at a conference in London, since they were seen as less supportive of action to underpin growth than interventions last week by two other MPC members \u2013 Andy Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe. Haldane called for a big package of measures to support the post-Brexit economy and stressed the need for a prompt and robust response to the uncertainty. Vlieghe was the only MPC member to back a rate cut at the July meeting. Weale said the result of the referendum on 23 June had led to a \u201cvery high degree of uncertainty\u201d about the implications of Brexit, and this meant there was a case for waiting to see what the implications might be. Weale added that he thought the short-term impact on demand would be greater than that on the economy\u2019s supply capacity, which would dampen inflation. In his valedictory speech as an MPC member, Weale rejected two of the arguments used to justify lower borrowing costs. First, he dismissed the notion that markets would be disappointed were there to be no easing in August, noting that market participants should remember that the MPC sets policy each month, not in advance. \u201cThe Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is not a nurse to markets,\u201d he said. Weale also gave short shrift to the idea that early action was needed to reassure people. \u201cIn contrast to the experience of 2008, I do not have any sense that either consumers or businesses are panic-struck and \u2026 there have been no material signs of financial panic.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Is YouTube wrecking the music industry \u2013\u00a0or putting new artists in the spotlight?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As artists, record labels, music publishers and managers line up to lobby the US Congress and the European Union, it might seem as if YouTube is the worst thing to happen to the music business since Napster in 1999. The streaming service, the aggrieved parties claim, is causing a massive \u201cvalue gap\u201d that is unsustainable. In brief, millions of users watching billions of videos are contributing peanuts towards ad revenue. The video service is also, they feel, building a huge business around their copyrights by gaming the safe harbour exemptions in the law, which mean it is absolved of guilt if its users upload music without a licence and only has to comply if told to take it down. According to those who oppose the service, YouTube is slowly killing the music industry, one tiny cut at a time. It is anti-artist and anti-copyright, they claim. Meanwhile, every major artist has a channel on YouTube and wouldn\u2019t dream of releasing a new record without YouTube involved in its launch. Although many have a conflicted relationship with YouTube, there is a generational conflict dividing the field. Those in the \u201cold\u201d music industry want to keep things the way they always were, nailing down copyright in every way possible. Yet around them a \u201cnew\u201d business is emerging \u2013 prescient and whip-smart artists, managers, labels and media organisations \u2013 who see YouTube as a facilitator of a creative renaissance rather than a death sentence. Leeds-based singer-songwriter Hannah Trigwell describes discovering YouTube\u2019s promotional potential as \u201clike finding treasure\u201d. Six years ago, she started uploading videos of her own songs, all without using her real name, to avoid her classmates finding out what she was doing. It was a stark contrast to the busking she had been doing. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a fanbase at the time and it was difficult to get gigs with promoters because no one knew who I was,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was obvious to me that unless I was very lucky with the right person coming along at the right time, I was going to have to forge my own journey.\u201d She praises the immediacy of the YouTube platform, whereby she can get instant feedback on songs or works in progress, as well as its global reach. A cover of Tracy Chapman\u2019s Fast Car was a success on her channel and the data tools YouTube supplies to all users revealed an unexpected detail: her fastest growing audience was in south-east Asia. Although Trigwell knows she cannot survive on YouTube income alone, she believes it provides opportunities for profit to be made. \u201cYouTube is definitely my main focus, but it is primarily a promotional tool,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things that come indirectly from YouTube \u2013 the touring and selling merchandise online \u2013 would be impossible without it.\u201d Having recently signed a partnership deal with Absolute Label Services \u2013 a music marketing and distribution company \u2013 she does not see YouTube as a fast track to a traditional record contract. \u201cIf the right one came along I would consider it, but I\u2019m not desperate for a record deal as I am a full-time musician right now,\u201d she says. \u201cYouTube has made it possible to be like that.\u201d Amid the mounting assault, YouTube argues that it has introduced tools specifically for the music industry, notably \u201ccards\u201d that let owners annotate their videos and create links to ticketing sites, streaming sites and download stores \u2013 essentially turning YouTube feeds into sales channels. \u201cThe music industry were our very first partners on YouTube \u2013 the first ones to sign agreements,\u201d says Candice Morrissey, head of YouTube music partnerships in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \u201cWe have a revenue share arrangement with our content partners, so the more they succeed the more we succeed. The more revenues that are created, the better it is for everybody. We hear their complaints about the amount of consumption, but I feel they are maybe not looking at it in the right way or through the right lens. The advertising business model is based on consumption. We want these revenues to grow in the future and we are convinced the advertising model will work for everybody.\u201d Morrissey adds that while she wants the service to be as successful as possible, the industry should not be solely dependent on a single platform. \u201cEven the biggest YouTube stars are developing businesses outside of YouTube \u2013 doing a book or making movies,\u201d she says. \u201cThat makes a lot of sense. YouTube is the focus for them as that is where their engaged audience is.\u201d Traditionally it has been the label that has sat between the artist and the audience, and their business model has revolved around the acquisition and exploitation of sound recording rights: insisting on being paid for every use and refusing to loosen their stranglehold on copyrights. NoCopyrightSounds (the clue is in the name) was set up in 2011 by Billy Woodford to address a problem for his video games review channel on YouTube. He wanted to use music in those videos, but the only copyright-free music online \u2013 on sites such as Creative Commons was \u2013 to his taste, not very good. There was also a risk of having a copyright strike against his channel if he used music from a label without paying for it. His idea was to scour SoundCloud for good copyright-free music and make it available to gamers, and others on YouTube, for free. All they had to do was list the name of the artist and song so any viewers, if they liked the music, could investigate further. \u201cI was just promoting free music,\u201d Woodford says of the early days of NCS. \u201cI saw a pretty good business opportunity as no one else was doing it. Still to this day, record labels haven\u2019t seen the potential in this.\u201d The business model behind NCS is to use YouTube and YouTubers to build interest in music and for that to be monetised elsewhere. It regards YouTube as the starting point to make money through other channels \u2013 primarily via links to Spotify and Apple Music. \u201cThe way I have always seen it is people using our music are showcasing it in their videos to potentially hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d Woodford explains. \u201cIf you get 10% of those people who like the song [to play it elsewhere], it keeps growing like that.\u201d Those using NCS music in their videos are politely asked to list the song details and maybe add links to premium music services \u2013 but NCS will not take the music down if the user does not do this. It is largely left to good faith as opposed to the licence-first strategy of labels. \u201cA lot of the big YouTubers always credit the artists,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to start bringing licences into it. I just want to keep in on trust that YouTube creators will credit us.\u201d Alan Walker could soon be a superstar thanks to this new ecosystem. He got his break via NCS. The 18-year-old British-Norwegian uploaded his track Fade to YouTube via NoCopyrightSounds and gained huge interest. A rewrite and a remix of the song, as Faded, with a new top line, got him a deal with Sony Music Sweden and the video has now drawn 488m views \u2013 about a third of the views of Adele\u2019s Hello. \u201cIt struck me as a brilliant way to make music and to market music,\u201d says Gunnar Greve Pettersen, Walker\u2019s manager and co-writer on Faded. \u201cWhat Alan had achieved when he was signed to NCS was a big reason why he treated it more like a marketing channel and a way to distribute his music. There is definitely a different approach and strategy within NCS and the other YouTube-based companies [compared with] the traditional music industry. They have completely opposite approaches in how to utilise YouTube and other digital platforms.\u201d Working hand-in-hand with NCS is AEI Group, which has invested in the company and provides infrastructure for it. They both operate under this new way of thinking that cuts free from the traditional approaches that they feel limits the new industry. Diluk Dias, MD of AEI Group, believes YouTube is a godsend. His company looks for music on SoundCloud, tests and builds it on YouTube and then makes money from Spotify streams, downloads and ticket sales. \u201cYou should see YouTube as a platform for engagement and to build a relationship \u2013 to pull people into your paid funnels elsewhere,\u201d Dias says. He feels YouTube channels have been key in building Faded\u2019s popularity. For example, the track features in a video made by tech channel TechRax, in which someone drops an iPhone into a lava lamp. That video has now passed 14m views but was not monetised. Rather, it was seen as a way to extend the track\u2019s reach. \u201cWe have not used Content ID [YouTube\u2019s copyright identification system] and have not set it to monetise the track,\u201d says Dias of Faded. \u201cWe gave this piece of content to everyone on YouTube and invited them to distribute it far and wide. We put links to Spotify and iTunes in there and it got to 30m plays on Spotify fairly quickly. It was also doing a few thousand downloads a week on iTunes. We were not concerned about the monetisation [of use on other YouTube videos].\u201d The track is now on 405m streams on Spotify which means, based on its average per-stream rate of $.0007, it would have generated roughly $2.8m (\u00a32.1m) in songwriting and recorded music royalties. YouTube was seen as pivotal in promoting the track and the thinking is that, without it, it would never have taken off on Spotify. With its expansive reach and helpful data, YouTube is, in Dias\u2019 eyes, more powerful than radio \u2013 which the music industry still sees as the kingmaker for hits. \u201cRadio is now almost the last place [we go to],\u201d he says of how his own company\u2019s promotional strategies and priorities have changed. \u201cBy the time you have built the record on streaming services and on YouTube, it\u2019s already a hit and is already making money for you. For me that is hugely exciting.\u201d James Gaster is the founder of Mahogany Sessions, a YouTube channel designed to showcase and break new acts. He believes YouTube has allowed his business to exist but also get to a point where it is big enough to attract brands and sponsors who will help bankroll what they do. The assault on YouTube is more political than is being let on, he says. \u201cWith all the major label contracts coming up for renegotiation it makes absolute sense [to attack it],\u201d Gaster explains. \u201cThese are huge businesses run by intelligent people and as much as it\u2019s a mud-slinging exercise at the moment, I am hopeful they will reach a middle ground where artists are being [properly] remunerated and YouTube continues to grow its platform and its offerings to artists. YouTube has given us and many independent artists an audience and an opportunity to build a brand. That\u2019s allowed us to exercise a business that goes far beyond what\u2019s on YouTube.\u201d None of this is likely to change the minds of the major labels, major publishers and the \u201c1%\u201d of pop stars such as Paul McCartney, Elton John and Taylor Swift, who are steadfast in their belief that YouTube must be taken to task. But while their status means they dominate the headlines, their stance does not reflect the industry as a whole. Besides, the music business has never been completely united on any industry change, and YouTube is no exception.",

The streaming service, the aggrieved parties claim, is causing a massive \u201cvalue gap\u201d that is unsustainable. In brief, millions of users watching billions of videos are contributing peanuts towards ad revenue. The video service is also, they feel, building a huge business around their copyrights by gaming the safe harbour exemptions in the law, which mean it is absolved of guilt if its users upload music without a licence and only has to comply if told to take it down.</p> <p> According to those who oppose the service, YouTube is slowly killing the music industry, one tiny cut at a time. It is anti-artist and anti-copyright, they claim. Meanwhile, every major artist has a channel on YouTube and wouldn\u2019t dream of releasing a new record without YouTube involved in its launch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/13/taylor-swift-youtube-music-royalties-battle\">Taylor Swift is taking on YouTube, and it won\u2019t be an easy fight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although many have a conflicted relationship with YouTube, there is a generational conflict dividing the field.

      "bodyText": "Despite continuing global concerns - the fallout from Brexit, the attempted coup in Turkey - the proposed \u00a324bn takeover of technology group ARM by Japan\u2019s Softbank has sent leading shares higher. The FTSE 100 is currently up 24.10 points at 6693.34, with Arm accounting for all that and more (nearly 28 points). The Japanese move has put the spotlight on other possible acquisitions, with analysts pointing out that the recent fall in the pound following the Brexit vote has left UK company valuations looking attractive. Peel Hunt said: Despite the recent economic and political uncertainty, we note that an all-cash deal has been agreed. We continue to believe that UK technology companies could be acquisition targets for large global companies looking to add intellectual property or customers (the deal rationale for Softbank in our view) and expect to see further M&amp;A activity in the sector. We could see near-term investor interest in other semiconductor names (eg IQE and Imagination Technologies); global leaders (eg GBGroup, NCC, Accesso); Internet of Things/virtual/augmented reality plays (eg Telit, Bango); or larger UK tech names with strong free cash flow and dividend (eg Micro Focus). ARM\u2019s smaller rival Imagination Technologies is benefitting from the speculation, up 19.25p at 205.5p. But it is not just technology companies which could be snapped up, according to Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital: Firstly, we can see in this deal the effect of Brexit and the collapse in the pound as British companies become ripe takeover targets. The pound is down around 10% since the referendum and this makes British firms a lot more attractive. Poundland was recently snapped up by Steinhoff and if this ARM deal is anything to go by, we can expect a torrent of deals to flow. Fears that Brexit would kill off deals in the UK seems to have been overblown \u2013 Britain is very much open for business and the weak pound is key. A lot more British firms could become foreign-owned quite soon. Secondly, ARM is without question an appealing prize. It has grown thanks to booming smartphone sales in recent years, but it is reducing its dependency here. Elsewhere mining shares are slipping back ahead of the sector results, with BHP Billiton down 21.3p at 975.2p. Credit Suisse has also issued a downbeat note: The mining sector has rebounded strongly this year. Credit concerns have diminished and prices have rallied, particularly steel inputs. Post Brexit we raise target prices by around 10% to reflect a weaker pound, but most share prices are now close to our target prices and the sector is no longer cheap against the underlying commodities. Earnings risk is positive, but looking out to 2017 we continue to see supply headwinds in the two most important earnings drivers - iron ore and copper. [At the results] we expect more optimistic outlook statements with more focus on medium-term growth options, but this will be an important balancing act. Tui is down 25p at 936.5p, the biggest faller in the leading index, after the Turkish unrest. Tour operators have been suffering recently in the wake of a number of terrorist attacks. Rival Thomas Cook is down 1.9p at 61.9p. Lower down the market Aim-listed Transense Technologies has jumped 50% to 1.5p after it unveiled a licensing deal with GE for its surface acoustic wave technology, sensors which measure the torque, temperature and pressure of tyres in industrial environments. Analysts at finnCap said: The group has achieved a notable licence agreement with GE for use of its SAW technology; GE is the second major manufacturer to sign a commercial licence on this technology, the other being Emerson, and together these deals signal the potential commercial value of the SAW technology. The group has also announced a year-end trading update, with revenues in line with previous guidance, albeit still held back by the deferred investment decisions by mining sector customers. No change to our 2016 trading forecasts. The shares should react well to this positive and encouraging licence agreement.",
