A skills shortage in the sector is making it hard for recruiters to meet rising demand, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said. It added that a vote to leave the EU at next month\u2019s referendum would exacerbate the problem. Research by REC found that two-thirds of recruiters had seen demand for temporary construction workers increase over the last year. Four in 10 said finding bricklayers was particularly difficult. Those recruiting for London projects said wages were rising as a result, with bricklayers earning up to \u00a325 an hour. The figures for London are based on 14 recruiters, almost half of which place more than 100 temporary construction workers every week. Outside the capital a fifth of bricklayers were being paid between \u00a320 and \u00a325, and the rest less. REC\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Green, said workers were earning \u00a334 a week more than last year on average. \u201cOur data indicates that some employers are increasing pay faster as the competition for skilled workers intensifies,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile this is great news for builders and tradesmen, there are hard questions that need to be asked about the sustainability of this trend.

Just under a third said it would make no difference. Green said if Britain votes to leave the EU \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt that recruitment for some construction roles will become even more of a challenge\u201d. However, he said that whatever the outcome of the referendum \u201cwe need to address deep-seated skills shortages\u201d. The latest employment figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the sector was the second-biggest job creator in 2015 and that by December there were 2.2m jobs in construction in the UK. The data also showed that average wages were up by 6.5% year on year in March.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail business was warned before the sale of BHS that Dominic Chappell, the man who led the buyout, had been declared bankrupt and lacked experience in the retail industry. Paul Budge, the finance director of Arcadia, admitted that the company was aware that Chappell had been declared bankrupt at least once and was \u201ccautious\u201d about the sale, MPs heard on Monday. However, he and a collection of Arcadia executives defended the decision to sell BHS to Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, despite the company collapsing into administration just 13 months after the deal. \u201cWe seriously believed there was a credible business plan and seriously believed he was surrounded by credible people,\u201d Budge said. Arcadia left \u00a394.5m of cash and debt facilities in BHS for Chappell, Budge added, as well as providing \u00a3110m of guarantees on loans and leaving \u00a3200m of property in the retailer. Budge said the \u201cmost heavy due diligence I have seen\u201d was conducted before the deal was completed. He blamed the collapse of BHS on Chappell failing to push through a turnaround plan for the retailer \u201cquickly enough\u201d. Anthony Grabiner, the chair of Arcadia, also defended his role, insisting he had been a \u201cresponsible\u201d chairman despite not being invited to a key board meeting that discussed the sale of BHS. The revelation Arcadia knew Chappell had been declared bankrupt will increase the pressure on Green over the demise of BHS. It raises further questions about why he sold the business to Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt three times. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS during its 13-month ownership of the retailer. Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrators, are attempting to secure a rescue deal for BHS and its 11,000 workers. An announcement about the future of BHS is expected to be made by Wednesday. The potential saviours include Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves, who has formed an alliance with Turkish businessman Cafer Mahiro\u011flu, the owner of the value fashion retailer Select. There is also an international suitor circling BHS whose identity remains unclear. Members of the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee are investigating the company\u2019s collapse. Before the Arcadia executives gave evidence, a Goldman Sachs boss revealed to MPs that he had told Budge about Chappell\u2019s background in the run-up to the deal. Anthony Gutman, the co-head of investment banking in Europe for Goldman Sachs, said he warned Arcadia there were \u201crisks attached to the proposal\u201d. Gutman also said Chappell\u2019s proposal to buy BHS was \u201cvery light on detail\u201d and included \u201cno business plan\u201d when he saw it just two months before the deal was completed. The Goldman Sachs banker said he provided \u201cinformal assistance\u201d to Arcadia during talks about the sale of BHS and was not paid a fee. Gutman said he was not asked to provide a recommendation about the deal but provide \u201cpreliminary observations\u201d about the offer from Retail Acquisitions, the consortium led by Chappell. \u201cWe provided a view that there were risks attached to the proposal,\u201d Gutman said. MPs were also told at Monday\u2019s hearing that Green \u201cpaused\u201d proposals to restructure the BHS pension scheme before the sale to Retail Acquisitions. Tony Clare, a partner at accountants Deloitte who was advising Arcadia about its pension schemes, said talks about restructuring the BHS pension scheme were put on hold in September 2014 so that the retailer could focus on improving trade during the Christmas period. A preliminary proposal to the Pensions Regulator was then withdrawn. It has previously been reported that the regulator blocked Arcadia\u2019s plan to restructure the scheme, rather than the company withdrawing it. The plan, called Project Thor, was designed to offer BHS workers more attractive pension benefits than if the scheme entered into the Pension Protection Fund. However, it also involved Arcadia writing off intercompany loans and needed landlords to agree to substantial cuts to their rental payments from BHS. Now that BHS has entered administration, the pension scheme is set to enter the PPF, with a bailout set to cost around \u00a3275m. The Pensions Regulator is investigating whether Green should be forced to contribute towards the scheme. In the first hearing over the BHS scandal earlier this month, Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, told MPs that she only found out about the controversial sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions after reading about it in the newspapers. However, Green said that Titcomb had given \u201cincorrect\u201d evidence. He said the regulator had been emailed on 6 February last year about his ambition to sell the loss-making business and that he had met with the body on 4 March about the sale. Chris Martin, chairman of the BHS pension scheme, backed up Green\u2019s claims and said trustees had worked \u201copenly and collaboratively\u201d with the regulator since the summer of 2014. However, the Pensions Regulator hit back at Green, saying it was \u201cnot approached for clearance\u201d before the deal and was \u201cnot given sufficient information\u201d to assess the impact on the BHS pension scheme.",

    "webTitle": "Lawsuit accusing 16 big banks of Libor manipulation reinstated by US court", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A US appeals court on Monday reinstated a civil lawsuit accusing 16 major banks of conspiring to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate. The ruling, which overturns a 2013 decision, could bankrupt the institutions, the judges warned. A lower court judge erred in dismissing the antitrust portion of private litigation against Barclays, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, UBS and others on the ground that the investors failed to allege harm to competition, according to the US circuit court of appeals in Manhattan. Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions and is used to set rates on credit cards, student loans and mortgages. It is calculated based on submissions by banks that sit on panels. In litigation that began in 2011, investors accused big banks of suppressing Libor during the financial crisis in order to boost earnings or make their finances appear healthier. Back in early 2013, Manhattan federal district court judge Naomi Reice Buchwald dismissed the claims filed by private plaintiffs. According to her 161-page decision, the banks did not violate antitrust laws when they colluded to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate and that the plaintiffs failed to prove harm from such collusion. Buchwald\u2019s 2013 decision surprised some, as at the time Barclays, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland had already settled cases with more than $2.5bn in penalties. Since then penalties in Libor-rigging probes have climbed to roughly $9bn, including a penalty of $2.5bn against Deutsche Bank. The three-judge appellate court panel disagreed with her decision. \u201cAppellants sustained their burden of showing injury by alleging that they paid artificially fixed higher prices,\u201d Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote on behalf of the panel. After determining that the plaintiffs had sufficiently shown they had been harmed by the alleged rate manipulations, the panel sent the case back to the lower court. Two of the judges asked that when revisiting the case, Buchwald consider if the plaintiffs are the appropriate parties to bring such charges. Among the plaintiffs bringing charges against the 16 banks are cities including Baltimore, San Diego and Houston. They also warned of dire consequences should the case be proven against the banks. If the court were to rule in favor of the plaintiffs, they would be eligible to receive triple damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for any violations. \u201cRequiring the banks to pay treble damages to every plaintiff who ended up on the wrong side of an independent Libor\u2010denominated derivative swap would, if appellants\u2019 allegations were proved at trial, not only bankrupt 16 of the world\u2019s most important financial institutions, but also vastly extend the potential scope of antitrust liability in myriad markets where derivative instruments have proliferated,\u201d the US court of appeals in New York said in the ruling issued on Monday. The decision could help investors in several other lawsuits in Manhattan seeking to hold banks liable for alleged price fixing in bond, commodity, currency, derivatives, interest rate and other financial markets. \u201cIt strengthens the hand of investors in other price-fixing cases based on benchmarks that were reached in collaborative, or outright collusive, arrangements,\u201d said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Thomas Goldstein, a lawyer who argued the investors\u2019 appeal, was not immediately available for comment. Robert Wise, a lawyer who argued on the banks\u2019 behalf, declined to comment.

Gutman seems to have taken about two minutes to spot the obvious flaw in selling BHS, a loss-making chain of department stores with 11,000 staff and 20,000 pensioners, to Retail Acquisitions: the outfit was led by Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt individual with no retail experience waving a sketchy business plan. Gutman did the sensible thing and flagged his worries to Paul Budge, finance director of Green\u2019s Arcadia group. The rest of the saga seems to have been a tale of the various other parties \u2013 lawyers, Arcadia\u2019s management \u2013 convincing themselves that Chappell\u2019s past bankruptcies were not a deal-breaker, or else were somebody else\u2019s lookout. Monday\u2019s select committee session heard a Linklaters partner deliver an effective hatchet job on his counterpart at Olswang, the lawyers acting for Chappell and thus the firm responsible for checking their client\u2019s credentials. Olswang\u2019s version of its fact-finding efforts is keenly awaited. For his part Budge pointed to the experienced and competent folk who later surrounded Chappell, including advisers Grant Thornton who were all over his business plan \u201clike a rash\u201d. Besides, argued Budge, Arcadia gifted Retail Acquisitions a load of cash and working capital to have a good crack at a turnaround. It was all fascinating detail. None of it, however, changes the central fact that Green was taking a huge risk in selling BHS to Chappell\u2019s bunch of amateurs. On Monday\u2019s evidence, Green\u2019s moral obligation to do the right thing for BHS\u2019s pensioners remains. Biggest cash takeover in history? Bayer beware A $62bn (\u00a343bn) cash bid should be contemplated only if you can be confident you\u2019ve got \u2013 or can secure \u2013 the backing of your shareholders. Bayer chief executive Werner Baumann, in pursuit of US seeds business Monsanto, isn\u2019t remotely able to make this claim. Bayer\u2019s share price has fallen 14% since news of the adventure broke, and Monday\u2019s confirmed bid price \u2013 $122 a share, or a 37% premium to Monsanto\u2019s old share price \u2013 will do little to calm investors\u2019 nerves. Naturally, Baumann was full of smooth talk about how Bayer\u2019s pesticides and Monsanto\u2019s genetically modified seeds would create \u201ca global leader in agriculture\u201d, spread joy among the world\u2019s farmers and deliver an instant kick to earnings. \u201cArrogant empire-building\u201d that will destroy shareholder value, reckoned fund manager Henderson Global Investors\u2019 John Bennett. That sounds closer to the mark. First, Bayer would be stretching its balance sheet to the limit. Even after whacking shareholders with a hefty rights issue, Bayer\u2019s debt would sail past four times\u2019 top-line annual earnings. Such financial leverage flatters earnings per share, assuming all goes well, but taking on \u20ac55bn-plus of debt is not without risk. Second, annual \u201csynergies\u201d of $1.5bn in the third years don\u2019t look large in the context of the size of the deal. Third, any hopes of Bayer\u2019s expanding its pharmaceutical division would be on hold while it sweats off the Monsanto debt; given that many investors think prospects in pharma are stronger, that\u2019s a serious drawback. Fourth, there\u2019s the mystery factor of whether US competition regulators would allow one company to be so dominant in the US agriculture business. If it happens Bayer/Monsanto would be the biggest cash takeover in history. On day one, Baumann is struggling. Every little trip hurts Taxi for Mr Higgins. Actually, no, it seems Tesco is gloriously relaxed about Benny Higgins, boss of its Edinburgh-based bank, running up a London taxi bill of \u00a318,000 in just eight months, as revealed in Saturday\u2019s Guardian. Higgins is still in his post, says a company spokesman, declining to elaborate on the mundane statement that \u201call Tesco colleagues adhere to a clear policy that allows travel and other expenses for business reasons\u201d. So no explanation as to why it is OK to claim \u00a3389.85 for a trip from Soho Hotel to the Victoria &amp; Albert museum, just five stops away on the underground. And no explanation as to how Higgins\u2019 liberal use of taxis squares with the parsimonious approach taken by group chief executive Dave Lewis, who likes to parade the fact he takes the train to London from the Hertfordshire head office to save money and keep a checkout worker in employment. In the grand scheme of things, an \u00a318,000 taxi bill doesn\u2019t move the profits dial at a company the size of Tesco. But, to judge by the sickly share price, it won\u2019t be long before Lewis is firing off another of his uplifting all-staff emails about the urgent need to pull together as \u201ca total Tesco team\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Potential buyers of Tata Steel UK have submitted final bids at the start of a crucial week in which the future of the struggling British business is likely to be decided in its Indian parent company\u2019s boardroom. Tata\u2019s board is expected to examine proposals at a meeting in Mumbai on Wednesday and to announce a shortlist of bidders on the day, with a slim chance that a single favoured bidder will emerge. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, who failed to travel to India when Tata decided to pull out of the UK, is heading for Mumbai to discuss the sale process and the government\u2019s involvement in the rescue bid with company bosses. Up to seven possible buyers have been working on proposals to buy Britain\u2019s biggest steelmaker, which employs about 12,000 people and includes the blast furnace plant at Port Talbot in south Wales. Tata, the Indian conglomerate, announced in March it wanted to sell its UK steel business, which it bought in 2007. The business was losing an estimated \u00a31m a day, undercut by cheap Chinese imports and saddled with high business costs. Tata said on 9 May it had put seven expressions of interest in the business through to the next stage of the sale process and Monday was the deadline for final offers. The potential buyers included Liberty House, the metals group headed by Sanjeev Gupta, and Excalibur Steel, a management team led by Stuart Wilkie, who runs Tata\u2019s strip products business, which includes Port Talbot. Other potential bidders include Greybull Capital, the investment company that has agreed to buy Tata\u2019s long products business; China\u2019s Hebei Iron and Steel; JSW Steel of India; and Endless, a US private equity fund. The bid process threatened to become acrimonious as Excalibur denied speculation that Wilkie and other senior team members were ready to join up with Liberty House. An industry source had suggested Excalibur would submit its own offer while informing Tata its team would move over to support Gupta\u2019s bid. Roger Maggs, Excalibur\u2019s chairman, told the BBC: \u201cThe suggestion that Stuart Wilkie is going to join the Liberty Steel bid is completely untrue.\u201d A spokesman added that the same applied to other members of Excalibur\u2019s management team. Gupta has said he wants to buy the entire Tata Steel UK business but that he would shift Port Talbot away from manufacturing steel from imported raw materials to recycling scrap steel. Liberty House\u2019s plan is said to have evolved to ensure the Port Talbot blast furnaces stay open with capacity expanded to take stripped steel from Liberty\u2019s plants in Newport and Scotland. Sources had suggested Liberty\u2019s change of plan had helped bring the Excalibur team on board with Gupta\u2019s bid. The government has offered to back a bid with hundreds of millions of pounds of loans and grants and a possible equity stake. About 40,000 UK jobs are judged to depend on Tata Steel UK, directly and through the supply chain. Liberty House already owns steel plants in the UK, including in south Wales, and has been taking on assets affected by the crisis in the steel industry. Last year it reopened a steel mill in Newport, south Wales, after spending two years reviving the site. In March, Gupta bought two mills in Scotland that had belonged to Tata Steel.",

      "body": "<p>Potential buyers of Tata Steel UK have submitted final bids at the start of a crucial week in which the future of the struggling British business is likely to be decided in its Indian parent company\u2019s boardroom.</p> <p>Tata\u2019s board is expected to examine proposals at a meeting in Mumbai on Wednesday and to announce a shortlist of bidders on the day, with a slim chance that a single favoured bidder will emerge.</p> <p>Sajid Javid, the business secretary, who failed to travel to India when Tata decided to pull out of the UK, is heading for Mumbai to discuss the sale process and the government\u2019s involvement in the rescue bid with company bosses.</p> <p>Up to seven possible buyers have been working on proposals to buy Britain\u2019s biggest steelmaker, which employs about 12,000 people and includes the blast furnace plant at Port Talbot in south Wales.<br></p> <p>Tata, the Indian conglomerate, announced in March it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot\">wanted to sell </a>its UK steel business, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/31/tata-decision-india-britain-steel\">which it bought in 2007</a>. The business was losing an estimated \u00a31m a day, undercut by cheap Chinese imports and saddled with high business costs.</p> <p>Tata said on 9 May it had put seven expressions of interest in the business through to the next stage of the sale process and Monday was the deadline for final offers. The potential buyers included Liberty House, the metals group headed by Sanjeev Gupta, and Excalibur Steel, a management team led by Stuart Wilkie, who runs Tata\u2019s strip products business, which includes Port Talbot.</p> <p>Other potential bidders include Greybull Capital, the investment company that has agreed to buy Tata\u2019s long products business; China\u2019s Hebei Iron and Steel; JSW Steel of India; and Endless, a US private equity fund.</p> <p>The bid process threatened to become acrimonious as Excalibur denied speculation that Wilkie and other senior team members were ready to join up with Liberty House. An industry source had suggested Excalibur would submit its own offer while informing Tata its team would move over to support Gupta\u2019s bid.</p> <p>Roger Maggs, Excalibur\u2019s chairman, told the BBC: \u201cThe suggestion that Stuart Wilkie is going to join the Liberty Steel bid is completely untrue.\u201d A spokesman added that the same applied to other members of Excalibur\u2019s management team.<br></p> <p>Gupta has said he wants to buy the entire Tata Steel UK business <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/steel-crisis-sanjeev-gupta-says-port-talbot-jobs-can-be-saved\">but that he would shift Port Talbot away from manufacturing steel from imported raw materials to recycling scrap steel</a>. </p> <p>Liberty House\u2019s plan is said to have evolved to ensure the Port Talbot blast furnaces stay open with capacity expanded to take stripped steel from Liberty\u2019s plants in Newport and Scotland. Sources had suggested Liberty\u2019s change of plan had helped bring the Excalibur team on board with Gupta\u2019s bid. <br></p> <p>The government has offered to back a bid with hundreds of millions of pounds of loans and grants and a possible equity stake. About 40,000 UK jobs are judged to depend on Tata Steel UK, directly and through the supply chain.</p> <p>Liberty House already owns steel plants in the UK, including in south Wales, and has been taking on assets affected by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/04/uk-government-must-step-up-response-following-tata-crisis-says-steel-boss\">crisis in the steel industry</a>. Last year it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/15/liberty-steel-newport-welsh-mill-reopen\">reopened a steel mill in Newport</a>, south Wales, after spending two years reviving the site. In March, Gupta <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/22/liberty-house-sanjeev-gupta-revive-british-steel-industry-scottish-mills-talks\">bought two mills in Scotland</a> that had belonged to Tata Steel.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Insurer AXA plans to divest \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.4bn) of tobacco investments and called upon rivals to do the same, citing the industry\u2019s \u201ctragic\u201d impact on public health. The announcement by one of the world\u2019s top investment institutions is the second major blow for UK tobacco firms inside a week, after the high court rejected their legal challenge against plain packaging. Investors immediately sold London-listed tobacco stocks, as AXA\u2019s move raised the prospect of other global investors following suit. Shares in Imperial closed down 1% and British American Tobacco lost 0.75%, both underperforming the FTSE100\u2019s 0.3% decline. AXA said it was selling out of tobacco for moral reasons as a health insurer, despite such stocks remaining a lucrative investment. \u201cThis decision has a cost for us but the case for divestment is clear: the human cost of tobacco is tragic; its economic cost is huge,\u201d said the incoming chief executive of AXA, Thomas Buberl. The French company, thought to be the first global insurer to abandon tobacco, pointed to figures showing that smoking kills 6 million people a year, projected to reach 8 million by 2030, with developing countries worst affected. \u201cThe damage to health from tobacco products is more costly to society than that caused by alcohol or obesity,\u201d it said. The divestment will involve offloading \u20ac200m worth of equities. Axa will also stop all new investment in tobacco industry corporate bonds. It will gradually run down its \u20ac1.6bn of existing bond investments by opting not to reinvest when they mature, the company said. Clients of AXA Investment Managers will still be able to invest in tobacco if they wish. Buberl said he hoped peers in the insurance industry would come to the same conclusion about the role investors can play in fighting smoking-related diseases. \u201cWe strongly believe in the positive role insurance can play in society and that insurers are part of the solution when it comes to health prevention to protect our clients. Hence it makes no sense for us to continue our investments within the tobacco industry.\u201d Deborah Arnott, chief executive of anti-smoking group Ash, said that while the decision by AXA was welcome, it was not likely to trouble the big tobacco firms much. \u201cThe withdrawal of one of the world\u2019s biggest insurance companies, AXA, from tobacco investments shows just how morally repugnant the tobacco industry has become, and we hope others will follow suit,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, despite the lethal nature of the product, tobacco remains one of the most profitable businesses in the world. Until we make smoking history it is likely to remain so.\u201d Cary Adams, chief executive of the Union for International Cancer Control, hailed AXA\u2019s decision as a \u201cmilestone step in the right direction\u201d, adding: \u201cWe need companies like AXA to signal that investing in an industry which kills its customers is simply the wrong thing to do.\u201d But Simon Clark, director of smoking lobby group Forest, said: \u201cAxa\u2019s decision is a slap in the face for millions of adults who choose to smoke. By supporting the government\u2019s anti-smoking programme the company is endorsing some of the most illiberal tobacco control policies in the world.\u201d Nine other institutional investors were asked to comment on whether they plan to dump tobacco investments. Schroders and Standard Life said they allow investors to opt out of tobacco investments but have no company-wide policy. \u201cWe note that Axa is not divesting of tobacco holdings where, like us, they are managing funds on behalf of third-party clients,\u201d said a spokesperson for Schroders. Seven other firms did not return requests for comment.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has called for \u201cupfront\u201d and \u201cunconditional\u201d debt relief for Greece as it warned that without immediate action the financial plight of the recession-ravaged country would deteriorate dramatically over the coming decades. In a strongly worded assessment, the IMF said that there was no prospect of Greece meeting the draconian terms of its current bailout plan and that interest payments on the soaring national debt would eat up 60% of the budget by 2060 in the absence of debt forgiveness. The debt sustainability analysis by the Washington-based Fund said Greece should have longer to pay, have the interest rate on its loans fixed at 1.5%, and that its creditors should make debt relief automatic once the bailout programme ends in 2018. \u201cThe implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the programme period\u201d, the IMF said. \u201cProviding an upfront, unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u201d The report\u2019s hard-hitting nature makes it clear to the EU that the IMF is not prepared to put its own money into the \u20ac86bn bailout unless Germany and other eurozone countries ease their hardline stance towards Greece. EU finance ministers are likely to hand Greece an emergency lifeline of up to \u20ac11bn on Tuesday but believe that IMF cash would add to the plan\u2019s credibility. In its debt sustainability analysis (DSA), the Fund insisted it would provide support for the third Greek bailout since 2010 on two conditions. It said it was \u201ccritical for the credibility of the DSA that it be based on ambitious but realistic policy commitments from the authorities\u201d. However, it added that \u201cfront-loaded debt relief, to be fully delivered during the programme\u201d was \u201cequally important\u201d. The Fund admitted its proposals for easing Greece\u2019s debt burden would not be easy for some countries to accept, because it would involve member states making a commitment to compensate the European Stability Mechanism \u2013 Europe\u2019s bailout fund \u2013 for any losses occurred from fixing interest rates at 1.5%. \u201cThis would clearly be highly controversial among member states in view of the constraints \u2013 political and legal \u2013 on such commitments within the currency union,\u201d the report said. But it added that it was unrealistic to assume that Greece, faced with a prolonged period of slow growth following a 25% contraction in its economy since 2009, could run permanent budget surpluses excluding debt interest payments of 3.5% of GDP. The Syriza government headed by Alexis Tispras has agreed to far-reaching and painful measures in return for receiving financial help. On Sunday, the Greek parliament agreed to tax increases \u2013 including an increase in VAT \u2013 estimated to raise \u20ac1.8bn, together with contingency measures to raise more revenue in the event that the government in Athens fails to keep to its stringent budget plans. The IMF expressed strong doubts about Greece\u2019s ability to undertake the sweeping economic reforms needed. \u201cIn all key policy areas \u2013 fiscal, financial sector stability, labour, product and service markets \u2013 the authorities\u2019 current policy plans fall well short of what would be required to achieve their ambitious fiscal and growth targets.\u201d It added: \u201cEven if Greece, through a heroic effort, could temporarily reach a surplus close to 3.5% of GDP, few countries have managed to reach and sustain such high levels of primary balances for a decade or more, and it is highly unlikely that Greece can do so considering its still weak policy making institutions and projections suggesting that unemployment will remain at double digits for several decades.\u201d The IMF said that Greece\u2019s national debt as a share of GDP would fall from just over 180% this year to around 140% by 2030 if debt relief was provided. The alternative, it added, was that Greece would face an ever-higher bill for servicing its rising debts.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our report on the IMF\u2019s Greek comments ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Larry Elliott writes: The International Monetary Fund called for \u201cupfront\u201d and \u201cunconditional\u201d debt relief for Greece as it warned that without immediate action the financial plight of the recession-ravaged country would deteriorate dramatically over the coming decades. In a strongly-worded assessment, the Fund said that there was no prospect of Greece meeting the draconian terms of its current bail-out plan and that debt interest payments on the soaring national debt would eat up 60% of the budget by 2060 in the absence of debt forgiveness. The debt sustainability analysis by the Washington-based IMF said Greece should have longer to pay, have the interest rate on its loans fixed at 1.5%, and that its creditors should make debt relief automatic once the bail out programme ends in 2018. \u201cThe implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the program period\u201d, the IMF said. \u201cProviding an upfront unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u201d The hard-hitting nature of the report makes it clear to the EU that the IMF will not be prepared to put its own money into the \u20ac86bn bail out unless Germany and other eurozone countries ease their hardline stance towards Greece. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s a link to the IMF report: Despite the prospect of Greece finally receiving much needed bailout cash, most European markets have ended the day lower, with commodity stocks on the slide again. An imminent rise in US interest rates was one of the factors, helping lift the dollar and hitting metal and oil prices. But Greece was an exception, with the Athens market up 1.5% and ten year bond yields falling to six month low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 19.89 points or 0.32% to 6136.43 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.74% to 9842.29 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.66% at 4325.10 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.74% to 17,325.08 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.65% lower at 8714.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.5% to 649.10 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, up just 6 points. More from the IMF staff report on Greece: In all key policy areas\u2014fiscal, financial sector stability, labor, product and service markets\u2014the authorities\u2019 current policy plans fall well short of what would be required to achieve their ambitious fiscal and growth targets. Consequently, staff believes that a realignment of assumptions with the evident political and social constraints on the pace and scope of adjustment is needed, and it has revised the DSA assumptions for the primary balance and growth. It has cut its primary surplus estimate from 3.5% of GDP to 1.5% and its long term growth assumption to 1.25%: [The primary surplus] target would in staff\u2019s view be within the realm of what is plausible, although it remains ambitious in as much as it requires the fiscal adjustment to be underpinned by much stronger support for reforms and much stronger resolve by policy making institutions, in Greece and at the European level, than currently evident. Two more US Federal Reserve members have added to the recent chorus suggesting a possible rate rise in June or July. San Francisco Fed president John Williams indicated a rise would not be delayed much longer, despite risks such as the possibility of the UK voting to leave the European Union. Williams told reporters (quotes from Reuters): [Brexit is] a factor in the decision for June obviously because you have an event right after, and we can obviously hold off until July if we wanted. But of course we could also make a decision to raise rates at a meeting and if later on economic conditions for the US change, we can always move interest rates back down. Earlier St Louis Fed president James Bullard said keeping rates too low for too long could cause financial instability in future. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The Fed\u2019s Bullard and Williams reiterated the new more hawkish stance of the Fed, though data showing a bigger than expected fall in manufacturing activity didn\u2019t support their calls. Greece\u2019s current policy plans fall well short of what is needed to achieve fiscal and growth targets, according to the International Monetary Fund. In a staff report ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, the IMF said Greece needs a substantial reprofiling of the terms of its European loans, and debt relief must be unconditional. But revised targets for economic growth and its primary budget surplus could meet the criteria for receiving IMF support, it said. Even before the growing signs that Greece may finally receive its long awaited bailout funds, eurozone consumer confidence improved for the second month in a row. The May figure came in at -7.0 compared to -9.3 the previous month and better than the -9.0 which had been expected, according to the European Commission. In the European Union as a whole, consumer sentiment rose by 1.1 points to -5.7. Here\u2019s something for the Fed to ponder as it wonders when to raise rates. The Markit provisional manufacturing PMI for May has fallen from a final 50.8 in April to 50.5. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 51. This is the worst level for more than six years. Stock markets continue to drift, with Wall Street opening marginally higher while European shares slip back. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 10 points as investors hold fire ahead of further clues as to whether the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.27% while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.6% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.8% lower. But in Greece, the Athens market continues to benefit from hopes that Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting will release much needed bailout funds, following the weekend\u2019s parliamentary vote approving the latest package of austerity measures. It is currently up 1.76% while bond yields continue to fall. Ten year Greek bond yields have dropped around 28 basis points to 7.34%, a six month low. Two year yields are down 100 basis points to 8.51%. The cost of insuring Greek debt against default in terms of five year credit default swaps has fallen to a six month low. Here\u2019s a reminder of the breakdown of Greek debt, from the Financial Times: Last summer, European officials worried that Greece might break off ties with Europe in favour of a new arrangement with Russia. So they might be interested to hear that Russian President Vladimir Putin is paying a visit to the Hellenic Republic on May 27-28. (Friday and Saturday). The Kremlin\u2019s press service reports that: \u201c[Putin] will meet Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the president of the Hellenic Republic, andPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras. The summit talks are expected to dwell on key issues of bilateral trade, economic and investment interaction, including the implementation of joint energy and transport projects.\u201d Those joint energy projects could includes a landmark \u20ac2bn gas deal which the two countries outlined last July \u2013 days before the third Greek bailout was agreed. Tass, the Russian newswire, says the president\u2019s upcoming visit will also pay \u201cspecial attention\u201d to cultural and humanitarian cooperation, while Putin and the Greek leaders will exchange views on urgent international and regional problems. AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp reckons eurozone finance ministers may take notice.... Here\u2019s the mood on the streets of Athens today after MPs approved the latest package of austerity measures: And they\u2019ve got a point. Last night\u2019s \u201comnibus bill\u201d includes: Raising VAT to 24%, from 23% Increasing fuel consumption tax A special tax on cigarettes, tobacco and electronic cigarettes A new levy on craft beer A new tax on imported coffee Consumption taxes on fuel and natural gas use A new overnight accommodation tax for hotels. Some measures are implemented in July; others don\u2019t kick in until 2017. Campaigners are concerned that the plans for Greek debt relief are far too modest. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the issue tomorrow, and consider whether to extend the grace period on Greece\u2019s bonds and give Athens more time to repay. That\u2019s part of the pledge made when the current bailout was agreed last summer. There are also reports that the eurozone could buy up \u20ac14bn of Greek bonds held by the IMF, to get around the Fund\u2019s concerns over Greece\u2019s debt sustainability (the FT has a good take) But the Jubilee Debt Campaign argues that much more dramatic action is needed. Otherwise, according to the eurogroup\u2019s own forecasts, Greece\u2019s debt repayments will hit 30% of government revenue in 2019, fall to 20% in the early 2020s, then rising back over 30% after 2040. Instead, they believe Greece should get the same kind of deal that Germany got in the 1950s, which pegged its debt servicing costs at less than 4% of government income. Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign said: \u201cGreece needs a reduction in debt payments now to help tackle the humanitarian crisis in the country. A significant amount of debt needs to be cancelled, not just rescheduled, if the Greek economy is going to have the breathing space it needs to recover. And the costs of cancelling the debt should be recovered from the real beneficiaries of bailout loans, including the German, French and British banks that lent recklessly to Greece in the first place.\u201d Despite today\u2019s rally, Greek debt is still pretty risky: Here\u2019s some other developments across business this morning: Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras have held their meeting in Istanbul: Back in the markets, money is pouring into short-dated Greek bonds. The yield on Greece\u2019s two-year debt has fallen to 8.5%, down from 9.5% on Friday night. Such a big drop in borrowing costs shows that traders are expecting Greece\u2019s bailout tranche to be signed off in Brussels tomorrow. Greek media are reporting that prime minister Tsipras will meet with German chancellor Angela Merkel shortly, in Istanbul. Both leaders are in the Turkish capital for a major international summit on the refugee crisis, that will consider how to improve the international humanitarian aid system. Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is hosting the summit, is calling on European countries to take more Syrian refugees. Writing in the Guardian today, Erdogan argues Turkey is doing more than its fair share: Having adopted an open-door policy towards Syrian refugees in 2011, we now host nearly 3 million Syrian nationals from diverse ethnic, religious and sectarian backgrounds. In the past five years Turkey has allocated $10bn to provide Syrian refugees with free healthcare, education and housing. At a time when the international community failed the Syrian people \u2013 600,000 of whom have lost their lives in the civil war, with 13 million forced from their homes \u2013 Turkey, along with the rest of Syria\u2019s neighbours, was left to deal with the conflict\u2019s consequences. As the Syrian civil war enters its sixth year, we are calling on the world to create a fair mechanism for sharing the burden. But some aid agencies doubt whether the summit will yield any real progress; with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res calling it a \u201cfig-leaf\u201d for international failures. More here. EU Economic Affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has welcomed Greece\u2019s decision to approve further austerity measures last night, despite public opposition. The AFP newswire has the details: \u201cA key step has been taken... towards the conclusion of the first stage of the Greek programme,\u201d Moscovici said in Paris, a day after Greek lawmakers voted in favour of spending cuts and tax hikes. Eurozone finance ministers are set to discuss easing Greece\u2019s debt burden and disbursing the next round of funds at a closely-watched Eurogroup meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. \u201cI hope and wish for an agreement at the Eurogroup meeting,\u201d he told a news conference. Bloomberg are reporting that eurozone finance ministers are planning to hand Greece \u20ac11bn of bailout funds tomorrow. That\u2019s according to a draft version of tomorrow\u2019s eurogroup statement, seen by the newswire: Greek banks are among the best-performing shares in Athens this morning: Greek government bonds have hit their highest level in six months, after MPs approved last night\u2019s austerity package. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek 10-year debt has fallen to 7.4%, from 7.2% on Friday night. As this chart shows, that\u2019s the lowest since last November: Yields fall when bond prices rises, so traders are prepared to pay a higher price for Greek debt today. And the cost of insuring those bonds against default has also dropped this morning, following the news that the package of tax rises and economic reforms has been agreed. That suggests investors are confident that eurozone finance ministers will sign off on its bailout review on Tuesday, unlocking fresh bailout loans for Greece. The Greek stock market is also rallying. The main ASE index has jumped 1% in early trading, defying the selloff in other markets. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the Eurogroup to agree to release bailout funds tomorrow, allowing Greece to \u201cmeet forthcoming debt repayments and clear arrears which have built up as the review has dragged on.\u201d This slowdown in Eurozone growth rather undermines critics of the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus measures. So suggests Carsten Brzeski of Dutch bank ING: Ouch. Growth across Europe\u2019s private sector has slowed to a sixteen-month low. The eurozone composite PMI calculated by Markit, just released, has inched down to 52.9 from 53.0 in April. That\u2019s surprising, given the decent numbers from France and Germany this morning. But it appears that other areas of the eurozone struggled: Eurozone firms reported the smallest rise in new business since January 2015, even though many cut prices to encourage sales. Happily, though, employment levels did rise. But Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, warns that Europe\u2019s recovery appears to be slowing: \u201cThere are signs of improving life in the \u2018core\u2019 countries of France and Germany, led mainly by their service sectors, as manufacturing continued to struggle. However, elsewhere the rate of expansion slowed to its weakest for almost one-and-a-half years. \u201cThe survey therefore paints a picture of a region stuck in a low-growth phase, managing to eke out frustratingly modest output and employment gains despite various ECB stimulus \u2018bazookas\u2019, a competitive exchange rate and households benefitting from falling prices.\u201d Europe\u2019s stock markets are suffering a dose of Monday morning blues. The main indices are all down, amid disappointment that global finance ministers didn\u2019t take any decisive action at their G7 meeting over the weekend. London\u2019s FTSE has shed 23 points, or 0.4%, while there are bigger losses in France and Germany. And in Italy, the stock market has shed 2.8%, led by banking stocks. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: The weekend\u2019s G7 meeting wrapped up with a lack of consensus and this appears to be very much setting the pace right now. Finance ministers did debate the risks facing the global economy, but didn\u2019t agree any new stimulus packages. Perhaps they were too busy wondering why Japanese central bank chief Haruhiko Kurodo decided to pat George Osborne on the bottom.... May is also looking like a good month for German companies. Markit reports that growth across Germany\u2019s private sector has hit a three-month high. Its \u2018composite PMI\u2019, which tracks output across the German economy, has jumped to 54.7, up from 53.6 in April (any reading over 50 shows expansion). Good news from France....its private sector is growing at the fastest rate in seven months. Markit, the data firm, reports that new business has picked up, encouraging French firms to take on more staff. This pushed up the French composite index up to 51.1 for May, from 50.2 in April. That\u2019s the highest level since last October - shortly before the Paris terrorism attacks. The service sector led the way, with companies reporting faster growth. The factory sector lagged behind, but at least it contracted at a slower rate: Flash France Services Activity Index climbs to 51.8 (50.6 in April), 7-month Flash France Manufacturing PMI rises to 48.3 (48.0 in April), 2-month high Fred Ducrozet, economist at Swiss bank Pictet, says it\u2019s a good performance: Last night\u2019s vote wasn\u2019t without incident. One government MP, Vassiliki Katrivanou, refused to back parts of the package, saying Greece\u2019s lenders were taking too much control. Katrivanou has now resigned, meaning she can be replaced as an MP - leaving Tsipras\u2019s narrow majority of 155 MPs, out of 300, intact. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras cut a defiant figure at last night\u2019s vote. He told MPs that this latest package of austerity is the last one: \u201cGreeks have already paid a lot, but this is probably the first time that the possibility of these sacrifices being the last is so evident.... Tsipras also gave eurozone finance ministers a dig in the ribs to sign off Greece\u2019s bailout funds at Tuesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cEuropean leaders will receive a message tonight, that Greece fulfils its obligations. Tomorrow, the other side must also take responsibility.\u201d But outside the parliament, protesters demonstrated against the package of tax rises and reforms: One demonstrator, 60-year old businessman Panayiotis Kehris, told Reuters: \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster! We will cut down on everything, from food to driving.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Greece is on the brink of receiving a much-needed dose of bailout, after its parliament agreed to the latest batch of austerity measure to be piled on its already weakened economy. Last night MPs in Athens approved the package, which includes \u20ac1.8bn in tax increases, VAT hiked from 23% to 24%, and a new privatization fund. That should be enough to allow eurozone finance ministers to sign off much-needed bailout payment to Greece when they meet in Brussels tomorrow. That would ease fears of another summer of Greek drama, with Athens struggling to meet debt repayments. It should also trigger more detailed discussions about debt relief. But as our correspondent Helena Smith reports, these latest restrictions on Greece are the toughest yet: The belt-tightening legislation, outlined in a 7,500-page omnibus bill, includes measures that range from the taxation of coffee and luxury goods to the creation of a new privatisation fund in charge of real estate assets for the next 99 years. Under the stewardship of EU officials, the body will oversee the sale of about 71,500 pieces of prime public property in what will amount to collateral for the \u20ac250bn in bailout loans Greece has received since 2010. \u201cThey are with the exception of the Acropolis selling everything under the sun,\u201d said Anna Asimakopoulou, the shadow minister for development and competitiveness. \u201cWe are giving up everything.\u201d But some big problems remain, including whether the International Monetary Fund will take the plunge and support Greece\u2019s current bailout. Germany demands the IMF\u2019s involvement, but balks at the Fund\u2019s key demand \u2013 substantial debt relief for Athens. We\u2019ll be tracking all the reaction to last night\u2019s vote, and the build-up to tomorrow\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Also coming up today... On the economic front, data firm Markit is releasing its latest PMI reports, showing how the eurozone\u2019s factory sectors are faring this month. We also get the latest measure of consumer morale across the euroarea. 8am: Flash French manufacturing PMI for May 8.30am: Flash German manufacturing PMI for May 9am: Flash eurozone manufacturing PMI for May 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence for May. The markets? They look rather quiet this morning, with IG calling the FTSE 100 index up just 4 points. And on the corporate front, budget airline Ryanair is reporting results. It has just posted profits to \u20ac1.242bn for the last financial year -- a 43% jump, but not enough",

Larry Elliott writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>The International Monetary Fund called for \u201cupfront\u201d and \u201cunconditional\u201d debt relief for Greece as it warned that without immediate action the financial plight of the recession-ravaged country would deteriorate dramatically over the coming decades.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43915.0\">In a strongly-worded assessment</a>, the Fund said that there was no prospect of Greece meeting the draconian terms of its current bail-out plan and that debt interest payments on the soaring national debt would eat up 60% of the budget by 2060 in the absence of debt forgiveness.</p> <p>The debt sustainability analysis by the Washington-based IMF said Greece should have longer to pay, have the interest rate on its loans fixed at 1.5%, and that its creditors should make debt relief automatic once the bail out programme ends in 2018.</p> <p>\u201cThe implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the program period\u201d, the IMF said. \u201cProviding an upfront unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u201d</p> <p>The hard-hitting nature of the report makes it clear to the EU that the IMF will not be prepared to put its own money into the \u20ac86bn bail out unless Germany and other eurozone countries ease their hardline stance towards Greece.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

      "bodyText": "Holidaymakers could find themselves bagging a cheaper seat on the plane this summer after Ryanair announced it would cut air fares by an average 7%, raising the prospect of a further price war between airlines. The Irish no-frills carrier said it would drop fares to keep its planes full, with demand hit by economic uncertainty and terror attacks, as lower fuel costs cut the cost of flying. Ryanair, Europe\u2019s biggest airline by passenger numbers, expects prices to drop by around 5-7% this summer, and as much as 12% in winter. Chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary said that fares would be lower primarily because of extra supply of seats, in Ryanair\u2019s fleet and others, while lower oil prices were filtering through to cut costs. The airline has taken delivery of 41 new 737s from Boeing in the last year with a further 52 coming this year, as it looks to grow passenger numbers to more than 100m. \u201cIt\u2019s good, because customers are going to get lower air fares and it also puts downwards pressure on our competitors.\u201d According to the International Air Transport Association, fares to and from European destinations had already fallen 11.4% in the first three months of 2016 compared with the same period last year. Britain\u2019s largest carrier, easyJet, said earlier this month it had cut fares to lure wary passengers. The Ryanair boss\u2019s outlook suggests competition will be fierce and fares will remain low, as analysts predict other carriers likely to follow suit. Robin Byde at Cantor Fitzgerald said: \u201cRyanair is a major player in many of the markets and airports it flies to. If it cuts prices, other airlines will have to respond to that.\u201d O\u2019Leary vowed: \u201cIf there is a fare war in Europe, then Ryanair will be the winner.\u201d A euro billionaire, O\u2019Leary imposed a pay freeze on middle and senior management and vowed costs would continue to fall, as the airline reported net profits up 43% to \u20ac1.24bn (\u00a3960m) for 2015-16. Hedging to buy oil at lower oil prices means that the airline\u2019s fuel bill will be \u20ac200m lower next year, while new aircraft with more seats and better fuel consumption will also cut costs significantly, O\u2019Leary added. The terrorist attacks in Brussels and Paris, as well as air traffic control strikes in France, also pushed fares down with fewer people looking to travel in the aftermath. O\u2019Leary said the EgyptAir disaster, in which a passenger jet with 66 people aboard crashed into the sea between Paris and Cairo last week, had also affected bookings: \u201cIt has already had an affect on business, bookings were weak on Thursday, Friday, Saturday. We respond by lowering fares and bookings return to normal, but at lower prices.\u201d O\u2019Leary said the impact would be felt in fares for three to five months, but he did not expect any new security procedures even if terrorism was behind the latest air disaster. He said Ryanair, which only flies to Morocco in North Africa, had conducted its own audits of airport security, alongside European and Irish audits, and revealed that the airline had been concerned about the safety of airports in Egypt where it had been considering opening routes. \u201cWe had certain concerns about some of the airports in North Africa that we don\u2019t fly to but have been in discussions about. There were concerns expressed at the Egyptian airports, but the Egyptians have significantly improved the state of security at their airports. Meanwhile, O\u2019Leary repeated his support for Britain staying in the EU and defended Ryanair\u2019s offer of cheap fares for expats to fly home to vote for UK\u2019s continued membership. Police are investigating Ryanair\u2019s \u201cBrexit special\u201d ad after the Vote Leave campaign claimed it broke the Bribery Act by offering discounts in exchange for votes. \u201cThe leave side have so run out of ideas that the best they can come up with is reporting me to the Metropolitan police,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they believe that Ryanair offering lower fares to UK customers is somehow endangering democracy in the UK,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. He said the airline would be extending its referendum seat sale, adding: \u201cWe want to thank them sincerely for the two days of additional PR we got out of it.\u201d",

The airline has taken delivery of 41 new 737s from Boeing in the last year with a further 52 coming this year, as it looks to grow passenger numbers to more than 100m.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good, because customers are going to get lower air fares and it also puts downwards pressure on our competitors.\u201d</p> <p>According to the International Air Transport Association, fares to and from European destinations had already fallen 11.4% in the first three months of 2016 compared with the same period last year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/easyjet-24m-pound-loss-dividend-terrorist-attacks\">Britain\u2019s largest carrier, easyJet, said earlier this month it had cut fares to lure wary passengers.</a></p> <p>The Ryanair boss\u2019s outlook suggests competition will be fierce and fares will remain low, as analysts predict other carriers likely to follow suit. Robin Byde at Cantor Fitzgerald said: \u201cRyanair is a major player in many of the markets and airports it flies to. If it cuts prices, other airlines will have to respond to that.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Leary vowed: \u201cIf there is a fare war in Europe, then Ryanair will be the winner.\u201d</p> <p>A euro billionaire, O\u2019Leary imposed a pay freeze on middle and senior management and vowed costs would continue to fall, as the airline reported net profits up 43% to \u20ac1.24bn (\u00a3960m) for 2015-16. Hedging to buy oil at lower oil prices means that the airline\u2019s fuel bill will be \u20ac200m lower next year, while new aircraft with more seats and better fuel consumption will also cut costs significantly, O\u2019Leary added.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/23/belgium-awkward-questions-bombers-links-to-paris-terror-cell\">The terrorist attacks in Brussels and Paris</a>, as well as air traffic control strikes in France, also pushed fares down with fewer people looking to travel in the aftermath. O\u2019Leary said the EgyptAir disaster, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egyptair-flight-ms804\">in which a passenger jet with 66 people aboard crashed into the sea between Paris and Cairo last week</a>, had also affected bookings: \u201cIt has already had an affect on business, bookings were weak on Thursday, Friday, Saturday. We respond by lowering fares and bookings return to normal, but at lower prices.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Leary said the impact would be felt in fares for three to five months, but he did not expect any new security procedures even if terrorism was behind the latest air disaster. He said Ryanair, which only flies to Morocco in North Africa, had conducted its own audits of airport security, alongside European and Irish audits, and revealed that the airline had been concerned about the safety of airports in Egypt where it had been considering opening routes.</p> <p>\u201cWe had certain concerns about some of the airports in North Africa that we don\u2019t fly to but have been in discussions about. There were concerns expressed at the Egyptian airports, but the Egyptians have significantly improved the state of security at their airports.</p> <p>Meanwhile, O\u2019Leary repeated his support for Britain staying in the EU and defended Ryanair\u2019s offer of cheap fares for expats to fly home to vote for UK\u2019s continued membership. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/20/ryanair-eu-referendum-ad-police-vote-leave-brexit\">Police are investigating Ryanair\u2019s \u201cBrexit special\u201d ad</a> after the Vote Leave campaign claimed it broke the Bribery Act by offering discounts in exchange for votes.</p> <p>\u201cThe leave side have so run out of ideas that the best they can come up with is reporting me to the Metropolitan police,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they believe that Ryanair offering lower fares to UK customers is somehow endangering democracy in the UK,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. </p> <p>He said the airline would be extending its referendum seat sale, adding: \u201cWe want to thank them sincerely for the two days of additional PR we got out of it.\u201d </p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has objected to government plans to privatise the Land Registry, warning that allowing a private firm to take possession of property ownership information could cause problems for other businesses. The Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) said selling off the organisation that keeps the official record of commercial and residential land ownership in England and Wales would give the new owner a monopoly on commercially valuable data with no incentive to improve access to it. The government attracted criticism for announcing its plans for the \u00a31bn-plus sell-off just before the Easter break, opening a consultation that closes on Thursday. In a letter sent alongside its response to the consultation, CMA senior director John Kirkpatrick said: \u201cWe believe that consumers and the economy would be best served by a model that promotes wide access to Land Registry data at cost-reflective prices, encouraging its use and commercial exploitation by a range of individuals and businesses.\u201d He added: \u201cOur view is that a privatised, vertically integrated Land Registry [the government\u2019s preferred option] would be unlikely to deliver this outcome, despite the best efforts of oversight bodies to regulate prices and write safeguards into a contract or licence.\u201d The Land Registry employs more than 4,500 civil servants and plays an important role in the property market, holding 24m titles for the ownership of properties across England and Wales. The information is available to the public at a small charge, and to businesses and other organisations. As well as providing the basis for its own house price index each month, the Land Registry\u2019s data is used by other organisations to produce regular indices and reports. It is also used by firms such as property websites to show recent prices. The CMA has no powers to block the proposed privatisation. The watchdog said its preferred option was for the Land Registry to remain in public ownership. Failing that, the organisation should be split into two with the register of properties remaining in public hands while a commercial arm was spun off. Kirkpatrick warned: \u201cHistory shows that it can be very difficult and time-consuming to solve problems arising from privatisations that give rise to anti-competitive market structures.\u201d The privatisation plans have drawn criticism from a wide range of organisations, including solicitors and the News Media Association, which warned it was a threat to investigative journalism. A petition against privatisation has so far attracted more than 225,000 signatures. It will be presented to the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills on Thursday. Joy Bassett, a solicitor and one of the people behind the Save the Land Registry Campaign, said she was not surprised the petition had been so popular. \u201cWhen we talk to our conveyancing clients about it, they are outraged and are quick to sign the petition for two main reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cOut of concern that it\u2019s their data that is at risk - it\u2019s their names on the title deeds and mortgage deeds and it should be protected by the state, and that it\u2019s not in the hands of a commercial entity driven by profit.\u201d She added: \u201cNo matter how much the government promises to safeguard and monitor, they will have very little control or power over a privately owned business. It seems plain to us, that the reason for privatising the Land Registry is the wrong reason.\u201d On Monday, a New Economic Foundation report for the campaign group We Own It found that selling the Land Registry would mean the British public would start to lose money in 25 years\u2019 time.",

      "bodyText": "German drug and chemicals group Bayer has offered to buy the American GM seed pioneer Monsanto for $62bn (\u00a343bn) in a deal that would create the world\u2019s biggest agricultural supplier. The offer of $122 a share in cash values the Monsanto group at 37% more than its closing share price on 9 May, before rumours of a bid emerged. The deal, which includes Monstanto\u2019s $9bn net debt, would represent the largest all-cash acquisition and the biggest takeover by a German company. Bayer, which invented aspirin in the 19th century, would fund the purchase with a mixture of debt and equity, including raising about $15bn from its shareholders. The proposed deal has unnerved Bayer shareholders who fear the company is stretching its finances too far to build an industry behemoth. Bayer shares have fallen by about 13% since 9 May. The acquisition would create a business making drugs including Yasmin birth control pills as well as pesticides and seeds for GM crops such as soybeans. Monsanto, based in St Louis, Missouri, was one of the first companies to develop genetically modified seeds in the 1990s. GM crops have remained controversial because of their potential impact on the environment and because they can keep ownership rights to seeds in the hands of big corporations. Monsanto confirmed Bayer\u2019s interest last week when it revealed it had received an unsolicited bid. The US company said it would review the offer. Bayer\u2019s chief executive, Werner Baumann, who has been in the job less than a month, said: \u201cWe have long respected Monsanto\u2019s business and share their vision to create an integrated business that we believe is capable of generating substantial value for both companies\u2019 shareholders.\u201d Agricultural producers are battling for position amid an industry shakeup. Monsanto missed out on buying Swiss pesticide maker Syngenta when China National Chemical swooped in February. That deal followed Dow Chemical\u2019s merger with DuPont to form a $100bn company last year. Prof John Colley of Warwick Business School said the size of Bayer\u2019s bid was designed to force Monsanto\u2019s board into accepting a takeover although such deals rarely worked out well. \u201cThis is an enormous offer in a number of ways. German businesses have generally avoided megabids, opting instead for lower risk but slower organic growth. Bayer has dispensed with that approach,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a classic transfer of value from the bidder\u2019s shareholders to those of the target. Few megabids go well and research shows more than half destroy value. Only around a quarter deliver on their promises.\u201d US competition regulators are likely to scrutinise the bid because there is an overlap between the companies\u2019 businesses in soybeans, cotton and canola. Monsanto\u2019s GM capability also arguably makes it an important national asset for the US.",

Its shares are up 17.6p or 3.5% to 509.5p as analysts at RBC moved their recommendation from underperform to sector perform and lifted their target price from 445p to 525p. Meanwhile Cantor Fitzgerald issued a buy note with a forecast raised from 530p to 550p. Cantor\u2019s Robin Byde said: Royal Mail\u2019s full year update was encouraging. Revenue and operating profits were up year on year and ahead of consensus estimates. European parcels continue to drive growth with cost cutting and productivity gains helping to protect margins in UK letters. Following the update, our forecast changes are minor. We expect parcels in the UK and Europe to drive the top-line and restructuring and productivity gains to support the bottom-line. Even with forecast hefty capex, free cash should be healthy.

      "bodyText": "The government would have greeted the release of the pre-election fiscal and economic outlook on Friday with a sigh of relief as the budget deficits were essentially unchanged. But the numbers in the Pefo and the commentary by the heads of the Treasury and the Department of Finance provide a tough question for the government \u2013 for all the talk of a plan for jobs and growth, where are the signs of either? The Pefo ended up being released a bit earlier than needed. The Treasury and Department of Finance had 10 days from the issuing of writs last Monday; instead it was released it within four days. Releasing so early meant the departments didn\u2019t need to consider the record low wages growth figures released last week. And because the Treasury makes its assumptions on commodity prices \u2013 such as iron ore \u2013 on \u201can average of the preceding weeks\u201d there would be little changed from the budget even with the recent sharp fall in iron ore prices. And so the upshot is the estimate for the deficit in 2015-16 was changed from $39.946bn to $40.047bn and for 2016-17 from $37.081bn to $37.083bn. You\u2019d have to work pretty hard to suggest an extra $2m was a blowout. But the Pefo doesn\u2019t exactly paint a wonderful a tale about the economy. It notes for example that there is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to the forecasts for real GDP growth if the pick-up in non-mining investment, which has been \u201cslower to materialise than previously forecast\u201d suffered further delays or was \u201cslower than currently estimated\u201d. The budget (and Pefo) estimate that non-mining investment for 2016-17 will grow by 3.5%. Such hope is yet to be supported by a great deal of evidence. The first estimate for non-mining capital expenditure for 2016-17 showed a fall of 1.1% from the first estimate for 2015-16: The Pefo also continues to use budget figures for employment growth, which actually suggest things are about to get pretty bad for those looking for work. While the Pefo notes that \u201cemployment growth is expected to remain solid across the forward estimate\u201d, that \u201csolid\u201d growth is just 1.75% in 2016-17 and 2017-18 before falling to 1.25% in 2018-19, and then improving to a tepid 1.5% in 2019-20. And yet despite that, unemployment is still projected to fall to 5.5% and wage growth to rise to 3.25% by 2018-19. Given wage growth at the moment is just 2% and the outlook for inflation from the Reserve Bank of Australia is much weaker than historically has been the case, it would be rather odd for wages to rise in a period of weaker employment growth. And the problem is that weak employment growth is already with us. The latest labour force figures released on Thursday showed that annual employment growth is now just 2% \u2013 down from a high of 2.6% in December. More worrying though is that the growth in hours worked has fallen off a cliff: At the end of last year the level of hours worked was growing by 2.6% \u2013 the strongest growth since February 2011. Now it is growing by just 0.4%; without a quick turnaround it will soon be going backwards \u2013 generally the sign of recessionary conditions. Among the reasons is that full-time employment has slowed considerably \u2013 especially for men: This is part of the ongoing issue since the global financial crisis where part-time employment has been the big driver of employment growth: Since September 2008 \u2013 when the financial crisis started hitting employment \u2013 there have been 235,400 more part-time jobs created than full-time ones: While these figures suggest a significant slowing of the employment sector, the government has been largely spared any great pain because the unemployment rate has stayed steady at 5.7%: And yet the past few months has certainly been a case of the unemployment rate hiding the bad news in the sector. Since December the participation rate has fallen from 65.2% in seasonally adjusted terms to 64.9%. A dropping participation rate is a function of more people leaving the workforce than entering it. This can be because of people retiring or because they have effectively given up looking for work \u2013 either to stay home raising kids or to stay in (or go back to) school/higher education. In the past six months the fall in participation has been across the board \u2013 both youth (15-24 year olds) and prime-aged workers (25-64 year olds) \u2013 suggesting it is not really an ageing population issue. Had the participation rate stayed where it was in November the unemployment rate would not have fallen as it has since then. Rather than being 5.7% it would be 6.1%: That doesn\u2019t mean the current unemployment rate is false, but just that, as ever, it is hostage to other aspects which can hide the weakness in the economy. Similarly the Pefo budget numbers hide the weakness that is clear within the actual report itself. The Pefo notes that \u201cthe medium-term projections are also underpinned by an assumption of annual productivity growth equal to the average of recent decades\u201d. That requires productivity growth averaging over five years around 1.7% annually. We\u2019ve been achieving that recently \u2013 but for nearly seven years until 2012 we were well below that level: Rather interestingly the statement of the secretary of the Treasury and Department of Finance suggests that to achieve this growth \u201ccontinued economic reform would be required\u201d. Just what this \u201creform\u201d would be is left unsaid, but what is clear is that the budget figures, while unchanged in the Pefo, are rather susceptible to being knocked. Whoever wins the election will be unlikely to be using these numbers by the time the estimates become actual.",

Now it is growing by just 0.4%; without a quick turnaround it will soon be going backwards \u2013 generally the sign of recessionary conditions. </p> <p>Among the reasons is that full-time employment has slowed considerably \u2013 especially for men:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Full-time employment graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DtTcZ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This is part of the ongoing issue since the global financial crisis where part-time employment has been the big driver of employment growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Part-time employment comparison graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GWWZQ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since September 2008 \u2013 when the financial crisis started hitting employment \u2013 there have been 235,400 more part-time jobs created than full-time ones:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hpN5x/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While these figures suggest a significant slowing of the employment sector, the government has been largely spared any great pain because the unemployment rate has stayed steady at 5.7%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployment rate graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5TECg/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And yet the past few months has certainly been a case of the unemployment rate hiding the bad news in the sector. </p> <p>Since December the participation rate has fallen from 65.2% in seasonally adjusted terms to 64.9%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Participation rate graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1cTil/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A dropping participation rate is a function of more people leaving the workforce than entering it. This can be because of people retiring or because they have effectively given up looking for work \u2013 either to stay home raising kids or to stay in (or go back to) school/higher education.</p> <p>In the past six months the fall in participation has been across the board \u2013 both youth (15-24 year olds) and prime-aged workers (25-64 year olds) \u2013 suggesting it is not really an ageing population issue.</p> <p>Had the participation rate stayed where it was in November the unemployment rate would not have fallen as it has since then. Rather than being 5.7% it would be 6.1%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployment graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qNxyJ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That doesn\u2019t mean the current unemployment rate is false, but just that, as ever, it is hostage to other aspects which can hide the weakness in the economy.</p> <p>Similarly the Pefo budget numbers hide the weakness that is clear within the actual report itself. The Pefo notes that \u201cthe medium-term projections are also underpinned by an assumption of annual productivity growth equal to the average of recent decades\u201d.</p> <p>That requires productivity growth averaging over five years around 1.7% annually. We\u2019ve been achieving that recently \u2013 but for nearly seven years until 2012 we were well below that level:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 8\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cMs8d/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Rather interestingly the statement of the secretary of the Treasury and Department of Finance suggests that to achieve this growth \u201ccontinued economic reform would be required\u201d.</p> <p>Just what this \u201creform\u201d would be is left unsaid, but what is clear is that the budget figures, while unchanged in the Pefo, are rather susceptible to being knocked. </p> <p>Whoever wins the election will be unlikely to be using these numbers by the time the estimates become actual.</p>",
