      "bodyText": "George Soros was also deeply scathing on Russia: Russia has become a mafia state in which the rulers use the resources of the country to enrich themselves and to maintain themselves in power. They preserve the outward appearances of democracy such as holding elections, but there is no rule of law and no arrangements for a legitimate transfer of power. I had an insider\u2019s view of how Putin became President and I could tell you horror stories. Putin became popular because he established stability after a period of profound turmoil and he used a portion of the oil revenues to assure people a rising standard of living. As long as he was popular, he was reasonably tolerant of dissent as long as it remained on the margin. But after a prearranged transfer of the presidency from Medvedev to Putin in 2012 the rising middle class joined the protests and Putin became repressive at home and adventurous abroad. He started supporting President Assad of Syria with arms on a large scale. He also felt threatened by the Arab Spring and from a Western point of view became a spoiler in the Middle East. George Soros also warned that the spread of unresolved conflict to Europe is a new threat destabilising markets: This has greatly increased the level of uncertainty, volatility and unpredictability both in financial markets and international affairs because financial events are extraneous to political dynamics and international affairs are extraneous to the dynamics of financial markets. So the increased interaction between the two is experienced as external shocks by both. For example: the financial sanctions against Russia and the collapse of oil prices. Neither of them on its own would have caused a financial crisis in Russia. This has made the job of hedge fund managers hellishly difficult. Great opportunities mostly missed or experienced as shocks. Some late news from Davos -- billionaire George Soros is giving up making money (a relief to central bankers who can remember Black Wednesday) Soros just told an event tonight that: First, some personal and institutional information. I have finally retired from managing my money. I have tried many times before but this time it\u2019s final. I am devoting all my remaining energies to what I call my political philanthropy and the two activities are not compatible. The man who beat the Bank of England also warned that nationalism is on the rise: I observe a general trend toward the weakening of international organizations and the rise of nationalism in various forms. The root cause can be identified either as the decline of the West or the rise of the rest. Nothing irreversible. The decline of the West was first identified by Werner Sombart in 1890. There have been several ups and downs since. The crash of 2008 destroyed the Washington Consensus. Since then both US and EU have been preoccupied with their internal problems. That\u2019s probably all from Davos tonight, but we\u2019ll post any new developments if they occur. Here\u2019s our full news story: Prince Andrew makes first public denial of sex allegations Prince Andrew has just left his Pitch@Palace drinks reception in Davos, briskly, with several minders. He did not respond when asked if he would be issuing a statement under oath, as requested by the lawyers representing Virginia Roberts. Prince Andrew is still inside his reception, and not showing any signs of leaving, Larry Elliott reckons. There\u2019s a steady stream of rich and powerful people down the stairs from the first floor of the Belvedere Hotel in Davos. One gentleman pretended (I think) to recoil in horror on hearing I worked for the Guardian, but his partner did say there was a \u201cvery good\u201d feeling in the reception, which was also packed out. Heather McGregor, CEO of headhunters Taylor Bennett, was also at the Duke\u2019s party. She tells me: I am absolutely delighted that the Duke of York went ahead with his plans to showcase three young British entrepreneurs to a key business audience. He has great convening power and he uses it for the benefit of young people who wouldn\u2019t get this chance otherwise. But what about the suggestion he should have kept away from Davos? I\u2019m sure those three young people are very pleased he didn\u2019t. Government minister Matthew Hancock just left Prince Andrew\u2019s reception. He didn\u2019t say much to the reporters hanging around in the corridors outside - just that Davos is a very important place for British business. Here\u2019s our early news story on Prince Andrew\u2019s statement tonight: He looked resolute and calm as he spoke for the first time to deny accusations, made in US court documents, that he had sex with a woman, Virginia Roberts, on three separate occasions when she was a minor. Lawyers acting on her behalf have filed a letter in a Florida court addressed to the duke at Buckingham Palace, asking him to take part in a two-hour interview. But speaking to leading figures from the worlds of politics and business at Davos Andrew said: \u201cFirstly I think I must, [and] want, for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last few weeks and I just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace.\u201d He went on to say: \u201cMy focus is on my work. Full story: Prince Andrew makes first public denial of sex allegations in Davos Lord Mark Malloch Brown, the former government minister, attended the Duke of York\u2019s party.....and was snaffled for an interview with the BBC afterwards. He said that Prince Andrew has given a clear, unequivocal reiteration of what the Palace has said. And that was the right choice, given he was at an event where he wanted to put the focus on his work helping young people into employment. Larry Elliott, who was inside the Duke of York\u2019s reception, confirms that he did indeed breaks his silence over the allegations of underage sex were revealed in US court documents. The prince didn\u2019t say much new -- telling attendees at his drinks party that he felt he had to address these allegations. He \u201creiterated and reiterated\u201d the statements from Buckingham Palace of his innocence, adding: I just want to focus on my work. He then moved on to discuss other issues, such as improving the skillsets of young people to help them into employment. Andrew has reiterated his previous statements regarding the sex allegations, and insisted that he wants to focus on his work. The Duke of York says that he must address the \u201cevents\u201d of recent weeks: Right, Prince Andrew is speaking now.... Larry Elliott is inside Prince Andrew\u2019s reception, and reports that the Duke is drinking mineral water and chatting to ex Barclays boss Bob Diamond. Back at Davos: A good chart on European debt: Investors welcomed the unveiling of the ECB\u2019s long awaited bond buying programme, and at \u20ac1.14tn it was better than had been - conveniently? - leaked the previous day. Shares move sharply higher and the euro dropped against other major currencies, while bond yields in Europe fell back. There were some concerns that the initial euphoria might soon dissipate, especially given the uncertainty over this weekend\u2019s Greek election, but the initial reaction must have been all that ECB president Mario Draghi could have hoped for. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 68.59 points or 1.02% higher at 6796.63 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.32% to 10,435.62 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.52% higher at 4552.80 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.44% to 20,469.74 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.7% better at 10,510.6 In Greece the Athens market climbed 1.14% to 791.8 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 115 points or 0.65%. As for the euro, it is currently down more than a cent against the dollar to $1.1408 - a near 11 year low - and down 1% against the pound to 75.8p. Yields on bonds which will be bought by the programme also fell sharply. Italian 10 year bond yields have dropped 15 basis points to 1.54%, Spanish yields are down a similar amount to 1.39% and Greek yields are down 47 basis points at 9.03%. German yields slipped 6 basis points to 0.4%. Back with the day\u2019s big central bank news, and Societe Generale analysts say the ECB\u2019s \u20ac1.14tn QE programme is nowhere near enough if it is to hit its 2% inflation target: For inflation to reach close to a 2.0% threshold medium term, the potential amount of asset purchases needed is \u20ac2-3tn, not a mere \u20ac1tn. Should the ECB target such an expansion of its balance sheet, it would have to ease some conditions on its bond purchases (liquidity rule, quality...) or contemplate other asset classes - equity stocks, Real Estate Investment Trust, Exchange-traded fund - as the Bank of Japan, previously. So the onus will remain on delivery of better-designed fiscal policy and structural reform. But it is difficult to be hopeful on these fronts. Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com tells the tech round-table on trust that we are at an incredible phase of technology, thanks to services such as cloud computing, AI and social networks. He agrees that we need radical transparency, in order to get the radical levels of trust needed to make them work. Not so fast, point out audience members and viewers online. They point out that Salesforce.com runs Jigsaw, formally called data.com, which pulls data together and sells access to it. Back in Davos, the father of the World Wide Web has warned that the technology world needs a major revolution to rebuilt people\u2019s trust in the way data is used. Sir Tim Berners-Lee cited the rash of iPhone applications that were created to allow users to turn on the flashlight, and which could be easily downloaded through Apple\u2019s App store. Some of those applications would immediately try to access the other applications on your phone, just to turn a light on. And then they would try to access personal details: Their whole model is to steal data, and build models, and not help you at all. Berners-Lee is arguing that the tech industry needs a new approach, which he dubs \u201cbenificent\u201d (I think that\u2019s the correct spelling....) At MIT, where he works, they are trying to ask whether their new projects are \u201cbenificent, being good for users. That business model has been almost lost, but we will move back to it as people get fed up with the way tech firms use (or abuse?) their data away, Berners-Lee says. But he has a killer pay-off line, guaranteeing trust and transparency will also need a new architecture to make it work. The UK chancellor has been chatting with Harvard professor Kenneth Rogoff, and the Telegraph\u2019s Szu Ping Chan has the snap: UK chancellor George Osborne has told Bloomberg TV the ECB action was welcome but not sufficent for a European recovery. He said: I think this is welcome action from the European Central Bank but action from a central bank is necessary, but not sufficient for a European recovery. We want to see this accompanied by clear plans to make the European continent more competitive to back business in Europe, to create jobs, and to make sure public finances are in order. Now we have all those ingredients in the Uk and that is why our economic plan is delivering a strong economic recovery. We want to see all those ingredients in place on the European continent so that the whole of Europe recovers. Here\u2019s a useful indicator from RBS: After months - no years - of waiting, Mario Draghi finally announced the European Central Bank is pushing the button on quantitative easing. It comes roughly six years after the US and the UK embarked on their own versions of QE, and more than two-and-a-half years after Draghi vowed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. Here is a quick summary of what we learned: The programme will involve purchases of \u20ac60bn a month, split between private and public sector assets Purchases will run from March to the end of September 2016, totalling \u20ac1.1tn There is however some ambiguity on the timing of the end of the scheme, given Draghi also said purchases would be \u201cconducted until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term\u201d The governing council\u2019s decision to start QE now was not unanimous The ECB won\u2019t buy more than 25% of each issue of government debt, and not more than 33% of each issuers debt In a concession to Germany (long opponents of eurozone QE), Draghi promised that national central banks would bear most of the risk of their governments defaulting, with just 20% of the new bond-purchases subject to \u201crisk-sharing\u201d. The ECB has not ruled out buying Greek bonds, but said certain (unspecified) criteria would have to be met Draghi said QE would not be enough in itself to revive the eurozone economy - structural reforms at country level are also essential Markets have broadly welcomed the announcement More reaction to the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme. My colleague Jill Treanor has been talking to Lord Adair Turner, former City regulator. He said: [The ECB\u2019s move was] slightly bigger than expected with a greater element of risk sharing which was not entirely predictable. I think it will be seen as bit more than anticipated. My own belief is that the deflationary pressures in Europe are so extreme [and] we should bring in more radical moves that require elements of fiscal relaxation, fully permanent monetarised, that is categories of helicopter money. [But given that isn\u2019t going to happen] this as good as we can get. Meanwhile Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser, PwC, said the move was modest in relation to the size of the eurozone economy: The ECB plans to buy \u20ac60bn of assets each month, equivalent to around 7% of Eurozone GDP. When the Bank of England launched its QE programme in 2009, bond purchases totalled \u00a325bn, per month, over 20% of GDP. \u201cOther concerns about the effectiveness of QE remain. The ECB has left it much longer than the UK and US to launch QE, and the experience of Japan in the 1990s and 2000s suggests that delaying policy responses allows economic and financial problems to become more deeply embedded. Also, longer term interest rates in the eurozone are already very low, which reduces the scope for QE to influence financial markets by pushing down bond yields. There may be some benefit to European growth from a weaker euro, though this will also result in higher import prices, squeezing consumer spending. QE does not address the major structural factors holding back the Eurozone economy. Growth is very weak in France and Italy, the 2nd and 3rd largest economies using the euro which account for nearly 40% of eurozone GDP. Businesses are reluctant to invest, labour markets remain inflexible and governments have been slow to undertake much needed economic reforms. Until these issues are addressed, we are likely to continue to see disappointing growth in the euro area economies. And here is our round up of some of the early reaction to the quantitative easing announcement: What the experts say about the ECB\u2019s latest round of QE. Not to be left out the Danish Central Bank has cut rates for the second time in four days: The move has weakened the Danish crown from 7.4429 crowns per euro to 7.4457. On Monday it shaved 0.15 percentage points off its base rate to discourage investors from switching their funds out of eurozone banks. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has given her response to eurozone QE (thumbs up for Draghi, governments could do better): We welcome the measures announced today that will strongly reinforce the ECB\u2019s accommodative stance. The planned expansion of the ECB\u2019s balance sheet will help lower borrowing cost across the euro area, raise inflation expectations and reduce the risk of a protracted period of low inflation. These measures will also strongly increase the prospects of the ECB achieving its price stability mandate. It remains essential that the accommodative monetary stance is supported by comprehensive and timely policy actions in other areas, not least structural reforms to boost potential growth and ensure broad political support for demand management policies. The press conference is over and markets are busy digesting the implications of the ECB\u2019s unprecedented foray into quantitative easing. German government bond yields are hitting record lows. 10-year yields are at a low of 0.377%, while two-year bond yields are at -0.18%. Back to German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s speech from earlier: The Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart has given her take on the ECB story: By buying eurozone governments\u2019 bonds using electronically created money \u2013 so-called quantitative easing \u2013 the ECB hopes to shore up confidence, boost inflation, and drive down the value of the euro on foreign exchanges, helping to boost exports and kickstart growth. The \u20ac60bn a month figure includes the purchases of private sector assets the ECB had already begun in a bid to unlock credit markets. Draghi said the decision on the ECB\u2019s governing council was made with \u201cso large a majority that no vote was necessary\u201d. The launch of QE is likely to infuriate Berlin, which views it as akin to a bailout for free-spending governments such as Greece. However, with average prices already falling across the eurozone, the ECB wants to avoid the threat of a deflationary spiral, in which consumers and businesses slash spending while they wait for prices to fall further, dragging the economy into a slump. In a concession to the Germans, Draghi promised that national central banks would bear most of the risk of their governments defaulting, with just 20% of the new bond-purchases subject to \u201crisk-sharing\u201d. In an aside that will be heard loud and clear in Athens, Draghi also warned that, \u201csome additional eligibility criteria will be applied in the case of countries under an EU/IMF adjustment programme\u201d. That could allow the ECB to exclude Greek bonds from QE if, for example, a future Syriza government ditched the austerity programme imposed by its creditors. Draghi says that if bubbles emerge in individual countries, they should be addressed at a local level, with macro prudential tools rather than by monetary policy. The ECB President concedes that markets have already priced in QE because the expectation was so strong, but, he says, we haven\u2019t seen all of the upside: There is a difference between expectations and the actual announcement. The British Chambers of Commerce is not as positive about eurozone QE as the CBI. John Longworth, director general: The ECB has to act to prevent the eurozone from falling into an even more dangerous situation, but the ECB\u2019s proposed QE programme may be too little too late, given the size of the challenge. The impact of eurozone QE is heavily dependent on the money reaching eurozone businesses rather than flowing to, and through, bank balance sheets via government bonds. QE must improve conditions in the financial system and increase the availability of credit to private sector businesses in order to work. The health of the eurozone economy has a clear impact on the prosperity of the UK. Businesses in Britain, particularly our manufacturing exporters, are watching with concern to see how the ECB\u2019s QE programme impacts sterling. The ECB\u2019s QE programme is unlikely to solve the fundamental challenges facing the eurozone, which needs sweeping structural changes to return to health. UK businesses will continue to trade with Europe \u2013 but only a broad-based recovery in the Eurozone would enable them to achieve their export ambitions in continental markets. Draghi doesn\u2019t want to be drawn on the breakdown of public/private sector purchases. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to give a precise division.\u201d There is an edge of irritation in Draghi\u2019s voice as he says he finds the discussion of risk-sharing \u201cfutile\u201d. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said eurozone QE should be good for the British economy. At the moment, flagging Eurozone economies are dragging on UK and world growth. Quantitative easing will give the eurozone recovery a much-needed boost, which should also have a positive economic effect in the UK. To gain maximum effect though, this action must go hand-in-hand with structural reform. France needs to work with the business community to modernise its labour rules and Germany should invest more in infrastructure.\u201d Draghi makes it clear that the ECB alone cannot be expected to revive the eurozone, countries need to do their bit. Individual governments need to get on with structural reforms and growth-friendly consolidation. Monetary policy can create the basis for growth but for growth to pick up you need investment and for investment you need confidence and for confidence you need structural reform. The decision to announce QE at this stage was not unanimous among the governing council, Draghi admits. Although he played down divisions: A large majority agreed on the need to trigger it now. The majority was so large we didn\u2019t need to take a vote. There were different views on the need to act now. The larger than expected QE programme has lifted stock markets and seen the euro and peripheral bond yields fall, writes Nick Fletcher. After earlier being in negative territory Germany\u2019s Dax is now up 0.5%, France\u2019s Cac has added 0.88%, Italy\u2019s FTSEMIB has jumped 1.4% and Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 1.3%. In the UK the FTSE 100 is up 0.54%. The euro has fallen sharply, down more than 1% against the dollar at $1.1481 and hitting a seven year low against the pound at 75.95p. Spanish 10 year bond yields have fallen to 1.491%, down around 5 basis points while Italian yields dropped to 1.636%, down 6 basis points and Greek yields are 12 basis points lower at 9.37%. The floor is opened to questions on the ECB\u2019s \u20ac1.1tn QE programme. Draghi says the ECB will buy government debt to a proportion that will allow \u201ca proper market price formation\u201d - it won\u2019t buy more than 25% of each issue, and not more than 33% of each issuers debt. Major markets appear satisfied for now - all trading higher. However, Marc Ostwald, strategist at ADM Investor Services International describes it as \u201ca messy compromise\u201d: So far market is impressed by \u20ac60 Bln per month, but details are a little bit sparse, loss sharing is very limited, and it is not clear as to how they will determine how much Govt bond/ Supra QE there will be each month, given 60 Bln includes ABS and CB programmes - what will be the mechanism. It\u2019s almost as though they have made this so complicated that markets cannot react! Plenty of scope for markets to be disappointed when the details are published at 14.30. On balance this does smack of a very convoluted and complex compromise. Here is Mario Draghi\u2019s introductory statement in full. Draghi says that low oil prices should help households and a wider economic recovery. \u201cHowever the euro area recovery is likely to be dampened by continued high unemployment and [high public debt].\u201d He says the risks remain to the \u201cdownside\u201d, but that the ECB\u2019s action today should improve the outlook. Draghi says the decision was taken to counter two unfavourable factors - weak inflation and weak growth. The ECB President admits the action the central bank took last year was \u201cinsufficient\u201d to ward off the threat of deflation. The actions will sizeably increase the ECB\u2019s balance sheet, he says, and support its forward guidance on interest rates. These factors should strengthen demand and support money and credit growth and thereby return inflation to about 2%. \u201cDon\u2019t read too much into our delay, the elevators weren\u2019t working\u201d, Draghi says. Here is the decision: The ECB will make monthly purchases of \u20ac60bn until the end of September 2016. Draghi says the ECB will start the purchases in March. Draghi is taking his seat. He looks relaxed. While we wait for Mario Draghi, Angela Merkel has been speaking in Davos and Graeme Wearden is following the action: The press are gathered. But where is Mario Draghi? He\u2019s keeping the world waiting. Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference will be live-streamed here. 10 minutes to go. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist, gives some context ahead of the ECB press conference in Frankfurt (now less than 20 mins away). Yesterday\u2019s reports that the Governing Council has been considering purchases of \u20ac50bn per month, perhaps up to a total of \u20ac1trn, have raised expectations even further so that a programme of \u20ac500bn or less would now be a serious let-down. Meanwhile, the positive impact even of a big programme could be diluted if, as mooted, the risks associated with the purchases remain with the national central banks, notionally eliminating \u201crisk sharing\u201d. Whether or not Mr Draghi signals that the programme may be extended in the future, and what objectives the ECB has for QE, might also be important influences on how it is initially received. Regardless of the precise details, though, it is worth remembering that the international experience of QE has been mixed at best and that there are reasons \u2013 not least the weakness of the banking system and already low levels of bond yields \u2013 to think that it might be less effective in the euro-zone than elsewhere. In short, QE is coming but don\u2019t expect it to cure all of the currency union\u2019s troubles. While we wait for the press conference to begin in Frankfurt at 13.30 (UK time), here is a reminder of what markets are expecting from ECB President Mario Draghi and his colleagues today: A massive bond-buying programme aimed at breathing some life into the ailing eurozone economy and revive inflation (currently at -0.2%) Eurozone sovereign bond purchases of \u20ac50bn (\u00a338bn) a month, starting in March Programme to run to 2016, with purchases totalling \u20ac1.1tn Here is the full statement from the ECB\u2019s governing council on its rate decisions: At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively. Further monetary policy measures will be communicated by the President of the ECB at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. CET today. So the European Central Bank has given no clues on its planned QE programme in the initial policy statement. We will have to wait until the press conference at 13.30. Here are the snaps from Reuters: 22-Jan-2015 12:44 - ECB SAYS LEAVES BENCHMARK REFINANCING RATE UNCHANGED AT 0.05 PCT 22-Jan-2015 12:44 - ECB SAYS LEAVES INTEREST RATE ON MARGINAL LENDING UNCHANGED AT 0.30 PCT 22-Jan-2015 12:44 - ECB SAYS LEAVES INTEREST RATE ON DEPOSIT FACILITY UNCHANGED AT -0.20 PCT 22-Jan-2015 12:44 - ECB SAYS LEAVES MAIN REFINANCING RATE UNCHANGED AT 0.05 PCT 22-Jan-2015 12:44 - ECB SAYS LEAVES RATE ON MARGINAL LENDING UNCHANGED AT 0.30 PCT 22-Jan-2015 12:44 - ECB SAYS LEAVES RATE ON DEPOSIT FACILITY UNCHANGED AT -0.20 PCT 22-Jan-2015 12:45 - ECB SAYS TO COMMUNICATE FURTHER MEASURES ON MONETARY POLICY AT PRESS CONFERENCE The ECB has left all key rates on hold. More soon. Wait for it wait for it... Markets keenly await the European Central Bank\u2019s policy decision on quantitative easing. In less than five minutes we will get the initial policy statement - which may or may not give us detail on QE plans. It might be that we have to wait until Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference at 13.30 (UK time) for the full details. Keep reading the blog for live updates and reaction. Another flurry (but no shouting) in the Davos conference centre as Angela Merkel arrives. She\u2019s giving a keynote address in 45 minutes (2.15pm CET/1.15pm GMT). That\u2019s going to clash somewhat with Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference over at the ECB. We\u2019re going to focus on Draghi, and catch up with Merkel afterwards (Graeme will be tweeting any important points: @graemewearden ) Baroness Amos, UN undersecretary for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, says the international community must learn lessons from the Ebola crisis which has hit some of the poorest parts of Africa \u2013 and also reached the UK and the US. Jill Treanor reports: Speaking at a panel to discuss the way pandemics are handed, Amos said that much more support was needed, better co-ordinated and more long-term approach taken. \u201cWe should not be having to scramble around to raise money to put in place to set up the supply chains,\u201d said Amos, who was sitting alongside the former head of UN Kofi Annan. She said a crisis such as Ebola required a \u201ca swift flexible and immediate response what we have is an assumption that the humanaitry committee will step in\u201d. But she highlighted the difficulties in coordinating the various bodies and said goverments, businesses and NGOs needed to work together. \u201cIt has to be partnership... no one agency can do it on its own. This is what this current ebola crisis has highlighted for us. It is major coordination challenge,\u201d she said, saying there are\u201d glaring gaps in there\u201d. \u201cWe have agencies with separate and overlapping mandates, we are highly bureaucratic,\u201d she said, \u201cWe have to be honest and clear about that,\u201d she said. There needed to be support for prevention, with a global platform to coordinate the business and public sectors and funding platform that can be tapped to in times of crisis. There also needed to be clarity on the roles and responsibilities of those involved. She finished her opening remarks pointing out that the three countries currently being dealt with \u2013 Guinea, Sierra Leoni and Liberia \u2013 were \u201cpost conflict\u201d. \u201cI think we are way too short-term ,we have to be in for the longer term. We have to say as a global community to say we are going to be with you for the next, twenty years, for example\u201d. General Al-Sisi didn\u2019t completely avoid media attention, though. After addressing Davos, Egypt\u2019s president was whisked through the conference centre in a security throng. There was a brief kerfuffle. Someone called out to him, along the lines of \u201cWould you like me to find some liberals for you to fight?\u201d, before al-Sisi vanished into the off-limit rooms. The Duke of York has arrived in Davos before his cocktail party this evening. His public appearance comes as lawyers acting for the woman who alleges she was forced by a multimillionaire financier to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17, formally request that he respond under oath to her accusations. AM Just grabbed a quick word with Enda Kenny, Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach. He warned Davos this morning that Europe faces a \u201cchasm of disconnection\u201d between its institutions and member states. So what\u2019s the solution? Europe needs to build closer ties with citizens, he explains, so people understand the benefits for them and their kids. Ireland has has several referendums over the years, Kenny points out, which makes people think about the relationship with Brussels. That\u2019s not happened in other countries, meaning public engagement can \u201cdrift\u201d. So you\u2019d welcome a UK referendum on EU membership? Totally a matter for the UK, Kenny replies. But he does want Britain to remain as a very important member of the EU, and supports David Cameron\u2019s push to complete the single market and reduce red tape. Al-Sisi\u2019s claim that Egypt\u2019s youth are its future is causing a stir on Twitter: UK manufacturers are less optimistic about their export prospects, according to the latest quarterly CBI industrial trends survey. Expectations for export order volumes fell to show a balance of +1, down from +9 in the last survey in October. In January total orders fell from +5 in December to +4. Output expectations dropped from +16 to +13, the lowest since October 2-13. CBI director of economics Rain Newton-Smith said: Exports have grown modestly but there is a feeling that we will not see a repeat in the next quarter, with the eurozone still treading water and battling inflation. Soon we will see the European Central Bank\u2019s response to the eurozone\u2019s problems, of course. General al-Sisi didn\u2019t have to defend Egypt\u2019s human rights record: Egypt\u2019s president al-Sisi just addressed Davos. He claimed a connection betweem uprisings in Egypt and the Unity March in Paris, and also declared: \u201cWe are extremely serious about creating a democratic system in Egypt in which everyone can participate.\u201d Journalists at Davos aren\u2019t impressed that al-Sisi is in town, given that three colleagues are still locked up in his jails. What can we expect and when from the ECB today? At 12.45 (UK time) the central bank will issue a statement outlining the governing council\u2019s decisions on key interest rates. We will hopefully get some indication on QE in the statement, but we will probably have to wait until the press conference at 13.30 for the full details. The press conference will be live streamed here. AM For all the facts and figures on Davos, read the Guardian\u2019s briefing here. A taster of the delegate breakdown is shown in the charts below. There is also a good spinning globe infographic on the WEF website here. AM \u201cMario Draghi is not in Davos this year but is still managing to dominate events,\u201d Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s Economics Editor, reports from the Swiss ski resort. A few extracts from Larry\u2019s blog below, but the full report can be found here. All anybody wants to talk about today at the World Economic Forum is the European Central Bank and quantitative easing. How much? For how long? What concessions have been made to the Germans? Will it make any real difference to the enfeebled state of the eurozone? After so many false dawns in the past, the prevailing mood is one of caution. There is very little sense among the business leaders or the policy chiefs that buying \u20ac50bn (\u00a338bn) of sovereign bonds a month will do much good. Rather, the feeling is that not doing it could do even more damage to an economy already in deflation. Things do not look all that promising for the eurozone. There has been too much austerity, too little structural reform, the transmission mechanism is impaired. So, is there any point to QE? Yes, because banks have been paying back the cheap loans to the ECB they were granted at the height of the crisis. The ECB\u2019s balance sheet has been shrinking for the past 18 months. Buying bonds will offset the tightening impact of that process. In addition, the euro has dropped sharply on the foreign exchanges in anticipation of ECB action. Failure to deliver will reverse that process, making imports cheaper and adding to deflationary pressure. ECB action on Thursday will not transform the eurozone\u2019s economic prospects. But doing nothing would make a bad state of affairs even worse. AM As George Osborne attends the WEF in Davos today, the latest figures on the public finances show he has a lot more work to do on getting the deficit down. The government borrowed \u00a32.9bn more in December than a year earlier. A reminder - if needed - of the scale of the task still facing the Chancellor on deficit reduction. Borrowing totalled \u00a313.1bn in December according to the Office for National Statistics. It was far higher than economists polled by Reuters had expected, forecasting a much lower \u00a39.7bn. In the first nine months of the fiscal year (April to December), borrowing totalled \u00a386.3bn, \u00a3100m lower than the same period a year earlier. The additional borrowing in December took the national debt to \u00a31.48trn, or 80.9% of GDP. That meant debt was \u00a394.6bn higher than it was in December 2013. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at German bank Berenberg, said January would be a \u201cmake-or-break\u201d month for the public finances: The government is banking on a flood of self-assessment tax receipts, relating to income earned in the fiscal year ending last April (which in turn reflected workers delaying income to take advantage of a cut in the higher rate of income tax), to improve the borrowing picture markedly. It is worth remembering though that the first stab at January\u2019s data by the statisticians will be particularly uncertain. Some self-assessment tax receipts are paid too late for the number crunchers to count in the data and will not be reflected until later on. That might mean January starts off disappointing but subsequently improves. In any case, January will tell us a lot about whether George Osborne\u2019s latest borrowing forecasts are veering far off course already. We expect economic growth to beat consensus forecasts, so we look for borrowing to gradually improve, with VAT receipts in particular benefitting consumers spending the money they save from cheaper petrol and food. But with wage growth still weak, the UK government finances are unlikely to see a rapid improvement. AM Finland will not be willing to consider renegotiating Greece\u2019s debts if the left-wing Syriza party wins power, PM Alex Stubb declared to the Davos conference hall. Asked about Sunday\u2019s Greek elections, Stubb reiterated Finland\u2019s hardline position on the issue, potentially drawing the battle lines with Alexis Tsipras, Syriza\u2019s leader. There has been a lot of solidarity in Europe. We have taken extensive measure to stabilise the eurozone, Stubb says. Ireland is back in the markets, Portugal is back in the markets. Greece is trying to get back. Syriza, of course, says it will negotiate a debt relief package if it wins Sunday\u2019s poll. Stubb says he cannot take issue with an election in another country. But -- in the \u201cstate of fairness\u201d -- he wants to tell the Greek electorate and the Finnish electorate what Finland\u2019s position is. Which is: We will deal with any democratically elected government Greece has. But it will be very hard for us to forgive any loans or restructure any debt at this moment. The best Finland can offer is to look at debt extensions (so repaying over a long time), or new adjustment programmes (another bailout? That would be politically toxic in Greece). And Stubb suggests Greece faces one of three futures 1) Things continue as they are. 2) A continued period of instability negotiating something around extensions -- but not the debt levels. 3) A dirty exit (from the eurozone) And we must do everything in our power to avoid a dirty exit, he concludes. Finland\u2019s prime minister is putting a brave face on the prospect of a Eurozone QE package today. Alex Stubb told Davos: We firmly believe in the independence of the ECB. Whatever they do today, we will welcome with a smile. Dutch PM Mark Rutte isn\u2019t happy that some countries (France, perhaps?) are still debating whether to take tough decisions on their economy. Europe needs to do a lot more to become competitive, he tells Davos. I am concerned that there is still debate in some countries about whether to take such measures. My plea is that we step up the game. The weakening in the euro has been great for Ireland, Enda Kenny declares, by helping exports and tourism. That chimes with Christine Lagarde\u2019s point earlier today about QE expectations already helping. His big hope is that the young people who left Ireland to look for work will be able to come home, if they choose, bringing new skills. Irish leader Enda Kenny says Ireland has made important progress since the debt crisis, lowering its deficit, borrowing at record low levels, returning to growth (4% this year, perhaps) and cutting unemployment. It shows the merits of working closely with the commission and with the ECB, We must fix the \u201cchasm of disconnection between the commission, the council and individual countries\u201d, he urges Davos. Only by working closer with these institutions will Europe get growth and stability. Kenny also warns that Ireland\u2019s recovery is \u201cfragile and incomplete\u201d. We need another three to five years of stead growth and stability, working with Europe. Antony Jenkins, the chief executive of Barclays, is in Davos and has been speaking to Bloomberg Television. Here is what he had to say about the recent market volatility: The one certain thing is that we live in a very uncertain world \u2013 look at the price. What is driving this volatility is an increase in geopolitical instability, and structurally lower macroeconomic growth that creates pressure in local economies. We can expect volatility in commodities and currencies for the foreseeable future.Volatility affects every business, but the point for business leaders like me is to build resilience into you business. On the future of Barclays investment bank: If you go back a decade or so, people like me were talking about getting bigger. The reality today is the constraints on balance sheets [with more capital to be held] requires you have to focus. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in the investment bank, focusing on where we can generate returns for our customers. I\u2019ve already said the investment bank will be no more than 30% of the business. AM Sigmar Gabriel also points out that in 2003, Germany and France broke the measures in the Maastricht treaty. But there\u2019s a big difference. We started our structural reforms then, but France did not. We\u2019d have had to make even deeper savings to stick within Maastricht. But wasn\u2019t it easier for Germany to restructure precisely because other country\u2019s weren\u2019t restructuring? Gabriel agrees that reforms aren\u2019t easy -- they must always be combined with education and measures to boost innovation. The Europe debate starts with a question on QE, for Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor: Have we reached an inflation point where despite all the structural reforms, we need a more active and pro-active stimulus for Europe? Germany\u2019s vice-president Sigmar Gabriel argues that we shouldn\u2019t give up on structural reforms. Germany took tough decisions in the last decade, and we only enjoyed the fruits of that work around eight years later. Why should it be different for other countries? He points out that countries such as Greece are taking measure that are \u201cmuch more stringent\u201d than Germany was prepared to take. He suggests that EC president Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s plan does contain measures for structural reforms and growth. The main hall at Davos is now filling up (slowly) for a debate on Europe, starring four European leaders. They\u2019re discussing the twin challenges of stability and growth. They are Latvia\u2019s PM Laimdota Straujuma, Irish leader Enda Kenny, Dutch PM Mark Rutte and Finland\u2019s PM Alex Stubb. And also German vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel. Christine Lagarde\u2019s view is that a eurozone quantitative easing programme is already having an effect, as markets have pushed down the euro in anticipation. But as flagged earlier, Larry Summers argue that the impact of QE is limited: Santander chief Ana Botin was more upbeat, though -- with QE on the way, Europe is heading towards recovery with a more stable and effective currency union. And that\u2019s the end of the session. European investors appear to be in a cautiously optimistic mood ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s big announcement on quantitative easing. Germany, which has been strong opponent of QE, is slightly down. All major indices are slightly up, apart from Germany\u2019s DAX. FTSE 100: +0.3% at 6,745.4 France\u2019s CAC 40: +0.1% at 4,488.92 Germany\u2019s DAX 30: -0.06 at 10,292.63 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.7% at 10,409.1 AM With European borrowing costs at such record lows, policymakers must realise that they have more options, argues Larry Summers: I do not accept that there is limited room for advanced borrowing by Europe... there is limited imagination, he says. And on the ECB\u2019s meeting today, Summers asks whether anyone thinks the situation is \u201csatisfactorily in hand\u201d if a substantial QE programme is announced today. Does anyone think that Europe has a basis for growth if the strategy is QE and asking the south to do more structural reforms? But can we afford not to have QE in Europe? We\u2019re all for QE in Europe. We can\u2019t afford not to have it. It\u2019s necessary, but it\u2019s not sufficient. It\u2019s a big mistake to think that quantitative easing is some magic cure for the world\u2019s ills, argues Larry Summers. I agree with Christine [Lagarde] that QE has already had significant impact, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m worried. We\u2019ve already had a set of positive developments, and the economic forecasts are pretty dismal from here. Europe\u2019s youth unemployment crisis shows the need for a big quantitative easing programme from the ECB, says Ray Dalio, head of investment firm Bridgewater Associates. Sitting alongside Lagarde, he explains: In Italy and Spain, youth unemployment is 50%. There will be a lost generation. There needs to be forceful action or there is going to be political extremism. Forceful QE and forceful structural reforms would be what\u2019s required. And Sunday\u2019s Greek elections are a \u201cstraw in the wind\u201d for where Europe is heading. Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s breakfast meeting with bosses of major UK companies has broken up, Jill Treanor reports. While those who left were tight lipped about the conversation that took place, it seems that George Osborne was keen for business people to shout out about their ability to create jobs. Around 30 chief executives and chairman met the Chancellor, who sat alongside the head of the CBI John Cridland. Among those there to hear Obsorne speak were boardroom veteran Sir Roger Carr, Sir David Walker, the outgoing chairman of Barclays, Gavin Patterson, the boss of BT, Antonio Simeos, the UK head of HSBC and Iain Conn, the BP veteran who now runs Centrica. Osborne\u2019s gathering , which was organised by accountants KPMG, takes place at a sensitive time for business leaders operating the UK and when the UK\u2019s position in the EU is being questioned. Ahead of the general election in May, business leaders are expecting a turbulent period with major sectors such as banking, energy supply and supermarket\u2019s treatment of suppliers likely to be hot topics for politicians. Lagarde isn\u2019t impressed by the argument that the US economy is too weak to support a rate hike: If the US is in a bad place, we are short of any engine of growth. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, argues strongly that the Federal Reserve should not raise rates yet. He tells the Davos panel that the risks are \u201cenormously asymmetric..of setting off a spiral towards deflation\u201d. The Fed should not be fighting against inflation until it sees the whites of its eyes. (reminder, the panel is streamed live here) Raising US interest rates will strengthen the US dollar even more, and cause a chilling effect on the US economy, Gary Cohn adds (he\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer of Goldman). Gary Cohn of Goldman Sachs isn\u2019t so confident that the US will raise rates as early as this summer, as Lagarde suggests. He tells Davos that while the US economy is growing, he\u2019s concerned about the Fed\u2019s ability to raise rates given what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world, in Japan and Europe. And US inflation is \u201cnowhere close\u201d to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and falling commodity prices mean we\u2019re a long way from it, he concludes. Christine Lagarde has predicted that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in 2015, probably around the middle of this year. Speaking on the big panel debate on monetary policy, the managing director of the IMF said that: The Federal Reserve is probably going to raise rates this year. Our expectation at the IMF is it is more likely to happen in mid-year, rather than the end of 2015, contrary to what the markets expect. That\u2019s a good sign, Lagarde argues -- it shows the US is growing. Employment is up, unemployment is down, and inflation is \u201chopefully giving little signs of moving in the right direction\u201d. Yellen has done a \u201cterrific job\u201d of communicating with the market, Lagarde says, But the process won\u2019t be painless. Raising US interest rates will unavoidably cause \u201cside effects, spillovers and volatility\u201d. Good advanced planning by HSBC, which chose \u201cEurope at the Crossroads\u201d as the subject for its breakfast meeting long before it knew that today would be the day when Draghi was to make his big announcement. Economics editor Larry Elliott was there, and reports: Zhu Min, deputy managing director of the IMF, says he is worried about the collapse in investment as a share of GDP across the euro zone. Min said \u201cThe ECB should take bold action. An accommodative monetary policy (a posh way of saying \u201cdo QE\u201d) will create the policy space for other policy action as well. The ECB balance sheet has shrunk in the past 18 months. It needs to pump liquidity into the system.\u201d But Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management, quotes John Maynard Keynes when she says QE will be like \u201cpushing on a piece of string\u201d. Banks will use the extra liquidity provided by the ECB to shore up their balance sheets so they won\u2019t lend it out to the real economy, she says. Tim Adams, former US Treasury official and now chief executive at the Institute for International Finance, says the difference between the euro zone and the US is that the Americans moved fast to clean up their banks after the financial crisis. \u201cThe banking system was not fixed as quickly in the eurozone as it was in the US\u201d. Reminder, you can follow a live video-feed from WEF here. It\u2019s a huge day for the eurozone, and for Mario Draghi personally. Can he deliver \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro, as he promised back in the summer of 2012? The eloquent President of the European Central Bank is accustomed to the spotlight, but the pressure is particularly intense today. Global markets will be listening to every word. Policymakers will be hoping that quantitative easing will be enough to turn around the flagging economy and stoke inflation, but many fear it will be too little too late. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, sums up the enormity of the moment (borrowing from Star Trek) Con permiso Mr Draghi, the hall is rented, the orchestra engaged, now it\u2019s time to see if you can dance. AM Angela Merkel and Mario Draghi are two of the most powerful figures in Europe right now, so it\u2019s a little irksome that they\u2019ll be speaking at the same time this afternoon...... The ex-head of the Bundesbank, Axel Weber, is arguing against a big eurozone QE package....even as his former colleagues at the ECB dicuss the idea in Frankfurt. UBS has handed out Fitbit pedometers to Davos attendees - promising to give a bicycle to African schoolchildren for every delegate who walks at least 6km per day. Weber claims to be ahead of the pack: Climate change continues to be a big issue at Davos. Last night, the president of the World Bank (via the Guardian) put his weight behind the issue. Jim Kim told us: \u201cWe are seeing the accelerated impact of climate change. Last year was the hottest on record. That matters. Extreme weather is real. It\u2019s a complete no brainer to move towards cleaner more liveable cities,\u201d Davos 2015: World Bank chief makes climate action plea The bosses of the biggest companies in the UK have piled into a private breakfast with Chancellor George Osborne in Davos, my colleague Jill Treanor reports. Salmon and scrambled eggs are on the menu. Among those in attendance are Gavin Patterson, boss of BT, City heavy-hitter Sir Roger Carr and Barclays chairman Sir David Walker. Around 30 people are in attendance. The chancellor usually uses his visits to the Alpine ski resort, currently mobbed by world leaders and business leaders, to hold private meetings with the representatives of big businesses from the UK who are also attending the World Economic Forum. Good morning from Davos, Switzerland, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is underway. Today\u2019s meeting of the powerful will be overshadowed, to a degree, by events in Frankfurt where the European Central Bank may announce a new stimulus package this afternoon. The latest speculation is that it the ECM might pledge to buy \u20ac50bn of government bonds with new money each month until the end of 2016. QE is also on the agenda at Davos, we\u2019ll be kicking off with a big debate about the end of America\u2019s stimulus programme shortly, including IMF chief Christine Lagarde. Several European leaders are in town too; some hoping that Mario Draghi can give their economies a lift. Angela Merkel, though, may have concerns about such unconventional monetary policy. She\u2019s due to be addressing WEF at the same time as Draghi is speaking in Frankfurt.... George Osborne, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer, is also in Davos today, we understand. As is Gordon Brown, discussing inequality. That\u2019s two former UK PMs in as many days, after Tony Blair discussed religion (and Iraq) yesterday. Cybersecurity and the future of technology is also on the Davos agenda today, with many leading tech CEOs and pioneers appearing on panels this afternoon. And then tonight, the Duke of York is due to hold his annual party for UK trade. Will he speak to the media? Last night, it emerged that US lawyers have asked Prince Andrew to respond under oath to underage sex allegations, which he denies. The Agenda: As usual, there\u2019s lots on at Davos, plus the ECB news. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll try to cover: 9am CET/8am GMT: Discussion on the ending of America\u2019s quantitative easing programme; with Christine Lagarde, Santander chief Ana Botin, Gary Cohn of Goldman Sachs, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater, and former US Treasury chief Larry Summers 10.15am CET: Debate on European growth, with German vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, Irish leader Enda Kenny, Dutch PM Mark Rutte and Finland\u2019s PM Alex Stubbe. 10.30am CET: Unicef press conference on growth and inequality, including former UK PM Gordon Brown 11.30am CET: Egypt\u2019s president Sisi is speaking 12.30pm CET: Debate on pandemics such as ebola, including former UN secretary general Kofi Annan 1.45pm CET: ECB ANNOUNCEMENT 2.15pm CET: Angela Merkel\u2019s special address to Davos 2.30pm CET: Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference begins in Frankfurt 4.45pm CET: How can tech firms retain our trust?

There were some concerns that the initial euphoria might soon dissipate, especially given the uncertainty over this weekend\u2019s Greek election, but the initial reaction must have been all that ECB president Mario Draghi could have hoped for.

Italian 10 year bond yields have dropped 15 basis points to 1.54%, Spanish yields are down a similar amount to 1.39% and Greek yields are down 47 basis points at 9.03%.

My colleague Jill Treanor has been talking to Lord Adair Turner, former City regulator. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The ECB\u2019s move was] slightly bigger than expected with a greater element of risk sharing which was not entirely predictable. I think it will be seen as bit more than anticipated. My own belief is that the deflationary pressures in Europe are so extreme [and] we should bring in more radical moves that require elements of fiscal relaxation, fully permanent monetarised, that is categories of helicopter money.</p> <p>[But given that isn\u2019t going to happen] this as good as we can get.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser, PwC, said the move was modest in relation to the size of the eurozone economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ECB plans to buy \u20ac60bn of assets each month, equivalent to around 7% of Eurozone GDP. When the Bank of England launched its QE programme in 2009, bond purchases totalled \u00a325bn, per month, over 20% of GDP.</p> <p>\u201cOther concerns about the effectiveness of QE remain. The ECB has left it much longer than the UK and US to launch QE, and the experience of Japan in the 1990s and 2000s suggests that delaying policy responses allows economic and financial problems to become more deeply embedded. Also, longer term interest rates in the eurozone are already very low, which reduces the scope for QE to influence financial markets by pushing down bond yields. There may be some benefit to European growth from a weaker euro, though this will also result in higher import prices, squeezing consumer spending.</p> <p>QE does not address the major structural factors holding back the Eurozone economy. Growth is very weak in France and Italy, the 2nd and 3rd largest economies using the euro which account for nearly 40% of eurozone GDP. Businesses are reluctant to invest, labour markets remain inflexible and governments have been slow to undertake much needed economic reforms. Until these issues are addressed, we are likely to continue to see disappointing growth in the euro area economies.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is our round up of some of the early reaction to the quantitative easing announcement:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/what-the-experts-say-about-the-eus-latest-round-of-quantitative-easing\">What the experts say about the ECB\u2019s latest round of QE.</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-01-22T15:32:56.038Z\">at 3.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54c1129ce4b00702a613cfe4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-22T15:12:53.281Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Not to be left out the Danish Central Bank has cut rates for the second time in four days:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/statuses/558278608914247680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>*DANISH CENTRAL BANK CUTS DEPOSIT RATE TO -0.35% FROM -0.2%</p>&mdash; World First (@World_First) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/558278608914247680\">January 22, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The move has weakened the Danish crown from 7.4429 crowns per euro to 7.4457.

Yes, because banks have been paying back the cheap loans to the ECB they were granted at the height of the crisis. The ECB\u2019s balance sheet has been shrinking for the past 18 months. Buying bonds will offset the tightening impact of that process.</p> <p>In addition, the euro has dropped sharply on the foreign exchanges in anticipation of ECB action.

It was far higher than economists polled by Reuters had expected, forecasting a much lower \u00a39.7bn.</p> <p>In the first nine months of the fiscal year (April to December), borrowing totalled \u00a386.3bn, \u00a3100m lower than the same period a year earlier.</p> <p>The additional borrowing in December took the national debt to \u00a31.48trn, or 80.9% of GDP. That meant debt was \u00a394.6bn higher than it was in December 2013.</p> <p><strong>Rob Wood, chief UK economist at German bank Berenberg</strong>, said January would be a \u201cmake-or-break\u201d month for the public finances:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government is banking on a flood of self-assessment tax receipts, relating to income earned in the fiscal year ending last April (which in turn reflected workers delaying income to take advantage of a cut in the higher rate of income tax), to improve the borrowing picture markedly. </p> <p>It is worth remembering though that the first stab at January\u2019s data by the statisticians will be particularly uncertain. Some self-assessment tax receipts are paid too late for the number crunchers to count in the data and will not be reflected until later on. That might mean January starts off disappointing but subsequently improves. </p> <p>In any case, January will tell us a lot about whether George Osborne\u2019s latest borrowing forecasts are veering far off course already. We expect economic growth to beat consensus forecasts, so we look for borrowing to gradually improve, with VAT receipts in particular benefitting consumers spending the money they save from cheaper petrol and food.

He said there should be a \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d on such warnings.</p> <p>The ECB had already announced, in a statement earlier on Thursday, that it would leave its main interest rate unchanged at 0.05%.</p> <p>In a concession to German reservations, Draghi promised that national central banks would bear much of the risk of their governments defaulting, with just 20% of the new bond-purchases subject to \u201crisk-sharing\u201d between member countries. Some analysts fear that could dent the effectiveness of the policy.</p> <p>In an aside that will be heard loud and clear in Athens, Draghi also warned: \u201cSome additional eligibility criteria will be applied in the case of countries under an EU/IMF adjustment programme.\u201d</p> <p>That could allow the ECB to exclude Greek bonds from QE if, for example, the populist Syriza party wins Sunday\u2019s general election and ditches the austerity programme imposed by its creditors.</p>",

Draghi echoed Merkel\u2019s call for national governments to take their own steps to kickstart growth, stressing that QE alone would not repair the eurozone economy. \u201cWhat monetary policy can do is to create the basis for growth, but for growth to pick up you need investment, for investment you need confidence, and for confidence you need structural reforms.\u201d Sony Kapoor, of the thinktank Re-Define, called on eurozone governments to respond by relaxing austerity policies and increasing public spending, to create demand and restore economic growth. \u201cToday the ECB has finally arrived as a truly \u2018European\u2019 Central Bank. It has acted against political opposition to deliver what is by most measures an ambitious programme of quantitative easing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ECB has finally, if belatedly, done its part. Now it\u2019s time for the eurozone to relax the fiscal constraint. Draghi ridiculed the doomsayers predicting that hyperinflation would eventually result from QE, saying that hawks had repeatedly warned about inflation taking off each time the ECB had cut interest rates \u2013 yet inflation remained very low. He said there should be a \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d on such warnings. The ECB had already announced, in a statement earlier on Thursday, that it would leave its main interest rate unchanged at 0.05%. In a concession to German reservations, Draghi promised that national central banks would bear much of the risk of their governments defaulting, with just 20% of the new bond-purchases subject to \u201crisk-sharing\u201d between member countries. Some analysts fear that could dent the effectiveness of the policy. In an aside that will be heard loud and clear in Athens, Draghi also warned: \u201cSome additional eligibility criteria will be applied in the case of countries under an EU/IMF adjustment programme.\u201d That could allow the ECB to exclude Greek bonds from QE if, for example, the populist Syriza party wins Sunday\u2019s general election and ditches the austerity programme imposed by its creditors.",

      "bodyText": "Buying \u20ac60bn worth of assets a month for 18 months sounds like an enormous commitment. It amounts to \u20ac1.1tn from the European Central Bank, enough to ensure a liberal serving of stock phrases about president Mario Draghi unleashing his \u201cbig bazooka\u201d to achieve \u201cshock and awe\u201d. Certainly, it was enough to excite markets. Share prices rose across Europe, government bond yields fell and the euro slumped. The latter will import a little inflation (the whole point of the exercise) and help eurozone exporters become more competitive. But, if we\u2019ve learned anything over the years about the eurozone\u2019s attempts to help itself, it is never to trust the market\u2019s first reaction. Initial wild enthusiasm is often replaced by a sinking realisation that the problems go very deep indeed. Exhibits A and B would be the two Greek bailouts. The second reaction was: when\u2019s the next one? One could also pose the same question to the European Central Bank about QE: what happens in September 2016 when the initial \u20ac1.1tn programme is exhausted? The hope, of course, is that the job will be done by then \u2013 that the deflationary threat will be tamed and that the ECB, instead of downgrading growth forecasts every time it speaks, will be announcing upgrades. But isn\u2019t it more likely that the outlook will be blurry and the ECB will face calls to launch QE2? That\u2019s how the script played out in the US and the UK, which took the plunge (the US even had QE3). Economists at Societe Generale are already predicting that \u20ac2tn-\u20ac3tn of QE will be needed to restore inflation in the eurozone to close to 2%. Would sceptical Germans cheer another dose of monetary medicine that, come September 2016, may have produced only minor improvements? Not without a fight, one suspects. Thursday\u2019s vote was not unanimous and Draghi was forced to accept that 80% of any losses from bond-buying will sit with national central banks. Note, too, that Draghi was ambiguous about whether the ECB\u2019s programme is open-ended. He said buying will continue until at least September next year and \u201cin any case be conducted until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d. That leaves plenty of room to squabble over the meaning of the phrase \u201csustained adjustment\u201d. One shouldn\u2019t be too churlish, of course. The eurozone has needed a shot in the arm for at least three years and the ECB seems to be the only body capable of constructing a consensus, if not unanimity. Deflation had to be confronted. Draghi has done well to get to this point given the eurozone\u2019s poisonous politics. But the politics will remain messy, Greece\u2019s exit from the euro is possible and the eurozone is starting with rock-bottom interest rates already. Something is better than nothing but the eurozone simply doesn\u2019t do miracles. Balfour uncertainty A \u201cconspiracy of optimism\u201d has reigned at Balfour Beatty, says Leo Quinn, the new Mr Fixit chief executive, summarising what shareholders had worked out for themselves after five profits warning in two years, and then a sixth yesterday. In the UK construction division, tendering for bids was too aggressive and cost controls were inadequate. In short, Balfour had thought it could get the job done for less than it actually took. Quinn\u2019s prescription is as you would expect: charge a proper rate for the job, control costs and apply common sense. Jolly good, but also jolly vague on detail. Carillion, when it was bidding unsuccessfully for Balfour, reckoned the combination could produce cost savings of \u00a3175m. How much could Balfour achieve under its own steam? There was a suggestion that it might be half. But this was not a firm commitment. Nor do investors know what Balfour will have to spend in up-front restructuring costs. In the meantime, shareholders must digest the hard fact of a further \u00a370m shortfall in UK construction profits after a review by KPMG\u2019s number-crunchers. That sum is roughly approximate to what Balfour, in fixed form, would hope to earn from the division in a full year \u2013 in other words, a 3% margin from turnover of \u00a32.5bn. And the provisions may yet get bigger once the board\u2019s review is unveiled in March. The consolation for shareholders is that the investment division \u2013 containing schools, hospitals, court houses and the like \u2013 has been revalued upwards again. It is now worth \u00a31.3bn, some \u00a3250m more than six months ago. No wonder Quinn is keen to keep it. But one also assumes John Laing Infrastructure Fund, which made a cheeky \u00a31bn offer for the unit, won\u2019t be so keen to bid for it. In that case, and assuming Carillion is also out of the frame, shareholders are left with a self-help story. Quinn, who has delivered effective kicks to De La Rue and Qinetiq in the past, is the right man for the job. Starting at 215p a share, it\u2019s possible he can conjure a terrific recovery tale. Some analysts already see 250p of value counting all the parts, which include a healthier US division and joint ventures in the Middle East and Far East. Be wary. The line that spoke most loudly yesterday was the one about how changing the group\u2019s culture will \u201ctake time\u201d. As if to emphasise the point, the \u00a3200m share buy-back, the last slops from a disposal, has been cancelled and the dividend may be next. Precautionary measures? Maybe, but there\u2019s a lot to be cautious about at Balfour.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of the privatised Royal Mail has said the business is still under intense pressure, despite seeing a 4% rise in parcel deliveries over Christmas and benefiting from the collapse of rival City Link. Moya Greene, the chief executive said she had no option but to push through further cost-cutting, amid external predictions that 3,000 more jobs will go across the company. \u201cThe sad demise of City Link demonstrates what we have been saying \u2013 the UK parcels market remains highly competitive, with significant over-capacity,\u201d she said. \u201cThese conditions \u2013 of too many players chasing traffic \u2013 will continue to put pressure on prices for the next couple of years. We firmly believe the long-term prospects for the delivery sector remain positive, underpinned as it is by the continued growth in e-retailing,.\u201d The difficulties in the parcel delivery sector were despite a stronger operational performance for Royal Mail in December, partly due to having won customers from City Link. Royal Mail delivered 120m parcels over Christmas 4% up on last year. Its shares rose by 4% on Thursday after it predicted full-year profits would be in line with expectations. Despite the rise in the share price Royal Mail has still lost more than a quarter of its value since the \u00a33.3bn stock market flotation 18 months ago. The number of parcel deliveries across the nine months to 28 December by Royal Mail was up 3% while letters were down by 3% \u2013 but that number was still better than the forecast fall of between 4% and 6%. Greene said postmen and women provided an excellent service over the busy festive period. \u201cThis is because we started to plan for Christmas in April, putting investment behind extra sorting capacity with 10 temporary hubs and training around 19,000 extra people.\u201d Industry experts said Royal Mail had cut almost 50,000 jobs over the last 10 years and 3,000 more could go over the next 12 months, leaving the group with 145,000 staff. The employees are all leaving under voluntary severance schemes, in contrast to the abrupt departure of nearly 2,400 staff at City Link. Royal Mail is known to have taken customers from City Link, which finally called in the administrators after years of substantial losses. Rival delivery companies such as Yodel, owned by the Barclay brothers, and Hermes are also fighting for dominance. Some of the job losses at Royal Mail are due to the introduction of mechanised sorting. The company says it is under pressure owing to its commitment to the universal service obligation, allowing anyone in Britain to post letters or parcels to any other part of the country at the same price. Royal Mail complains the obligation is being undermined by rivals such as former TNT Post business, now called whistl, who are \u201ccherry picking\u201d deliveries in the more accessible city areas, making it harder to cross-subsidise deliveries to less-accessible areas. But the business secretary, Vince Cable, has accused the company of scaremongering. Analysts expect Royal Mail to report annual operating results before special charges of around \u00a3585m for 2014/15. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \u201cThe initial euphoria following the float has worn thin, with the share price having dropped 28% in the last year, as compared to a 2% dip for the wider FTSE100. \u201cThe general sentiment is that the valuation is up with events, such that the market consensus of the shares as a hold is most likely to remain intact.\u201d The company remains under pressure from the drop in letters which has also resulted from the increasing use of emails. The parcels arm is also being hit by web-based businesses such as Amazon, which are opting to establish their own operations.",

      "body": "<p>Wall Street has a saying: \u201cThe trend is your friend until it ends\u201d. In other words, enjoy rising stock prices while you can, because what goes up must come down. And after a year when the stock market has risen higher than ever, the idea that it has to come down has people pretty worried.</p> <p>The first half of January took investors for a wild ride, with stock price swings lower and then higher again.</p> <p>That may just be a preview of what investors can expect to see this year. Expect the stock market to get even wilder, and for the ripples to radiate outward into many American companies who will start fretting publicly about their earnings and share prices.</p> <p>Stock analysts are paid to gaze into their crystal balls and see trouble. They see heightened uncertainty about key economic events, like an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this year, which means stock prices may be vulnerable to dramatic moves in short periods of time.</p> <p>That is a markedly different pattern from recent years, which has generally seen a reliable and steady climb in stock prices. In 2014, the S&amp;P 500 gained 11.4%, after a nearly 30% return in 2013 and a 13.4% gain in 2012.</p> <p>After several years of steadily rising stock prices, it might be time to buckle up for a bumpy ride.</p> <p>The general backdrop does remain favorable for the stock market. Interest rates are still low, inflation is tame and more Americans are back to work. The US economy is projected to grow around 3% in 2015, which all provide a solid underpinning to continued stock market gains.</p> <p>The consensus from the experts is this: the stock market will keep going up in 2015. S&amp;P Capital IQ forecasts continued gains in the S&amp;P 500 index with a 2015 year-end target about 11% higher from current levels. </p> <p>Despite the positive backdrop there may be a spoiler in the midst. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero to encourage people to stop saving and start spending, and to push banks to lend and consumers to borrow.

      "bodyText": "Wall Street has a saying: \u201cThe trend is your friend until it ends\u201d. In other words, enjoy rising stock prices while you can, because what goes up must come down. And after a year when the stock market has risen higher than ever, the idea that it has to come down has people pretty worried. The first half of January took investors for a wild ride, with stock price swings lower and then higher again. That may just be a preview of what investors can expect to see this year. Expect the stock market to get even wilder, and for the ripples to radiate outward into many American companies who will start fretting publicly about their earnings and share prices. Stock analysts are paid to gaze into their crystal balls and see trouble. They see heightened uncertainty about key economic events, like an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this year, which means stock prices may be vulnerable to dramatic moves in short periods of time. That is a markedly different pattern from recent years, which has generally seen a reliable and steady climb in stock prices. In 2014, the S&amp;P 500 gained 11.4%, after a nearly 30% return in 2013 and a 13.4% gain in 2012. After several years of steadily rising stock prices, it might be time to buckle up for a bumpy ride. The general backdrop does remain favorable for the stock market. Interest rates are still low, inflation is tame and more Americans are back to work. The US economy is projected to grow around 3% in 2015, which all provide a solid underpinning to continued stock market gains. The consensus from the experts is this: the stock market will keep going up in 2015. S&amp;P Capital IQ forecasts continued gains in the S&amp;P 500 index with a 2015 year-end target about 11% higher from current levels. Despite the positive backdrop there may be a spoiler in the midst. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero to encourage people to stop saving and start spending, and to push banks to lend and consumers to borrow. Low interest rates are a form of stimulus. But, as the economy is improving, the Fed is cutting off that list bit of stimulus to the economy. The central bank has signaled it will start raising interest rates this year. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates this spring, the stock market may stop rising as all the men and women who buy and sell shares pause to figure out the impact of higher rates.

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymaker David Miles has argued that low inflation means there is no great urgency in returning interest rates to normal levels from their record low of 0.5%. In a speech to the University of Edinburgh Business School, Miles, who is an independent member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, said lower-than-expected inflation, driven by the rapid decline in oil prices over recent months, meant the committee should be in no hurry to raise borrowing costs. \u201cI don\u2019t think that lower inflation than seemed likely six months ago means that more expansionary policy is now needed; but it does mean that there is no great urgency in starting the process of moving monetary policy back towards a more normal setting,\u201d he said. His view echoed the minutes of the MPC\u2019s January meeting, published on Wednesday, which showed there were no votes for an interest rate rise for the first time since last August. Two hawkish members, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, withdrew their support for an increase. The MPC believes there is an even chance that inflation could drop below zero in the coming months, prompting some analysts to raise fears that the economy is sliding towards damaging deflation. But Miles, an economics professor at Imperial College, London, said: \u201cThis is a long way from the sort of deflation trap that is really worrying. This fall in inflation, rather than increasing the burden of debt in a way that can become self-reinforcing in a downwards spiral, is boosting the disposable income of households and making the burden of debt easier.\u201d As the European Central Bank prepares to press the start button on its own dose of quantitative easing, following the example of the US, UK and Japan, Miles argued that central banks still have plenty of weapons left, even when interest rates are close to zero. He suggested that QE in the UK had worked partly by prompting investors to shift money into corporate bonds, helping to unblock the dysfunctional credit markets in 2009. He also rejected the idea that in the light of the financial crisis, the Bank should be given a broader target, perhaps encompassing growth and unemployment, instead of focusing solely on hitting an inflation rate of 2%. \u201cThere is no inconsistency in setting monetary policy with regard to real things and having a remit in which an inflation target is central \u2013 provided that the target does not require you to act like an inflation \u2018nutter\u2019, a technical term which I would define as wanting to bring inflation bank to target in the shortest possible timeframe\u201d, he said.",

Two hawkish members, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, withdrew their support for an increase.</p> <p>The MPC believes there is an even chance that inflation could drop below zero in the coming months, prompting some analysts to raise fears that the economy is sliding towards damaging deflation. But Miles, an economics professor at Imperial College, London, said:</p> <p>\u201cThis is a long way from the sort of deflation trap that is really worrying. This fall in inflation, rather than increasing the burden of debt in a way that can become self-reinforcing in a downwards spiral, is boosting the disposable income of households and making the burden of debt easier.\u201d</p> <p>As the European Central Bank prepares to press the start button on its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/ecb-quantitative-easing-1-trillion-euros\" title=\"\">own dose of quantitative easing</a>, following the example of the US, UK and Japan, Miles argued that central banks still have plenty of weapons left, even when interest rates are close to zero.</p> <p>He suggested that QE in the UK had worked partly by prompting investors to shift money into corporate bonds, helping to unblock the dysfunctional credit markets in 2009.</p> <p>He also rejected the idea that in the light of the financial crisis, the Bank should be given a broader target, perhaps encompassing growth and unemployment, instead of focusing solely on hitting an inflation rate of 2%.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no inconsistency in setting monetary policy with regard to real things and having a remit in which an inflation target is central \u2013 provided that the target does not require you to act like an inflation \u2018nutter\u2019, a technical term which I would define as wanting to bring inflation bank to target in the shortest possible timeframe\u201d, he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank is set to unveil a massive bond-buying programme on Thursday to kickstart the ailing eurozone economy, with reports suggesting it could total more than \u20ac1tn. The eagerly expected quantitative easing programme, which will come two-and-a-half years after ECB president Mario Draghi said he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to protect the euro, looks to have cleared all hurdles despite strong opposition from Germany. Speculation over the details reached fever pitch in recent days, and Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi said on Wednesday the ECB could \u201chelp Europe give a message of a new economic direction\u201d. Reports out of Frankfurt on the same day suggested that the ECB is considering a sovereign bond buying programme of \u20ac50bn a month starting in March, to run through 2016, which would come to \u20ac1.1tn. This is far more than markets had been expecting, although it was also reported that no formal decision had been taken and the numbers could still change. Draghi is due to announce the unprecedented measures at a press conference at ECB headquarters in Frankfurt at 1.30pm UK time. There are concerns, however, that it is too little, too late. Growth in the 19-nation eurozone has been lacklustre, and the currency bloc slipped into deflation in December, when prices fell by 0.2%, the first annual decline for five years. Nick Kounis at ABN Amro said: \u201cWe think that the QE programme needs to be towards the upper end of the range to impress financial markets, and this looks increasingly likely.
