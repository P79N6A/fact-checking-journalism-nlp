      "bodyText": "The consumer-driven momentum that has kept the British economy afloat since the Brexit vote is declining rapidly, with new data showing households in the grip of the most protracted squeeze on living standards since the economic crisis of the mid-1970s. Against a backdrop of rising prices and stagnant wage growth, incomes adjusted for inflation have now fallen for three successive quarters, the first time this has occurred since the International Monetary Fund had to bail Britain out in 1976. At the same time, the amount being set aside as savings has now slipped to just 1.7% of disposable income \u2013 the lowest level on record, and a fraction of the near-10% average for the last 50 years. Just a year ago, it was more than three times the current rate. The new data from the Office for National Statistics shows that in the first three months of 2017, the mounting financial pressure on consumers brought the UK\u2019s strong performance following last summer\u2019s Brexit vote to an abrupt halt. On Thursday, separate figures showed an unexpected jump in consumer credit. Households borrowed an extra \u00a31.7bn in May - \u00a3300m more than had been expected \u2013 on credit cards, personal loans and car finance. A survey of consumer confidence also showed a steep decline. Despite saving less and borrowing more, consumers still reined in their spending, contributing to economic growth confirmed today at just 0.2% \u2013 the lowest of any of the major G7 industrial nations. Spending in the shops, new car sales and property transactions have all showed signs of weakness, and the Bank of England has expressed concern about rising levels of consumer debt. Monthly health checks on manufacturing, construction and services due next week will be scrutinised for signs that the hung parliament is now having an impact on business confidence, but the ONS figures show that the economy was already fragile when Theresa May called the general election. Real household income in the UK \u2013 a measure of spending power adjusted for movements in prices \u2013 fell by 1.4% in the first three months of 2017, following falls of 0.3% in the third quarter of 2016 and 0.4% in the fourth quarter. The only recent parallel for such a prolonged squeeze occurred four decades ago, when a combination of a sterling crisis, pay restraint and public spending cuts agreed with the IMF resulted in real household income falling by around 6% between the fourth quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1977. In the City, the pound fell back below $1.30 amid speculation that the Bank of England would be wary of adding to consumer pain by raising interest rates. Sterling had been edging higher after remarks by Threadneedle Street\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, were seen as a hint that the first increase in interest rates in a decade would soon be announced. The ONS said that during the first three months of 2017, the savings ratio \u2013 a measure of how much money individuals are putting away for retirement or a rainy day out of their disposable income \u2013 fell below 2% for the first time. But it added that, despite the fall in the savings ratio, individuals also spent less in the shops and on going out, contributing to the sharp slowdown in the UK economy, from 0.7% growth in the final quarter of 2016. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at City data group IHS/Markit, said: \u201cThe main drag seems to have come from weaker household spending growth, which dropped from 0.7% late last year \u2026 which can in turn be at least partly linked to a third consecutive quarterly fall in real household disposable income \u2013 its worst run since the 1970s, according to official statisticians.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cThese figures make for grim reading. People raiding their piggy banks is bad news for working people and the economy. But with wages falling as living costs rise, many families are having to run down their savings or rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month.\u201d The UK\u2019s balance of payments also fell deeper into the red in early 2017 as the trade gap in goods widened and the surplus in services widened. The one bright spot for the government from a downbeat set of economic statistics was news of a modest pickup in activity in the services sector in April. With services accounting for 79% of the economy, this raised the prospect of GDP growing in the second quarter. Darren Morgan, ONS head of GDP, said growth in the first quarter of 2017 was driven by business services and construction, with declines in some consumer-focused industries, such as shops and hotels. \u201cThe saving ratio has fallen again this quarter to a new record low, partly as a result of higher tax payments reducing disposable income. Some of the fall could be as a result of the timing of those payments, but the underlying trend is for a continued fall in the saving ratio.\u201d The balance of payments \u2013 which measures trade flows, income from investment, and payments to international bodies such as the EU \u2013 was in deficit by \u00a316.9bn in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from \u00a312.1bn in the previous three months. The ONS said the UK\u2019s poor trade performance wiped 0.8 percentage points from growth in the first quarter. Some deterioration had been expected in the City after the sharp narrowing of the deficit in late 2016, and analysts said the fall in the value of sterling \u2013 which makes exports cheaper and imports dearer \u2013 should help the balance of payments.",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, let\u2019s take a look at the markets. Wall Street is up, after tech stocks recovered from a sharp sell off and there were no nasty surprises in consumer spending data: Dow Jones: +0.4% at 21,370 S&amp;P 500: +0.4% at 2,428 Nasdaq: +0.3% at 5,668 The picture in Europe is mixed, with the FTSE 100 slipping back into the red: FTSE 100: -0.03% at 7,348 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 12,400 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 5,164 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 20,666 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,541 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 381 The pound has not been able to push back above $1.30, and is currently at $1.2982. Thank you for all your comments, and please join us again next week. Have a great weekend. AM The Bank of Greece has today raised the alarm over the country\u2019s debt pile. Issuing a clarion call to the country\u2019s creditors to deal with a debt mountain approaching 180% of GDP, the central bank warned that failure to address the problem could risk Greece ultimately needing a fourth bailout package when its current rescue programme ends in 2018. Lenders, it said, needed to spell out their commitment to medium-term debt relief imminently. \u201cLetting this pending matter drag on poses potentially serious risks,\u201d the Bank said in its annual monetary policy report. \u201c[It] might even foreshadow the need for a new financial assistance agreement post- 2018, something that neither Greece not its partners would want.\u201d Germany, the biggest contributor to the three bailouts the country has received since 2010, is opposed to even discussing the issue of some form of debt relief before federal elections in September. Greece\u2019s debt pile, by far the highest in the EU, is currently in excess of \u20ac300bn. The traditional relationship between the level of unemployment and inflation rate appears to have vanished: US consumer spending rose by just 0.1% last month, a slowdown compared with growth of 0.2% in April and 0.6% in March. Meanwhile consumer prices excluding food and energy were up 1.4% from a year earlier, compared with 1.5% in April according to the Commerce Department figures. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said that despite weaker spending and inflation, the US Federal Reserve was likely to press ahead with plans to raise interest rates. Despite the modest 0.1% increase in real spending in May, real consumption growth is still on track to record a solid 3% annualised gain over the second quarter as a whole. The fundamentals suggest that consumption growth should continue at a solid pace in the third quarter too. Real personal disposable income increased by a very strong 0.6% in May and, as a result, the saving rate rebounded to 5.5%, from 5.1%. Although the real economy is doing well, Fed officials are concerned that isn\u2019t translating into stronger inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, with the unemployment rate plummeting even further below its long-run sustainable level, we expect the Fed to push ahead with additional interest rate hikes. Over in Greece, public sector workers are cleaning mountains of rubbish off the streets after a 12-day walk-out prompted health concerns. Helena Smith reports: Authorities say it will take at least four days to remove the mounds of rotting rubbish that have accumulated during the strike. With the country in the grip of its first summer heat wave, and worries of a public health crisis, sanitation employees are expected to work around-the-clock. Giorgos Broulias, an Athens vice mayor, told the Greek daily Kathimerini it would take even longer to disinfect urban centres where streets are now dotted with decomposing waste. The 12-day walk-out had enraged citizens and the tourism sector \u2013 the engine of the Greek economy \u2013 with many denouncing the workers for holding the country hostage to their demands. But the strike has also been successful for the municipal workers with the government eventually caving in to demands for short term contracts to be renewed. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who stepped in personally to break the deadlock, had argued that it was impossible to challenge the hiring freeze imposed on Greece by international creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. The workers had demanded that thousands of jobs be turned into permanent posts. The stand-off was the first major run-in between the leftist-led government and labour unions and while halted for now, it may well re-erupt if disgruntlement mounts among unionists over this week\u2019s compromise. Analysts at Oxford Economics believe markets have overreacted to comments made by Mark Carney on Wednesday, when he said \u201csome removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary\u201d if certain conditions prevail. Andrew Goodwin, lead economist, does not think the Bank\u2019s MPC will be rushing to raise rates this year. Markets have been very sensitive to commentary from MPC members, particularly Governor Mark Carney. But in our view, the sudden move to price a rate hike in late-2017 is a major overreaction which was not in keeping with the substance of the comments. A reminder of those Carney comments: The FSTE 100 has clawed back its earlier losses and is now rising, after UK GDP data prompted a dip in the pound. Here are the latest scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,374 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 12,448 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 5,188 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 20,786 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,575 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 383 Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, gives his take: The pound trickled back below $1.30 after that weak GDP was revealed, while against the euro, sterling saw its 0.3% rise shrink to 0.2%. This, combined with the halving of BP and Shell\u2019s morning losses \u2013 the oil giants are now down 0.7% apiece after Brent Crude clawed its way back above $48 per barrel \u2013 allowed the FTSE to climb out of the red. There was a similar situation in the eurozone as the DAX and CAC jumped 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. That\u2019s because the euro has lost some of its lustre, slipping 0.2% against both the dollar and the pound. Despite the region-wide inflation figure arriving at a [higher] than expected 1.3% (the more important core reading also beat estimates at 1.1%), that is still a decline month-on-month, damaging the currency\u2019s recently renewed hopes of an ECB rate hike. Here is the full story on the UK growth figures from Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor: Eurozone inflation eased to 1.3% June from 1.4% in May because of weaker energy price rises according to a flash estimate from the Eurostat statistics office. Economists had been expecting a bigger fall in the headline rate to 1.2%. Meanwhile core inflation - which strips out volatile items such as energy and food - actually rose to 1.1% in June from 0.9% in May. Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economists, said that despite the June rise in core inflation, the European Central Bank was unlikely to cut interest rates any time soon. The data will add to the ECB\u2019s sense that reflationary pressures are appearing. But core inflation is still well below the Bank\u2019s near-2% medium-term target for the headline rate, and its rise has been concentrated in Germany. The Bank has repeatedly stressed that it will wait for core inflation to be on a clear upward path throughout the euro-zone before raising interest rates and we suspect that this is still some way off. The health of the consumer sector combined with the slight rise in core inflation reinforces our view that the ECB will announce at its September meeting that it plans to taper its asset purchases from January 2018. But we doubt that it will act before then and expect it to keep stressing that interest rate hikes are a distant prospect. Scotiabank\u2019s Alan Clarke says the chance of an August rate hike is still on a knife-edge, after the ONS said services output grew by 0.2% in April (in line with expectations). The services sector is crucial to the growth outlook, accounting for more than three quarters of the UK economy according to the ONS. Clarke says growth in April puts the services sector on track to grow 0.4% in the second quarter overall, as predicted by the Bank of England. Unfortunately, that is going to leave us in agony for another month leading up to August\u2019s Super Thursday [when the Bank will announce its next rates decision and update forecasts]. Growth will probably be in line with where the Bank expected, but their inflation forecast will be shunted up. We are probably right on the borderline for a hike. The squeeze on UK household incomes is a concern for the wider growth outlook, according to Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item forecasting group. Consumer spending growth in the first quarter was supported by the household savings ratio falling to a record low of 1.7% from the previous low of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is not sustainable and fuels the belief that weakened consumer spending is likely to hold back the economy over the coming months. Archer believes that while there might be a bounce in GDP growth in the second quarter - from 0.2% in the first - the second half of the year will be more challenging for the UK economy. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, says the drop in the saving ratio to a record low is a big concern. These figures make for grim reading. People raiding their piggy banks is bad news for working people and the economy. But with wages falling as living costs rise, many families are having to run down their savings or rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month. With household debt now at crisis levels, we urgently need to create better paid jobs. And the government must do its part by lifting the unfair pay restrictions on public sector workers. Ministers need to get their act together quickly. It looks like we are at the start of another living standards crisis. The ONS data has provided fresh evidence that UK consumers are suffering from an income squeeze and declining living standards. Household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, fell for the third quarter in a row between January and March, which was the worst run since the 1970s. It dragged the household saving ratio to new record low of 1.7%, as consumers grappling with rising prices and weak pay growth run down their savings. The ONS said the drop in the savings ratio was partly down to tax payments, but added \u201cthe underlying trend is downwards, reflecting relatively strong consumption volumes, increasing consumer prices and subdued wage growth.\u201d The dark blue line below tells the story of what is happening to the saving ratio: The pound has dipped below $1.30 following the GDP data. It is currently down 0.1% at $1.2984. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the Office for National Statistics has commented on the Q1 growth update: GDP growth for the first three months of 2017 remained unrevised at 0.2%. Growth was driven by business services and construction, partially offset by declines in some consumer-focused industries, such as retail sales and accommodation. The saving ratio has fallen again this quarter to a new record low, partly as a result of higher tax payments reducing disposable income. Some of the fall could be as a result of the timing of those payments, but the underlying trend is for a continued fall in the saving ratio. Services output in April was up slightly on the month, with the largest contribution to the month-on-month growth coming from the retail trade. The Office for National Statistics has confirmed the UK economy grew by just 0.2% in the first quarter of 2017, following 0.7% growth in the previous quarter. More soon... The Bank of England\u2019s August decision on interest rates is on a knife edge according to Scotiabank economist, Alan Clarke. He says much will be dependent on how the crucial services sector performed in April. He calculates that a 0.2% increase in services output would put in on track for a 0.4% increase over the second quarter as a whole... That would meet the Bank of England\u2019s own expectation and make an August rate hike a 50-50 bet. Any reading above 0.2% in services output in April would make a rate hike in August more likely than not,while a reading below 0.2% would probably rule out a rate hike. The services data is due at 9.30 so let\u2019s see what it brings. George Osborne came within weeks of scrapping the 1p and 2p pieces, the Guardian has been told. The former chancellor of the exchequer apparently wanted to make the change in late 2015, after winning the general election, but was stopped by David Cameron who feared it would reflect badly the Tories. Read our full story here: Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS, is taking a relaxed approach to the recent hints from central bankers that ultra loose monetary policy might be coming to an end sooner rather than later. Relaxed in a cosy Sunday evening kind of way. Think feet up, Downtown Abbey on the box. Donovan says: Central bank comments have been correlated (but almost certainly not coordinated) \u2013 as economist-policymakers all react logically to similar economic circumstances. Policy tightening is to be expected \u2013 but it will be genteel, tasteful tightening (the economic equivalent of an episode of Downton Abbey). The FTSE 100 is taking the hit from the (relative) strength of the pound this morning, down 26 points or 0.4% at 7,324. It is being dragged lower by commodity-based stocks, despite a rise in Brent crude oil prices this morning (up 0.6% at $47.70 a barrel). Elsewhere in Europe: Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 12,395 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 5,160 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 20,746 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,544 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.02% at 381 UK consumer confidence dropped to the lowest level since the Brexit vote in June as people become increasingly concerned about what the year ahead will bring. The monthly snapshot of consumer sentiment from GfK dropped five points to -10, which was the lowest since July last year, a month after the EU referendum. The survey covered the period before and after the general election, and signalled growing unease among consumers about their personal financial situation and the outlook for the wider economy. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said people were more reluctant to spend money on non essential items. All this concern will worry the UK\u2019s retailers, with this month\u2019s plunge in the major purchase index (down eight points) reflecting our increased caution over non-food spending and our softening appetite for debt. Strong consumer spending has propped up the economy since last June but now the twin pressures of higher prices and sluggish wage growth are squeezing household finances and adding to widespread fears of a Brexit- induced economic slowdown. Read our full story on the survey: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is trading at $1.3017 this morning, its highest level in six weeks, as investors bring forward their expectations of a rise in interest rates. There has been a shift in thinking in recent days after both Mark Carney and Mario Draghi appeared to tweak their language to suggest that policy tightening might not be as far off as markets previously anticipated. Their comments have boosted both the pound and the euro, to the detriment of equities, which suffered fairly hefty losses on both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday. At 9.30 the ONS will publish its third and final estimate of growth in the first quarter of 2017. It is expected to confirm the economy grew by 0.2% in the first three months of the year, after a surprise downgrade from 0.3% at the time of the second estimate. Growth slowed in the first quarter as rising inflation in the wake of the Brexit vote took its toll on consumer spending. Other key data today includes a flash estimate of eurozone inflation in June at 10am, which could provide clues about the ECB\u2019s next move. Economists are predicting a fall in the headline rate to 1.2% from 1.4% in May.",

Issuing a clarion call to the country\u2019s creditors to deal with a debt mountain approaching 180% of GDP, the central bank warned that failure to address the problem could risk Greece ultimately needing a fourth bailout package when its current rescue programme ends in 2018. Lenders, it said, needed to spell out their commitment to medium-term debt relief imminently. </p> <p>\u201cLetting this pending matter drag on poses potentially serious risks,\u201d the Bank said in its annual monetary policy report. \u201c[It] might even foreshadow the need for a new financial assistance agreement post- 2018, something that neither Greece not its partners would want.\u201d </p> <p>Germany, the biggest contributor to the three bailouts the country has received since 2010, is opposed to even discussing the issue of some form of debt relief before federal elections in September.

Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who stepped in personally to break the deadlock, had argued that it was impossible to challenge the hiring freeze imposed on Greece by international creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. The workers had demanded that thousands of jobs be turned into permanent posts. </p> <p>The stand-off was the first major run-in between the leftist-led government and labour unions and while halted for now, it may well re-erupt if disgruntlement mounts among unionists over this week\u2019s compromise. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"363b9702b60570b05726b685d4762abf6ff24bae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/363b9702b60570b05726b685d4762abf6ff24bae/0_123_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rubbish piles grew as the strike progressed.

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has issued one-off payments of \u00a335,000 each to victims of the fraud in its HBOS Reading branch after missing Friday\u2019s deadline to make formal compensation offers. The number of victims has risen to 67 small business customers from 64 as more have stepped forward since January when six financiers were jailed for their roles in the fraud, which took place before Lloyds rescued HBOS in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. The bank had aimed to make compensation offers from a \u00a3100m pot by the end of June but has only made formal offers to seven so far, with only one having accepted and received their payout. As the timetable slipped on Friday, affected customers were offered the \u00a335,000 payments as a goodwill gesture while the formal compensation process continues. Lloyds has been criticised by some of the victims, most notably the TV celebrity Noel Edmonds who accuses the bank of creating a \u201csham\u201d compensation process lacking in transparency. Adrian White, chief operating officer of Lloyds\u2019 commercial banking arm, said he was disappointed it was taking longer than expected to make offers as victims were asking for more time to provide information. In an update, Lloyds said it had paid \u00a3485,000 to 13 customers to cover day-to-day living expenses while the review continues. It is now offering all the 67 victims the \u00a335,000 payment in order to cover their bills and expenses. \u201cSince the end of the HBOS Reading fraud trial, we have been working hard to provide fair, swift and appropriate compensation,\u201d said White. \u201cBut as we have met and spoken with victims, many have asked us for more time. We are disappointed that getting to offers is taking longer than we had hoped, but we are committed to doing everything we can to support those affected as we continue with the review.\u201d The bank is waiting to find out if the other seven offers made will be accepted and is in the final stages of making a further eight offers. It is also searching for some of the victims \u2013 at one point the location of around 30 was unclear, although this has now been reduced to six. The bank has appointed Professor Russel Griggs to review its compensation offers but has faced criticism that he is not independent. The bank denies Edmonds\u2019 claim that its review is a sham and insists that Griggs makes his decisions independently. Griggs said: \u201cProgress has been made with the review. We have had productive discussions with a number of customers and a number of offers have been made, and accepted. Clearly, some customers may need longer to provide their input, and we will give them whatever time is necessary.\u201d The fraud took place between 2003 and 2007 when HBOS employee Lynden Scourfield, who was in charge of looking after troubled businesses, referred struggling firms to David Mills and his consultancy QCS in return for luxury cruises and lavish gifts. Mills and his associates, meanwhile, loaded big fees onto the businesses and sometimes took control of them. Scourfield pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court and the jury convicted Mills and his wife, Alison, their associates Michael Bancroft and Tony Cartwright as well as Mark Dobson, a former HBOS banker. Lloyds said it takes around four weeks to make an offer to victims once it has information about their claim. The bank is intending to set compensation payouts on the basis of financial losses incurred by the claimants and also for the \u201cimpact on their lives and lives of their families\u201d. Some of the businesses collapsed; in such instances part of the payments may not go the individuals. Two victims of the fraud are not taking part in the review and are dealing with the bank in other ways, including Paul and Nikki Turner who spent 10 years investigating how their business was treated by Scourfield. Nikki Turner said there are many more victims than those identified by Lloyds. \u201cWe knew this process was biased and flawed, but now we learn it is also painfully slow ... If all are processed in this way, it will take Russel Griggs around four and a half years to finish the review,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Twain, so the story goes, used to joke that giving up smoking was the easiest thing in the world \u2013 after all, he had done it \u201cthousands of times\u201d. The US novelist, though, did not have the option of e-cigarettes \u2013 the quitting phenomenon that started in the US and is now a rapidly growing business here with its own \u201ccloud-chasing\u201d subculture . UK sales of vaping products surged 50% last year to reach \u00a31bn, and are on course to exceed \u00a32bn by 2020. It is 10 years ago this weekend that laws came into effect banning smoking in virtually all enclosed public places in England. According to Cancer Research UK there are now 1.9 million fewer smokers in Britain compared with when the smoking ban was introduced \u2013 the lowest smoking rates ever recorded in Britain. But nearly 3 million Britons are now vaping. \u201cMore and more smokers realise that e-cigarettes are so close to the experience they\u2019re used to that they can almost effortlessly shift across\u201d said Shane MacGuill, tobacco analyst at Euromonitor, the research firm that compiled the sales data. \u201cThey often see it less as a substitution and more as a guilt-free way to carry on consuming nicotine,\u201d he said. Software sales director Gary Stevenson, 44, is a prime example. He has been vaping for two years and admits he is probably taking in more nicotine now than when he smoked. \u201cI\u2019ll be at work \u2013 reading my emails or on the phone \u2013 and I instinctively grab for my vape, have a chonk on it \u2013 then put it down,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s an addiction or a reaction, but I graze on it all the time.\u201d Stevenson used to smoke about 10 cigarettes a day and saw himself primarily as a \u201csocial smoker\u201d. But the perceived harmlessness of vaping has turned a habit he used to fear (\u201cevery time I put a cigarette in my mouth I imagined I was going to die of cancer the next day\u201d) into a habit he is happy to indulge. \u201cIf I go out for a drink, I might get a hangover the next day but I don\u2019t get a \u2018cigarette hangover\u2019. There\u2019s none of the physical downside you get from smoking, so there\u2019s no \u2018oh God, I\u2019ve got to stop smoking\u2019 moment.\u201d Stevenson opts for a nicotine strength of 3 milligrams (per ml) but has no intention of lowering it to zero, much less of giving up. And he is not alone. Across the country, trendy shops and cafes are opening where \u201ccloud chasers\u201d \u2013 a new tribe of unashamed vape addicts \u2013 are encouraged to hang out, drink coffee and listen to music. \u201cIt\u2019s a subculture coming out of America \u2013 with particular types of music and clothes \u2013 and that\u2019s now part of the incentive to stop smoking cigarettes,\u201d said MacGuill. At Vapour Evolution in Brighton, for example, on upmarket Duke Street, there is a tasting bar where punters try out new flavours and e-liquids. Vapers can buy trendy items of clothing like baseball caps and T-shirts, and upstairs theres a Cloud cafe. \u201cWe do coffees, juices, smoothies \u2013 we try to offer a bit more of a sit-down experience,\u201d said its manager, Andrew Kinghorn. \u201cThere\u2019s music, coil building sessions (making your own heating elements) and competitions to see who can blow the biggest cloud.\u201d Kinghorn says one of the newest trends is for a more bespoke vaping experience, where you drip the e-liquid yourself and tailor the flavour and vapour to exactly how you want it. \u201cThere\u2019s a skill to it, and it\u2019s not for everyone, but the flavour is really incredible,\u201d he said. Surprisingly, and with an endless stream of novelty flavours \u2013 from strawberry milkshake to sugar-cured bacon \u2013 it seems non-smokers are getting tempted, too. \u201cIf non-smokers come into our shop, I\u2019ll ask them, why would you want to start using a device that\u2019s going to give you a nicotine addition? But I can\u2019t make someone\u2019s decision for them \u2013 if they want to buy something, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d said Kinghorn. The public health charity Ash claims only a tiny proportion of British vapers are non-smokers \u2013 about 0.2%. But MacGuill says that percentage could rise significantly over the longer term. \u201cThink about it logically. If you have people who\u2019ve been interested in smoking but have chosen not to do it for health reasons, if they\u2019re then presented with a means of doing it in a way that\u2019s not harmful, it stands to reason more will want to try it,\u201d he said. MacGuill adds that the value of the market is likely to increase over the next five years, especially with big tobacco companies investing heavily behind the scenes. \u201cThere\u2019s a basic understanding inside the industry that it\u2019s a better business model to sell a product that doesn\u2019t kill 50% of your consumers\u201d, he said. \u201cThey [the tobacco companies] recognise the tide is going out on combustible cigarettes, so different delivery systems for nicotine are a huge opportunity.\u201d Is vaping safe? Last year about 2.9 million people in the UK were thought to use electronic cigarettes \u2013 but their impact on health has been the topic of controversy, with concerns ranging from the health impact of the technology to whether it can help smokers quit conventional cigarettes and if it encourages others to take up conventional smoking. The latest Cochrane review of the best available evidence, published last September, found there was no evidence of serious side-effects from using e-cigarettes over a two-year period. A paper published the same month in the British Medical Journal estimated that in 2015 alone, the devices helped 18,000 smokers to kick the habit who would otherwise not have done so. However, the authors pointed out that the devices are not linked to a greater rate of attempts to quit, just more success among those that try. The latest figures from the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics reveal that about a million e-cigarette users in the UK say they are using the devices to help them give up cigarettes. A 2016 report from the Royal College of Physicians has also acknowledged the growing role of e-cigarettes in helping smokers quit. The report noted that \u201ce-cigarettes are not currently made to medicines standards and are probably more hazardous than NRT [nicotine replacement therapy such as gum, patches or inhalators]\u201d. But it also pointed out that \u201cthe hazard to health arising from long-term vapour inhalation from the e-cigarettes available today is unlikely to exceed 5% of the harm from smoking tobacco\u201d. The report added that while regulation of e-cigarettes was needed, the devices should be considered a valuable tool in helping smokers to quit, advising: \u201cIn the interests of public health it is important to promote the use of e-cigarettes, NRT and other non-tobacco nicotine products as widely as possible as a substitute for smoking in the UK.\u201d But not every health body believes e-cigarettes are a boon. A report from the World Health Organisation, published last year, raised a number of concerns, including that both users and those passively breathing in e-cigarette vapour could be at risk of adverse health effects. The UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, however, criticised the WHO report, saying it had failed to quantify risk and concluded: \u201cIn terms of toxicology, the discussion is naive and places excessive emphasis on negligible risks arising from very low exposures.\u201d The centre also stressed that it was important to compare the safety of e-cigarettes with the health effects of traditional smoking, rather than to not smoking in any way at all. As the NHS website pointed out after news that mice exposed to e-cigarette vapour were found to have mild lung damage and other problems, \u201cAre e-cigarettes safer than normal cigarettes? Almost certainly. Are they 100% safe? Probably not.\u201d By Nicola Davis",

      "bodyText": "Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist is in Wales, on tour. But this is not the usual speechifying trip, addressing business audiences on the dry details of monetary policy. Instead Haldane \u2013 who some regard as a potential successor to the governor of the Bank, Mark Carney \u2013 is in listening mode, on the first leg of a nationwide tour that is aiming to feed the everyday experiences of ordinary households into monetary policymaking. Britain\u2019s poorest families, he says, are being hardest hit by the rising prices of essentials like food and fuel, and action to prevent higher inflation becoming entrenched must therefore be a priority. Haldane has met dozens of people this week who said they were struggling to cope with the rising cost of living. He heard of parents stopping their children from going on school trips in order to divert the money towards increasingly expensive basic supplies. He heard about increasing numbers of loan sharks setting up shop and about people who scour supermarkets to save a few pennies on a loaf of bread. In fact, he heard dozens of similar stories during roundtable events in Cardiff, Barry and Porth, in the Welsh valleys. \u201cPrices in the shops have gone up pretty rapidly, particularly for some essentials like food and fuel,\u201d said Haldane. \u201cAdjusting for inflation, most people\u2019s pay is probably falling rather than going up and that is causing a particular pinch for people further down the income spectrum.\u201d The economist, who sits on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee that decides when interest rates will have to be raised to put a lid on inflation, said it is important to remember that rising prices have the biggest impact on the poorest. \u201cIt hits hardest those on the lowest incomes and those whose incomes are fixed in money terms, for example those on benefits or on amounts close to the minimum wage.\u201d In a clear hint that a rise in interest rates could be looming, he added: \u201cThe reason we absolutely are sitting up and paying attention now to rises in the cost of living \u2013 inflation is up to almost 3% \u2013 is not just because that is in breach of our target but because that is having big and serious consequences for those on the lowest incomes in society and that came across loud and clear today.\u201d The Bank of England economist\u2019s day trip to Wales marked the start of a series of visits, in collaboration with Citizens UK, that aims to expand the Bank\u2019s previous outreach programme with business figures to ordinary people, including those on low incomes or benefits and the self-employed. The eventual aim is for Haldane and other senior colleagues from Threadneedle Street to visit every county in the country \u2013 and to feed back what they are told into \u201cdeliberations on monetary policy and interest rates\u201d. Haldane is clear about what he is hearing: \u201cFirst and foremost we need to set our interest rate policy to prevent those higher inflation rates becoming entrenched.\u201d His comments came after Haldane hinted that he considered opposingCarney at this month\u2019s meeting of the MPC. The eventual vote was 5-3 in favour of leaving rates at their record low of 0.25% \u2013 the stance that Carney backed \u2013 but the result was closer than had been expected and Haldane has now made it clear he could soon change sides. . Just 24 hours after Carney said the state of the economy and the uncertainty caused by Brexit meant borrowing costs should not change, the chief economist said they should go up before the end of the year. He used a speech to say the balance of risks had shifted so that the dangers of moving too late on interest rates outweighed those of raising them too soon. On Wednesday, when Haldane was in Wales, Carney also acknowledged that continued growth would eventually lead to higher rates. Back in Wales, some of those who turned out to speak to the Bank\u2019s top economist expressed their worries about rising mortgage rates. But a larger number of people, many of whom were not homeowners, stressed the problems caused by spiralling prices. At a community centre in Ely in western Cardiff \u2013 on the edge of Wales\u2019s largest housing estate \u2013 53-year-old Tracy described shopping around in order to try to save 10 pence on a loaf of bread. \u201cPeople are going without fuel, gas and electric, food,\u201d she said. When Haldane asked her whether people were \u201cscrimping or saving or trying to borrow\u201d to deal with their situations, she claimed that loan sharks were on the rise. Gloria, 82, said she was worried about energy bills hitting older people who struggled to switch to cheaper providers. She had brought with her a letter from an energy supplier outlining a 6% increase in gas prices, 11.1% for electricity, and 8.5% for those on a dual fuel deal. Three sixth-formers said they feared university loans, and two 25-year-old graduates said friends had left the area because of falling real wages. Alan, who was approaching retirement, said that he had been involved with research that had revealed people\u2019s \u201ccoping strategies\u201d. \u201cFirst there is multiple debt, with people who have exhausted all avenues turning to illegal sources. Then there is \u2018self-imposed austerity\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example not sending children on school trips.\u201d The same concerns were raised in Porth and at another event in Barry, where a number of entrepreneurs said they were also struggling. Shop owner Fay, said she was self-employed but needed multiple jobs to cope with the financial demands of her family life. \u201cOur incomes haven\u2019t increased but our costs have gone up. I never thought I\u2019d be a government statistic but I am now a \u2018jam\u2019,\u201d she said \u2013 referring to Theresa May\u2019s \u201cjust about managing\u201d group. \u201cWe have nothing left. People are not spending in shops. The self-employed can\u2019t pay themselves the living wage.\u201d Susan, who runs the local food bank, said the number of people \u201cin crisis\u201d turning to her group for help had been on the rise again over the past year after falling back in 2015-16. She blamed \u201cstagnating wages\u201d, saying people were talking about having to choose between heating or eating. Speaking afterwards, Haldane said the phrase of \u201cself-imposed austerity\u201d had stuck with him. It was, he said \u201cpeople cutting back on investing in themselves or in their family. That was a worrying thing to hear. How generalised that is it is tough to know but ... that will be a big point for me to take away and reflect on.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><span tabindex=\"-1\">Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist is in Wales, on tour. But this is not the usual speechifying trip, addressing business audiences on the dry details of monetary policy. Instead Haldane \u2013 who some regard as a potential successor to the governor of the Bank, Mark Carney \u2013 is in listening mode, on the first leg of a nationwide tour that is aiming to feed the everyday experiences of ordinary households into monetary policymaking.</span></p> <p>Britain\u2019s poorest families, he says, are being hardest hit by the rising prices of essentials like food and fuel, and action to prevent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">higher inflation</a> becoming entrenched must therefore be a priority.</p> <p>Haldane has met dozens of people this week who said they were struggling to cope with the rising cost of living. He heard of parents stopping their children from going on school trips in order to divert the money towards increasingly expensive basic supplies. He heard about increasing numbers of loan sharks setting up shop and about people who scour supermarkets to save a few pennies on a loaf of bread. In fact, he heard dozens of similar stories during roundtable events in Cardiff, Barry and Porth, in the Welsh valleys.</p> <p>\u201cPrices in the shops have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/petrol-food-prices-uk-rising-2017\">gone up pretty rapidly</a>, particularly for some essentials like food and fuel,\u201d said Haldane. \u201cAdjusting for inflation, most people\u2019s pay is probably falling rather than going up and that is causing a particular pinch for people further down the income spectrum.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/04/sharp-rise-in-uk-food-prices-inflates-household-shopping-bill\">Sharp rise in UK food prices inflates household shopping bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The economist, who sits on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee that decides when interest rates will have to be raised to put a lid on inflation, said it is important to remember that rising prices have the biggest impact on the poorest.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt hits hardest those on the lowest incomes and those whose incomes are fixed in money terms, for example those on benefits or on amounts close to the minimum wage.\u201d</p> <p>In a clear hint that a rise in interest rates could be looming, he added: \u201cThe reason we absolutely are sitting up and paying attention now to rises in the cost of living \u2013 inflation is up to almost 3% \u2013 is not just because that is in breach of our target but because that is having big and serious consequences for those on the lowest incomes in society and that came across loud and clear today.\u201d</p> <p>The Bank of England economist\u2019s day trip to Wales marked the start of a series of visits, in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/\">Citizens UK</a>, that aims to expand the Bank\u2019s previous outreach programme with business figures to ordinary people, including those on low incomes or benefits and the self-employed.</p> <p>The eventual aim is for Haldane and other senior colleagues from Threadneedle Street to visit every county in the country \u2013 and to feed back what they are told into \u201cdeliberations on monetary policy and interest rates\u201d. </p> <p>Haldane is clear about what he is hearing: \u201cFirst and foremost we need to set our interest rate policy to prevent those higher inflation rates becoming entrenched.\u201d</p> <p>His comments came after Haldane hinted that he considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/21/bank-of-england-interest-rate-rise-andy-haldane-mark-carney-mpc\">opposingCarney</a> at this month\u2019s meeting of the MPC. The eventual vote was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/15/bank-of-england-uk-interest-rates-inflation\">5-3 in favour of leaving rates </a>at their record low of 0.25% \u2013 the stance that Carney backed \u2013 but the result was closer than had been expected and Haldane has now made it clear he could soon change sides. .</p> <p>Just 24 hours after Carney said the state of the economy and the uncertainty caused by Brexit meant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/bank-of-england-mark-carney-interest-rates-hold-brexit-eu\">borrowing costs</a> should not change, the chief economist said they should go up before the end of the year.</p> <p>He used a speech to say the balance of risks had shifted so that the dangers of moving too late on interest rates outweighed those of raising them too soon. On Wednesday, when Haldane was in Wales, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/28/bank-of-england-deputy-interest-rate-mpc-cunliffe-mark-carney\">Carney also acknowledged</a> that continued growth would eventually lead to higher rates.</p> <p>Back in Wales, some of those who turned out to speak to the Bank\u2019s top economist expressed their worries about rising mortgage rates.

      "bodyText": "Couriers carrying emergency blood supplies and delivering passports have won improved employment rights in an important concession for workers in the gig economy. The Doctors Laboratory, a company which provides pathology services to the NHS, has admitted that five cyclists, motorcyclists and van drivers carrying emergency blood supplies to hospitals and samples to laboratories, are not self-employed. The company now concedes that the couriers, who are on a variety of different contracts, are workers, an official employment classification which entitles them to rights including holiday pay and a minimum wage. Self-employed contractors, who make the vast majority of drivers and riders in the courier and delivery industry, have no employment rights, beyond basic health and safety and anti-discrimination rules. The firm, which is understand to employ more than 70 couriers, who are a mix of car drivers, motorcyclists and cyclists, would not confirm when or if it would be repaying holiday pay owed to the five workers. \u201cTDL is mindful of doing the right thing but as the case is ongoing we are unable to provide further comment at this time,\u201d the company said. TDL\u2019s admission comes after a similar move by eCourier, a subsidiary of Royal Mail, which last month admitted it had wrongly classified one of its couriers as a self-employed contractor. It is now carrying out a review to work out how best to switch staff to worker status where it reflects their working arrangements. Both admissions came after legal action backed by the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain. Other tribunals against taxi-hailing app Uber and courier firm CitySprint also both successfully argued drivers were officially \u201cworkers\u201d. Uber, which has 40,000 drivers in the UK, will appeal against the employment tribunal verdict in September. CitySprint has also launched an appeal after losing a similar case. Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of IWGB, said: \u201cLooking at how these cases have progressed in the past year and a half, there\u2019s momentum for real change happening. Worker status in an inevitability in the gig economy. It is like dominoes falling.\u201d He said the IWGB would continue to pursue its case against TDL because the couriers argue they are employees \u2013 an even more secure classification than worker. Employees have guaranteed additional benefits including sick pay and maternity leave as well as protection against unfair dismissal, statutory redundancy pay and the right to request flexible working. Moyer-Lee said: \u201cTDL\u2019s recent admission of unlawful behaviour is further evidence that there has been widespread and rampant denial of employment rights with no consequence. But also that worker status is inevitable once these companies are challenged. \u201cIn TDL\u2019s case however worker status is not good enough, these couriers are employees. TDL would be wise to admit to the full extent of its behaviour and not try to weasel out of the situation on the cheap.\u201d The case will be heard between 13 and 16 November 2017. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 July 2017. An earlier version said eCourier admitted to wrongly classifying hundreds of couriers as self-employed contractors. eCourier has admitted to wrongly classifying only one courier as a self-employed contractor. eCourier has said it\u2019s carrying out a review into whether other couriers on similar contracts have been classified in the same way.",
