A representative for Investec declined to comment, noting that the report had cleared the bank\u2019s regulatory compliance review. <br></p> <p>Gordon\u2019s note came after US regulators <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/10/standard-chartered-management-us-regulators-investigation-sanctions\">relaunched investigations</a> into Standard Chartered\u2019s breach of US sanctions rules.

      "bodyText": "An analyst with the British South African bank Investec has described the regulatory strictures on Standard Chartered with the last words of Eric Garner, who choked to death during an attempted arrest by the New York City police. Ian Gordon, who was recommending that investors buy shares of Standard Chartered, titled his research note \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and later directly compared the struggles of both Garner and Standard Chartered against \u201cauthoritarian control\u201d. Gordon, head of banks research for Investec, also told the FT that US regulatory activity had parallels with the policing that led to Eric Garner\u2019s death. \u201cThey are both examples of abuse of power or authoritarian control gone wrong,\u201d Gordon is quoted as saying. \u201cStandard Chartered \u2013 a legitimate business \u2013 is being prevented from breathing or operating by US regulatory discriminatory behaviour. The parallel I see is unfettered power by a US agency,\u201d Gordon told the FT\u2019s Arnold. The note drew widespread criticism for being in poor taste. A representative for Investec declined to comment, noting that the report had cleared the bank\u2019s regulatory compliance review. Gordon\u2019s note came after US regulators relaunched investigations into Standard Chartered\u2019s breach of US sanctions rules. American regulators had previously fined Standard Chartered $667m for doing business with Iran in defiance of sanctions already in place. The note\u2019s title repeats the last words of Garner, the Staten Island resident who died after a policeman placed him in a chokehold.

The outsourcing company \u2013 which has been dogged by a series of scandals and four profit warnings this year \u2013 estimates the contract to be worth \u00a3500m-\u00a3750m (AUD$950m-$1.4bn) , less than the potential \u00a31bn (AUD$1.9bn) the Australian government had put on it. This reflects a sharp drop in the number of people in detention, which reached 10,000 in mid-2013 but has fallen back to 3,000. The government has clamped down on people without a valid visa entering the country by boat. Serco, which has been running 12 migrant detention facilities across Australia since 2009 and employs 2,000 people to deliver the contract, has come under fire over the Christmas Island centre, which was condemned by the Canberra\u2019s top human rights official for its filthy conditions and for the high levels of self-harm among detainees. Levels of self-harm at the Serco-run centres rose six-fold in six months, after the government made it mandatory to process all asylum claims offshore. Gillian Triggs, president of the Australian Human Rights Commission, voiced \u201cgrave concerns\u201d for the welfare of asylum seekers at Christmas Island centre when she visited in July. She found a sharp escalation in the number of mothers on suicide watch and babies confined to small metal containers, where they cannot learn to crawl or walk. Serco has been heavily reliant on profits from running Australia\u2019s immigration detention centres, as it faces increased losses from other contracts it holds. Excluding the immigration services contract, group profits were flat between 2009 and 2013, it revealed last month when it issued yet another profit warning. A strategic review started after Rupert Soames took over as chief executive in June uncovered a raft of loss-making contracts. Serco expects to make \u00a3100m-\u00a3150m of revenues a year from the latest contract, which can be extended twice for up to two years each time. It relates to seven Australian states and territories, and includes accommodation, transport and escort, catering and facilities management. The news comes as a UK committee of MPs warned that five government departments continued to award Serco and G4S work while they were under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office for overcharging tens of millions of pounds for electronic tagging contracts. The Commons public accounts committee said: \u201cIt was not acceptable for government to give the impression that all business with Serco and G4S was halted whilst investigations took place, when in fact contracts were extended, new contracts were awarded and negotiations for new business continued.\u201d Serco runs a huge range of government and other services around the world, from rail franchises including Merseyrail in Liverpool to parking-meter services in San Francisco and maintenance and repair services for CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, near Geneva.

    "webTitle": "Pay growth adds to case for interest rate rise, says Bank of England policymaker", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Bank of England policymaker has argued that pay growth may be at a \u201cturning point\u201d, strengthening the case for higher interest rates. The comments came as the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said inflation was expected to dip below 1% in coming months, which means he will have to write to the chancellor to explain why inflation is more than a percentage point below the 2% target. Carney signalled financial markets were right to rule out an interest rate rise any time soon. Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), set out his reasons for raising interest rates sooner. Speaking at a breakfast organised by the Institute of Directors in Liverpool, he talked of a \u201cremarkable\u201d recovery in the economy, and said raising rates now would ensure that increases will be \u201cgradual and limited\u201d. He is one of two MPC members who have voted for higher rates since August. Carney predicted a slow and steady rise in inflation towards 2%, in an interview with the Birmingham Post. He added: \u201cOur message is that interest rates are going to increase. We don\u2019t know the precise timing that will start, but what we are emphasising to businesses, to mortgage-holders, to homeowners and to individuals is that what\u2019s most important is the path of interest rate adjustments. That path is expected to be a gradual set of interest rate increases and to a more limited extent than the past.\u201d McCafferty noted that \u201cthe main puzzle has been the recent weakness of average weekly earnings which has been at odds with the strength of the survey indicators\u201d. But he added that the most recent private sector pay data suggested a pickup in wage growth. \u201cThe risks around our central estimate of slack in the November inflation report are probably skewed to the downside, and in practice there may not be that much spare capacity left in the labour market.\u201d McCafferty said policymakers need to look through the recent sharp fall in inflation, as this reflected falling food and energy prices as well as the 10% strengthening of the value of sterling. In the long run, he is worried that there is \u201ca risk that pay and unit cost growth will begin to rise faster than is consistent with our inflation target\u201d. The Bank slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.5% during the financial crisis and has kept them at that level for nearly six years. McCafferty and Martin Weale broke away from their seven colleagues on the MPC in August and began voting for a rate rise. In its latest set of projections in last month\u2019s inflation report, the Bank said it expected inflation, which dropped to a five-year low of 1.2% in September, would return to its 2% target in about three years\u2019 time.",

      "body": "<p>A Bank of England policymaker has argued that pay growth may be at a \u201cturning point\u201d, strengthening the case for higher interest rates.</p> <p>The comments came as the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said inflation was expected to dip below 1% in coming months, which means he will have to write to the chancellor to explain why inflation is more than a percentage point below the 2% target. Carney signalled financial markets were right to rule out an interest rate rise any time soon.</p> <p>Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), set out his reasons for raising interest rates sooner. Speaking at a breakfast organised by the Institute of Directors in Liverpool, he talked of a \u201cremarkable\u201d recovery in the economy, and said raising rates now would ensure that increases will be \u201cgradual and limited\u201d. He is one of two MPC members who have voted for higher rates since August.</p> <p>Carney predicted a slow and steady rise in inflation towards 2%, <a href=\"http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/finance/bank-england-governor-admits-inflation-8261758\" title=\"\">in an interview with the Birmingham Post</a>. He added: \u201cOur message is that interest rates are going to increase. We don\u2019t know the precise timing that will start, but what we are emphasising to businesses, to mortgage-holders, to homeowners and to individuals is that what\u2019s most important is the path of interest rate adjustments. That path is expected to be a gradual set of interest rate increases and to a more limited extent than the past.\u201d</p> <p>McCafferty noted that \u201cthe main puzzle has been the recent weakness of average weekly earnings which has been at odds with the strength of the survey indicators\u201d. But he added that the most recent private sector pay data suggested a pickup in wage growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe risks around our central estimate of slack in the November inflation report are probably skewed to the downside, and in practice there may not be that much spare capacity left in the labour market.\u201d</p> <p>McCafferty said policymakers need to look through the recent sharp fall in inflation, as this reflected falling food and energy prices as well as the 10% strengthening of the value of sterling. In the long run, he is worried that there is \u201ca risk that pay and unit cost growth will begin to rise faster than is consistent with our inflation target\u201d.</p> <p>The Bank slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.5% during the financial crisis and has kept them at that level for nearly six years. McCafferty and Martin Weale broke away from their seven colleagues on the MPC in August and began voting for a rate rise.</p> <p>In its latest set of projections in last month\u2019s inflation report, the Bank said it expected inflation, which dropped to a five-year low of 1.2% in September, would return to its 2% target in about three years\u2019 time.</p>",

Two years after being fined more than \u00a3400m for breaching US sanctions towards Iran, the bank revealed that a two-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that was imposed at the time was being extended for three years.
