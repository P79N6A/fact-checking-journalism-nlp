      "bodyText": "Never believe a big bank that boasts that its culture is so different: its lending principles conservative, its business immune to the traditional banking vices of over-confidence, over-expansion and bad behaviour. For a decade, Standard Chartered told us that its rising income and profits flowed from a unique winning formula. Here was chairman John Peace in the annual report a few years ago describing the supposed magic: \u201c2012 was another year of good performance for Standard Chartered, thanks to a consistent strategy, a stable management team, supportive clients, customers and shareholders, and, above all, our great people.\u201d The fact that Standard Chartered had just been whacked with heavy fines for busting US sanctions was a mere detail. The unabashed title of that annual report was Leading the Way. The word \u201cresilient\u201d was used 13 times to describe everything from the business model to the balance sheet. Since then, Standard Chartered\u2019s share price has been in full retreat. A bank valued at \u00a319-a-share during its supposed golden decade now finds itself going cap in hand to shareholders for \u00a33.3bn in a rights issue pitched at 465p a share. Humiliating stuff. A small shift in economic breezes in Standard Chartered\u2019s core Asian markets has blown the bank completely off course. Bill Winters, the new, straighter-talking, regulator-friendly chief executive, brings the promise of firm action, as opposed to the tweaks and \u201crefreshes\u201d of predecessor Peter Sands\u2019 later years. Winters thinks he can manage with 15,000 fewer people from a workforce of 86,000, a staggering level of reduction; a loan book too heavily concentrated on Asian commodity firms will be overhauled; and perennial underperforming units in Korea and Indonesia will be tackled, though detail was thin. One growth area is compliance, where Standard Chartered wants to \u201cmake a meaningful contribution to fighting financial crime\u201d \u2013 a welcome and overdue change in attitude. Yet it will all take time. Winters\u2019 horizons are set on 2020, which is when a return on equity of 10% is pencilled in. At a push, one might agree that there is still \u201can outstanding franchise\u201d at the heart of Standard Chartered. But the bank was loss-making in the last quarter as revenues tumbled 18% on a year ago and impairments more than doubled. Given the cost of restructuring, City analysts understandably wonder whether \u00a33.3bn of new capital will be enough. The big long-term shareholders \u2013 Temasek, from Singapore, and our own Aberdeen Asset Management \u2013 are obliged to sound supportive, swallow the lack of a final dividend and back the rights issue. But they should also look in the mirror. The market smelled trouble at Standard Chartered for at least two years, but the pressure from the wings rarely rose above the level of mumbles. Temasek and Aberdeen were too willing to believe the boasts from the highly remunerated boardroom about Standard Chartered\u2019s specialness. The consquences of delay are now horribly clear: a decade of chasing growth will be followed by half a decade of clean-up and cost-cutting. This story could have been different. Witty buys GSK time after takeover talk Sir Andrew Witty, GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s chief executive, declined to comment on the FT\u2019s story that the UK\u2019s biggest pharmaceuticals firm rejected a tentative takeover approach from Pfizer of the US a few weeks ago. But it\u2019s not hard to guess what Witty might have said. Something like: Big Pharma\u2019s record on big mergers and acquisitions is mixed, at best, and often lousy; and, anyway, GSK has a splendid independent future. Witty has sung the first half of that tune since he got the top job in 2008. The second part has been constant refrain, too. It\u2019s just that convincing outsiders to share a rosy vision of life after Advair, the asthma drug that has been the biggest earner in recent years, is proving tricky. Tuesday \u2013 GSK\u2019s first research and development showcase for years \u2013 was billed as a key moment for Witty to display the wonders about to appear from the labs. Around 40 potential new medicines and vaccines were paraded; four-fifths were described as \u201cfirst-in-class\u201d, meaning they are designed to be novel drugs as opposed to improvements on old ones; and GSK gave a strong account of how its progress in oncology continues despite the sale to Novartis last year of its established portfolio of cancer treatments. The market, though, declined to be dazzled: the share price slipped 1.5%. Perhaps the underwhelming response reflected the fact that GSK didn\u2019t lift its earnings forecasts from May. That feels too churlish. The layman\u2019s hunch here is that not all innovation in pharma land will emerge from the whizzy biotech firms. It surely would not be a surprise if GSK proves old dogs can learn new tricks. Witty\u2019s critics have become more vocal as GSK\u2019s share price refuses to rise. But he said enough on Tuesday to allow the standalone prescription to be given more time to work. Pfizer\u2019s tax planners were not needed.",

      "bodyText": "Burberry is to invest at least \u00a350m in a new factory to produce its trademark trenchcoats, creating 200 extra jobs in Yorkshire. The facility in Leeds will draw together production of the coats and the gaberdine cloth they are made from \u2013 currently made at two separate sites in Castleford and Keighley.

Among those modelling the famous trenchcoat are actors James Corden, Michelle Dockery and Julie Walters, singer James Bay and models Naomi Campbell, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Romeo Beckham. George Osborne welcomed the new investment in Leeds, describing it as \u201ca massive vote of confidence in our plans to build a \u2018northern powerhouse\u2019.\u201d The changes come as Burberry faces a slowdown in its key Asian markets which has hit global growth and sent the company\u2019s share price falling.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered is asking shareholders to stump up \u00a33.3bn while axing 15,000 jobs after reporting its first quarterly loss in 15 years. The emerging markets-focused bank also warned it faced further potential penalties on top of the \u00a3415m fine imposed in 2012 by the US authorities for breaching sanctions against Iran.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK is conducting two investigations into the bank\u2019s internal safeguards against financial crime. As Standard Chartered asked investors to take up new shares through a rights issue, its new chief executive, Bill Winters, said the bank would restructure to focus on affluent customers, rather than big companies, in emerging markets such as China. It will also pull back from riskier lending to remove $100bn (\u00a365bn) of assets \u2013 representing a third of the bank\u2019s balance sheet. One analyst described the changes as \u201cthe most significant repositioning\u201d of a bank he had ever seen. Telling analysts that there were some good aspects to Standard Chartered but they were buried under \u201cfertiliser\u201d, Winters said: \u201cThis bank has a history of excellence. It does not have a recent history of excellence.\u201d Winters \u2013 a former JP Morgan investment banker \u2013 took over in May from Peter Sands, who had overseen rapid growth until 2012 when regulatory problems hit and profits began to fall. The shares, which were trading at \u00a319 five years ago, have plummeted in value and on Tuesday were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, closing almost 7% lower at 666p. Until three years ago, the bank had enjoyed 10 consecutive years of rising profits, even through the damaging 2008 banking crisis. Winters is now focusing on returns to shareholders rather than revenue and winding back the less stringent approach to lending. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory group Manifest, said she would be quite surprised if investors did not raise the issue of any outstanding bonuses due to Sands. The former boss waived his bonus for 2014. Winters immediately faced questions about the timing of the cash call, which comes just weeks before the Bank of England is to publish the results of its stress tests on the major banks, on 1 December. \u201cThe bank has not raised enough capital in our view. Today\u2019s capital raise is the exact amount raised in 2010 \u2013 it was not enough then and is unlikely to be now,\u201d said Joseph Dickerson, analyst at the investment bank Jefferies. But major investors said they backed Winters. The rights issue is priced at 465p a share and gives investors two shares for every seven they already hold. The largest investor, Temasek \u2013 a Singaporean investment vehicle, which has 15.8% \u2013 will subscribe to the rights issue fully and help to underwrite the fundraising. The bank\u2019s second largest shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management, is also backing the fundraising. Hugh Young, managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, said: \u201c The plan outlined seems sensible and it is clear where the bank now wishes to focus its business.\u201d Standard Chartered has been affected by the turmoil in the Chinese economy and the plunge in stock markets in August as well as a rise in bad debts at its Indian business. It has reduced its exposure to China by 15% over the first nine months of the year. It has also cut by 21% its exposure to commodities, where prices have fallen as Chinese economic growth has weakened. The bank is also trying to rectify problems in its Indonesian and Korean operations. Winters has indicated that the bank has lent too readily in the past. Of the $100bn of assets being removed, $20bn are large loans to a handful of investors who are now deemed too risky for the bank. The third-quarter loss was $139m (\u00a390m) \u2013 thought to be the first loss at the bank since the Asian debt crisis in 1998 \u2013 and over a nine-month period profits dropped from $4.8bn to $1.6bn. As well as taking a tougher approach to bad debts, the bank pointed to a 44% rise in the cost of dealing with regulatory and legal issues to $690m. At the half-year results in August, Winters halved the dividend. The bank will not pay a further dividend until 2016 to save $700m. Stephen Andrews, analyst at investment bank UBS, said: \u201cWe believe this is one of the most significant repositionings of a large financial group we have seen. The aim is to reposition the group away from low return corporate banking towards higher return retail/wealth management businesses.\u201d There were no details on where the job cuts would fall within the 86,000-strong workforce, which is based largely in Asia and Africa. But the restructuring seeks to reduce costs by $2.9bn over four years. Winters intends to spend $3bn in the next three years on bolstering risk and compliance controls and pushing into faster growing business areas. The bank has promised to replace its chairman, Sir John Peace, next year. The bank warned investors participating in the rights issue that it could face further penalties from regulators. It said it was \u201csubject to various regulatory reviews, requests for information and investigations in relation to a number of the markets in which it operates, including two inquiries by the FCA concerning the group\u2019s financial crime controls and the matter in the US where the authorities continue to investigate the group\u2019s sanctions compliance in the period after 2007, as well as the completeness of its disclosures to the authorities at the time of the 2012 settlement\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2015 to correct a description of Temasek.",

      "bodyText": "Three directors of Compass Group, the FTSE 100 catering company, are to appear in court to answer fraud charges relating to how they dismissed an alleged whistleblower in 2013. Mark White, the group\u2019s general counsel, Jane Kingston, its human resources director, and John Bason, a non-executive director who heads its audit committee, were handed on Tuesday summonses to appear at Milton Keynes magistrates court next month. The cases emerged after the Guardian revealed last month that Dave Forsey, chief executive of FTSE 100 retailer Sports Direct, faced criminal charges over the alleged failure to give employees adequate notice that they were to lose their jobs, after a subsidiary went into administration. White and Kingston are accused of making false statements when dismissing Karim Pabani, a former finance director of a Compass subsidiary in Kazakhstan. Pabani claims he exposed fraud in the caterer\u2019s businesses in the former Soviet state before being sacked two years ago. Bason, who is also finance director of Associated British Foods, is accused of conspiring with White and Kingston over the sacking. Pabani, who has also launched an employment tribunal claim, which Compass is contesting, has brought the fraud case as a private prosecution. Alison Geary, a white-collar crime specialist at City law firm WilmerHale, said: \u201cPrivate prosecutions are becoming increasingly common. They are used by those seeking pursuing companies and individuals for alleged wrongdoing, particularly in fraud cases.\u201d She added that there was a far lower bar for an individual or company to pursue a private prosecution, as the cost for the Crown to bring a prosecution means it must be satisfied that it has \u201ca realistic prospect of conviction\u201d before proceeding. \u201cThere are a number of general principles that a magistrate will need to consider before issuing a summons in a private prosecution,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in general the magistrate ought to grant the summons unless there is a compelling reason not to do so.\u201d A spokesman for Compass said the allegations \u201cwill be vigorously defended\u201d against.

I will be engaging with the NI Executive and colleagues in government on this issue. Our economics correspondent Phillip Inman has pointed out that Michelin, in blaming a glut of tyres from the far east, fails to mention that it has a huge plant in India, four in Thailand and two in China. The Chinese factories employ more than 6,000 workers out of Michelin\u2019s 112,000 global workforce. He also says that blaming outdated machinery harks back to a similar incident in 1979 when Dunlop closed its Liverpool factory. There was a House of Commons debate at the time with angry Liverpool MPs to the fore. Dunlop owner Goodyear closed its last UK tyre factory in Birmingham last year Back to Ireland. South of the border, away from the doom and gloom over Northern Ireland\u2019s shrinking manufacturing base, the emphasis today in Dublin is all on hi-tech. More than 30,000 tech entrepreneurs from all over the planet have descended on the city\u2019s RDS conference centre for the annual Web Summit. But even amid all of the start ups and the hyper-optimistic tech speak there is discord from the lips of a Game of Thrones star. Liam Cunningham who plays Davos Seaworth in the cult TV series used a live question and answer session at the summit today to denounce Dublin\u2019s loss of the annual hi-tech global gathering to Lisbon for the next three years. Criticising the Irish government for its alleged lack of support for the summit and its founder Paddy Cosgrave, the Game of Thrones actor told a packed audience: \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace that something this clever and wonderful has been lost by people who probably don\u2019t know how to turn on a mobile phone.\u201d Cunningham said the government should get \u201con its hands and knees\u201d to help Cosgrave bring the international conference back to the Irish capital. Earlier there was better news for the US economy, with New York business activity bouncing back in October. The Institute of Supply Management\u2019s index surged from 44.5 to 65.8. This is the best performance for 12 years and follows the lowest reading in September since 2009. After disappointing UK export figures, come weaker than expected US factory orders. According to the Commerce Department, new orders for factory goods fell for the second month in a row in September, hit by a strong dollar and cutbacks by energy companies. Orders dropped by 1%, compared to a 2.1% decline in August - itself revised down from the initial 1.7% fall. Analysts had been expecting a decline of 0.9% in September. Ahead of the latest US factory order figures, markets are treading cautiously, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently up around 10 points after an initial dip. The factory orders are expected to recover a little from August\u2019s 1.7% decline, but most observers will be concentrating on Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers for further guidance as to when the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. Northern Ireland\u2019s First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said they would do everything they could for the Michelin workers, the Belfast Telegraph reports. They said: The Executive will make every effort to alleviate the impact of the job losses and ensure the necessary support is available to those affected directly and indirectly. Just over a year ago the workers of JTI Gallaher in Ballymena received similar news and so this combined with today\u2019s announcement is a real body blow to the local economy. The Executive is willing to meet with management, workers, trade unions and all local representatives to see if there is anything further we as an Executive can do. The Belfast Telegraph has also spoken with Ballymena factory manager John Milsted, who has worked at the factory for two years and had been a Michelin employee for the past 36 years. He told them. \u201cThe decision was not made easily, but is due to the dramatic transformation of the truck tyre market since 2007. \u201cSales have slumped and we are competing with cheap imports.\u201d Davy Thompson of Unite said that in terms of per head of population the loss of 860 jobs for a country town like Ballymena would be the equivalent of the city of Belfast losing 14,000 jobs. Meanwhile the Michelin management are trying to soften the blow by holding out the chances of some workers relocating to other plants. Jim Milsted, Michelin\u2019s manager at the North Antrim town, said the company now had \u201ctwo and a half years to find out how to get 860 people into alternative employment\u201d before its final closure in 2018. We\u2019ve got hold of the document which Michelin handed to staff in Ballymena today, explaining why the plant is to shut by 2018. It blames \u201cAsian imports\u201d, general over-capacity and high energy costs, which mean it doesn\u2019t make financial sense to upgrade the plant: The document then outlines how Michelin will invest in its plants in Stoke and Dundee The Ballymena job losses are a particularly bitter blow, as the pneumatic tire was (re)invented in Northern Ireland by John Boyd Dunlop back in the 1880s. Michelin is actually cutting around 1,6000 jobs across Europe. The French tire maker has announced it will also restructure its operations in Italy and Germany, and is taking a \u00a3280m impairment charge to cover the cost. Pneu Laurent According to workers who attended the briefing from management today some staff will be offered relocation to other Michelin factories in Britain and Europe, reports our correspondent Henry McDonald. Commercial television station UTV\u2019s business editor, Jamie Delargy, is tweeting more details of the closure: Michelin has blamed outdated machinery at the Ballymena factory for the decision to close the site by 2018. In a statement, it says: \u201cThe tyre building machines at Ballymena are not capable of making the high tech tyres of the future, and the amount of investment required to upgrade the plant is prohibitive, particularly at a time when that capacity is not required. Michelin will \u201cimmediately\u201d start a consultation process with employees over its proposal to close the site: \u201cThe Ballymena factory currently employs 860 people and the MTPLC is committed to supporting those employees during consultation and in the forthcoming months. \u201cMichelin appreciates the impact these proposals may have on the employees and local community and commits to support every employee throughout the process. \u201cIn the coming weeks we will meet every employee individually to discuss the proposal and the assistance the employee may need.\u201d Ballymena\u2019s local MP, Ian Paisley, says he will table an urgent question at the House of Commons tomorrow, about the Michelin factory closure. Jim Allister, who represents North Antrim in the Northern Ireland Assembly, is also very concerned by the news: I\u2019m afraid we have bad news from Northern Ireland, as feared. Nearly nine hundred jobs are to go, after Michelin told its workforce at today\u2019s meeting in Ballymena that it is closing the plant where it has operated since 1969. The company has just told its workforce that 860 jobs will be lost when the factory closes, in 2018. Unions representing employees at the factory said the decision was a cruel blow in the face of Christmas and the town already facing mass redundancies because JTI-Gallagher Tobacco is leaving Ballymena. The Unite union said the Michelin decision was devastating news for Northern Ireland manufacturing. Davy Thompson, Unite\u2019s regional co-ordinating officer said: \u201cIn addition to the 860 workers who are directly employed by Michelin on the site, there are approximately 500 contractors and many more in the economy who now face the threat of redundancy as a result of this announcement.\u201d Thompson also said regional and national government inaction played a part in Michellin\u2019s planned departure from Ballymena after more than four decades. He said: \u201cUnite has repeatedly demanded action from Ministers in relation to the high energy costs, the protracted difficulties experienced by Michelin in obtaining a connection for a proposed combined-heat power plant and the pressing need for capital support to modernise the plant. Ministerial inaction has resulted in a situation where high energy costs have left the Ballymena plant having the second lowest operating efficiency and now facing closure. It\u2019s also a blow to the wirer UK export industry, as the Ballymena site made tires that were shipped overseas. The British Chamber of Commerce has raised the pressure on the British government to help exporters, after warning this morning that the sector is at a six-year low. BCC director general John Longworth an audience in London that David Cameron\u2019s ambition of \u00a31trillion in exports by 2020 is simply not going to happen Longworth says: Yes, we have to be honest with ourselves \u2013 and acknowledge that, as a country, we are not living up to the national export challenge set by the Prime Minister back in 2012. And then he makes some serious home truths about the state of British exports -- showing how talk about creating the March Of The Makers is still that, just talk. Britain has had a trade deficit since 1998 \u2013 and this became four-and-a half-times larger by the end of 2014, at \u00a334.5 billion. Yes, it\u2019s true that he deficit has narrowed by \u00a38 billion since 2010 \u2013 but this has been on the back of a standout performance by services alone. The UK has had a current account deficit since 1984. It\u2019s now 57 times as large as it was then, at nearly \u00a393 billion. Since 2010, the current account deficit has more than doubled, as income from overseas investments has reduced and it is indicative of the quality and volume of both inward and outward investment. Even though the value of UK exports to non-EU countries has increased by 25% over the past five years, compared to just 6% for exports to the EU, we have not moved quickly enough to seize opportunities in the new markets. By British Chambers calculations, we\u2019re 14 years behind meeting the target of \u00a31 trillion in annual exports, despite standout performances by so many individual companies. The solution, Longworth told the BCC International Trade Conference 2015, is to restructure the UK economy: Will we continue, our unsustainable binge of consumer and Government spending \u2013 or will we make the tough choices and fix the fundamentals, a choice that would lead to more investment and global trade? Over in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, workers at the Michelin tire plant have been told to assemble for a meeting at noon, and it could be bad news. We understand they will be told about plans to halt production at the site, which could lead to job losses. Local Stormont Assembly member Jim Allister says there is \u2018alarming\u2019 news about the plant. Michelin has been operating in Ballymena since 1969 and employs about 1,000 people. It makes truck and bus tyres mainly for export to the US. The Standard Chartered selloff is gathering speed. The bank\u2019s shares are now down 10% , as the City learns more about CEO Bill Winters\u2019 plan for the company, funded by \u00a33.3bn from shareholders through a cash call. Winters faces a tricky task, turning around a bank that is badly exposed to slowing emerging markets and just reported its first quarterly loss since the Asian debt crisis in 1998. He told analysts this morning that Standard Chartered would liquidate $20bn of loans that are outside its \u2018risk tolerance\u2019, suggesting some of its lending has been too ambitious. It is also planning to restructure its Indonesian and South Korean operations, and also throw more money into operations in Africa and China. Richard de Meo, managing director at Foenix Partners, agrees that today\u2019s construction report suggests growth will rebound this quarter. He says (via Reuters): The construction data was a bit underwhelming, but overall we are still on track for 1% growth in the final quarter which is pretty good. My money would still be on the Bank of England hiking rates sometime in the first half of 2016,\u201d said Britain\u2019s housebuilders are having a bad morning on the stock market. Shares in Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey have both shed 3%, followed by Persimmon (down 2%). That follows a ratings downgrade by analysts at Liberum, who recommended selling shares in the building sector: Today\u2019s construction report follows an unexpectedly strong manufacturing PMI yesterday, which showed growth rebounded in October. This may be a sign that the economy is picking up after slowing in the last quarter, reckons Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon: Markit also disputes the official claim that the construction sector shrank in the last quarter (as the Office for National Statistics believes). Rather than acting as a drag on the economy, as suggested by recent GDP estimates, the sector is continuing to act as an important driving force behind the ongoing UK economic upturn. Markit\u2019s PMI survey found solid construction growth between July and September. The ONS, though, believes the sector shrank by 2.2%. At least one of them is wrong..... Construction firms are struggling to find enough builders to keep up with demand, says Markit\u2019s Tim Moore: \u201cConstruction companies noted a rebound in new business flows during October and responded to rising workloads by taking on extra staff at the fastest rate for almost a year. Shortages of skilled staff persisted as a result, with the current period of falling sub-contractor availability the longest seen in over a decade.\u201d This chart shows how commercial building activity jumped last month, growing nearly as fast as housebuilding. Civil engineering growth slowed, though, continuing a recent trend: Britain\u2019s construction sector has posted another month of solid growth, according to data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s construction PMI came in at 58.8 in October, down from 59.9 in September. That suggests growth slowed a little, but it\u2019s still looking pretty healthy (50 points is the the cut-off point between expansion and contraction). Markit reports that new orders picked up, while job creation hit a near one-year high. That suggests the sector is ending 2015 quite strongly.\uf0a7 Here\u2019s the key points: Business activity continues to rise in all three construction sub-categories... ...but only commercial building sees a faster increase than in September Employment growth picks up to its fastest since November 2014 Builders are also quite optimistic -- 58% forecasting a rise in business activity over the next year, and only 7% expect a decline. Reaction to follow.... Central bank news. Zambia has just hiked interest rates by three whole percentage points, in an attempt to fight inflation and prop up its currency, the Kwacha..... It\u2019s nearly time for Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck of Britain\u2019s construction sector: Reuters columnist Olaf Storbeck sees more trouble ahead for Volkswagen: Volkswagen shares have taken a predictable hit from the news that the emissions cheating scam may be even bigger than thought. The company has slumped to the bottom of the Frankfurt stock market, down 3.33%, after US regulators claimed that the 2015 Porsche Cayenne contained software to evade emissions tests. They also alleged that several Audi models are involved in the scandal. Volkswagen has denied adding \u2018defeat devices\u2019 to these cars, but the prospect of the scandal widening is another blow to the carmaker. The biggest takeover of a UK tech company since 2011 has been announced, with US video game maker Activision Blizzard sweeping on King Digital, the British creator of Candy Crush. Activision are paying a hefty price \u2013 $5.9bn \u2013 for a company whose addictive game once racked up a billion plays every day from smartphone fans eager to smash those sweets. But that\u2019s rather less than the $8bn which King was worth when it floated on the New York stock market last year. Not the first time that someone\u2019s paid too much for a mobile gaming experience, of course. As blogger John Gruber jokes: They were only going to pay $1 billion, but then they got stuck on a couple of levels, bought some gold bars, and, well, here they are. Standard Chartered\u2019s shares have slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 index at the start of trading in London. They lost almost 6% at one stage, as investors react to the decision to issue \u00a33.3bn of new shares to raise capital. City editor Jill Treanor explains: Standard Chartered is asking its investors to stump up \u00a33.3bn after reporting its first quarterly loss in at least 15 years and warning of further penalties for regulatory breaches. Alongside the rights issue, the emerging markets-focused bank also revealed it would need to cut 15,000 jobs as it reins in costs and pulls back from riskier operations. Standard Chartered\u2019s financial results, also released this morning, won\u2019t help the share price either. It made a loss of $139m in the last quarter, due to rising bad debts in emerging markets such as India. The company is briefing the media now, on a conference call. Newish CEO Bill Winters says his strategic plan is \u201cambitions, aggressive and well-thought through\u201d. Let\u2019s see if the City agrees.... The Times is so worried about Britain\u2019s current account deficit that it has published two different opinion pieces on it today. Ed Conway, Sky\u2019s economics editor, argues on page 27 that policymakers are deliberately ignoring the alarm bells, because they\u2019ve been ringing for so long. Ed\u2019s solution? A weaker pound, to make exports more competitive and also drive up the cost of imported goods to make us live within our means again. Then on page 41, Oliver Kamm also warns that Britain\u2019s balance of payments is the deficit that \u2018no-one is talking about\u2019, despite being a headache for decades: At present, Britain helps to covers its trade deficit with capital from foreign investors - who still get a decent return on their investments. In contrast, UK investments overseas aren\u2019t yielding as much - driving the balance of payments further into the red. So if exports deteriorate, and the global economy worsens, Britain\u2019s prosperity could take a hit. This export gloom is a worry, because Britain is already running a persistent trade gap with the rest of the world. This chart, from last month\u2019s trade figures, shows how the UK\u2019s surplus in services is more than wiped out by the deficit in goods traded in and out of the country: Phil Couchman, CEO of parcel business DHL Express UK, says British exporters are suffering from persisting worries over the eurozone (after another summer dominated by the Greek crisis) The strong pound isn\u2019t helping either, leading to today\u2019s downbeat survey: Couchman explains: \u201cWe can mostly attribute the drop in export orders and sales to uncertainty in the Eurozone, and the instability of the Chinese and wider global economy. He\u2019s not sounding too alarmed, though: Despite these factors, we must remember that UK businesses are resoundingly resilient. Whilst the overall index has fallen, over half of businesses say export orders have remained constant \u2013 and half say export sales have too.\u201d The UK manufacturing industry has suffered a painful slump in export growth and confidence as problems in the global economy hit demand. According to the British Chambers of Commerce this morning, exporters are at their gloomiest since the dark days of the last recession. Growth in sales and orders is now at its weakest in six years, say businesses surveyed for the Trade Confidence Index. The BCC warns: While export orders have remained constant for just over half (54%) of UK businesses, and 50% report that export sales have remained the same as in the previous quarter, both have fallen to their lowest level since Q2 2009. The report suggests that Britain is going to struggle to close its hefty trade gap with the rest of the world, given the economic problems in the eurozone and many emerging markets. The BCC also found that: 50% of businesses report export sales have remained constant, 21% report a decrease (up from 15% in Q2). 54% of businesses report export orders have remained constant, 22% report a decrease (up from 17% in Q2). 13% of exporters say that they have seen a decrease in investment in plant and machinery during the previous quarter. All quite concerning, at at time when growth is slowing in China, America and Canada, and remains lacklustre in Europe. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, fears that the sector is teetering on the brink of a serious crisis: \u201cDriving export growth is key to reducing the UK\u2019s deficit and maintaining our global competitiveness. These figures make it clear that the UK\u2019s export drive is at risk of going into reverse gear, precisely at the time when it needs to be moving forward. \u201cMany firms are currently operating at capacity and are in need of support to invest in machinery or staff. Those businesses considering taking the leap and breaking into new markets desperately need access to the growth funding and working capital to enable this transformation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today..... After yesterday\u2019s splurge of manufacturing data, today we find out how Britain\u2019s builders fared in October. The Construction PMI, due at 9.30am GMT, is expected to show that growth slowed a little. Construction was the worst-performing sector of the UK in the last quarter, helping to drag growth down to 0.5%, so any signs of fresh weakness will be worrying. In the financial sector, Standard Chartered is centre-stage as its new CEO, Bill Winters, announces a new turnaround plan. The bank is cutting 15,000 jobs and raising \u00a33.3bn in new capital, and will explain the moves this morning. Volkswagen is also in the spotlight, after US regulators claimed that the emissions cheating scandal was even bigger than expected. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which uncovered the initial emissions rigging at VW, claims the carmaker installed defeat devices in VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles with three-litre engines in models with dates ranging from 2014 to 2016. That could pull VW\u2019s shares down again today. Europe\u2019s stock markets are tipped to rally a little, after Wall Street closed almost 1% higher. And over in Australia, the central bank has left interest rates unchanged - and suggested that economic conditions have \u2018firmed\u2019 a little. Here\u2019s how the action unfolded (with bonus horse racing coverage): We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Implementing the \u201cnational living wage\u201d will cost Primark tens of millions of pounds by 2020 but will not mean higher clothing prices, the retailer\u2019s parent company has said. John Bason, finance director of Associated British Foods, said: \u201cThe extra cost of the national living wage is of a scale we have seen from many other factors that affect Primark and it is not going to prejudice our pricing position.\u201d ABF warned that group profits were likely to fall in 2016 after a 30% drop to \u00a3717m in the year to 12 September, when a tough 12 months for its sugar business combined with currency exchange issues and lower profit margins at Primark. Revenues at the group, which owns food brands including Kingsmill bread, dipped by 1% to \u00a312.8bn. The company blamed Primark\u2019s lower profit margin on a return to more usual levels of discounting over the summer compared with the previous year, when the long spell of warm weather drove demand for its vest tops and light clothing. George Weston, ABF\u2019s chief executive, said problems with currency exchange rates, which affect the prices at which Primark can buy stock and the reporting of profits from overseas businesses, would be the main factor affecting next year\u2019s bottom line. Analysts said they were surprised by ABF\u2019s cautious language after it was able to deliver better than expected profits in 2015, partly because of cost cutting within the substantial sugar business. Weston said: \u201cThe national living wage will add costs in the UK, but that is only one market we are trading in. It will put money into the pockets of some of our customers, but is another one of the cost challenges we face.\u201d Sales at Primark stores open for more than a year rose by 1% in the year to September, but total sales were up by 13% at constant currency rates to \u00a35.3bn as the company opened 1m sq ft of shop space including new stores in France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as its first US store in Boston. This year, Primark will press ahead with 1.5m sq ft of new space including more US outlets and new stores in the UK, Spain and France. Weston said the Primark brand was still going strong and that sales at established stores rose by 4% outside Germany and the Netherlands, where longstanding outlets were affected by a rash of new openings. The Boston store had traded well in its first few weeks, he said, and seven new outlets would open in locations including Philadelphia, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Staten Island, New York, over the coming months. Weston said the UK high street was set for a better autumn than last year, despite another warm start to November, when temperatures in parts of the country topped those in Barcelona and the Algarve on Sunday. Warm autumn weather usually prompts retailers to warn about slow sales of woolies and coats, but Weston said: \u201cThe whole high street is benefiting from better weather. Consumer confidence is supplemented by greater disposable income, so it\u2019s a better environment.\u201d He said the cold snap at the beginning of the season meant shoppers had switched to thinking about coats and jumpers despite the recent warm spell. \u201cWe are feeling good about trade at the moment. It is better than last year across all our European markets,\u201d he said. Weston said prices of food commodities including sugar were also stabilising after several years of deflation. \u201cCommodity prices have come down, but don\u2019t seem to be falling further for the time being. It\u2019s hard to be certain that prices have reached the bottom. Recent movements have been more up than down,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Plans to bring local buses back under public control have been dealt a blow by a ruling over Tyne and Wear\u2019s pioneering attempt to regulate its services. In the culmination of a bitter, drawn-out battle between the regional authority in Newcastle upon Tyne and private bus firms, an independent board has dismissed a scheme to re-regulate buses, judging that it does not provide value for money and would have a disproportionate impact on bus operators. After hearings this year, the Quality Contract Scheme board chaired by the traffic commissioner for the north-east said Tyne and Wear\u2019s proposals to control bus routes, timetables and fares would improve services, but would not provide value for money. The operators had argued that attempts to take control of routes would be in breach of their economic rights. The board judged that Nexus, the region\u2019s transport executive, would potentially be causing Stagecoach, Go-Ahead and Arriva to lose up to \u00a3226m in business if the scheme went ahead, and that they should be compensated. The decision could have implications for city devolution plans at the heart of the chancellor\u2019s vision of a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d. Manchester and other cities have agreed to changes including elected mayors and control over local financing and transport, with buses a key issue. Bus services outside London were deregulated by the Thatcher government in the 1980s. Stagecoach and other transport firms have made the bulk of their UK profits from such bus services rather than the trains or regulated buses they also operate. Nexus argued it was paying large subsidies to fund unprofitable routes for community benefit, while not being allowed to run public services on profitable routes under the legislation. Local authorities are also forced by law to provide concessionary bus travel for pensioners. The transport executive claimed re-regulation would save money and lead to better services. But operators led by Stagecoach, which runs about 40% of buses in Tyne and Wear, claimed the move would mean higher fares, worse service and bigger taxes. Tobyn Hughes, the managing director of Nexus, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with the board\u2019s opinion and we don\u2019t agree with the analysis they\u2019ve made. In terms of our aspiration for an integrated transport system, with integrated fares and democratic accountability for services, that has not changed in any way.\u201d He said it would continue to push for change, despite the verdict, pointing to recent devolution agreements between the government and the north-east. \u201cThe government supports the right of devolved authorities to manage their transport networks in the way they see fit, and that includes bus franchising in this area,\u201d he said. Hughes added: \u201cIt means our plans are delayed. As well as improving transport, we were trying to stave off the effects of cuts and austerity and the decline in services. This delay will mean some of those ill-effects will come about.\u201d Stagecoach said the decision had clear implications for the government\u2019s plans to devolve control of buses to local authorities in the north, warning that the forthcoming buses bill must ensure any proposals to franchise bus networks were subject to proper safeguards and a transparent public interest test. Stagecoach\u2019s chief executive, Martin Griffiths, said: \u201cWe welcome the review board\u2019s confirmation that the core franchising proposal was unaffordable, inflexible, high risk and not in the public interest. Tyne and Wear already has 90% bus customer satisfaction, among the highest levels of bus use in the country, and smart ticketing is being introduced across the region. Franchising does nothing to build on that successful, high-quality network.\u201d He urged the regional authority to abandon its franchising plans and work in partnership with bus operators. But Labour said the decision was disappointing. The shadow transport secretary, Lilian Greenwood, said: \u201cIt puts the needs of shareholders ahead of passengers and critically undermines one of George Osborne\u2019s key northern powerhouse commitments. We must reverse the decline in bus services outside London and it\u2019s clear that the deregulated model has failed. Labour\u2019s councillors in the north-east were absolutely right to push for reform in the face of appalling abuse and they continue to have our full support. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement proves once and for all that the current law is not fit for purpose and the onus is now on the government to bring forward new legislation. It\u2019s now vital that the government does not cave in to pressure and duck the need to include radical measures in its forthcoming buses bill.\u201d The battle has been closely followed across other cities in the north, where similar powers are sought over buses, which provide the bulk of public transport in the UK. Transport for Greater Manchester\u2019s chief executive, Jon Lamonte, said of the decision: \u201cIt reinforces the need for new legislation under the buses bill. This was always a difficult piece of legislation and this process has proved it.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is every indication that we will get central backing that will allow the elected mayor to make the right decision.\u201d Richard Collins, a transport specialist at the law firm Bond Dickinson, said the drawn-out battle between bus operators and the regional authority showed up problems with the current regulatory structure. \u201cThere is more regulation coming down the pipeline, the buses bill, due next year. It may be that, whatever the outcome of this process, new forms of partnership between operators and local authorities are likely,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to create an interesting dynamic: part of the northern powerhouse is about devolving decision making to local authorities and it throws up challenges for bus operators.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Michelin is to close a factory in Northern Ireland with the loss of 860 jobs, heightening concerns that global competition amid a recent decline in world trade will cause a spate of factory closures. The French tyre maker told its workforce in Ballymena it was closing the plant \u201cin light of the significant downturn in demand for truck tyres in Europe since the financial crisis of 2007\u201d. Michelin said the site would be run down until it shuts in mid-2018. It is the second major closure in the town after tobacco company JTI Gallagher announced last year that it was closing its manufacturing site, with 800 redundancies. More could follow across the UK unless the government improves support for export industries and especially manufacturing businesses, the British Chambers of Commerce said. Speaking at the BCC\u2019s international trade conference in London, the director general said David Cameron\u2019s ambition to generate an annual \u00a31tn in exports by 2020 was off course. \u201cWill we continue our unsustainable binge of consumer and government spending \u2013 or will we make the tough choices and fix the fundamentals, a choice that would lead to more investment and global trade?\u201d John Longworth said. In 2014, the annual trade deficit was \u00a334.8bn \u2013 the largest since 2010 when it reached \u00a337bn. The deficit was blamed on a \u00a314.6bn fall in goods exports from the previous year, which was only partialy offset by a \u00a37.3bn drop in imports. Michelin said it would continue to make tyres in Dundee and Stoke on Trent, where it planned to invest in new machinery and storage facilities. But the company said a reduction in capacity was needed after a decline in the European tyre market by more than 5m tyres since the financial crisis. It added that he squeeze on its operations had been compounded by the huge influx of Asian imports, which had doubled in recent years. \u201cAs a result, there is a strong need to reduce overcapacity and to concentrate Michelin truck tyre production in larger, more competitive sites. Despite great efforts and progress being made in previous years, other European plants are still more competitive than Ballymena,\u201d it said. Michelin has four factories in Thailand, one in India and two in China. Its Chinese factories employ more than 6,000 of the firm\u2019s 112,000-member global workforce. Unite said the Michelin decision was devastating news for manufacturing in Northern Ireland. Davy Thompson, the union\u2019s regional coordinating officer, said: \u201cIn addition to the 860 workers who are directly employed by Michelin on the site, there are approximately 500 contractors and many more in the economy who now face the threat of redundancy as a result of this announcement.\u201d Thompson also said regional and national government inaction played a part in Michelin\u2019s exit from Ballymena after more than four decades. \u201cUnite has repeatedly demanded action from ministers in relation to the high energy costs, the protracted difficulties experienced by Michelin in obtaining a connection for a proposed combined-heat power plant and the pressing need for capital support to modernise the plant,\u201d he said. \u201cMinisterial inaction has resulted in a situation where high energy costs have left the Ballymena plant having the second lowest operating efficiency and now facing closure.\u201d",

The deficit was blamed on a \u00a314.6bn fall in goods exports from the previous year, which was only partialy offset by a \u00a37.3bn drop in imports.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Michelin said it would continue to make tyres in Dundee and Stoke on Trent, where it planned to invest in new machinery and storage facilities.</p> <p>But the company said a reduction in capacity was needed after a decline in the European tyre market by more than 5m tyres since the financial crisis. It added that he squeeze on its operations had been compounded by the huge influx of Asian imports, which had doubled in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result, there is a strong need to reduce overcapacity and to concentrate Michelin truck tyre production in larger, more competitive sites. Despite great efforts and progress being made in previous years, other European plants are still more competitive than Ballymena,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Michelin has four factories in Thailand, one in India and two in China.

      "bodyText": "Shell has sought to reassure shareholders about its blockbuster takeover of BG Group by announcing an extra $1bn (\u00a3650m) of cost savings aimed at making the $70bn deal work in the face of persistently low oil prices. The Anglo-Dutch oil group said on Tuesday that a doubling of cost cuts to $2bn would increase total savings from the takeover by 40% to $3.5bn. Shell said it was on track to complete the acquisition by early next year as planned. Investors have been nervous about Shell\u2019s purchase of BG since it was announced in April. At the time, Shell suggested oil prices would recover to $90 a barrel by 2020. However, they have fallen from $115 a barrel last year to less than $50 and are predicted to stay low for some time. The International Energy Agency said in July that prices could decline further due to a growing glut of crude and slowing demand. Shell reported a quarterly loss of $7.4bn last week as it unveiled $8bn of charges to cover its withdrawal from the Alaskan Arctic, the suspension of building on the Carmon Creek oil sands project in Canada and the impact of the depressed oil price. Shell said the BG deal would break even with oil in the mid-$60s per barrel and that while price forecasts had fallen by $10-$15 a barrel, its calculations of the benefits from the takeover were unchanged. Shell believes buying BG will increase its cash flow, allowing the company to pay off debts and giving it greater scope to pay dividends and buy back shares. The BG purchase will also let Shell simplify its business by concentrating on oil production and refining, deep water drilling and liquefied natural gas, it said. The company is selling $20bn of assets with a further $30bn planned for the two years after the takeover is confirmed. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said: \u201cLow oil prices are driving significant changes in our industry. We are reshaping the company and this will accelerate once this [BG] transaction is complete. \u201cAsset sales and hard choices on capital spending, such as the recent announcements to cease exploration in Alaska and the development of Carmon Creek heavy oil in Canada, all underline the changes that are under way. Integration planning for Shell and BG is progressing according to plan and we\u2019re announcing a 40% increase in synergies expected from the recommended combination.\u201d",

But the Lambert &amp; Butler and Gitanes owner said it expected \u201ca headwind form Iraq and Syria in the first half.\u201d It added: Looking to the year ahead we expect first quarter volumes will continue to reflect the situation in Iraq and Syria as well as a strong comparator quarter for volumes last year, while first half revenue should benefit from stronger relative pricing. Overall we are well placed to meet expectations for the coming year. That confidence. along with a 10% hike in the dividend, has lifted Imperial\u2019s shares 4p to \u00a335.01 in downbeat market. Analysts at Credit Suisse said: The full year results on balance look good to us; a \u2018beat\u2019 on both earnings per share and net debt, strong pricing, US integration going well and good progress on growth brands. On the negative side organic volumes are weaker; down 10% in the fourth quarter over half of which was Iraq/Syria. With another year of double digit earnings per share and dividend growth in prospect and the latter well covered by free cash flow, Imperial\u2019s 15 times PE continues to look very attractive within the staples space. Canaccord Genuity however has repeated its sell recommendation, although it has raised its target price from \u00a327.05 to \u00a327.25: While the fourth quarter performance was robust overall, looking ahead we remain concerned about the impact of the introduction of plain packaging in the UK and Ireland in mid-2016 (and its possible adoption in other EU markets in the longer term), and the likely increased competitive threat from larger players Altria and Reynolds American in the US as the pricing standstill agreement expires in mid-November 2015. The boost from brand migrations more broadly will now slow, albeit this will not be a surprise.

      "bodyText": "A surge in new work across the UK construction industry in October cheered financial markets and sent the pound close to a 10-week high against a basket of currencies. Building firms took on new work at the fastest rate for a year, according to the CIPS/Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the construction industry. The index, published on Tuesday, suggests the British economy has recovered quickly from the turmoil caused by China\u2019s dramatic slowdown. The figures came a day after a similar survey showing the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector, which had slipped several gears in response to declining world trade, at its highest level of expansion in 16 months. Markit said increased output by construction companies appeared to reflect a strong pipeline of work already underway as well as a faster growth in new orders. \u201cThe latest rise in incoming new work was the steepest since October 2014, with construction companies highlighting new project wins from both public and private sector clients,\u201d it said. A slow recovery among civil engineering firms dragged down the overall growth figure for the sector, which slowed in October after hitting its fastest pace in six months in September. The construction PMI slipped back to 58.8 in October from 59.9 in September. Tim Moore, a senior economist at Markit, said: \u201cAnother relatively buoyant construction PMI reading indicates that the sector remains in rude health. Rather than acting as a drag on the economy, as suggested by recent GDP estimates, the sector is continuing to act as an important driving force behind the ongoing UK economic upturn.\u201d He said construction companies noted a rebound in new business flows in October and responded by taking on extra staff at the fastest rate for almost a year. \u201cShortages of skilled staff persisted as a result, with the current period of falling subcontractor availability the longest seen in over a decade,\u201d he said. Richard de Meo, the managing director of the currency hedging firm Foenix Partners, said: \u201cThe construction data was a bit underwhelming, but overall we are still on track for 1% growth in the final quarter which is pretty good. My money would still be on the Bank of England hiking rates sometime in the first half of 2016.\u201d He added: \u201cSterling is holding up pretty well because of that.\u201d Sterling was steady against the dollar at $1.54, and 0.25% higher against the euro at \u20ac1.40, just off its 10-week high on Monday.",

Rather than acting as a drag on the economy, as suggested by recent GDP estimates, the sector is continuing to act as an important driving force behind the ongoing UK economic upturn.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said construction companies noted a rebound in new business flows in October and responded by taking on extra staff at the fastest rate for almost a year. </p> <p>\u201cShortages of skilled staff persisted as a result, with the current period of falling subcontractor availability the longest seen in over a decade,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Richard de Meo, the managing director of the currency hedging firm Foenix Partners, said: \u201cThe construction data was a bit underwhelming, but overall we are still on track for 1% growth in the final quarter which is pretty good. My money would still be on the Bank of England hiking rates sometime in the first half of 2016.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cSterling is holding up pretty well because of that.\u201d </p> <p>Sterling was steady against the dollar at $1.54, and 0.25% higher against the euro at \u20ac1.40, just off its 10-week high on Monday.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

As a consequence of these concerns, Liberum issued a gloomy sector note, helping to push Barratt Developments down 17p to 593p, Taylor Wimpey 4.8p lower to 193.4p, and Persimmon 30p down at \u00a319.38. Liberum analyst Charlie Campbell said: We believe the largest housebuilders\u2019 valuations are too optimistic to withstand the gross margin pressure that we expect in the coming years as house price inflation is suppressed by a more vigilant regulator and build cost inflation returns. We cut our ratings on Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey from Hold to Sell. There is better value in builders who can grow profits by raising output: top picks Bellway and Gleeson. House prices are much more stretched than widely assumed because price/income multiples are now watched by a regulator with growing powers. Stricter controls on lending standards will depress house price inflation, which could cause gross margins to fall as build costs have started rising materially, especially labour. Falling gross margins will lower returns especially for those not growing output. Rising rates will not derail the housing market, but sentiment is vulnerable. We believe investors may see the first US rate rise as a signal to reset portfolios. Housebuilders\u2019 shares could also be vulnerable as returns-based models generate lower valuations as interest rates rise. The other main risk to the sector is that Help to Buy is repealed. The government will keep this in place while it generates job growth, but if house prices were to stall the scheme\u2019s costs could rise materially. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 7.05 points at 6354.75, with Standard Chartered 56.3p lower at 657.3p. Associated British Foods, owner of Primark, groceries and sugar businesses, has slipped 36p to \u00a333.98 after a 2% fall in annual earnings and a warning about currency pressures affecting the current year. It said the first US Primark store opened eight weeks ago was trading well. Meggitt, hit recently by a full year profit warning, has recovered 9.2p to 366.3p after Barclays kept an overweight rating on the engineering group, albeit with a price target slashed from 610p to 420p. Barclays said: Rarely do we find aerospace and defence companies which are simply too cheap. But post last week\u2019s warning Meggitt is firmly in that bracket. At 10 times 2016 PE, 9 times enterprise value/EBITA with a comfortably affordable dividend yielding around 4.5%, the shares trade at a 25% discount to their own historical averages versus the sector in spite of a 6% earnings per share compound annual growth rate and unmatched cash progression. We too harbour concerns around near term visibility and capital deployment discipline, but this looks to be more than in the price. Mining shares have slipped back despite Australia\u2019s central bank keeping interest rates on hold and suggesting economic conditions had \u2018firmed\u2019 a little. BHP Billiton is down 1.5p at 1024.5p, Rio Tinto is off 40p at 2281.5p and Anglo American has dropped 8.5p to 535.8p.",

      "bodyText": "King Digital Entertainment, the British creator of the hit smartphone game Candy Crush Saga, has been bought for $5.9bn (\u00a33.8bn) in a deal that will mean a payday of more than $1.2bn for co-founders Mel Morris and Riccardo Zacconi. King is being acquired by Activision Blizzard, the US video game maker behind World of Warcraft and Call of Duty. The US group will pay $18 in cash for each King share \u2013 16% more than the UK company\u2019s closing price on Monday \u2013 in the biggest takeover in the British tech sector since Hewlett-Packard bought Autonomy in an ill-fated \u00a37bn deal in August 2011. Morris, the former chairman who left the company last year and is now owner of Derby County FC, has an 11.3% stake in King worth $666m at the $18 price. Zacconi, the chief executive, stands to bank $561m, and will stay on at the company. The deal will also make cash multimillionaires of other top executives. Activision Blizzard\u2019s games are played on consoles \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s Xbox and Sony\u2019s PlayStation \u2013 and it said buying King would give it a place in the rapidly growing mobile games market. It added that 60 % of King\u2019s players were female, and that the combined company would have more than 500 million monthly active users across the world. King floated on the New York Stock Exchange in March last year with a valuation of almost $8bn, making it the most valuable British business of the tech craze. Candy Crush had become wildly popular, racking up a billion plays a day on smartphones for the company, based in London\u2019s West End. But the confectionery-themed game, in which players must make lines of sweets disappear from a grid by lining up three or more of the same colour, was no longer a top 10 download at the time of flotation. King\u2019s shares fell on their first day of trading as traders decided it was a one-product company, even though the business has 200 games. The game still makes up about a third of King\u2019s revenues and the shares have never got back to the $22.50 they were sold for. The sale to Activision Blizzard means those who bought at the time of flotation have made a loss. The flotation made multimillionaires on paper of the company\u2019s leadership team, including Morris, but their fortunes were tied up in shares. The British entrepreneur used his wealth to become the sole owner of Derby County, his local football club, in September after selling almost 2% of King. At the time of the flotation, Morris\u2019s stake had a paper value of about $875m. Chief operating officer Stephane Kurgan and chief creative officer Sebastian Knutsson will receive $150m and $309m respectively. Zacconi and his team will run King as a separate business within Activision Blizzard. He said: \u201cWe will combine our expertise in mobile and free-to-play with Activision Blizzard\u2019s world-class brands and proven track record of building and sustaining the most successful franchises, to bring the best games in the world to millions of players worldwide.\u201d Sweet returns The takeover is the second time Morris, 59, has made millions from the sale of a technology business. The self-made tycoon left school at 16 and by 20 he was working as a management consultant. After a spell in the US, Morris, moved back to his home town of Derby. Already a serial entrepreneur with a hardwood flooring company and a Spanish property business, in 1998 he turned his matchmaking agency into an internet dating site, uDate, the sale of which netted him \u00a320m four years later. Morris spent some of that money on a stake in Derby County, later sold, and part of it on establishing King Digital. He was persuaded to invest by Zacconi, who had worked at uDate. Toby Rowland, the son of the Lonrho tycoon Tiny Rowland, who helped run the dating site, also put money into King. Now Morris has bought all of Derby County. He acquired 22% of his boyhood club in May last year after the Championship play-off defeat to Queens Park Rangers. Morris, worth \u00a3400m according to the Sunday Times Rich List, stood down as chairman of King after its flotation but kept a stake of about 12%, most of which he has kept. Zacconi is an Italian former management consultant who joined the digital industry during the dotcom boom of the late 90s. He missed out on a potential fortune when Spray, the Swedish web portal he worked at, delayed its flotation and the dotcom bubble burst. At the sale price of $18 a share for King, his stake is worth $561m. Knutsson cofounded Spray, where he met Zacconi. He claims to have designed most of King\u2019s worst games but he struck gold when Candy Crush emerged from his Stockholm studio. He banks $309m at the announced sale price. Kurgan, who is Belgian and has an MBA from France\u2019s elite Insead, joined King from Tideway, a data-centre management business. His stake is worth approximately $150m. Rowland has missed out on the bonanza. He sold his shares back to King in 2011 for $3m\u2013 nice money but a fraction of the $900m his stake would have been worth when the business floated.",

    "webTitle": "National living wage is a gamble, says CBI boss", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The head of Britain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 organisation on Tuesday described the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d as a gamble and warned it would speed up the replacement of workers by machines if business found it too expensive. John Cridland, outgoing director general of the CBI, said it was a \u201cbig ask\u201d for firms that employed large numbers of low-paid staff to raise wages by 5% a year to \u00a39 an hour by 2020. He added that an unintended consequence of a laudable aim might be a \u201clabour light\u201d service sector. In a wide-ranging valedictory interview marking the end of five years running the CBI and a career at the business lobby group that has spanned 33 years, Cridland was also critical of the government\u2019s education strategy and its slow response to providing help for the UK\u2019s energy-intensive manufacturers, such as steel. The CBI director general, who steps down after the lobby group\u2019s annual conference next week, said: \u201cWhat I am proudest of is sitting on the Low Pay Commission in April 1999 when one million low paid workers got a 25% pay rise and not one of them lost their jobs as a result. That was because the minimum wage was set at the right level. \u201cThe national living wage of \u00a39 an hour is a laudable objective. The increase to \u00a37.20 next April looks OK, but you can\u2019t guarantee what will happen in the next four years. Increasing wages by 5% a year for four years will result in 25% of people being on the national living wage,\u201d he said. Cridland added that Osborne\u2019s policy could result in employees being squeezed out by technology. \u201cThe national living wage is a gamble. If the government pushes up wages too fast and more quickly than business can accommodate, then business will take out people and replace them with machines.\u201d Cridland said it was not in the best interests of the economy or of low-paid workers to have a \u201clabour light service sector that results in forced productivity through a decline in the number of staff working in shops, restaurants and hotels\u201d. On Monday the voluntary living wage, set annually by the Living Wage Foundation and based on the cost of living in the UK, was increased by 40p to \u00a38.25 an hour outside London and by 25p to \u00a39.40 an hour in the capital. Cridland said while the economy had recovered after its longest and deepest postwar recession, it would take time to repair the battered reputation of business. \u201cI think the economy has finally healed. The recovery is soundly and fairly deeply rooted. One third of the growth is coming from business investment. The last time it healed like this was 20 years ago almost to the month. George Osborne is in the strongest position since 1995,\u201d he said. Cridland said the CBI had become a campaigning organisation as it sought to rebuild the reputation of business after the financial crisis. \u201cThis is a 20-year campaign so that when the Guardian writes about business it is broadly positive. We are not there yet. Business is not totally trusted,\u201d he said. \u201cVW is another corporate scandal. It has really let the side down. There appears to have been a breach of trust with the public. That\u2019s really serious. We need to regain the position where we speak for the consumer. For a company, no amount of corporate social responsibility or volunteering matters if its core business doesn\u2019t pass muster. I believe business is a force for good. Most businesses pay a fair share of tax and try to do the right thing.\u201d Cridland said Britain\u2019s education system was failing too many children and was a \u201cdrag anchor\u201d on the economy. \u201cI\u2019m a working-class lad. I passed the 11-plus and went to a state grammar school. I owe a lot to that. But a lot of my mates didn\u2019t pass the 11-plus and didn\u2019t have a great education. Forty years later that is still an issue.\u201d He said changes introduced by the coalition in the last parliament had added rigour, and added that while the English baccalaureate was \u201cfine for grammar school children aiming for a place at Russell Group universities\u201d, it wasn\u2019t delivering for those children who \u201cdon\u2019t want to sit in rows learning by rote. For some pupils the only thing that has changed in the last 40 years is that the blackboard has been replaced by a whiteboard.\u201d The outgoing CBI director general said he wanted four changes to the education system: careers guidance at the start of secondary school; high quality vocational and technical education along German lines to be provided from 14; an end to \u201cthe exam factory\u201d by abolishing GCSEs; and a single test for all pupils at 18 with equal parity for academic and non-academic courses. Ministers had been talking about a plan to help energy-intensive companies for two years, with negotiations dragging on in Brussels about whether help would be compatible with Europe\u2019s state aid rules. \u201cThe prime minister now says the package will apply retrospectively,\u201d Cridland says. \u201cBut the Germans have provided more support and other countries have been pushier than the UK.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The head of Britain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 organisation on Tuesday described the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d as a gamble and warned it would speed up the replacement of workers by machines if business found it too expensive.</p> <p>John Cridland, outgoing director general of the CBI, said it was a \u201cbig ask\u201d for firms that employed large numbers of low-paid staff to raise wages by 5% a year to \u00a39 an hour by 2020. He added that an unintended consequence of a laudable aim might be a \u201clabour light\u201d service sector.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/31/living-wage-fairer-society-peoples-movement\">The fight for a living wage will not be won in parliament, but in a shop near you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a wide-ranging valedictory interview marking the end of five years running the CBI and a career at the business lobby group that has spanned 33 years, Cridland was also critical of the government\u2019s education strategy and its slow response to providing help for the UK\u2019s energy-intensive manufacturers, such as steel.</p> <p>The CBI director general, who steps down after the lobby group\u2019s annual conference next week, said: \u201cWhat I am proudest of is sitting on the Low Pay Commission in April 1999 when one million low paid workers got a 25% pay rise and not one of them lost their jobs as a result. That was because the minimum wage was set at the right level.</p> <p>\u201cThe national living wage of \u00a39 an hour is a laudable objective. The increase to \u00a37.20 next April looks OK, but you can\u2019t guarantee what will happen in the next four years. Increasing wages by 5% a year for four years will result in 25% of people being on the national living wage,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Cridland added that Osborne\u2019s policy could result in employees being squeezed out by technology. \u201cThe national living wage is a gamble. If the government pushes up wages too fast and more quickly than business can accommodate, then business will take out people and replace them with machines.\u201d<br></p> <p>Cridland said it was not in the best interests of the economy or of low-paid workers to have a \u201clabour light service sector that results in forced productivity through a decline in the number of staff working in shops, restaurants and hotels\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/02/living-wage-rises-further-above-national-living-wage\">On Monday the voluntary living wage</a>, set annually by the <a href=\"http://www.livingwage.org.uk/\">Living Wage Foundation</a> and based on the cost of living in the UK, was increased by 40p to \u00a38.25 an hour outside London and by 25p to \u00a39.40 an hour in the capital.</p> <p>Cridland said while the economy had recovered after its longest and deepest postwar recession, it would take time to repair the battered reputation of business. \u201cI think the economy has finally healed. The recovery is soundly and fairly deeply rooted. One third of the growth is coming from business investment. The last time it healed like this was 20 years ago almost to the month. George Osborne is in the strongest position since 1995,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Cridland said the CBI had become a campaigning organisation as it sought to rebuild the reputation of business after the financial crisis. \u201cThis is a 20-year campaign so that when the Guardian writes about business it is broadly positive. We are not there yet. Business is not totally trusted,\u201d he said.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/02/living-wage-rises-further-above-national-living-wage\">Living wage rises further above government's 'national living wage'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cVW is another corporate scandal. It has really let the side down. There appears to have been a breach of trust with the public. That\u2019s really serious. We need to regain the position where we speak for the consumer. For a company, no amount of corporate social responsibility or volunteering matters if its core business doesn\u2019t pass muster. I believe business is a force for good. Most businesses pay a fair share of tax and try to do the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>Cridland said Britain\u2019s education system was failing too many children and was a \u201cdrag anchor\u201d on the economy. \u201cI\u2019m a working-class lad.
