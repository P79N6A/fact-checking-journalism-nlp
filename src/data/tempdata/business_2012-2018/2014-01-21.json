Growth in emerging market and developing economies will edge up to 5.1% from 4.7% in 2013, Blanchard said.</p> <p>He highlighted risks from deflation in the eurozone and the unwinding of years of ultra-loose monetary policy and stressed the recovery was fragile and by no means equally spread.</p> <p>\"Among advanced economies, it is stronger in the US than in Europe, stronger in the euro core than in Southern Europe. In most advanced economies, unemployment remains much too high.

      "bodyText": "And with that, Matt Damon nipped off to conduct a TV interview, to warm applause from the room. It's easy to be starstruck on these occasions -- but putting that aside, Damon and Gary White made a persuasive case for their campaign. They need support from business leaders and politicians attending Davos -- fingers crossed that they have some success this week. And that's the end of our live blog for this evening (i think!). See you in the morning. GW Another question -- how does water.org guarantee that people who take our microloans can actually be guaranteed a long-term supply of safe water? Gary White explains that Water.org will make loans to people for water cleaning and purification facilities, to help ensure that they make the break from dirty water permanently. My colleague, economics editor Larry Elliott, points out that water charities have traditionally struggled to get major support. How will Damon and White be different? Matt Damon agrees that it's harder than campaigning on an issue such as HIV, where everyone knows someone who has been touched by the issue. But those of us lucky enough to live in the first world DO have experience of dealing with diarrhea in our children -- that's a small taste of what people who don't have clean water are suffering from. Damon adds that: We are in the middle of trying to figure out right now how to.... explain the issue, and get people how to care. He even held a mock press conference last year, saying he was going on a toilet strike, to bring more attention to the issue. Onto questions -- and Matt Damon is asked who Water.org will be targeting at Davos. There's lots of people who can help us, he replies. And he won't be taking to the slopes this week, as he's got a broken collarbone. Now Gary White, CEO of Water.org, is explaining how the initiative is changing lives in the developing world. He cites the example of a mother of five children who paid 1,200 rupees per month for an inadequate water supply. She then took a microloan from Water.org, which will be repaid at 1,200 rupees per month for two years. After two years, she'll be free and clear, says White, adding: We can solve this crisis, as Matt said, we can do it in our lifetimes. I've gone from helping to dig wells that bring water to a few hundred people to getting two million people onto a clean water supply through Water.org, Matt Damon says. We absolutely can solve this problem...and we are looking for help and support from people in Davos today. Every 20 seconds, a little kid under the age of five dies because they can't get clean water, says Matt Damon. He says he started his involvement after travelling in the developing world and seeing how much need there was for water wells. But it became clear that wells weren't enough -- so Damon and co-founder Gary White decided to launch a campaign to give loans to get a faucet into people's homes. 98% of those loans are repaid, he says. Previously, families and communities had to pay punitive repayments to get a water connection. As Damon puts it: They were paying more for their water than we pay for our water. We're watching a video explaining how Water.org is fighting the water crisis by using 'water credits' or loans to needy households who don't have a clean supply of water or functional toilet facilities. This works, he says, and when the loans are paid back the resources are redistributed to other families in need. Eventually, Damon believes, the water crisis can be addressed. Hello again. We're at a drinks reception in the Davos Hilton hotel, held for Matt Damon and his colleagues at Water.org -- the initiative to bring clean water to more people in the developing world. WEF delegates are scattering across Davos to various seminars, parties and briefings, so I'm going to pause the blog now... There may be more tonight, if not we'll be back in the morning.... GW PwC also held a press conference to discuss its survey of CEOs (see last post) - Jill Treanor tweets the key points, including PwC's boss admitting that businesses have a hard fight to rebuild public trust. Apparently CEOs also want the tax system reformed -- something critics of corporate tax avoidance could also support! While the WEF congress hall was digesting Pope Francis's stark message (and being entertained by the excellent Mariinsky Orchestra), accountancy firm PwC was releasing its annual survey of CEOs. It found they were more confident than last year, but also rather worried about regulation strangling their firms, and the danger posed by high government debt levels. Here's the full story: Davos 2014: bosses see a half-full glass \u2013 for now Perhaps the most important section of Pope Francis's message to Davos is that the world needs \"a renewed, profound and broadened sense of responsibility on the part of all\". (and by all, he's clearly addressing business execs and world leaders who have travelled to the snowy ski resort for this week's Forum.) The Pontiff didn't pull many punches, by pointing out that \"it is intolerable that thousands of people continue to die every day from hunger, even though substantial quantities are available and wasted\". Pope Francis also railed against the treatment of refugees, saying that it was impossible not be moved by the plight of those who seek \"minimally dignified living conditions\", and who are not only turned away but perish moving place to place. That's a nod towards the ongoing crisis in Syria, which is expected to be a big issue this week. He went on to say that those who have used their talents and expertise to innovate (and who have already benefited people this way) can do more to help those suffering in \"dire poverty\". And on the crucial issue of inequality, the Pope called for decisions, mechanisms and processes directed to a better distribution of wealth, the creation of sources of employment, and an integral promotion of the poor that goes beyond a simple welfare mentality. As one delegate remarked afterwards \"that put it to them\". The Pope's message is online here (as a pdf). Here's another key quote from the message which Pope Francis sent to attendees at the World Economic Forum, urging world leaders and top business people to reflect more deeply on the causes of the financial crisis. The Pope said: The growth of equality \u2026 calls for decisions, mechanisms and processes directed to a better distribution of wealth, the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor, which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality,\u201d he said. It was delivered by Cardinal Peter Turkson, President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace a few minutes ago. I'm sitting in the hall, and the message appeared to capture the attention of everyone packed in here. Now Matt Damon is on stage, collecting a Crystal Award for his work with water.org. The Hollywood star begins by pretending to give a Golden Globe speech (apparently it's a humdinger, but alas he didn't get to deliver it this year). More seriously, Damon explains that he and the co-founders of water.org began the initiative because they couldn't believe that hundreds of millions of people were unable to access clean water. They are at Davos to try to drum up more support for their initiative, which they believe could help 100 million people by 2020. Damon tells the hall that: We are just getting started, and we need you on board. Access to water is important, but its only the start - he adds. It leads to demand for education, for example. To summarise, the key message from the Pope is that Davos must make serious progress on fixing the economic system, and that business leaders must become more focused on fixing the world's problems. It's a big ask. Pope Francis's message continues, by urging attendees at WEF to recognise that: We need a new, profound, sense of responsibility on behalf of all. Business is a vocation, a noble vocations, as long as those involved feel challenged by a meaning in life. Those people can serve us all for the common good, he says. Progress is about more than economic growth, the Pope's envoy continues. We can only all benefit from business if its leaders are looking to serve us all, rather than to simply serve themselves. Now, Pope Francis's envoy is taking to the stage, with a message from the pontiff himself. The pope thanks Klaus Schwab and WEF for offering him an invitation (he's not able to attend, alas). He adde that he \"hopes it will provide an opportunity for deeper reflection on the causes of the economic crisis\" that has hit the world in recent years. The Message continues that we must praise the steps being taken to improve people's welfare in education, communications, and many other areas of human activity. And we must recognise the role that modern business activity has had in creating these opportunities. But we cannot ignore the suffering in the world, he warns, and often important issues of human suffering are \" little more than an afterthought\" to business leaders. Those in positions of power have a special responsibility to those less fortunate than themselves, he says. It is intolerable that so many people around the globe still die from hunger today. The opening ceremony of this year's WEF is underway in Davos right now (writes Graeme Wearden from the congress hall). Klaus Schwab, the founder and driving force of the event, is on stage now -- offering a \"Really cordial welcome to the 44th World Economic Forum.\" He's telling delegates (from excellencies and world leaders down to friends) to bring four things to make this year's event a success -- their brains, their souls, their hearts, and their \"good nerves\". Dusk has fallen in Davos, and the place is starting to fill up with delegates for the WEF, writes Graeme Wearden. Security guards are on the streets directing bumper-to-bumper cars - and redirecting anyone who tries to defy the strict traffic rules. WEF kicks off soon with tonight's opening ceremony and the Crystal awards to, among others, Matt Damon. And speaking of Davos attendees, our own representatives have safely arrived: From Bono and Matt Damon to Manchester United chairman Avie Glazer and the Duke of York, here are all the attendees at Davos in our interactive datablog: Who's doing Davos this year? Wall Street has opened lower after the long weekend (US markets were shut on Monday for Martin Luther King day), taking the shine off what was looking like a positive day elsewhere. It seems to be the prospect of further tapering by the US Federal Reserve which is doing the damage. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 57 points or 0.3%, which has helped knock European indices off the day's highs and has pushed the FTSE 100 into negative territory. Cue \"Davos goes to the dogs\" jokes, and the envy of those scrabbling around for authorisation badges: The UK recovery appears to be sustainable, IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard has told journalists. This is a remarkable change of tune for Blanchard. Katie Allen writes: In a damning indictment of George Osborne's austerity drive last year, he said the chancellor was playing with fire. Today he has unveiled a much higher growth forecast for the UK - 2.4%, rather than 1.9% forecast in October - and he tells reporters the recovery does appear to be sustainable. That is a little at odds with remarks from the Office for Budget Responsibility, which compiles forecasts for the government, that the UK remains too reliant on consumer spending. Explaining the IMF's move to upgrade the UK's growth outlook by more than any other advanced economy, Blanchard said that six months ago domestic spending was weak. But consumers had surprised the fund's economists on the upside. \"Investment is still not doing as well\", he noted but \"many signals are good... so yes, we think this growth can continue for some time.\" More preparations for Davos, as participants begin to arrive. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's chief economist, has been taking questions on a call with journalists on the fund's latest economic forecasts. Katie Allen writes: Asked about the Bank of England's forward guidance policy, he said: \"we do think it's appropriate. As we know the British economy is experiencing stronger than expected momentum\". The fund has highlighted the withdrawal of exceptional monetary stimulus from central banks around the world as a key risk to the global recovery. Blanchard's colleague, Thomas Helbling, praised the Bank of England's inclusion of financial stability considerations in the forward guidance scheme and its vow to look at financial risk factors from policy. The other risk flagged up by the IMF was the threat of deflation. Blanchard told reporters there were two places in the world where this was a concern. Firstly, Japan \"because it has a history of deflation\" but this was not a big worry right now. \"The part of the world where we worry more is the eurozone where you have a recpvery in the core but you have very weak demand in the south.\" He said the important thing for central bankers was to anchor price expectations and to do whatever possible to sustain demand to counter the threat of deflation. The Treasury welcomed the IMF's increased forecast for UK growth this year but shadow chancellor Ed Balls was predictably less impressed. Here's his response: After three damaging years of flatlining, any growth is both welcome and long overdue. But this is the slowest recovery for 100 years and working people are facing a cost-of-living crisis with real wages now down \u00a31600 a year under David Cameron. With business investment still weak and the IMF forecasting that UK growth will slow down again next year, it\u2019s clear that this is not yet a recovery that is built to last. Simply to catch up all the lost ground since 2010 we need 1.5 per cent growth each quarter between now and the election. Instead of more complacency from George Osborne we need Labour\u2019s plan to secure a stronger recovery and earn our way to higher living standards for the many, not just a few at the top. That means reforms to our banks and energy market, expanding free childcare to make work pay, a compulsory jobs guarantee and a plan to build 200,000 new homes a year. And on that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Global economic recovery will quicken this year but stay \"weak and uneven\", the International Monetary Fund's top economist has said. Commenting on the IMF's World Economic Outlook, the fund's chief economist Olivier Blanchard said global growth would pick up to 3.7% in 2014 from 3% last year but that there were still plenty of risks for the recovery. Blanchard said the IMF had raised its UK growth forecast to 2.4% for this year, from a previous forecast of 1.9%. The upgrade \u2013 the biggest for a G7 country \u2013 is a small victory for George Osborne because Blanchard warned last year that the chancellor's austerity drive was too risky. Here's an excerpt from our story by Katie Allen: The forecast for global growth was barely changed from 3.6% pencilled in last October when the IMF published its closely watched World Economic Outlook (WEO). \"The brakes to the recovery are progressively being loosened. The drag from fiscal consolidation is diminishing. The financial system is slowly healing. Uncertainty is decreasing,\" said Blanchard, unveiling the fund's latest update to the WEO forecasts. The Washington-based fund also stuck by its view that growth in advanced economies would accelerate markedly this year, to 2.2% from 1.3% in 2013. Growth in emerging market and developing economies will edge up to 5.1% from 4.7% in 2013, Blanchard said. He highlighted risks from deflation in the eurozone and the unwinding of years of ultra-loose monetary policy and stressed the recovery was fragile and by no means equally spread. \"Among advanced economies, it is stronger in the US than in Europe, stronger in the euro core than in Southern Europe. In most advanced economies, unemployment remains much too high. And downside risks remain,\" Blanchard said. Blanchard welcomed a slowdown in the UK austerity process: \"Conditions are increasingly favourable in the UK and the euro core. Public debts are on sustainable paths, and fiscal consolidation is, rightly, slowing down. Credit conditions are favourable,\" Blanchard said. The Treasury welcomed the UK upgrade, which was the largest for any of the the advanced G7 countries. \"Today's report provides further evidence that the government's long term economic plan is working,\" a spokesman said. \"But the job is not yet done and so the government will go on taking the difficult decisions necessary to deliver a sustainable recovery for all.\" The IMF's 2.4% forecast for the UK is the same as the outlook frombusiness group the CBI and the Office for Budget Responsibility, which publishes independent forecasts for the government. The British Chambers of Commerce is more optimistic and expects 2.7% growth. After all its travails of recent years, Ireland remains the fifth priciest country in the EU. It costs more to live there than the UK and Germany but disposable income is on the up. Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, reports from Dublin: Ireland is still the fifth most expensive country in the EU with prices higher than the UK, Holland and even Europe's powerhouse economy, Germany, new figures reveal today. Despite a five year long recession, the cost of living crisis in the Republic goes on with prices 15 per cent above the EU average. The Irish Central Statistics Office confirms today that while Irish prices have fallen from being the second highest in Europe before the 2008 crash, consumers are still paying far more for goods and services than most of their EU counterparts except those in high-tax, affluent Scandinavia and Luxembourg. These latest CSO figures in their \u201cMeasuring Ireland's Progress Report 2012\u201d also confirm that, even though Ireland has left the IMF-EU bailout and rating agencies have predicted the economy will grow in 2014, Irish unemployment remains the fifth highest in Europe. The jobless rate is due to factors such as the crash in the Irish construction industry which during the crisis years between 2008 and 2012 made up 60 per cent of all jobs lost in Ireland during the recession. Back to Irish prices in the High Street, the forecourt, the shopping centre and the pub, it seems consumers at least have an extra \u20ac49 to spend each month. Irish disposable income has increased by an average of almost fifty euros according to a survey released today by the Irish League of Credit Unions. The report on the \u201cWhat's Left Tracker\u201d found by the end of 2013 that there had been a gradual recovery in family finances. The Credit Union survey also reveals that 44 per cent of Irish adults are now likely to save some money every month - up by 13 per cent compared to last year. But Irish not only face the 5th highest prices in Europe, around seven out of ten of them owe money on their credit card and one third use their cards to get the basic essentials each month. After a gruelling Christmas, there's not much relief in store for Britain's big food retailers, according to ratings agency Moody's. In a report on the sector, its analysts pick Tesco and Morrisons as chains that could suffer from continued pressure on household finances despite signs of economic recovery. Yasmina Serghini-Douvin, Moody's analyst who wrote the report, said: We anticipate pressure on UK consumer spending to only ease in the latter part of the year as economic growth gradually improves. In the meantime, price conscious consumers will remain attracted to promotions and hard discounters, and are unlikely to increase their average spend. This is likely to result in downward pressure on many UK food retailers' sales and margins for much of 2014. So while manufacturing activity picks up, consumers are going to stay constrained. Material there for visitors to Davos to ponder ahead of the IMF's revised forecast for UK and global growth, due in less than an hour. Simmering tensions boil over at the Treasury committee. Labour's John Mann has had a go at chairman Andrew Tyrie, who's a Conservative. Here's the FT's Sharlene Goff: A severe storm is about to hit Washington DC, so the International Monetary Fund has switched its planned press briefing to a conference call. The fund's top economists will be on the phone at 2:30pm UK time as planned to set out revised forecasts for the world economy. With up to 11 inches of snow predicted and all federal offices closed for the day, hats off to the IMF for persevering. While I was writing about the WEF's seven digital principles, Reuters snapped that Gary Hoffman told MPs he was approached about joining the Co-op Bank during the attempted sale of the Lloyds branches. Just to recap, Hoffman was chief executive of NBNK, which was competing with the Co-op to buy the branches. The plot thickens. Here's a taster of the kind of thing they might be talking about at Davos. The World Economic Forum, which hosts the event, has published \"seven principles for adapting to the new digital world\". The principles are meant to increase understanding and agreement about who owns what content on the web \u2013 and they're going to be tested in the UK and Indonesia. Here's what Ofcom head Ed Richards thinks: There is a complex coordination challenge here; it is a global issue with a lot of players and conflicting economic incentives. To move forward, there often needs to be a neutral party holding the ring. Couldn't be clearer. After a short break, Lord Levene and Gary Hoffman are back giving evidence at the Treasury committee. Levene has already sounded fed up with the former Lloyds chairman, Sir Win Bischoff. Now he says he personally handed Bischoff an analysis of the flaws in the Co-op's bid for Lloyds branches. At an earlier session, Bischoff said he didn't recall seeing any such document. Levene's main gripe is that Lloyds favoured the Co-op because there was political pressure to sell the branches to a mutually owned lender, which was an idea in favour at the time. He claimed earlier in the session that former Bank of England governor Baron Mervyn King told him his suspicions were well founded. The Telegraph's Harry Wilson thinks it's heavy stuff: Another positive forecast for the Davos crowd to chew over. The International Energy Agency has increased its forecast for Opec oil demand this year by 200,000 barrels per day to 29.4m bpd. Demand for oil will increase along with economic growth, particularly in developed markets, the IEA said. \"Global oil demand growth appears to have gradually gained momentum in the last 18 months, driven by economic recovery in the developed world,\" the IEA said in its monthly report. Jack Allen and Martin Beck at Capital Economics have put out a quick reaction to the CBI's industrial trends survey. They're encouraged: The CBI Industrial Trends Survey for January and Q1 provided grounds for optimism on the pace and balance of the manufacturing recovery... The quarterly orders balances (past and expected) both rose. And even though the business optimism balance fell slightly from +24 in Q4 to +21 in Q1, it is still consistent with strong annual growth in manufacturing output of 5% or more. The survey\u2019s investment and export indicators were encouraging for the composition of growth. Two of the survey\u2019s investment intentions balances rose sharply, while the third remained well above its long-run average. And the quarterly export optimism balance remained fairly high at +8 (compared to -11 a year earlier), despite sterling\u2019s recent strength. In all, then, the survey gave signs that the economic recovery is set to broaden beyond household consumption to investment and exports. Good news for the Chancellor as Davos gets underway. The CBI has just published an optimistic quarterly survey of UK manufacturing. Here's the top paragraph from the press release: Growth in new manufacturing orders was the strongest since April 2011, according to the latest CBI quarterly Industrial Trends Survey. In the three months to January 2014, domestic orders rose, uncertainty about demand fell and investment intentions for the year ahead picked up.\" Lord Levene told MPs earlier that he lost \u00a360,000 from his NBNK vehicle's failed bid for more than 600 Lloyds branches. Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie finds out that Levene was paid \u00a3300,000 a year as chairman for two years. \"You were \u00a360,000 down and \u00a3600,000 up \u2013 that would have been a more accurate reply wouldn't it?\" Levene points out he had to pay tax and that he could have been doing another job instead. Former Northern Rock boss Gary Hoffman was paid \u00a3750,000 a year as chief executive of NBNK. Tyrie tots this up to be \u00a31.8m plus a \u00a31.8m golden hello. Hoffman doesn't argue with the figures. Carsten Brzeski at ING reckons the German Zew survey is good news for Europe's biggest economy: The ZEW index, which measures investors\u2019 confidence, decreased slightly and now stands at 61.7, from 62.0 in December. At the same time, investors have become significantly more positive on the current economic situation. The current assessment component accelerated to 41.2, from 32.4 in December. The strong equity market, the smooth tapering announcement and the possibility of further ECB action have clearly kept German investors in a positive mood. Lord Levene is appearing at the Treasury Select Committee to give his version of the \"project verde\" process to sell more than 600 Lloyds Banking Group branches. Levene, the former chairman of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, tried to buy the branches to launch a new bank but he was rejected in favour of the Co-op Bank. The Co-op's bid fell apart last year and Levene has been fuming since. He's started in forthright form, telling MPs the process was handled in bad faith. Here's the Telegraph's Harry Wilson: The Zew survey of investor and analyst sentiment is out. The index for economic sentiment fell slightly to 61.7 from last month's 62.0 but the current conditions index has jumped to a 20-month high of 41.2, ahead of expectations for a reading of 34.1. Reuters reports that the news caused the euro to fall against the dollar. Here's a tweet from Markit Economics: Aha. It looks like takeover talk is behind the rise in Standard Chartered's shares - up almost 3% and second only to Unilever on the FTSE 100 leader board. The FT has published an article suggesting the Asia-focused bank's recent mishaps and falling share price could finally spur a rival such as Australia's ANZ to make a bid for its prized emerging markets operations. Then again, people have been waiting for that to happen for 15 years or more. As leaders try to look forward at Davos, here in the UK we're still going over old ground. More than five years after Bradford &amp; Bingley came close to collapse, the Financial Reporting Council has launched an investigation into the bank's former finance director Chris Willford. The decision by the regulator, which oversees corporate reporting and auditing, follows the Financial Conduct Authority's \u00a330,000 fine for Willford last month for failing to update the bank's board about its worsening financial position in 2008. SAB Miller appears to be echoing Unilever's glum comments on consumer spending in developed markets. The brewer's third-quarter sales were up, powered by strong growth in Asia, Africa and other emerging regions. But in Europe sales fell. North America net producer revenue rose 1% but sales to retailers dropped. Struggling consumers in mature markets aren't drowning their sorrows in Peroni, Coors or Grolsch in great numbers, it seems. SAB Miller's chief executive Alan Clark said: The combination of pricing and volume growth, particularly in Africa, Latin America and China, supported net producer revenue growth of 4%. This was in spite of continued weakness in consumer sentiment, which particularly impacted our European and North American businesses.\" SAB Miller shares were down more than 2% on the news at 9:10am. Unilever did well in emerging markets but apparent economic recovery doesn't seem to have done much for sales of Domestos and Viennetta in developed countries. Here's Sky's Joel Hills' tweet: On top of whatever comes out of Davos and the IMF's updated forecasts, we're also expecting keenly watched surveys on the health of the UK, eurozone and German economies. The CBI releases its industrial trends survey at 11am, which will give a snapshot of the state of British manufacturing. Markets are hoping for improved results from the Zew surveys of eurozone and German business confidence. The FTSE 100 is up in early trading, benefiting from action overnight by the People's Bank of China to relieve the squeeze on interbank lending. The Chinese central bank intervened to bring down interbank lending rates, which were pushed up by consumers withdrawing cash for New Year, Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets said. This may help explain the strong showing for Standard Chartered, the UK bank that makes most of its money in Asia. The index is up more than six points at 6843. Investors like what they hear from Unilever. The maker of Pot Noodle, Dove soap and Vaseline's shares are up more than 4% in early trading, leading the FTSE 100 gainers. Underlying sales were up 4.1% in the fourth quarter compared with analysts' consensus of 3.9%. Equivalent sales rose 8.4% in emerging markets. Chief executive Paul Polman said the company had produced another year of solid growth and prepared for further cost cuts. We anticipate ongoing volatility in the external environment and are positioning Unilever accordingly. Although the investments we have made over the last five years ensure that we are well placed, we are determined to make Unilever even more agile and to fund further growth opportunities by driving out complexity and cost. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and the business world. The World Economic Forum's annual meeting of financial and political leaders starts this evening at its usual venue - the Swiss ski resort of Davos. Many of the leading figures in finance will spend the day trekking across Switzerland to reach the remote town in time for this evening's opening dinner. This year's theme is: The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business. Technology is creating huge social change, \"shifting power from traditional hierarchies to networked heterarchies\" but international leaders are still in crisis mode, the meeting's blurb says. The aim is to use the meeting to figure out a response to what's going on. To coincide with the start of Davos, the IMF is set to publish its latest World Economic Outlook. The widely trailed update on October's figures is expected to upgrade forecasts for global GDP and to increase the estimate for UK economic growth this year. The IMF has been highly critical of UK economic policy in the past so Chancellor George Osborne is likely to use a more upbeat assessment to reinforce his recent theme that the coalition's \"economic plan is working\". On the UK front, the big company reporting today is Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant. Unilever published its first profit warning for many years in October but Paul Kavanagh at Killik &amp; Co is calmed by today's numbers.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Paul Polman, chief of consumer goods group, backs reform but says European Union is good for business and UK economy", 
      "body": "<p>The UK would be better off staying inside the European Union \"than kicking against the table\" and voting to leave, the boss of one of the world's largest consumer goods companies has said.</p> <p>Paul Polman, the Dutch chief executive of the consumer multinational Unilever, said the company could review its UK investment if Britain left the EU.</p> <p>\"We will always look at things,\" he said, when asked whether Unilever could reduce its presence in the UK. Unilever employs 7,000 people in the UK, which is a net exporter to the EU for its business.</p> <p>\"We are a positive contributor in that sense to the UK economy and we [would] have to look at that then for the UK v&#xa0;Europe, just like we do in any other country that is not in the EU.\"</p> <p>Being in the EU was good for business and for the UK economy, he said, although Europe needed to raise its game as a place to do business. \"We are very concerned about the overall competitiveness of Europe vis-a-vis the rest of the world.\"</p> <p>Polman said he supported EU reform but added that the debate was simplistic. \"We tend to forget all the good things that the common market has brought, also to Britain, and take that for granted and then only focus on the things that need to be changed and portraying that as bad.\"</p> <p>He was speaking as Unilever surprised the City with better than expected results for 2013. The company reported net profit of \u20ac5.3bn (\u00a34.4bn) for 2013, up 9% on last year, sending its share price up 2.5%.</p> <p>The maker of PG Tips tea, Dove shampoo and Magnum ice-creams, reported global sales growth of 4.3%. Sales in emerging markets, where Unilever makes 60% of its turnover, grew at 8.7% \u2013 a slower rate than in previous years. But Unilever faces bigger problems in Europe, where sales are still falling in several countries, and recovery looks distant.</p> <p>\"We are still well below the lines of 2009 in many of the countries and we still have a lot of deleveraging to do,\" said Polman. \"In an environment where markets don't grow, where costs go up, you are not going to hire people.\"</p> <p>He also admitted that Unilever had been slow to react to changing market conditions in rich countries, where consumers are abandoning mid-market retailers for discount items and premium brands. Unilever was now focusing across the \"price piano\", he said, with a broader range of products, from Sara Lee frozen desserts at one end, to premium products, such as upmarket teas and Toni &amp; Guy haircare.</p> <p>Dismissing criticisms that Unilever had too many products, Polman said the company now had a \"very focused portfolio\", although future sell-offs could not be ruled out. Some categories, notably margarines, are still struggling. Consumers' appetite for spreads, such as Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, continues to decline, as people reassess the health warnings on butter.</p> <h2><strong>Skin lighteners 'like sun lotion'</strong></h2> <p>Skin-whitening creams are no different to tanning products, Unilever's chief executive, Paul Polman, said, in defence of his firm's controversial \"fairness products\" that have been at centre of racism rows in India and Thailand.</p> <p>Unilever's Fair &amp; Lovely skin cream has come under more scrutiny in India since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/aug/14/indias-dark-obsession-fair-skin\" title=\"\">the Bollywood star Nandita Das launched her campaign Dark is Beautiful</a> last year. Unilever's Thai business is behind Citra Pearly White UV body lotion, which stoked a heated debate over racism when its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/27/thailand-racism-unilever-skin-whitening-cream-citra\" title=\"\">advertising appeared to link skin colour to intelligence</a>.</p> <p>Polman said the products should be seen in a similar way to tanning products in Europe. \"We all like to walk around with tanning products and that's OK. In that part of the world they have fairness products, which are also skincare products and there is a need for that and consumers want that,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Products like Fair &amp; Lovely are very important products in Indian society that people appreciate. [They] not only provide the fairness but also take care of the skin There are a lot more benefits in climates that are quite harsh.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It's the same as deodorants. We don't like people to walk around with body smell, but the whole world did before deodorants were invented. That is what you have. You give people choices.\"</p> <p>He admitted however that some ads had \"not passed local standards\".

      "bodyText": "The UK would be better off staying inside the European Union \"than kicking against the table\" and voting to leave, the boss of one of the world's largest consumer goods companies has said. Paul Polman, the Dutch chief executive of the consumer multinational Unilever, said the company could review its UK investment if Britain left the EU. \"We will always look at things,\" he said, when asked whether Unilever could reduce its presence in the UK. Unilever employs 7,000 people in the UK, which is a net exporter to the EU for its business. \"We are a positive contributor in that sense to the UK economy and we [would] have to look at that then for the UK v Europe, just like we do in any other country that is not in the EU.\" Being in the EU was good for business and for the UK economy, he said, although Europe needed to raise its game as a place to do business. \"We are very concerned about the overall competitiveness of Europe vis-a-vis the rest of the world.\" Polman said he supported EU reform but added that the debate was simplistic. \"We tend to forget all the good things that the common market has brought, also to Britain, and take that for granted and then only focus on the things that need to be changed and portraying that as bad.\" He was speaking as Unilever surprised the City with better than expected results for 2013. The company reported net profit of \u20ac5.3bn (\u00a34.4bn) for 2013, up 9% on last year, sending its share price up 2.5%. The maker of PG Tips tea, Dove shampoo and Magnum ice-creams, reported global sales growth of 4.3%. Sales in emerging markets, where Unilever makes 60% of its turnover, grew at 8.7% \u2013 a slower rate than in previous years. But Unilever faces bigger problems in Europe, where sales are still falling in several countries, and recovery looks distant. \"We are still well below the lines of 2009 in many of the countries and we still have a lot of deleveraging to do,\" said Polman. \"In an environment where markets don't grow, where costs go up, you are not going to hire people.\" He also admitted that Unilever had been slow to react to changing market conditions in rich countries, where consumers are abandoning mid-market retailers for discount items and premium brands. Unilever was now focusing across the \"price piano\", he said, with a broader range of products, from Sara Lee frozen desserts at one end, to premium products, such as upmarket teas and Toni &amp; Guy haircare. Dismissing criticisms that Unilever had too many products, Polman said the company now had a \"very focused portfolio\", although future sell-offs could not be ruled out. Some categories, notably margarines, are still struggling. Consumers' appetite for spreads, such as Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, continues to decline, as people reassess the health warnings on butter. Skin lighteners 'like sun lotion' Skin-whitening creams are no different to tanning products, Unilever's chief executive, Paul Polman, said, in defence of his firm's controversial \"fairness products\" that have been at centre of racism rows in India and Thailand. Unilever's Fair &amp; Lovely skin cream has come under more scrutiny in India since the Bollywood star Nandita Das launched her campaign Dark is Beautiful last year. Unilever's Thai business is behind Citra Pearly White UV body lotion, which stoked a heated debate over racism when its advertising appeared to link skin colour to intelligence. Polman said the products should be seen in a similar way to tanning products in Europe. \"We all like to walk around with tanning products and that's OK. In that part of the world they have fairness products, which are also skincare products and there is a need for that and consumers want that,\" he said. \"Products like Fair &amp; Lovely are very important products in Indian society that people appreciate. [They] not only provide the fairness but also take care of the skin There are a lot more benefits in climates that are quite harsh.\" He added: \"It's the same as deodorants. We don't like people to walk around with body smell, but the whole world did before deodorants were invented. That is what you have. You give people choices.\" He admitted however that some ads had \"not passed local standards\". Unilever Thailand was forced to withdraw its Citra advert for Citra Pearly White last year, after widespread criticism that it appeared to link white skin to intelligence. \u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 22 January.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Business lending fell towards the end of last year as banks continued to squeeze funding to small and medium-sized businesses despite attempts by the Bank of England to boost finance to the sector. Lending figures from the Bank showed businesses paid back \u00a34.3bn more than they borrowed in the three months to the end of November. SMEs were the worst affected by the brake on lending, which appears to have persisted despite the Bank tweaking its Funding for Lending scheme last April to favour loans to smaller businesses. Ministers are likely to be dismayed by the figures, which show a deteriorating trend after net credit contracted by \u00a33.7bn in November alone. The government has succeeded in persuading banks to increase their lending to the mortgage market, which has rocketed in recent months, but has failed to expand the amount of credit going into the corporate sector. While large businesses can access the growing market for debt financing in the bond market, small businesses are reliant on high street banks and specialist finance and leasing businesses, which have become conservative in their lending practices since the 2008 crash. Small firms have consistently reported that credit is either refused or is offered at high prices by the major lenders. The average net monthly flow of lending was only slightly less negative in 2013 through to November than it had been in 2012. It came as the public accounts committee of MPs criticised government departments for running a series of ad hoc schemes to boost lending but failing to build them into a coherent plan. \"There is no common understanding about which parts of the SME sector are generating the most growth and where government support would do most good,\" said the chair of the committee, Margaret Hodge. \"[The business department] intends to give nearly \u00a33 billion of financial support to SMEs between 2011-12 and 2014-15 through its six main schemes. It helped nearly 6,000 firms during the last financial year, but more could have been helped if the department had done more to ensure that SMEs are aware of the potential financing options available to them.\" Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the Bank of England figures would prove a disappointment to the Treasury and BoE, which have made it their mission to expand the amount of credit going into SMEs for investment. \"The further fall in net lending to businesses came despite the latest Bank of England credit conditions survey reporting a \"significant\" increase in credit availability to corporates in the fourth quarter of 2013, with a further increase expected in the first quarter of 2014,\" he said. \"Importantly, credit availability was reported to have increased for smaller companies as well as for larger ones. This increase in credit availability was reported to be due to the improved economic outlook as well as from market share objectives, and competition from capital markets.\" He said the situation could improve this year following \"clear evidence that firms are now looking to step up their borrowing as markedly improved economic activity in recent months lifts their confidence and need for capital.\" Samir Desai, co-founder of peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle pointed out that business lending in total remains a third lower than it was in the first quarter of 2008. Paul Aitken, chief executive of lender borro, said: \"It seems that despite continued efforts from policymakers, small businesses remain locked in a battle for capital, so while 2013 was the year of talking about change \u2013 let's hope 2014 is the year we see it happen.\" He said his own survey of 310 SMEs found that one in five owners said they had missed out on a growth opportunity due to a lack of accessible finance. Two in five SMEs that applied for funds were unsuccessful with a quarter saying they \"wouldn't even bother with the bank in the first place\".",

    "webTitle": "IMF: world economic recovery picking up pace but still weak and uneven", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The global economic recovery will pick up pace this year but remains \"weak and uneven\", the International Monetary Fund's top economist has said. Olivier Blanchard said the \"largely anticipated\" recovery in global growth would see it pick up to 3.7% in 2014 from 3% last year but there was still much work to be done as new risks emerged. In a boost to George Osborne, Blanchard confirmed the IMF had raised its UK growth forecast to 2.4% for this year, from a previous forecast of 1.9%. It was Blanchard, who last year warned Osborne has was playing with fire with his austerity drive, but the forecast for the UK is well ahead of Europe's largest economy, Germany, where growth is forecast at 1.6%. France's economy would grow by a much weaker 0.9% given \"policy uncertainty is weighing on growth\", Blanchard said. The forecast for global growth was barely changed from 3.6% pencilled in last October when the IMF published its closely watched World Economic Outlook (WEO). \"The brakes to the recovery are progressively being loosened. The drag from fiscal consolidation is diminishing. The financial system is slowly healing. Uncertainty is decreasing,\" said Blanchard, unveiling the fund's latest update to the WEO forecasts. The Washington-based fund also stuck by its view that growth in advanced economies would accelerate markedly this year, to 2.2% from 1.3% in 2013. Growth in emerging market and developing economies will edge up to 5.1% from 4.7% in 2013, Blanchard said. He highlighted risks from deflation in the eurozone and the unwinding of years of ultra-loose monetary policy and stressed the recovery was fragile and by no means equally spread. \"Among advanced economies, it is stronger in the US than in Europe, stronger in the euro core than in Southern Europe. In most advanced economies, unemployment remains much too high. And downside risks remain,\" Blanchard said. Blanchard welcomed a slowdown in the UK austerity process: \"Conditions are increasingly favourable in the UK and the euro core. Public debts are on sustainable paths, and fiscal consolidation is, rightly, slowing down. Credit conditions are favourable,\" Blanchard said. The Treasury welcomed the UK upgrade, which was the largest for any of the the advanced G7 countries. \"Today's report provides further evidence that the government's long term economic plan is working,\" a spokesman said. \"But the job is not yet done and so the government will go on taking the difficult decisions necessary to deliver a sustainable recovery for all.\" The IMF's 2.4% forecast for the UK is the same as the outlook from business group the CBI and the Office for Budget Responsibility, which publishes independent forecasts for the government. The British Chambers of Commerce is more optimistic and expects 2.7% growth. Blanchard's summary of conditions around the world highlighted rebalancing challenges for Japan, big concerns about southern Europe and threats to emerging markets from changing monetary policy. Prospects for the world's largest economy, the United States, were improving. \"US growth appears increasingly solid. Private demand is strong. As a result of the December budget agreement, fiscal consolidation, which weighted on growth in 2013, will be more limited in 2014. These factors lead us to forecast 2.8% growth for 2014, compared to 1.9% in 2013,\" he said. Japan's growth is forecast to hold at 1.7% in 2014. \"This is good news. But this growth has come largely from fiscal stimulus and from exports. For growth to be sustained, consumption and investment have to take the relay,\" Blanchard said. Southern Europe continues to be the \"more worrisome part of the world economy\", he said, highlighting strong exports but weak internal demand. For emerging market and developing economies the IMF forecasts growth will remain high but highlighted a risk from US monetary policy. China faced a \"delicate balancing act\" of containing the build up of risks in the financial sector without excessively slowing growth, Blanchard said. Blanchard echoed other economists in highlighting the risks of a return to a more normal monetary policy after years characterised by large scale quantitative easing programmes and ultra-low borrowing costs in many countries. \"We can expect complex capital movements across countries for some time to come. In that environment, the evidence from last year is that emerging market economies with weak macro frameworks may be most affected,\" he said. The second key risk, already flagged earlier this month by the IMF, was in the eurozone where some countries have already slipped into deflation. The lower inflation and the higher the deflation rate, the more dangerous that was for the recovery. \"While our baseline forecasts are for low but positive inflation in the euro area, the risk is that inflation turns into deflation,\" said Blanchard. \"Deflation means higher real interest rates, higher public and private debt burdens, lower demand, lower growth, and further deflation pressure. To avoid that risk, accommodative monetary policy remains of the essence. And so is the strengthening of banks' balance sheets.\" He concluded: \"In short, recovery is indeed strengthening. But much work remains to be done.\"",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are heading towards their highest level since the dotcom boom amid a mixed set of trading updates and a spate of takeover speculation. The FTSE 100 is currently up 9.15 points at 6845.88 - if it closes at this level it will beat the most recent peak on 22 May last year and be the highest since the record close of 6930 on 30 December 1999. News overnight that the People's Bank of China had injected liquidity into the system helped calm fears of a credit crunch in the country. Brenda Kelly, chief market strategist at IG, said: Any waning momentum felt in European indices yesterday has been offset by monetary intervention from the People's Bank of China this morning. An emerging credit crunch in the world's second-biggest economy has become one of the more prominent event risks over the past year. For now, the Chinese authorities appear to be stemming investor concerns. Even news from Fed-watcher Hilsenrath, that the FOMC is likely to continue to shave its asset-purchase programme by an additional $10 billion per month, does not seem to have fazed the bulls. Unilever is leading the way, up 89p at \u00a325.26 following well received results, but SABMiller has lost 30p to \u00a330.64 as weaker beer volumes led to disappointing third quarter sales. Back with the risers, testing group Intertek is 89p higher at \u00a329.97, lifted by a positive update from Swiss peer SGS, which reported rising profits and said it expected revenues to grow over the next three years. Elsewhere Standard Chartered has added 35.5p to 1363.5p on renewed talk its recent share price weakness could leave it vulnerable to a bidder, with Australia's ANZ the latest name added to the list. William Hill has fallen 4p to 358p and rival Ladbrokes 4.3p to 162.4p after JP Morgan cut its price target on both and gave them an underweight rating, based on possible restrictions on gaming machines in betting shops as early as spring or autumn this year. The bank said: Prior to the House of Commons debate on regulatory restrictions on gaming machines on 8 Jan, our initial analysis suggested significant risk to forecasts.

      "bodyText": "The government's business lending schemes have failed to boost the flow of finance to small and medium-sized companies (SMEs), according to an influential committee of MPs. In a report published on Tuesday that raises the alarm over value for money, the public accounts committee criticises the Funding for Lending scheme for its failure to increase banks' appetite to lend, leaving many firms reliant on more costly ways of raising working capital, such as credit cards and overdrafts. Since the government introduced Funding for Lending in mid-2012, loans to business from banks participating in the scheme have fallen by \u00a32.3bn, the committee said. A government spokesperson said the committee's assessment \"does not reflect the reality, which is that credit conditions for SMEs are improving, new lending is being provided and small businesses are being offered cheaper loans rates\". The bleak picture is confirmed by recent data from the Bank of England, which showed that lending to business saw its biggest drop in 32 months, although loans to small firms have picked up. Also under fire were six schemes run by the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills intended to provide \u00a32.85m to small firms by 2015. So far, 5,900 businesses have received financial support, but MPs say take-up could have been better if the department had done more to promote the initiatives. MPs also criticised the \"poor performance\" of equity-support schemes designed to help risky ideas get off the ground: it found that since 2003 government commitments of \u00a3140m had generated returns of just \u00a338m. Margaret Hodge, the chair of the public accounts committee, said departments were unable to demonstrate they were achieving best value for taxpayers' money. With a British Business Bank backed by \u00a31bn of public funds due to launch later this year, Hodge called on the government to tighten up the management of its lending schemes. \"Government must use the establishment of the bank to start managing departmental schemes as a coherent programme, clearly setting out what it wants to achieve, and how each scheme and the programme as a whole will contribute towards the overall objective of making it easier for SMEs to access the finance they need.\" This call was echoed by the Federation of Small Businesses. \"The British Business Bank must look at how these schemes are communicated to business so that small firms have much more awareness about the schemes which are available to them,\" John Allan, FSB chairman, said.",
