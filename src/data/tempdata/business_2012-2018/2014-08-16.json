The average home typically covered 1,647 sq ft and boasted four bedrooms in the 1920s, according to analysis by the Royal Institution of British Architects, but today's versions have three bedrooms and are 925 sq ft. Pizza Express's certainly shrinking share price (combined with the rumours of stingier portions) eventually persuaded the restaurant group to increase the size of its servings. However, investors will be concerned with another type of growth reversing a share-price slide this week, as the housebuilders' reporting season kicks off with Bovis and Persimmon.

As Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says: \"Only two other regions [apart from London] in the UK have recovered their 2008 peaks [the south-east and the east].\" In other words, the house-price bubble is perhaps like the shrinking Pizza Express pizza: an urban myth. Rob Peter to pay Paula The 1969 book The Peter Principle was unusual when it comes to management texts, in that it contained quite a good joke. Its premise was that employees are promoted until they reach a job at which they prove incompetent \u2013 a line you instinctively sense is true, as well as funny. Anyway, a chap called Tom Schuller has come up with a clever modern twist called the Paula principle, which argues that most women get promoted to a level below their competence. Far from rising to a position their talents don't deserve, they languish below what they could easily manage. Girls and women, of course, do better than boys and men educationally. They also take part in more further education and professional training than male colleagues, but get paid less. All of which will look even odder this week when the Chartered Management Institute unveils its yearly survey into the UK pay gap. Last year there was a \u00a38,502 difference in the average salaries of male and female managers, while female directors received bonuses of \u00a336,270 in 2013, compared with \u00a363,700 awarded to men.

Swiss bliss If you are a resident of the Swiss town of R\u00fcschlikon, you may be studying the results of commodity trading group Glencore this week. The lakeside municipality cut local taxes in 2011 after a huge windfall following the company's flotation, an event which announced Glencore boss and R\u00fcschlikon resident Ivan Glasenberg as a paper billionaire. Anyway, after a rather mixed production report last week, Glencore announces half-year results this week, just after the group revealed that it will trouser around $6.5bn from selling Las Bambas. As you might gather from the price, that is a Peruvian copper mining project, rather than a 1958 hit by Ritchie Valens. Anyway, the commodity trader has said that the disposal will allow it to pay down debt, hunt for other possible investments or, crucially for inhabitants of R\u00fcschlikon, return cash to shareholders \u2013 of whom Glasenberg is the second-largest, with a stake worth \u00a34bn. Analysts are expecting news this week on what shareholders might receive, and if the cash is returned as a dividend \u2013 rather than a share buyback \u2013 a chunk will find its way into the Glasenberg coffers.

      "bodyText": "All the anguish over interest rates \u2013 when they will rise and by how much \u2013 illustrates both the power and impotence of our central banks. They have power when governments fence themselves in with austerity, limiting the ability of ministers to aid the recovery and leaving central bankers the only ones able to get money flowing into the economy. But their spending does little more than offset austerity and the continuing failure of commercial banks to lend to households and businesses for anything other than the purchase of a prized property asset. As soon as they try to influence the economy in the other direction \u2013 say by raising rates \u2013 they are forced to back down. Bank of England governor Mark Carney says he is watching and waiting for the right time to raise rates. Why does he think they should go up? Central bankers worry that without a charge for borrowing, lenders cannot reward saving. They also fear that savers, in search of a higher return, will fall prey to the City's snake-oil salesmen and invest in high-risk assets, causing another financial crash. It may be laudable to reward saving and provide a decent return on safe assets, thereby discouraging risky behaviour, but the UK's huge level of household indebtedness effectively rules out much higher base rates: at least not the postwar norm of 4%-5%. Carney agrees and has in so many words put a 3% ceiling on base rates, most likely for the rest of the decade, which must be a reasonable assumption when taking into account low wage growth, no-better-than-moderate business investment and stumbling exports alongside a predicted rise in household debt to 165% of GDP (from 140% in 2013) over the next five years. At least, 3% is a reasonable assumption until the recent experiences of smaller, supposedly less beleaguered, central banks are taken into account. Both Sweden and Norway have tried to rise rates to more \"normal\" levels only to find it killed high street spending and sent economic growth into reverse. Australia tried it too. Importantly for these central banks, which, like most, have a mandate to maintain inflation at or around 2%, price increases dropped near to zero. Norway is a rich nation with huge savings, yet such is the weakness of its broader economy it could not survive higher rates. Sweden had a relatively soft landing from the banking crash: its banks were robust. However, quickfire rate rises from 0.25% to 2% between 2010 and 2011 proved too much. Prices went into reverse. Only a cut in rates back down to 0.25% served to prevent a full-blown deflationary spiral. Dhaval Joshi, the head of research at analysts BCA Research, argues we are returning to an era similar to the one before the war, when low inflation and low rates were closely aligned: \"The lessons should be crystal clear. When interest rates rise again in the UK and the euro area, the next peak in rates will be nowhere near the last peak of 4%-5%. As we return to the old normal world, rates will likely peak much closer to 2% \u2013 if they even get that far \u2013 and then come back down again.\" Not everyone is indebted. We know that large sections of the over-55s have huge assets in the form of homes and pensions. They are largely immune to the cost of interest rate rises. A third of homes are owned outright. On the other hand, many British families where the parents are in the 35-to-45-year-old bracket are mortgaged up to the hilt and saving only small sums for old age. They will stop spending on almost everything to keep a roof over their head. Pushing up rates is therefore going to have the same effect in the UK as it did in Sweden and Norway. No wonder some forecasts have put back the first UK rate rise to 2016. Cheap credit is essential when households and businesses are close to going bust, but cannot encourage investment if they have already hit a borrowing ceiling, so it has limited value in supporting productivity growth and higher wages. Ask the Japanese: they've spent 25 years treading water with zero inflation, zero rates, zero wage rises and zero growth. While the UK waits for an economic fairy godmother to arrive \u2013 one that ties GDP gains to higher wages \u2013 the Treasury operates a cash-back policy, handing money back to taxpayers through higher personal allowances every year. The Liberal Democrat election proposal to increase the personal allowance to \u00a312,500 in the next parliament is more of the same. Don't worry about your lack of pay rises, says Lib Dem treasury spokesman Danny Alexander \u2013 have some of the money we would have spent on the health service. George Osborne, knowing wages are stagnant, is likely to match this promise in the runup to the election, cementing the already obvious message that work for those on below-average incomes doesn't pay without neverending state handouts. Labour is hoping that a mix of housebuilding, price controls and skills training will make the difference. Yet Japan and Switzerland, which are both high-skill economies (the Swiss have a manufacturing sector that is double the proportion of the UK's) have tried this route and failed to spread the gains of growth beyond a few key sectors or the owners and managers of private-sector businesses. Breaking out of the impasse is going to take more than tinkering.",

    "webTitle": "Five key factors that will decide when Bank of England raises interest rates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It doesn't know when. It doesn't know by how much. And it doesn't know how quickly. But one thing the Bank of England is sure of is that, at some point, interest rates will be raised from 0.5%, their rock-bottom level of the past five-and-a-half years. Threadneedle Street's governor, Mark Carney, said last week that the UK's economic momentum was looking more assured. The Bank's forecasts, not always 100% reliable in recent years, point to growth this year of 3.5% \u2013 the highest since 2003. Back then, official interest rates stood at 3.75% in November and were raised four times \u2013 a quarter of a percentage point at a time \u2013 during the following year. Carney's message to Britain's mortgage-payers and businesses is that the era of ultra-low-cost borrowing is coming to an end. \"Interest rates can be expected to increase as the expansion progresses. But, given the broad forces acting on our economy, the normal rates of tomorrow are likely to be lower than those of yesteryear,\" he said. So what are these broad forces acting on the economy? And how important will they be in the Bank's decisions? Issue one: slack The Bank is interested to know how fast the economy is growing, but it is even more interested in the amount of spare capacity \u2013 or \"slack\" \u2013 that is available. So long as there is slack, the UK can continue to grow above its long-term trend rate of approximately 2.5%-2.75% without inflationary pressure mounting. Once the slack is used up, there is the risk that inflation will start rising. The bad news, according to Carney, is that \"slack in being used up at a faster pace than we had anticipated\"; but the good news is that \"there was more slack in the first place\". At present, the Bank estimates that slack amounts to 1% of GDP, but Carney will act before all spare capacity disappears. Importance: high Issue two: wages Measuring the amount of spare capacity is an imprecise and difficult science. The Bank thinks most of the economy's slack lies in the labour market, where there are the people who are working fewer hours than they would like, or who want a job but cannot find one. It has been surprised at the weakness of wage growth over the past year, a period that has seen employment increase by more than 800,000. It is not sure whether the lack of any upward pressure on wages, reflected in the 0.6% increase in annual average earnings excluding bonuses, is temporary or structural. If the former, average earnings will start to rise over the coming months, triggering dearer borrowing. Lena Komileva, chief economist at analyst G+ Economics, says the Bank's \"monetary arithmetic is not about GDP strength, but \u2026 uncertainty about when UK wages will recover\". Importance: critical Issue three: indebtedness Given Britain's propensity for housing booms and busts in the past 40 years, the Bank is keeping a wary eye on the state of the property market. For the time being, though, the emphasis is on the Bank's financial policy committee to use tailored policies to control mortgage lending and borrowing, with the \"big gun\" of higher interest rates being seen as a last resort. What does worry the Bank is that many borrowers would find it hard to make ends meet in the event of even fairly modest increases in interest rates. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates that the number of households struggling to pay the mortgage would double to 2.3m by 2018 if the Bank raised rates from 0.5% to just under 3%. Indebtedness is more likely, however, to have an impact on the eventual level at which rates will settle than on whether they will go up at all \u2013 particularly since the Bank believes lenders will absorb most of the initial increases in their profit margins. Importance: medium Issue four: sterling The level of the pound matters to the Bank. If sterling is going up against other currencies, imports become cheaper and that pushes down inflation, but it hurts exports by making them dearer. Conversely, a falling pound drives up prices but makes UK exports cheaper abroad. Over the past year, the pound has appreciated by 14% against a basket of world currencies, but the full effects of this have not yet been felt. A sharp fall in sterling would lead to the Bank revising up its forecasts for inflation and make an interest-rate move more likely. With the eurozone struggling, however, this does not appear an immediate threat. Importance: low Issue five: events overseas The past few weeks have seen a marked increase in so-called geopolitical risk. Fears of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine are already having an impact on business confidence in Germany, while events in Gaza and Iraq have added to concerns about supplies of energy. But for the time being, the biggest concern for the Bank is the weakness of the eurozone, where growth was slowing to a standstill in the second quarter even before events took a turn for the worse in Ukraine. Importance: medium, potentially high Of the five factors listed above, the final three point to the Bank continuing to adopt a cautious approach. The City considered last week's inflation report to be less hawkish than the Bank's previous health check on the economy in May. Peter Dixon at Commerzbank said: \"We get the sense there is little urgency to pull the trigger on interest rates any time soon.\" As a result, financial markets now believes the first increase in interest rates will be in the first three months of 2015 rather than in the final quarter of 2014. That view could change swiftly, however, if the release of the minutes taken at the August meeting of the Bank's monetary policy committee show there is no longer unanimity about keeping rates at 0.5%. Moreover, wages hold the key to what will happen to borrowing costs. If it becomes clear that the weakness of earnings is simply the result of it taking time for pay to respond to shrinking dole queues, the Bank will not wait long before pulling the interest-rate trigger.",

But one thing the Bank of England is sure of is that, at some point, interest rates will be raised from 0.5%, their rock-bottom level of the past five-and-a-half years.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street's governor, Mark Carney, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/13/bank-of-england-2014-interest-rate-rise-unlikely-mark-carney\" title=\"\">said last week</a> that the UK's economic momentum was looking more assured. The Bank's forecasts, not always 100% reliable in recent years, point to growth this year of 3.5% \u2013 the highest since 2003. Back then, official interest rates stood at 3.75% in November and were raised four times \u2013 a quarter of a percentage point at a time \u2013 during the following year.</p> <p>Carney's message to Britain's mortgage-payers and businesses is that the era of ultra-low-cost borrowing is coming to an end.</p> <p>\"Interest rates can be expected to increase as the expansion progresses. But, given the broad forces acting on our economy, the normal rates of tomorrow are likely to be lower than those of yesteryear,\" he said.</p> <p>So what are these broad forces acting on the economy? And how important will they be in the Bank's decisions?</p> <h2><strong>Issue one: slack</strong></h2> <p>The Bank is interested to know how fast the economy is growing, but it is even more interested in the amount of spare capacity \u2013 or \"slack\" \u2013 that is available. So long as there is slack, the UK can continue to grow above its long-term trend rate of approximately 2.5%-2.75% without inflationary pressure mounting. Once the slack is used up, there is the risk that inflation will start rising. The bad news, according to Carney, is that \"slack in being used up at a faster pace than we had anticipated\"; but the good news is that \"there was more slack in the first place\". At present, the Bank estimates that slack amounts to 1% of GDP, but Carney will act before all spare capacity disappears. <br><strong>Importance: high</strong></p> <h2><strong>Issue two: wages</strong></h2> <p>Measuring the amount of spare capacity is an imprecise and difficult science. The Bank thinks most of the economy's slack lies in the labour market, where there are the people who are working fewer hours than they would like, or who want a job but cannot find one. It has been surprised at the weakness of wage growth over the past year, a period that has seen employment increase by more than 800,000. It is not sure whether the lack of any upward pressure on wages, reflected in the 0.6% increase in annual average earnings excluding bonuses, is temporary or structural. If the former, average earnings will start to rise over the coming months, triggering dearer borrowing. Lena Komileva, chief economist at analyst G+ Economics, says the Bank's \"monetary arithmetic is not about GDP strength, but \u2026 uncertainty about when UK wages will recover\".<br><strong>Importance: critical</strong></p> <h2><strong>Issue three: indebtedness</strong></h2> <p>Given Britain's propensity for housing booms and busts in the past 40 years, the Bank is keeping a wary eye on the state of the property market. For the time being, though, the emphasis is on the Bank's financial policy committee to use tailored policies to control mortgage lending and borrowing, with the \"big gun\" of higher interest rates being seen as a last resort. What does worry the Bank is that many borrowers would find it hard to make ends meet in the event of even fairly modest increases in interest rates. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates that the number of households struggling to pay the mortgage would double to 2.3m by 2018 if the Bank raised rates from 0.5% to just under 3%.</p> <p>Indebtedness is more likely, however, to have an impact on the eventual level at which rates will settle than on whether they will go up at all \u2013 particularly since the Bank believes lenders will absorb most of the initial increases in their profit margins. <br><strong>Importance: medium</strong></p> <h2><strong>Issue four: sterling</strong></h2> <p>The level of the pound matters to the Bank. If sterling is going up against other currencies, imports become cheaper and that pushes down inflation, but it hurts exports by making them dearer. Conversely, a falling pound drives up prices but makes UK exports cheaper abroad.</p> <p>Over the past year, the pound has appreciated by 14% against a basket of world currencies, but the full effects of this have not yet been felt. A sharp fall in sterling would lead to the Bank revising up its forecasts for inflation and make an interest-rate move more likely. With the eurozone struggling, however, this does not appear an immediate threat.<br><strong>Importance: low</strong></p> <h2><strong>Issue five: events overseas</strong></h2> <p>The past few weeks have seen a marked increase in so-called geopolitical risk. Fears of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine are already having an impact on business confidence in Germany, while events in Gaza and Iraq have added to concerns about supplies of energy. But for the time being, the biggest concern for the Bank is the weakness of the eurozone, where growth was slowing to a standstill in the second quarter even before events took a turn for the worse in Ukraine.<br><strong>Importance: medium, potentially high</strong></p> <p>Of the five factors listed above, the final three point to the Bank continuing to adopt a cautious approach. The City considered last week's inflation report to be less hawkish than the Bank's previous health check on the economy in May. Peter Dixon at Commerzbank said: \"We get the sense there is little urgency to pull the trigger on interest rates any time soon.\"</p> <p>As a result, financial markets now believes the first increase in interest rates will be in the first three months of 2015 rather than in the final quarter of 2014. That view could change swiftly, however, if the release of the minutes taken at the August meeting of the Bank's monetary policy committee show there is no longer unanimity about keeping rates at 0.5%.</p> <p>Moreover, wages hold the key to what will happen to borrowing costs. If&#xa0;it becomes clear that the weakness of earnings is simply the result of it taking time for pay to respond to shrinking dole queues, the Bank will not wait long before pulling the interest-rate trigger.</p>",
