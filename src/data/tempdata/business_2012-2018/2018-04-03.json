      "bodyText": "And finally, Spotify has closed at $149 per share. That\u2019s a drop from its opening level of $165.9, but still 13% above the \u2018reference price\u2019 of $132. That values Spotify at around $26.6bn, more than some analysts had suggested before today\u2019s listing. Here\u2019s our tale of the latest tech float: Goodnight! GW A recovery rally on Wall Street has helped the US stock market recover a chunk of Monday\u2019s falls. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 1.65% higher, up 389 points at 24,033 - having lost over 450 points yesterday. Traders were encouraged by reports that the White House was not planning action against Amazon. Spotify may have bucked the trend with its direct listing, but its ownership structure is depressingly familiar, says our financial editor Nils Pratley. Its founders are wedded to keeping vice-like control via a share structure with unequal voting rights. For unequal, read unfair: Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzen own 38.9% of the ordinary shares but they have created \u201cbeneficiary certificates\u201d with super-charged voting rights that only they can own. Include those holdings and Ek and Lorentzen have 80.4% of the votes. As the prospectus is obliged to concede: \u201cIf our founders act together, they will have control over the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors.\u201d Put another way, for as long as the duo stick together, they are unsackable. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says Spotify has a \u2018great story\u2019; even so, people should be cautious when investing. He explains: \u2018Spotify is floating on the stock market at a pretty inauspicious time for the tech industry, which has been rocked by the Facebook data scandal and now potentially faces greater regulation as a result. Donald Trump\u2019s tweeted attacks on Amazon don\u2019t help lift sentiment towards the sector either. Despite the downbeat mood music, Spotify shares changed hands on the market at a substantial premium to the highest price previously paid in private transactions, indicating significant investor demand for the stock. It\u2019s still early in the US trading session however. The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u2019s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale. Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u2019t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem. However the company has already carved out a dominant role, and has demonstrated its ability to leverage scale by renegotiating agreements with music labels, boosting its gross margin from 12% to 21% since 2015. The BBC\u2019s Danni Hewson is impressed by the streaming service\u2019s opening debut: Bloomberg\u2019s Alex Webb points out that Spotify is now worth more than some established players (despite having never made a profit!) Here\u2019s some video of the moment Spotify\u2019s shares joined the market: Spotify\u2019s shares are bouncing around in early trading, as investors weigh up whether to buy in at today\u2019s opening price. They\u2019ve just slipped below $164, from the opening price of $165.9. Early days, though.... The Wall Street Journal says Spotify has hit the markets with a bang: Spotify Technology roared onto the public market Tuesday as the music-streaming giant pulled off an unusual method of going public. The stock opened at $165.90 and traded in a close range immediately after. With an opening value of $29.55 billion, Spotify is poised to become the third-largest U.S.-listed tech IPO on record, according to Dealogic. That \u2018unusual method\u2019 involved spurning the investment banks who would have underwritten the company\u2019s shares (providing a safety net for the market debut), in return for a large fee. AT LAST! Spotify is finally trading, after more than three hours of intense discussions on the Wall Street trading floor. Shares have opened for trading at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 which had been suggested. That, by my maths, values Spotify at around $29.5bn. I imagine the company should be pretty pleased - this is a sharp jump on the value of its shares earlier this year (when they could only be traded privately between shareholders). On a lighter note, the New York Stock Exchange has confirmed that it accidentally flew a Swiss flag to mark Spotify\u2019s listing -- which is unfortunate as it\u2019s actually a Swedish company. More here: Spotify\u2019s likely market valuation is pushing closer to $30bn, as its unconventional \u2018direct listing\u2019 continues to play out on the trading floor There are 178.1 million Spotify shares in existence (although the company is only offering around a third to New York investors today). So if today\u2019s listing hits $170, as seems possible, the company could be worth several billion dollars more than forecast. Market makers on Wall Street are continuing to haggle over Spotify\u2019s valuation, pushing its likely share price value even higher: After a edgy day, European stock markets have closed mostly in the red. The escalation of tensions between China and the US over tariffs hit sentiment in the City, and beyond, as traders returned to their desks after the Easter break. Anxiety over the tech sector also weighed on shares, despite the interest in Spotify\u2019s listing in New York, and Tesla\u2019s upbeat statement. The slowdown in eurozone factory growth last month also didn\u2019t provide traders with any fresh optimism. So, the FTSE 100 finished 26 points lower, or 0.4%, at 7,030. Germany\u2019s DAX shed almost 0.7%, but France was calmer and Italy actually rallied a little. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, thinks Europe could be a safe-haven from some of the turbulence in America\u2019s markets. It was a rough start to the second quarter for European equities. Still, next to the losses seen on Wall Street on Monday, the damage in Europe was contained. Europe is out of the firing line for Trump\u2019s tariffs for now and has a lower weighting in technology companies compared to the US. Both factors make Europe a relative haven from the current negative news flow. Higher still and higher.... Spotify\u2019s shares are now seen opening at $150-$160 - indicating that its stock market listing is going well. Wall Street is pushing higher in volatile trading. The Dow is now up 256 points, or 1% -- which would recover around half of Monday\u2019s selloff. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that \u201cinvestors continue to process the latest chess-moves in the nascent trade war between China and the US,\u201d, so this bounce-back might be fragile. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is 0.2% higher, partly thanks to Tesla which is rallying after sticking to its pledge to more than double production of its Model 3 by the end of June. Those early prices suggest that Spotify could be worth around $27bn, I think. Not too shabby, given the company hasn\u2019t made a profit out of its 157 million customers. Ooooh - Spotify is being priced at between $145 and $155 per share. That\u2019s more than the $132 which had been pencilled in. This delay is because the company decided not to use investment banks to underwrite its offering -- saving it millions of dollars in fees. So, if today\u2019s listing goes smoothly, other companies might consider taking the same track. Donald Trump is refusing to back down in his fight against Amazon, and just fired off a new tweet: Spotify\u2019s stock market listing is underway...but we don\u2019t know what price its shares are trading at yet. Wall Street has opened a little higher, as traders hope to recovery from Monday\u2019s selloff. The Dow has gained 0.5% in early trading, up 123 points at 23,767 Here\u2019s some early reaction to Tesla\u2019s new production numbers: Just in: Electric carmaker Tesla has just released its latest eagerly-awaited production figures, which confirm rumours that it has missed some of its own targets. Tesla says it produced 34,494 vehicles in the last three months, 40% more than the final quarter of 2017. This makes January-March \u201cby far the most productive quarter in Tesla history\u201d, it says. This includes 9,766 Model 3s (Tesla\u2019s new model), and 24,728 were Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla also reveals that it has ramped up production recently -- amid reports that founder Elon Musk has taken personal control of car output in recent days (and even been sleeping at the factory). The company says: In the past seven days, Tesla produced 2,020 Model 3 vehicles. In the next seven days, we expect to produce 2,000 Model S and X vehicles and 2,000 Model 3 vehicles. It is a testament to the ability of the Tesla production team that Model 3 volume now exceeds Model S and Model X combined. What took our team five years for S/X, took only nine months for Model 3. However, Musk had previously aimed to produce 2,500 Tesla 3 cars each week by now. So Tesla hasn\u2019t hit that goal yet. But crucially, it says it still aims to get production of the \u20183\u2019 model up to 5,000 per week in \u2018about\u2019 three months. Shares are rallying in pre-market trading - up around 6% Spotify logos have sprung up at Wall Street, ahead of today\u2019s listing: New York\u2019s stock market may claw back some of yesterday\u2019s losses when trading resumes in under an hour\u2019s time. The Dow Jones index is expected to rise by 0.6%, or around 140 points, judging by the futures markets. That would take a small bite out of Monday\u2019s rout, when it lost over 450 points (and was down 730 points at one stage). Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says the markets are still nervous, though: The second quarter got off to a rough start on Monday, with trade war fears and declining tech stocks taking their toll on investor sentiment, but we are seeing a small rebound ahead of the open on Wall Street. US futures are up to half a percentage point higher on Tuesday, but this pales in comparison to the losses recorded on Monday and reflects ongoing weakness in stocks. Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Amazon over the weekend put the spotlight back on the tech sector, as it tries to recover from the Facebook data scandal that threatens more regulation. Pressure on the sector doesn\u2019t appear to be going away in the near-term which will continue to act as a drag on indices. Traders might need their tin hats this spring... In less than 90 minutes, music streaming site Spotify will join the US stock exchange. You can get up to speed quickly with our explainer, which outlines why the popular service (which has never turned a profit) could be worth up to $25bn - and why today\u2019s listing could be particularly lively.... Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg is questioning whether Donald Trump has really hurt Amazon\u2019s share price (as suggested earlier). He points out that other tech companies have suffered similar falls, even though they\u2019ve been spared a digital roasting from the president: However, I\u2019d suggest that Trump\u2019s attack on Amazon\u2019s tax affairs (and its implications for the digital companies) are one of several factors weighing on markets. And sometimes, investors like to have an excuse to sell -- especially if they\u2019re getting jittery. Bad news: another 97 workers at the collapsed UK construction and outsourcing group Carillion have lost their jobs. That take the total redundancies at the company to 1,802, since it was liquidated in January in one of the biggest UK corporate failures in years. Some 9,946 jobs have been saved (because other companies have taken on the contracts they work on). Sky is bucking today\u2019s selloff, after a cunning scheme to help Rupert Murdoch take full control of the broadcaster emerged. Disney has \u2018expressed interest\u2019 in buying Sky News, a move that might clear the way for Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox company take control of the 61% of Sky\u2019s shares it doesn\u2019t already own. 21CF\u2019s bid has been hit by media plurality concerns - given Murdoch\u2019s strong position in UK media (including owning the Times and Sun newspapers). But those worries might abate, if Sky News wasn\u2019t part of the package. Jolly decent of Disney to offer to help, eh? Not exactly. The US giant has its own motive - namely to take over Fox (including all of Sky) in a $66bn (\u00a347bn) deal. That takeover risks being derailed because Comcast recently launched its own takeover offer for Sky. Sky shares have risen to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up 1.5% at \u00a313.15. That\u2019s higher than either Comcast\u2019s offer (\u00a312.50) or Fox\u2019s (\u00a310.75), suggesting traders expect a higher bid. City firm Liberum expects Fox to strike back: We think the news and today\u2019s comments from Sky point to a revised bid from Fox/Disney to trump Comcast\u2019s 1250p bid. More here: Two and a half-hours into the new trading quarter, and Britain\u2019s stock market is still down. The FTSE 100 is currently 46 points lower or 0.6%, at 7010. Industrial stocks, utilities and telecoms firms are leading the selloff. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital blames the double-whammy of trade tensions following China\u2019s tariffs, and the tech selloff in America: On tech\u2019s impact on the market, it\u2019s a case of the star performers suffering and this has a big psychological effect on sentiment. It\u2019s not just that they have been behind the bulk of the gains in recent years and therefore exert an outsized effect on indices when they sell off; there is also a kind of network effect on other stocks. On trade, there is hope that China\u2019s response to US sanctions is sufficiently moderate and contained to prevent further escalation. However we await to see where this goes and whatever happens from here, there is no \u2018good news\u2019 in the sense that the direction of travel is either one-way or going no further \u2013 we are not about to see a freeing up of global trade (reversal of tariffs), which would be risk-positive. Even if there is no further escalation, the background music is risk-off. It\u2019s hardly unusual for Donald Trump to lash out on Twitter -- as Hillary Clinton, CNN, the FBI, several senators and the Mexican government can all testify. But still, his trenchant criticism of Amazon in recent days has caused a real stir in the markets for several reasons, helping to fuel this week\u2019s market selloff. Partly, because Trump is taking the side of the old-economy - tweeting that America\u2019s \u201cfully tax paying retailers\u201d are being forced to shut stores because (he claims) Amazon is getting an unfairly good deal. Politifact, a US website, has debunked Trump\u2019s claim that the US Postal Service is losing money thanks to Amazon. It says: Amazon isn\u2019t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it\u2019s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. But still, the US president\u2019s comments suggest that other tech disruptors could also come under fire -- especially if changes are made to the US tax system to help traditional retailers. That\u2019s not the only concern. Some industry figures are concerned that Amazon (whose shares fell 5% yesterday) is being hammered because its founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post. Vanity Fair\u2019s Gabriel Sherman is reporting that Trump is firmly focused on Bezos, thanks to the Post\u2019s criticism of his presidency: Sherman says: He\u2019s off the hook on this. It\u2019s war,\u201d one source told me. \u201cHe gets obsessed with something, and now he\u2019s obsessed with Bezos,\u201d said another source. \u201cTrump is like, how can I fuck with him?\u201d That sort of behaviour will unnerve Wall Street, as investors try to judge where to place their money. It\u2019s also unusual to see politicians try to settle scores so publicly. Paul Donovan, UBS\u2019s chief global economist, fears that such \u2018random\u2019 attacks could undermine faith in the \u2018rule of law\u2019. Just in: Britain\u2019s manufacturing has just posted its slowest quarter growth in a year. But it\u2019s not all bad -- growth in March picked up a little, pushing the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index up to 55.1 from 55.0 in February. Factory bosses reported that output growth picked up last month, but increases in new orders and employment slowed. Data firm Markit says: The average reading over the opening quarter as a whole (55.1) was the weakest in a year, suggesting that the underlying pace of expansion has been generally slower since the start of 2018. Growth across Europe\u2019s factory sector has hit an eight-month low, as the recent \u2018euro boom\u2019 falters. The eurozone manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, dropped to 56.6 in March, down from 58.6 in February. This is the third monthly drop in a row, but it still signals solid growth (50 points would show stagnation). Factory bosses reported that output, new orders and new exports grew at a slower rate last month. They also reported problems getting hold of the raw materials and parts they needed, as supply chains struggled to cope. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, is concerned that business confidence also dipped last month. The fact that business optimism about the coming year has slipped to a 15-month low suggests there are other factors that are now hitting factory order books. Export growth has more than halved since late last year, linked in part to the appreciation of the euro, and in some cases demand is being stymied by higher prices. Hopes that the markets might calm down after their volatile start to 2018 have been dashed this morning. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investors need to decide whether we\u2019re heading into a bear market, or just a \u2018revaluation\u2019 of asset prices. The major fear for markets is that the imposition of retaliatory import tariffs by China could just be the tip of the iceberg and will cause a chain reaction that drags more sectors and countries into the dispute. In a world where China is not willing to turn the other cheek and where President Trump likes to get the last word, the situation is set for further turmoil and the danger for investors is that this will escalate into a broader battle, which could leave few sectors immune to trouble. Each of the major tech companies appears to have its own particular set of problems to deal with. Facebook - data security. Intel - Apple chips. Tesla - missed targets compounding fears of excessive leverage. Amazon - President Trump. However, the one thing these companies do have in common is that these stocks are held by most of the big popular global funds. This means that many investors may have substantial exposure, even if they are not direct shareholders, which makes the tech troubles a wider problem. Monday\u2019s selloff was actually Wall Street\u2019s worst start to an April since 1929 -- a date etched in market memory thanks to the crash later that year. Now, it\u2019s just one day\u2019s trading, but its not a great open for the second quarter either... Yesterday\u2019s selloff means America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 has now shed 3.4% since the start of the year, while the Dow is down almost 5%. That follows a remarkable 2017, which saw the US stock market surge by around 25%. European markets have fallen down across the board in nervous trading, as traders rush to catch up with events after the Easter break. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says fears of a trade war are refusing to go away: On Monday China announced that it has implemented afforementioned tariffs on 128 types of US goods. Implementing the tariffs makes China\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s steel and aluminium tariffs official. China has to show it is serious. We still expect a settlement in trade negotiations between the two nations. Sentiment will be fragile until the result of trade negotiations become clear. Britain\u2019s stock market has fallen sharply at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 shed 54 points, or 0,7%, to 7001 points, as traders take their cue from yesterday\u2019s slide on Wall Street. The US president appears to have unnerved the markets, with his trade war rhetoric and attacks on Amazon. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: The fall in tech stocks and escalating trade tensions continued to rattle markets after the Easter break. This time, it\u2019s Trump\u2019s tariffs and tech stocks driving the selloff, and I don\u2019t think the U.S. President is doing himself any favors before the midterm elections. Beijing\u2019s response hasn\u2019t been aggressive, by imposing levies on $3 billion worth of imports from the U.S.; the question now is - what\u2019s next? A tariff \u2018tit for tat\u2019 is a lose-lose scenario. So, it\u2019s likely that after this war of nerves, the world\u2019s two largest economies will find a middle ground. Markets should get used to Trump\u2019s negotiating style - kicking off with something dramatic, and then scaling down through negotiation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fresh worries over a global trade war are rippling through the markets today, after China hit back against America\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium by targeting imports of food, wine, steel and even ginseng. The news that Beijing is imposing its own tariffs of up to 25% on more than 120 US products sparked a selloff on Wall Street last night, sending the S&amp;P into correction territory. The Dow plunged by over 700 points at one stage, before ending the day 458 points lower. With Donald Trump expected to announce new curbs on China soon, traders are worried that this tit-for-tat action could escalate. As David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Beijing decided to impose levies on approximately $3 billion worth of goods from the US. In the grand scheme of things, China\u2019s response hasn\u2019t been too aggressive, but dealers fear we could be starting a long trade war. The ball is now in Trump\u2019s in court, and traders are waiting for the US President to make the next move. European markets were closed yesterday for Easter Monday, so we\u2019re expecting losses of almost 1% on the main indices this morning. Trump has also put the technology sector into a spin, after sending a series of tweets criticising Amazon for avoiding taxes and not paying the US Post Office a fair rate. Amazon\u2019s share price tanked by over 5% on Monday, on concerns that the e-commerce giant is firmly in Trump\u2019s firing line. Music streaming site Spotify will hope to ride out the market choppiness, when it lists its shares on the New York stock exchange for the first time. Spotify has taken the refreshing decision not to employ investment banks to underwrite its listing, so the launch could be more volatile than usual. We also get a new healthcheck on Europe\u2019s factory sector: The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI survey for March 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI survey for March 2.30pm BST: Spotify joins the US stock market",

Donald Trump\u2019s tweeted attacks on Amazon don\u2019t help lift sentiment towards the sector either.</p> <p>Despite the downbeat mood music, Spotify shares changed hands on the market at a substantial premium to the highest price previously paid in private transactions, indicating significant investor demand for the stock. It\u2019s still early in the US trading session however.</p> <p>The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u2019s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale.</p> <p>Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u2019t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem. However the company has already carved out a dominant role, and has demonstrated its ability to leverage scale by renegotiating agreements with music labels, boosting its gross margin from 12% to 21% since 2015.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ac3b492e4b0968bfc01b0cb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-03T17:12:01.554Z\">6.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spotify floats: What the experts say</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The BBC\u2019s Danni Hewson is impressed by the streaming service\u2019s opening debut:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dannihewson/status/981215980167860224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wowzers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/spotify?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#spotify</a> debuts on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYSE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYSE</a> with a share price of $165.90 - the music streaming service is worth $29.5 billion - more than Twitter!</p>&mdash; Danni Hewson (@dannihewson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannihewson/status/981215980167860224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Bloomberg\u2019s <strong>Alex Webb</strong> points out that Spotify is now worth more than some established players (despite having never made a profit!)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/atbwebb/status/981212723152384001\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Spotify&#39;s opening price of $165.90 gives it a valuation of $30b.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesla may have steered itself away from a financial precipice, after the US electric carmaker announced that it had finally started to produce its Model 3 on a scale that could lead it to the mass market. Faltering production of the latest, cheapest model of its electric supercars had been a factor in a downgrading of Tesla\u2019s credit rating, plummeting share price and deepening industry scepticism. But on Tuesday the California-based firm said it had made more than 2,000 Model 3 vehicles in the past seven days \u2013 still some way below Tesla\u2019s original target of 5,000, and short of the 2,500 per week it had since scheduled for this March, but a healthier figure than many analysts had suspected. Tesla said it had doubled the production rate over the first quarter of 2018 by addressing bottlenecks in its production process and supply chain, including shutting down its factory for several short periods to upgrade its equipment. It admitted that delays had lost it some customers for the Model 3 but said that net orders remained stable. The firm, led by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, claimed that its exponential rate of increased production was so fast that it would, if continued, trump that of Ford\u2019s Model T. Tesla said production of its Model 3 would now start to exceed that of its luxury Model S and X electric cars, and it would continue to aim for its stated target of 20,000 cars per month by the summer \u2013 a rate that would give it \u201cthe long-sought ideal combination of high volume, good gross margin and strong positive operating cash flow\u201d. The carmaker added that it would not need to seek additional financing this year as a result, other than borrowing on its standard credit lines. Its share price, which had dropped by more than a third in six months on fears for the firm\u2019s future, rallied on Tuesday by 7% after news of the higher production rate. Tesla\u2019s announcement came two days after Musk issued a jokey series of tweets on April Fools\u2019 Day that only served to fan further speculation about the company. The chief executive said that despite efforts including \u201ca last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt\u201d. A photograph showed Musk apparently slumped unconscious beside a Model 3, holding a cardboard sign reading \u201cBankwupt\u201d. Concerns over the company\u2019s finances had been rife, with the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s downgrading Tesla\u2019s rating last week. Moody\u2019s warned that the company might need to raise another $2bn (\u00a31.4bn) to remain solvent, and that its rating was likely to be downgraded further if it failed to meet its production targets. Whether Tesla\u2019s latest showing will avert further gloom remains in the balance: Bruce Clark, a Moody\u2019s analyst, told the Financial Times on Tuesday: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to pull out all the stops in the last week or so of the quarter, and another to maintain that level of production on a sustainable basis.\u201d Confidence in Tesla could also take a further knock following the death of a second driver who was using a Model X in its self-driving mode, Autopilot, raising questions over the firm\u2019s pioneering technology. Tesla confirmed last week that the driver who died in a crash on 23 March had set the car to cruise control without his hands on the wheel, and said he had apparently not responded to warnings. Another Tesla driver died with his car on Autopilot in 2016.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The struggling toymaker Hornby has been given breathing space by its bank to nail down a new finance deal despite a fresh slump in sales. The loss-making model railway and Scalextric maker said poor sales in the first three months of 2018 meant it had breached the terms of its loan agreement with Barclays, but the bank was not taking any action. Hornby\u2019s new chief executive, Lyndon Davies, said the 117-year-old company was in the final stages of negotiating a new, larger loan facility with another lender. The agreement is expected to be in place by the time the company updates the City on its annual results in June. In 2015 Hornby shares were changing hands for over \u00a31 but several torrid years punctuated by profit warnings, cash calls and leadership changes have had a dramatic effect on the company\u2019s value. Things got so bad in 2016 that the former Top Gear presenter James May intervened, urging Britons to \u201cbuy a train set today\u201d in an attempt to shore up the troubled company\u2019s finances. The shares have shed a fifth of their value in the past 12 months and on Tuesday closed at 23p, valuing the company at \u00a330.7m. Davies, who is the founder of rival model business Oxford Diecast, is the third chief executive to attempt to get Hornby back on the tracks since 2014. He was installed by the company\u2019s majority shareholder, Phoenix Asset Management, which took control last year. Analysts say Hornby is struggling to stay relevant in a cutthroat industry where it has to compete with toys linked to the latest blockbuster films as well as online games. Last year Toys R Us, the world\u2019s largest toy retailer, filed for bankruptcy and its UK stores are closing after a buyer failed to emerge. Hornby, which also makes Airfix kits and Corgi cars, made a loss before tax of \u00a39.5m in the year ended 31 March 2017. One of Davies\u2019s first actions has been to stop the discounting he said had been damaging its brands. But he admitted the tactic meant sales and profits in the fourth quarter were lower than a year ago. \u201cAs the dust settles on the changes to the strategy ... morale is starting to build in our hardworking staff and some trust is coming back with our retailers and customers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst we have managed to make a lot of progress in the first few months, there is still much more to do in terms of reducing costs, streamlining processes and adding routes to market.\u201d",

Things got so bad in 2016 that the former Top Gear presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/james-may\">James May</a> intervened, urging Britons to \u201cbuy a train set today\u201d in an attempt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/hornby-warns-it-will-lose-6m-pounds-this-year\">to shore up the troubled company\u2019s</a> finances. </p> <p>The shares have shed a fifth of their value in the past 12 months and on Tuesday closed at 23p, valuing the company at \u00a330.7m.<br></p> <p>Davies, who is the founder of rival model business Oxford Diecast, is the third chief executive to attempt to get Hornby back on the tracks since 2014. He was installed by the company\u2019s majority shareholder, Phoenix Asset Management, which took control last year. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Analysts say Hornby is struggling to stay relevant in a cutthroat industry where it has to compete with toys linked to the latest blockbuster films as well as online games. Last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/19/toys-r-us-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us-and-canada\">Toys R Us</a>, the world\u2019s largest toy retailer, filed for bankruptcy and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/02/toys-r-us-slashes-prices-closing-down-sale-store-closures-uk\">UK stores are closing</a> after a buyer failed to emerge.<br></p> <p>Hornby, which also makes Airfix kits and Corgi cars, made a loss before tax of \u00a39.5m in the year ended 31 March 2017. One of Davies\u2019s first actions has been to stop the discounting he said had been damaging its brands. But he admitted the tactic meant sales and profits in the fourth quarter were lower than a year ago.</p> <p>\u201cAs the dust settles on the changes to the strategy ... morale is starting to build in our hardworking staff and some trust is coming back with our retailers and customers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst we have managed to make a lot of progress in the first few months, there is still much more to do in terms of reducing costs, streamlining processes and adding routes to market.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has warned its members that they are failing to prepare workers for an automation revolution that will leave 66 million people at risk of being replaced by machines in the coming years. A new report by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that the most vulnerable \u2013 one in seven workers on average across the 32 countries studied \u2013 were less likely to be receiving help than those whose jobs were more secure. The OECD said 14% of jobs in developed countries were highly automatable, while a further 32% of jobs were likely to experience significant changes to the way they were carried out. The report said some of its member states were far more vulnerable than others to seeing jobs replaced by computers or algorithms: \u201cThere are significant differences across countries: 33% of all jobs in Slovakia are highly automatable, while this is only the case with 6% of the jobs in Norway. \u201cMore generally, jobs in Anglo-Saxon, Nordic countries and the Netherlands are less automatable than jobs in Eastern European countries, South European countries, Germany, Chile and Japan.\u201d Britain was identified by the OECD as one of the countries that would be least affected by automation, but even so the thinktank said one in ten jobs were at high risk and one in four could experience significant change. Automation was most likely to affect jobs in the manufacturing industry and agriculture, although a number of service sectors, such as postal and courier services, land transport and food services are also highly vulnerable, the thinktank warned. The new research suggested the job threat posed by automation was less severe than a 2013 study showing that 47% of US jobs were at high risk. But the OECD added that even its new estimates pointed to 13m American jobs being lost, warning that the impact on some local economies would be far more damaging than the impact on Detroit of the decline of the car industry. Low-skilled people and youth were among those most at risk, according to the report, with the jobs at highest risk tending to be in low-skill sectors such as food preparation, cleaning and labouring. Workers in fully automatable jobs were more than three times less likely to have participated in on-the-job training, over a 12-month period, than workers in non-automatable jobs. Those most at risk were also less likely to participate in formal education or distance learning. The OECD underlined the need to help young people obtain work experience while studying, and highlighted the importance of retraining and social protection for those who were at risk of seeing their job restructured or significantly downsized. \u201cIn parallel, the large share of workers whose jobs are likely to change quite significantly as a result of automation calls for countries to strengthen their adult learning policies to prepare their workforce for the changes in job requirements they are likely to face,\u201d the report said.",

The figure is among the most imbalanced yet reported in any sector, about four times the UK average and outstripping that of easyJet, whose 45% gap had attracted widespread criticism. Median hourly pay among Ryanair\u2019s 1,182 UK staff is 71.8% lower for women (67% lower on mean hourly pay), while median bonus pay for women was 3% lower (with a mean difference of 21%). With most of Ryanair\u2019s management and administration based in Ireland and excluded from the figures \u2013 including its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, and its all-male senior management board \u2013 more than 95% of the firm\u2019s UK-based staff are pilots or cabin crew. Only eight of Ryanair\u2019s 554 UK-based pilots are female, while women make up more than two-thirds of the low-paid cabin crew. Ryanair said: \u201cLike all airlines, our gender pay in the UK is materially affected by the relatively low numbers of female pilots in the aviation industry. \u201cIn recent years, the number of female pilots applying to Ryanair has increased and we are committed to developing this welcome trend.

EasyJet, one of the first airlines to report, has pledged that at least one in five of its new pilot recruits will be women by 2020. Its new chief executive, Johan Lundgren, who took a \u00a334,000 pay cut to match the salary of his predecessor Carolyn McCall this year, said he wanted to make a personal commitment as the airline attempted to address the imbalance. According to easyJet\u2019s staff surveys, most male pilots had decided on their career before the age of 11, while most of their female pilots had not been encouraged to think of it as a career until after school.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s factories increased production unexpectedly last month despite the sector experiencing its weakest quarter in a year, with signs the growth spurt enjoyed towards the end of 2017 has fizzled out. Shaking off concerns that heavy snowfall from the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d would trigger a slowdown, the UK manufacturing sector maintained a steady pace of growth in March. The Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI barometer of factory sentiment showed activity jumped to 55.1 from 55 in February, beating economists\u2019 forecasts for a fall in the growth rate. A figure above 50 indicates expansion on the index, which is used by the Bank of England to monitor the health of the economy. The latest PMI figures show manufacturing production rose for the 20th successive month, as companies continued to report solid inflows of new work from both domestic and overseas markets. But the performance completes a relatively weak quarter for the industry after a mini-boom at the end of last year. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said the latest reading suggested overall production growth would fall by more than half in the first quarter compared with the final three months of 2017. Manufacturing output growth had remained steadily above 1% towards the end of last year but may have fallen to about 0.5%, according to economists. \u201cThe key question is whether growth can now be sustained, albeit at a lower level, into the coming months,\u201d Dobson said. There are already some positive signs, with the survey of manufacturers used for compiling the PMI figures showing almost 55% of companies forecast that output will be higher in 12 months\u2019 time. The rate of growth also remains fairly strong by past standards, which experts said should help the economy to overcome weak high street spending in the first few months of 2018. Ruth Gregory, an economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said factories were still being supported by the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote, which has boosted demand from overseas markets. Sterling remains about 5% below its level before the EU referendum.",

      "bodyText": "Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Rupert Murdoch push through his \u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky by allaying fears he will control too much of the UK news media. Murdoch\u2019s bid is being scrutinised by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) amid concerns that buying the 61% of Sky his company 21st Century Fox does not already own will give him too much media influence. The Murdoch family also controls News UK, the owner of the Times and the Sun, and the radio station TalkSport. Disney has \u201cexpressed interest\u201d in buying Sky News, a move that would clear media plurality concerns and pave the way for its own $66bn (\u00a347bn) takeover of most of Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox, including all of Sky. \u201cThe Walt Disney Company has expressed an interest in acquiring Sky News, with a view to adding it to Disney\u2019s existing portfolio of television channels, whether or not Disney\u2019s proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox proceeds,\u201d said Fox in a statement. Disney, which has called Sky a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d Fox asset, said it would \u201cagree to sustain the operating capital of Sky News and maintain its editorial independence\u201d. The entertainment company said buying Sky News was not conditional on a successful takeover of Fox. Disney is hoping to get the deal done to see off its US rival Comcast, which owns assets including NBC Universal, which is seeking to derail it with its own much pricier \u00a322bn bid for Sky. Separately, Fox has further beefed up its pledge to make Sky News independent within the Sky operation. Fox has said it will fund Sky News for at least 15 years, up five years on its previous offer and 10 years more than its original proposal. Politicians including the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, and the Conservative MP Ken Clarke have been vociferous in criticising the deal and calling for it to be blocked. \u201cWe are aware that a group of politicians that is opposed to the transaction is seeking to influence the CMA and is making a number of unsupported and fanciful assertions,\u201d said Fox. Fox has said that it will look to legally separate Sky News from Sky, using the same structure BT used with Openreach, which the media regulator, Ofcom, said was enough to allay competition concerns raised by rivals. Fox reiterated its pledge from Rupert Murdoch that he and his family would not seek to influence the editorial choices made by Sky News bosses. \u201cWe offered this even though the record before the CMA shows that, over the course of nearly 30 years as Sky\u2019s founding shareholder, neither 21CF [21st Century Fox], nor the Murdoch family trust, have ever sought to influence the editorial direction of Sky News,\u201d Fox said. Sky has previously warned it could close Sky News if Fox were unable to gain regulatory clearance for its takeover bid. Shutting Sky News, which employs about 500 people, would eliminate the issues surrounding the deal but would have a hugely detrimental impact on wider plurality in UK news media. Ofcom has said the loss of Sky News could \u201cpresent risks to plurality equal to or greater than those presented by the transaction itself\u201d. \u201cSky believes that both of these remedy proposals comprehensively address any plurality concerns the CMA may have, and would guarantee the long-term future of Sky News and its ongoing editorial independence,\u201d the company said.",
