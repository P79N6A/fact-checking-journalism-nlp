      "bodyText": "George Osborne is to announce that he has faced down strong lobbying pressure from the City and is to press ahead with plans to ringfence the high street operations of Britain's major banks from their higher-risk investment banking arms. In an attempt to prevent a repeat of the crisis that saw a run on Northern Rock and the part-nationalisation of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, a government white paper to be published by the Treasury includes the bulk of the recommendations made by the independent commission on banking (ICB) headed by Sir John Vickers. The chancellor has agreed to only three significant changes from the Vickers report, but has not changed his mind about the need to ensure that banks' customers are protected from losses generated by the speculations of investment bankers. \"We are fundamentally reforming the structure of our banking sector,\" he will say in his annual Mansion House speech. \"We've got to stop problems here in the City of London spilling on to our high streets and putting taxpayers' money at risk.\" While accepting that some sort of legislation is inevitable following the financial crisis of 2007-08, UK banks have been urging Osborne to ensure that the ringfencing does not impose onerous restrictions on their businesses. The chancellor said in the 2011 Mansion House speech that he supported the Vickers approach to banking reform and will say that Thursday's white paper demonstrates how the coalition plans to have a new structure for the industry in place within seven years. \"High-street banking will be ringfenced so that taxpayers are better protected when things go wrong,\" Osborne will say. \"We will be able to bail in creditors when a bank fails rather than turning to the public purse. \"And I believe that we have found a workable way to solve what I called the 'British dilemma' \u2013 so we are proposing to protect taxpayers in a way that does not make the UK uncompetitive as a home of global banks.\" The Treasury said that the white paper will include plans for a high ringfence that will ensure a \"tough\" separation, with restrictions on equity holdings and on governance. Some derivative products will be available for the small business customers of retail banks, but only under strict regulatory conditions. Draft legislation to be put to parliament in the autumn will also include radical proposals to defend the interests of depositors if a bank finds itself in trouble. Instead of being low down the pecking order of creditors, a system of depositor preference will ensure that retail customers go to the head of the queue. Osborne also supports the ICB's call for greater competition in the high street, and wants legislation to include proposals that will make it easier for customers to switch banks. The Bank of England and the Financial Services Review will look at how banking red tape can provide barriers to entry. The chancellor will tell City grandees at Mansion House that legislation must be on the statute book by the end of the current parliament in spring 2015 and implemented by 2019 at the latest. Some of the lobbying by the banks has paid off, the Treasury said. Small banks \u2013 their size yet to be determined \u2013 will be exempted from the ringfencing requirements, in an attempt to ensure that greater competition breaks the stranglehold of the big high street chains. The ICB recommended that banks should have to hold additional capital to cover their overseas operations, but Osborne has decided that this will not be necessary when the activities do not pose a threat to financial stability. While Vickers proposed fixed leverage ratios for banks, the chancellor believes these should be set only when international negotiations have established new global standards.

The analysis by Credit Suisse estimates that up to 58% of the value of Europe's banks could be wiped out by the departure of the \"peripheral\" countries - Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain - from the eurozone. Even if the single currency remains intact some \u20ac1.3tn of credit could be sucked out of the system as banks retrench to their home markets, unwinding years of financial integration, the Credit Suisse analysis warns. his represents as much as 10% of the credit in the financial system. \"We find that a Greek exit could be manageable ... but in a peripheral exit, few of the large listed eurozone banks would be left standing,\" the Credit Suisse report said. The banking sector could need capital injections of as much as \u20ac470bn if the three scenarios considered by the Credit Suisse analysts - a Greek exit, an exit of the periphery countries and a situation where banks retrench domestically - happen at once. The UK's banks will not escape unscathed, although they are better insulated than those in the eurozone. In the event that the peripheral countries leave the eurozone, Barclays faces losses of \u20ac37bn and bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland some \u20ac26bn. If only Greece were to leave the single currency, the Credit Suisse analysts calculate that losses for Europe's banks would be limited to some 5% of the stock market value of banks across the eurozone with French banks and investment banks being hit hardest. Credit Agricole would be worst effected by a Greek exit. The Credit Suisse analysts insist they are not expecting the euro area to break up - or for Greece to leave - but they believe it is likely there will be a dramatic reduction in cross-border business - leading to less loans for businesses and individuals. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that some \u20ac2tn of credit could be lost through a eurozone break up and the Credit Suisse analysts point out they have only analysed the impact on banks they research. Ratings agency Fitch also estimated the impact of a Greek exit from the eurozone. While the direct impact would be minimal, Fitch warned that \"the indirect impact of a Greek redenomination on banks throughout the eurozone could be severe\". \"A robust response from policymakers would be required to prevent contagion, and Fitch would expect a strong public statement of commitment by the European Central Bank and eurozone policymakers to provide support, if required,\" Fitch said. \"Banks in Portugal and Ireland are more vulnerable to contagion risks as these nations could be perceived 'next in line' for a euro exit. If the EU policy response fails to control contagion risks and if bank runs and capital flight were to become a reality, banks in these countries would be under severe stress,\" it said. The Credit Suisse analysts said that banks have been preparing for a potential Greek exit so the impact would be limited, so long as \"it is an orderly event\". But if there is an exit of the five countries in the periphery the the consequences for the banks in those countries would be substantial\"with some of them having their tangible equity largely wiped out\". Among those which would fall into this category are Intesa Sanpaolo in Italy. \"",

Roughly 10% of CWW investors are from across the pond and this is good news for Vodafone, which needs all the support it can get.

Better to take the cash than back a halfhearted turnaround plan by a chief executive who was hired, many think, to sell the company.

    "webTitle": "Martin Sorrell pay row exposes WPP chairman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\"Do not fiddle with the market mechanism,\" declared WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell in his great defence of his pay arrangements. Now the market, in the form of the owners of WPP, has spoken: 59.5% of votes were cast against the company's pay report. Sorrell has to face the fact that most voting shareholders don't think he deserved a 60% increase in his pay package to \u00a36.8m. The sensible response would to apologise, concede that shareholders' views must be respected and to pledge to reduce the current year's potential bonus jackpot. Any other course would invite the accusation that Sorrell treats WPP as his own firm, or that the non-executives have tin ears. The man himself hardly helped to dispel the former idea in his now-famous letter to the FT. It's true, of course, that Sorrell took a personal risk in 1985 when, fresh out of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, he borrowed \u00a3250,000 to buy a 15% stake in Wire &amp; Plastic Products with the intention of building a global advertising business. Nor could anybody doubt his continued personal investment in WPP shares \u2014 \u00a340m over the years, he says. But a substantial personal commitment and commercial success can't alter the simple fact that Sorrell's stake, worth \u00a3140m, represents a holding of less than 2% in modern-day WPP. He's issued a lot of shares to fund deals over the years and an awful lot more to prevent the company's near-collapse in the early 1990s. And when you don't own 98% of the company, you can't always call the shots. The plea from WPP chairman Philip Lader is that the board \"exercised its best judgment in the context of the company's record year, international competitors, and the executives' performance.\" Well, OK, there's no easy answer to the question of what Sorrell should be paid. But a year ago, 41% of WPP shareholders voted against the pay report. That ought to have served as a warning to the board not to push its luck on pay. Instead, Sorrell's salary was increased by 30% and his maximum potential bonus was inflated. Today's defeat was entirely predictable. The less predictable \u2014 and fascinating \u2014 result was the votes of 20%-plus against the re-election of three directors: Jeffrey Rosen, head of the pay committee (21.8%), and non-executives Ruigang Li (28.7%) and Koichiro Naganuma (29.7%). Such levels of dissent are almost unheard of at FTSE 100 companies.

      "body": "<p>\"Do not fiddle with the market mechanism,\" declared WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell in his great defence of his pay arrangements. Now the market, in the form of the owners of WPP, has spoken: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/13/wpp-shareholders-vote-against-sorrell-pay\" title=\"\">59.5% of votes were cast against the company's pay report</a>. Sorrell has to face the fact that most voting shareholders don't think he deserved a 60% increase in his pay package to \u00a36.8m.</p> <p>The sensible response would to apologise, concede that shareholders' views must be respected and to pledge to reduce the current year's potential bonus jackpot. Any other course would invite the accusation that Sorrell treats WPP as his own firm, or that the non-executives have tin ears.</p> <p>The man himself hardly helped to dispel the former idea in his now-famous letter to the FT. It's true, of course, that Sorrell took a personal risk in 1985 when, fresh out of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, he borrowed \u00a3250,000 to buy a 15% stake in Wire &amp; Plastic Products with the intention of building a global advertising business. Nor could anybody doubt his continued personal investment in WPP shares \u2014 \u00a340m over the years, he says.</p> <p>But a substantial personal commitment and commercial success can't alter the simple fact that Sorrell's stake, worth \u00a3140m, represents a holding of less than 2% in modern-day WPP. He's issued a lot of shares to fund deals over the years and an awful lot more to prevent the company's near-collapse in the early 1990s. And when you don't own 98% of the company, you can't always call the shots.</p> <p>The plea from WPP chairman Philip Lader is that the board \"exercised its best judgment in the context of the company's record year, international competitors, and the executives' performance.\" Well, OK, there's no easy answer to the question of what Sorrell should be paid. But a year ago, 41% of WPP shareholders voted against the pay report. That ought to have served as a warning to the board not to push its luck on pay. Instead, Sorrell's salary was increased by 30% and his maximum potential bonus was inflated. Today's defeat was entirely predictable.</p> <p>The less predictable \u2014 and fascinating \u2014 result was the votes of 20%-plus against the re-election of three directors: Jeffrey Rosen, head of the pay committee (21.8%), and non-executives Ruigang Li (28.7%) and Koichiro Naganuma (29.7%). Such levels of dissent are almost unheard of at FTSE 100 companies. The moral for Lader, the former US ambassador who saw 10.8% cast against his own re-election, should be clear: the row over pay threatens to become a crisis of confidence in how WPP is governed.</p> <p>Part of the reason, one suspects, is that there's little evidence that the board knows how WPP would cope without Sorrell. Everything is in hand, says Lader in the annual report \u2014 \"candid, specific and current\" opinions are exchanged about the best candidates but these \"ongoing deliberations\" must remain strictly confidential \"lest public discussion of this subject foster speculation and distraction.\" In other words, dear shareholder, don't ask. That's not the best way to win friends in your hour of need: Lader needs to raise his game.</p>",

The easyGroup tycoon, who is embroiled in a long-running boardroom battle with easyJet, is backing a carrier that will operate under his Fastjet airline and be run by former easyJet executives. Fastjet will operate from Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana and Angola. The ambition is to carry more than 12 million passengers a year, from the 500,000 at present, by cashing in on demand for regional travel from a burgeoning African middle-class. EasyJet remained tight-lipped about the move, referring queries to a statement made last year that said the Luton-based airline would take \"necessary action\" if Fastjet infringed its rights. However, Ed Winter, Fastjet's chief executive-in-waiting and formerly easyJet's chief operating officer, said the airline would avoid antagonising its European peer. \"We have been 100% careful. We are absolutely aware of the agreement, and so is Stelios, and we are not infringing it in any way,\" he said. Under the terms of Wednesday's announcement, an Aim-listed cash shell company called Rubicon has bought the aviation arm of Lonrho, an ancestor of the pan-African conglomerate formerly run by Tiny Rowland, in a deal worth $85.7m (\u00a355m). As part of the deal, easyGroup will own 5% of Rubicon, and the airline will use Lonrho Aviation's network. It will operate from the Lonrho hubs in the four African countries. Operating as Fly540, Winter said a 12-million passenger target was feasible. \"If you take the four countries, they have a total population of 100 million people. If you estimate that all our customers come from just those countries alone, you could see three million of them becoming customers with us, flying a couple of times a year. That would generate something like 12.8 million passengers [annually].\" Winter said Fastjet would launch towards the end of the summer but not use its fleet of 10 turboprops and small jets. Instead it would seek to lease larger modern jets like the Boeing 737 or Airbus A319. Another former easyJet director set to join Fastjet is Richard Boden. He said the business would aim at the west African market. \"There is a significant shortage of direct point-to-point flying within the continent, particularly with west Africa. It is very difficult to get from capital city to capital city.\" However, the financial health of African airlines remains fragile. According to the International Air Transport Association, airline traffic in the continent will grow by 4% this year, but African carriers will make a collective loss of $100m in 2012, having made no profit in 2011 and a profit of $100m in 2010. EasyJet has been locked in a dispute with Haji-Ioannou since 2008 over its capacity plans and the purchase of new Airbus aircraft, although another dispute over further use of the easyJet brand was settled in a deal that could earn the tycoon at least \u00a365m over 10 years. Haji-Ioannou and his family control 37.5% of the airline. Haji-Ioannou said the move would help bring low-cost air travel to more Africans. \"This is another small but significant step in bringing the dream of low-cost air travel to millions of people in Africa \u2013 the aviation industry's last frontier. Past experience shows that by halving fares, a successful low-cost carrier can encourage those people, who have never previously travelled by air, to fly.\"",
