      "bodyText": "The Volkswagen chief executive and his predecessor are facing an investigation by German authorities into whether they misled investors by not releasing information about the company\u2019s cheating on diesel emissions tests soon enough. Prosecutors in Stuttgart yesterday formally launched their case against Matthias M\u00fcller and his predecessor Martin Winterkorn, who resigned as VW chief executive when the diesel emissions scandal broke in September 2015. The investigation relates to their role as executives in 2015 at Stuttgart-based Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the holding company that controls Volkswagen. Porsche SE chairman Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch is also under investigation. Prosecutors confirmed media reports that Germany\u2019s federal financial supervisory authority filed a complaint in 2016 asking prosecutors to investigate executives from the holding company. They are accused \u201cof knowingly delaying telling shareholders about the financial consequences for Porsche SE of software manipulation in diesel vehicles by Volkswagen AG\u201d. Porsche SE said in a statement: \u201cWe are convinced that we have duly fulfilled our capital market disclosure requirements.\u201d A Volkswagen spokesman refused to comment on the prosecutors\u2019 statement when contacted by Agence France-Presse. VW has admitted equipping around 11m cars worldwide with software that sensed when cars were on test stands and turned emission controls up, then turned the controls off during every day driving to improve performance. It has agreed to at least $16bn (\u00a312bn) in civil settlements with environmental authorities and car owners in the US, and to a $4.3bn criminal penalty. Seven VW executives have been criminally charged in the US. The company also faces investor lawsuits in Germany alleging it did not inform shareholders of the scandal quickly enough. VW says it met its duties. The company apologised for the scandal and says it is changing its culture and practices. In a separate development on Wednesday, the EU launched legal action against Italy over claims it overlooked attempts by Fiat Chrysler to cheat on diesel emission tests. Italy has become the latest member state to be accused by the European commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive body \u2013 of ignoring the installation of so-called defeat devices in cars, in a scandal that continues to reveal both the alleged illegal practices of major manufacturers and the weakness of national regulators. The move by the European commission against Italy came despite a last-minute call for a postponement by its government. In a statement, Italy\u2019s transport minister, Graziano Delrio, claimed there was a \u201cneed to delay the start of the infringement procedure\u201d to allow for further clarifications. The plea fell on deaf ears, and Italy now joins the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Spain and the United Kingdom in being formally accused by the EU of failing to regulate the use of cheat devices. In January, the US EPA alleged that Fiat Chrysler had used \u201cmanagement software\u201d that \u201cincreases air pollution\u201d from nitrogen oxides over a three-year period in its Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Ram vehicles. Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, responsible for internal market, industry, entrepreneurship and SMEs, said: \u201cCar manufacturers have been treating emission tests laxly \u2013 some have even broken the law. The emissions scandal has shown that the responsibility to enforce the law and punish those who violate it can no longer be left solely to individual member states. \u201cWhile the European parliament and member states have recently made good progress on our proposal to overhaul the current system, it\u2019s high time that they reach a final agreement. Citizens\u2019 health and trust is at stake and we have no time to lose.\u201d Under current EU law, national authorities are responsible for checking that a car type meets all EU standards before individual cars can be sold on the single market. When a car manufacturer breaches the legal requirements, national authorities are expected to recall models and \u201capply effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties laid out in national legislation\u201d. Ugo Taddei, a lawyer for ClientEarth, said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s action highlights that the Italian government tried to whitewash emissions cheating by Fiat Chrysler rather than protect the health of its citizens. \u201cThe Italian case is particularly alarming but, unfortunately, this reluctance to deal with the problem of emissions controls strategies employed by car manufacturers is a pan-European failure.\u201d Fiat Chrysler has previously rejected the allegations against it, saying that it \u201cbelieves that its emission control systems meet the applicable requirements\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The release of the latest wages data saw yet another record set for low growth. The figures show that not only are real wages lower than they were four years ago, but that the hopes of the budget returning to surplus rely on wage growth that is completely incompatible with current levels of underemployment. The Bureau of Statistics estimates that in the past year wages for all workers grew by just 1.9% \u2013 equal with the record low set in the December quarter (although at 1.865% the current rate is marginally lower than the 1.874% of December): And while the overall growth is decidedly at dire levels, the real damage is in the private sector. In the March quarter, private sector wages grew by just 0.4% in trend terms \u2013 a level achieved only four times before. But the public sector actually saw a slight improvement \u2013 its 0.6% increase in March was the best quarterly growth since September 2015: That meant that while annual public sector wage growth improved from 2.25% to 2.3%, private sector wages grew in the past year by a paltry 1.7%: The big driver of public sector wages was in Victoria, which saw a 1% jump in March. Canberra public servants by contrast saw their wages grow on average by just 0.3%: For private sector workers, however, the picture is dire all over the nation. The fall to 1.7% was just the latest in a nearly five-year run of falling growth. In the past six years, the annual growth of private sector wages has risen just once: This pathetic growth is below the latest inflation growth figure of 2.1% and even below the more stable underlying inflation growth figure of 1.9%. It means that real wages for private sector workers fell in the past year: But alas, once again this is nothing new. Real wages for private sector workers have not increased for more than four years \u2013 a longer period of stagnation than occurred during the GFC: It means most workers would have less purchasing power now than they had at the end of 2012. So what is driving this low wages growth? Clearly the issue is not unemployment. While the current level of 5.9% is a touch higher than 12 months ago, it is not so much higher that it means the employment sector is significantly weaker. The problem (as I have noted before) is that the link between wages growth and unemployment has completely broken down. Normally, when unemployment falls, wages growth rises. But that relationship collapsed about two years ago. In December 2014 the unemployment rate was 6.2% \u2013 higher than now, but wages were growing at 2.5%. Since then while unemployment has improved, wages growth has worsened. Normally with an unemployment rate of 5.9% wages would be growing by 3.3% - almost twice as fast as the current rate: So what happened to break the relationship and cause this record low wages growth? Underemployment. Unemployment and underemployment usually move in synch. The unemployment rate is always a bit lower than the underemployment rate, but when one falls, so does the other \u2013 that occurred even during the GFC. But at the end of 2014, the two went their separate ways \u2013 unemployment fell, but underemployment rose to record highs: And in the past two years the relationship between wages and unemployment also decided it was time for a trial separation \u2013 a separation that is now almost a total divorce. It is why the relationship between wages is now closer to the underemployment rate. While wages growth is a touch below where it should be given the current level of 8.6% underemployment, with such high underemployment we would still expect wages growth only marginally above inflation: And while this is bad for workers, it is also bad for the budget. Remember that last week\u2019s budget projections forecast strong wages growth over the next three years. By 2020-21 the budget predicts wages will be growing by 3.75% a year, despite unemployment then predicted to be only 5.25%. So while unemployment is expected to fall just half a percentage point, wages growth is expected to increase by more than double the current rate of 1.9%? Now that might be possible but it would also require a massive fall in underemployment \u2013 something that is unlikely to occur given the budget also projects employment to grow annually by a less-than-stellar 1.5% over the next three years. And full-time employment as a rule grows slower than overall employment. In the past, governments thought that if they worried about unemployment, underemployment would take care of itself. The past two years have shown that not to be the case and it has led to a precipitous drop in wages growth for workers. Unless that situation changes, not only will workers continue to see their real wages barely rise, Scott Morrison\u2019s budget projection of a surplus in 2020-21 will continue to be barely credible.",

But that relationship collapsed about two years ago. In December 2014 the unemployment rate was 6.2% \u2013 higher than now, but wages were growing at 2.5%. </p> \n<p> Since then while unemployment has improved, wages growth has worsened. Normally with an unemployment rate of 5.9% wages would be growing by 3.3% - almost twice as fast as the current rate:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Phillips curve - wage growth v unemployment rate\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n7bCs/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p> So what happened to break the relationship and cause this record low wages growth? Underemployment.</p> \n<p> Unemployment and underemployment usually move in synch. The unemployment rate is always a bit lower than the underemployment rate, but when one falls, so does the other \u2013 that occurred even during the GFC. </p> \n<p> But at the end of 2014, the two went their separate ways \u2013 unemployment fell, but underemployment rose to record highs:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in unemployment &amp; underemployment rates past deade\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Uwqaq/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p> And in the past two years the relationship between wages and unemployment also decided it was time for a trial separation \u2013 a separation that is now almost a total divorce. It is why the relationship between wages is now closer to the underemployment rate.</p> \n<p>While wages growth is a touch below where it should be given the current level of 8.6% underemployment, with such high underemployment we would still expect wages growth only marginally above inflation:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wage growth v underemployment rate\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/evWN4/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p> And while this is bad for workers, it is also bad for the budget. </p> \n<p> Remember that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/11/can-we-trust-the-budget-figures-on-wages-growth-my-eyebrow-is-raised\">last week\u2019s budget projections</a> forecast strong wages growth over the next three years. By 2020-21 the budget predicts wages will be growing by 3.75% a year, despite unemployment then predicted to be only 5.25%. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/may/09/australia-federal-budget-2017-10-graphs-you-need-to-see-greg-jericho\">Federal budget 2017: the 10 graphs you need to see | Greg Jericho</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> So while unemployment is expected to fall just half a percentage point, wages growth is expected to increase by more than double the current rate of 1.9%?</p> \n<p> Now that might be possible but it would also require a massive fall in underemployment \u2013 something that is unlikely to occur given the budget also projects employment to grow annually by a less-than-stellar 1.5% over the next three years. And full-time employment as a rule grows slower than overall employment.</p> \n<p> In the past, governments thought that if they worried about unemployment, underemployment would take care of itself. The past two years have shown that not to be the case and it has led to a precipitous drop in wages growth for workers. </p> \n<p> Unless that situation changes, not only will workers continue to see their real wages barely rise, Scott Morrison\u2019s budget projection of a surplus in 2020-21 will continue to be barely credible. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"943b461f-22d2-4d4b-9ce6-afe9e7e13f15\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbtcaR_48Vo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen> </iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Up to a point, one can forgive the excitement. It would be churlish not to acknowledge that Lloyds was indeed in a mess and in danger of a relapse before Horta-Os\u00f3rio arrived in 2011. Then he faced the stiff challenge of getting through the tide of compensation claims for his predecessors\u2019 PPI sins. Lloyds\u2019 staff have done a decent job. And, given that Horta-Os\u00f3rio has a \u00a3850,000 bonus riding on the disposal of all the government\u2019s shares in the bank (part of the \u00a338m he\u2019s earned along the way), his mood of celebration is understandable. It\u2019s just that it all feels slightly over the top. You can cut the investment return in many ways. A \u00a3894m profit over nine years on a \u00a320.3bn punt isn\u2019t much to shout about if you annualise the return. But, in any case, turning a profit wasn\u2019t the primary purpose of rescuing the banks: the deed was done to protect depositors and save the UK economy from a bigger meltdown. Let\u2019s not forget, too, that Lloyds started with the immeasurable advantage of being the biggest retail bank in the UK by a country mile. It has a 25% share of UK current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% of mortgages. Yes, the balance sheet was in \u201ca very fragile condition\u201d, but the market position was commanding and being made to sell TSB made only a minor dent. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, thankfully, remembered to look forwards, saying: \u201cThe job is not done.\u201d Let\u2019s hear more of that. The backslapping feels like it started in 2014 when Lloyds resumed paying dividends. It\u2019s time to give it a rest. SSE dividend growth has at least another lap before energy price cap In the corporate world, a commitment is a commitment right up until the moment is broken. So you can\u2019t blame SSE, the energy group with an unbroken record of dividend growth stretching back to privatisation in 1989, for saying that it continues to aim to increase distributions to shareholders by at least the rate of inflation. If retail price caps lie around the corner, however, this ambition has never looked so hard to fulfil. SSE\u2019s dividend cover already looks thin, even by the standards of the utility industry. At the bottom end of the official target range \u2013 which is the end at which SSE expects to land \u2013 the dividend would be covered only 1.2 times by earnings this year. How much damage would a price cap do? Impossible to tell until the next government puts the industry out of its misery and explains the details. SSE, it should be noted, is a much broader business than energy supply. Its networks and power generation divisions contributed larger slices to overall operating profits of \u00a31.87bn last year. Yet the \u00a3389m of profit from supply, where most of the customers are on standard variable tariffs, looks dangerously exposed to government intervention. When push comes to shove, SSE\u2019s dividend should be able to survive at least one more lap of the track unscathed. The company has more generation capacity coming on stream soon, and the wheels of government do not turn quickly. But thereafter? Shareholders should read the small print: \u201cThe level of dividend cover is subject to \u2026 material change in sector regulation.\u201d You bet. Wall Street\u2019s reaction to the Trump show is tame in the extreme Financial markets supposedly offer a clean and clinical assessment of risk. Yet they are a reliably terrible guide to political risk. It is only now, with political commentators assessing the odds on impeachment, that one sees the first twitches of concern about President Trump. The US stock market had a bad day on Wednesday and the dollar has given up all its gains since last November\u2019s election. This reaction is surely tame in the extreme given the pace of events in Washington. Even now, Wall Street continues to debate the chances, or otherwise, of Trump\u2019s infrastructure spending boom arriving on schedule. That stuff is easy to process in a spreadsheet, but it\u2019s hardly the full political story \u2013 and hasn\u2019t been for months.",

After deliberating for months, the three appeals judges delivered their judgment on Wednesday in a 16,000-word ruling that found the KitKat shape was not a \u201cbadge of origin\u201d. \u201cWe are concerned here with ... the three-dimensional shape of a chocolate product, that has no inherent distinctiveness,\u201d said Lord Justice Kitchin. The ruling marks the latest stage in a bitter-tasting battle between Nestl\u00e9 and Mondel\u0113z, the US owner of Cadbury, that have been battling over the KitKat trademark for seven years. Nestle\u2019s appeal followed a UK high court ruling in January last year that blocked the trademark attempt. The European court of justice had previously found that the four-fingered shape, breaking apart with a snap, was not distinctive enough to merit a trademark and that such a designation would not comply with European law. The ruling clears the way for competitors, including the major supermarkets as well as other confectioners, to produce their own copycat KitKats without fear of legal consequences. But a Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson indicated the Swiss firm was not necessarily prepared to give up, saying it was considering its next move. The company could potentially try to take the case to the UK supreme court. \u201cNestl\u00e9 is disappointed by the court of appeal judgment and is considering its next steps,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cKitKat is much loved around the world and its four-finger shape is well known by consumers. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s four-finger shape has been granted trademark registration in many countries of the world, for instance Germany, France, Australia, South Africa and Canada, further protecting it from imitations.\u201d Following the appeal ruling, a Mondel\u0113z spokesperson said: \u201cAs we have previously stated, we do not believe the shape of the KitKat bar should be protected as a trademark in the UK.\u201d The case turned on whether a the product\u2019s shapewas sufficiently distinctive to the brand to prevent any other manufacturer using a similar format. Protected \u201cshape marks\u201d are not without precedent \u2014 Toblerone, which is owned by Mondel\u0113z, has successfully trademarked its \u201czigzag prism\u201d shape. But the appeal judges found that while the four-finger shape might be \u201cvery well known\u201d in association with KitKat, \u201cthat does not necessarily mean that the public have come to perceive the shape as a badge of origin such that they would rely upon it alone to identify the product as coming from a particular source. \u201cThey might simply regard the shape as a characteristic of products of that kind or they might find it brings to mind the product and brand name with which they have become familiar. \u201cThese kinds of recognition and association do not amount to distinctiveness for trademark purposes.\u201d The judges also noted that the chocolate bar\u2019s shape had not been central to its marketing in recent years: \u201cIt has nothing, therefore, to do with the informed choices that consumers make between similar products.\u201d The judges heard that Nestl\u00e9 had spent between \u00a33m and \u00a311m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007. More than 40m were sold in Britain in 2010. \u201cThe appeal court\u2019s ruling indicates that shape marks are going to be increasingly difficult to obtain,\u201d said Guy Wilmot, partner who specialises in intellectual property law at Russell-Cooke. \u201cThe court were ... concerned that if they granted the trade mark, Nestl\u00e9 would have a potentially permanent monopoly on the four-finger shape, which they felt would be unfair given that KitKat had never used the shape alone to promote KitKats.\u201d Clare Jackman, an intellectual property lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright, said the fact the two multinationals were prepared to battle through the courts for so long showed the value of what was at stake. \u201cTrademarks are very important and valuable business assets. They confer monopoly rights, so I can see entirely why Nestl\u00e9 thought, \u2018our four-finger bar KitKat has been around for ages, let\u2019s register it, because we can stop anyone from producing a bar in four fingers\u2019\u201d, she said. \u201cIt is typically brand owners in this space that will spend the money and push the boundaries, in trying to get as much protection as possible, because at the end of the day trademarks can potentially last forever, so it really is a signficant monopoly right.\u201d Asked if she could foresee a challenge in supreme court, Jackman said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to rule it out, because I think these are two brand owners who are prepared to push this as far as it can go.\u201d The four-fingered battle is not the only protracted legal disputes between the two confectioners. In 2004, Cadbury attempted to trademark the shade of purple it uses for its Dairy Milk bars, registering Pantone 2685C in a move that was initially successful before the court of appeal backed Nestl\u00e9 challenge in 2013. An attempt last year by Cadbury to resurrect an earlier trademark on the colour was rejected by the high court. The first KitKat-type bar was sold in Britain by Rowntree in 1935, when it was called Chocolate Crisp, and the shape has changed little since then. Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree in 1998. A lookalike called Kvikk Lunsj, translated as \u201cquick lunch\u201d, launched in Norway in 1937 and is available in some UK shops. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 May 2017. The judge\u2019s ruling was not a \u201cbadge of origin\u201d, a previous version said the judge\u2019s ruling was not a \u201cbadge or origin\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Wall Street suffers worst opening this year after Trump allegations \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After all the talk of record highs and low volatility, it was almost inevitable that something would turn up to rock the boat. Equally, it was almost inevitable that something would be the latest Donald Trump developments. The newest controversy involved accusations the president had asked former FBI James Comey to drop his investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. That prompted all sorts of disquiet, and even talk of possible impeachment. Not surprisingly, that sent investors heading for the exits, both for the chaos such a move would cause and also the prospect that even if things did not escalate that far, Trump and the White House would be distracted from their market-friendly tax reforms and infrastructure spending plans. So as Wall Street slumped, European markets followed suit, although the FTSE 100 managed to hold fairly firm, helped by a rise in safe haven gold miners\u2019 shares. But despite the falls, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said there was no need to panic: It says a lot for how quiet markets have been that today\u2019s selloff, which has been rather dramatic relative to the recent past, is being trumpeted in some quarters as the beginning of the next big pullback. There are justifiable reasons for thinking we are due a drop, some of which I have alluded to over the past few weeks - weaker US data, declining participation on indices, and others could all be cited as the culprits. Now is not the time to panic however; the S&amp;P 500 has fallen by 30 points as of 4pm London time, but is still up more than 6% for the year so far. We are not in correction territory just yet, and may not even get there anyway. US banks are some of the hardest hit this afternoon, having been consistent underperformers for two months now. It looks like investors are already beginning to worry that a June rate hike is looking less likely, while the sight of the words \u2018Trump\u2019 and \u2018impeachment\u2019 hint at the possibility that regulatory reform is now off the agenda. In Europe, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.25% or 18.56 points at 7503.47 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.35% to 12,631.61 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.63% lower at 5317.89 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.31% to 21,283.72 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.79% lower at 10,786.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.04% to 789.08 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 260 points or 1.24% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. And more on the dollar falling: While the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are all down more than 1%, the FTSE 100 is off just 0.2%. The US dollar has now lost all the gains it made since Donald Trump was elected president. The dollar index shows: David Madden, market analyst at CMC markets, said: The decline in the US dollar has wiped out all the gains it has made since Donald Trump was elected. The speculation about his impeachment is rising and the dollar is falling in tandem. The decline in UK unemployment gave the pound a boost, and the steady inflation rate from the eurozone gave traders a minor reason to buy the respective currencies, but the moves were magnified by the weaker greenback. Make no mistake, the drop in the US dollar is the reason behind in move in the GBP/USD and the EUR/USD. US crude inventories declined by 1.75m barrels last week, a sign of increasing demand, even though the fall was lower than the expected 2.4m barrel drop. The news has pushed the oil price higher again, with West Texas Intermediate up 1.6% at $49.48 and Brent crude 1.7% better at $52.54. European markets have seen their falls accelarate after Wall Street\u2019s slide. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 121 points and France\u2019s Cac has lost 68 points. The FTSE 100 has fared a little better, falling 26 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After the brief morning distraction of the UK jobs report, focus turned firmly back to Trump\u2019s latest foul-up following the US open. The Dow Jones set the tone this afternoon, the index plunging more than 200 points as the bell rang on Wall Street. That leaves the Dow at its worst price since April 25th, the day investors first got a sniff of Trump\u2019s tax plan. The dollar fared no better; it slid 1.4% against the Japanese yen and 0.3% against the pound, while remaining at a 6 month low against the euro. Investors have been shaken by reports that Trump urged the then-FBI chief Comey to drop his investigation into Michael Flynn, the latest twist in the Russia saga that is gradually engulfing the President. There are a couple of reasons as to why this has caused such jittery trading. Firstly, it threatens to delay, or completely derail, Trump\u2019s market-lifting infrastructure and tax policies. Secondly, and more drastically, it could actually lead to impreachment... an eventuality that would completely erase the foundations of the market\u2019s recent record highs. In the Eurozone the DAX and CAC performed just as badly as their US counterpart, dropping 0.9% and 1.2% respectively. The FTSE, on the other hand, was more resilient; though it did fall by 25 or so points, this still kept it at or around the 7500 mark. The UK index is being somewhat supported by the likes of Fresnillo and Randgold Resources, which both benefited from gold\u2019s 1.6% rise. Here is the damage to the Dow: Banks are among the fallers as the US market decline continues. The S&amp;P 500 banking index is down 1.8% with Bank of America off 2% and JP Morgan 1.7% lower. Meanwhile the Dow is now down 215 points or just over 1%. Meanwhile the VIX volatility index - the fear index - has moved higher after hitting a 24 year low earlier this week. It has jumped 20% to 12.69 in the wake of the latest Trump revelations. US markets have made their worst start to the year following the latest allegations about Donald Trump trying to interfere with a federal investigation. After news of a leaked memo from sacked FBI director James Comey, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 180 points or 0.88%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.8% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.94%. Of course both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq have been at or close to their record highs until now. Back in the US, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now forecast to open around 170 points lower, as investors fret about the latest shennanigans in the White House. But it doesn\u2019t seem to be panic level yet. Time for a quick recap. Britain is facing a new cost-of-living squeeze after wages failed to keep up with rising prices. Basis pay only rose by 2.1% per year during the January-March quarter, figure released by the Office for National Statistics showed. That\u2019s weaker than CPI inflation, which averaged 2.3% during the quarter, and jumped to 2.7% in April. Public sector workers face the biggest pressure; their regular pay only rose by 1.3% year-on-year, meaning their real wages are falling fast. Economists say that the figures show that the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote is now hitting earners. It is likely to dent consumer spending this year. However, the UK economy is still creating jobs. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6%, the lowest since Harold Wilson was running the country in 1975. Employment is at a record high, too, with 31.95 million people in work. That\u2019s 122,000 more than in October to December 2016 and 381,000 more than for a year earlier. ING called it \u201castonishing\u201d. Here\u2019s our news story on the figures: Now this might surprise you... London now has a higher unemployment rate than any other region in the UK. Unemployment in the capital has risen to 6.1% in the first three months of 2017, new ONS statistics show, up from 5.5% in the previous quarter. The lowest unemployment rate was in the South East, at just 3.5%. The ONS says: Allowing for some individual volatility, the overall pattern for the last few years has been for gently falling unemployment rates. The highest unemployment rate in the UK for January to March 2017 was for London at 6.1%. This follows a period of a number of years when the highest unemployment rate was consistently the North East. Londoners also worked the longest average working week, at 33.7 hours; the lowest was in Yorkshire and The Humber at 31.3 hours. The latest stunning developments from the Trump White House are likely to weigh on the US stock market today. The Dow Jones industrial average, and the wider S&amp;P 500 index, are both expected to fall by around 0.75% when trading begins in around one hour. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says \u201ca feeling of unease\u201d has gripped the markets today, pushing shares down in Asia and Europe. With the latest bombshell developments in the Trump saga seen as an obstacle that may delay the proposed fiscal spending further, Wall Street should follow the bearish cues from Asian and European markets this afternoon. The pound has gained half a cent today, to $1.296, as traders applaud the latest rise in UK employment. Sterling is also benefitting from the political upheaval on the other side of the Atlantic, following those reports that Donald Trump had pushed former FBI director James Comey to drop investigations into Michael Flynn, former national security advisor. The pound hasn\u2019t traded over $1.30 since last September. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: The $1.30 level is again coming into sight, with the dollar weighed down by worries that President Trump could find it trickier to forge ahead with his intended economic reforms amid reports of interference into an FBI investigation into links between his campaign team and Russia. Over in Greece, clashes have broken out between demonstrators and riot police during protests against the country\u2019s austerity programme. Violence erupted outside parliament between hooded \u201canti-establishment\u201d demonstrators throwing rocks and flares, and riot officers, who fired tear gas. Earlier, thousands of strikers had marched through Greece, opposing the latest package of tax rises and economic reforms agreed between Athens and its lenders -- which MPs vote on tomorrow night. Addressing crowds in Athens\u2019 square of national resistance, the leader of the communist party Dimitris Koutsoumbas said: \u201cEssentially a class war is underway .. these harsh unpopular measures, the fourth memorandum along with all the previous memorandums, should be thrown in the basket of history.\u201d As Greek MPs began debating the measures, trade unionists told the Guardian that there will be a massive show of protest culminating with a demonstration outside parliament on Thursday night when the chamber is expected to pass the bill. \u201cThis is the 32nd general strike since 2010 [when the Greek debt crisis erupted] and we are not going to give up,\u201d said Grigoris Kalomoiris who heads the public sector workers\u2019 union, Adedy. Kalomoiris added: \u201cFor some the pension cuts that these policies will bring will amount to the loss of two pensions while the lowering of the tax [threshold] will mean the loss of a monthly salary. Some of us are not going to accept that without a fight.\u201d There is major disquiet in the ranks of the ruling Syriza party with leftwing MPS saying they have been \u201cpushed to the limit\u201d by the latest cost-cutting measures. Although no defections are expected \u2013 with the prospect of losing power viewed as the biggest incentive now spurring MPs in the governing two-party coalition to endorse the policies \u2013 many have privately described the measures as unconstitutional. \u201cMany [cadres] would like to be out in the streets [protesting] not in parliament supporting these measures,\u201d said one. \u201cBut the alternative [default and euro exit] is just not on the cards. Everyone agrees it would be catastrophic.\u201d The policies, which will see pensions being pared back by another 18%, will not be enforced until 2019 towards the end of the present government\u2019s four-year term in office. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has argued that counter-measures offsetting losses will effectively neutralise the cuts for those expected to be hardest hit by them. Britain\u2019s poor productivity and weak pay are inextricably linked, argues the CBI, which represents UK businesses. To get wages higher, firms need to boost their output -- and the key is to boost research and development spending. UK R&amp;D is equivalent to just 1.7% of gross domestic product today; the CBI is pushing the government to set a target of 3%. Alpesh Paleja, CBI Principal Economist, says: \u201cRising employment continues to reinforce the importance of the UK\u2019s flexible labour market. \u201cHowever, weakening productivity and slower pay growth, coupled with rising inflation, will continue to squeeze real household earnings. \u201cTherefore maintaining the UK\u2019s reputation as a great place to do business, for example by increasing R&amp;D spend to 3% of GDP by 2025, will help boost the UK\u2019s productivity. This is the only sustainable route to higher wages, and better living standards.\u201d If Britain\u2019s jobless rate is really at a 40-odd year low, why doesn\u2019t it feel like a nation at full employment? Our economics editor Larry Elliott has highlighted three reasons: One reason for the weakness of earnings growth is the ferocious squeeze on public sector pay, which \u2013 stripped of bonus payments \u2013 is rising at just 1.3% a year. A second factor is that employers are able to buy in cheap labour from overseas. Migration from other EU countries has not fallen off a cliff despite the result of last summer\u2019s referendum: according to the Office for National Statistics, the number of non-UK nationals from the EU working in the UK rose by 171,000 to 2.32 million between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. This continues a trend, which has seen the number of workers from the other 27 EU countries double since the recession of 2008-09. Finally, the nature of work seems to have changed. Work by David Blanchflower, Rui Costa and Stephen Machin has shown that earnings growth for the self-employed \u2013 who account for 15% of the workforce \u2013 has been particularly weak in recent years. People are working flat out in the gig economy but still struggling to make ends meet. The labour market has, for want of a better word, been Uberised. Here\u2019s John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, on today\u2019s labour market report: \u201cThese figures bring home the Tories\u2019 total failure to improve the living standards of working families. \u201cReal wages are lower than they were in 2010 and, after seven years of the Tories, they are now falling again. \u201cThe choice at this election couldn\u2019t be clearer: either a Tory party presiding over a crisis in living standards or a Labour government that will build a Britain for the many, not the few.\u201d New productivity figures have also been released this morning, and they\u2019re a shocker. Productivity across the UK economy shrank by 0.5% in the first three months of 2017, the first fall since the end of 2015. It\u2019s because the UK economy took on more workers, who worked longer hours, but didn\u2019t deliver a corresponding rise in economic output. The decline fall in real wages is particularly painful for workers, because pay packets hadn\u2019t clawed back all the losses since the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrats are blaming the Brexit vote for the slump in real wages. Sir Vince Cable, the former business secretary, says workers are paying the price for the plunge in sterling last June. \u201cThis squeeze on living standards is almost certainly caused by the falling pound since the Brexit vote. \u201cIf Theresa May is allowed to pursue her extreme Brexit agenda, we can expect further weakening of the economy and erosion of people\u2019s living standards. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have to settle for a bad Brexit deal that will cost jobs and push up prices. A brighter future is possible. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats will give you the final say on the deal, with a chance to reject it and stay in the EU.\u201d Britain\u2019s wage squeeze threatens to undermine the economic recovery, warns Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. If the disparity between pay and price growth continues to increase as we predict, household spending is likely to slow further, weakening overall economic activity. \u201cThe next government must do more to close the skills gap, including improving the transition from education to work by guaranteeing universal experience of work in all schools for under 16s, and delivering a future immigration regime based on economic need, rather than an arbitrary migration target. This will help firms compete on the global stage, boosting UK productivity and growth.\u201d Dutch bank ING says that Britain enjoyed an \u201castonishing\u201d jump in employment last month. The real standout in today\u2019s UK jobs report was the surge in employment growth. The three month on three month average came in well above consensus at 122k, lifted by a huge 340k \u201csingle month\u201d increase in jobs \u2013 the highest in 2 years. This is hard to square given recent survey data, which suggests the outlook for hiring is more muted. But they\u2019re concerned by the fall in real wages, which is likely to prevent an interest rate hike before 2019. It\u2019s also hard to ignore the fact that wages are now growing at a noticeably slower pace than prices. The key measure of wage growth, which excludes bonuses, came in at 2.1%. When taken together with yesterday\u2019s acceleration in inflation to 2.7%, real wages are now falling. We\u2019ve already seen measures of consumer activity slow through the first quarter. The slump in real wages last quarter means Britain is facing its worst decade for pay since the Napoleonic Wars, says the Resolution Foundation. It fears the situation will get worse this year. Stephen Clarke, their economic analyst, explains: \u201cBritain kicked off the year with another welcome record on employment, and another big fall in unemployment. This welcome jobs boost will provide a much needed boost to family incomes. \u201cHowever, the good news on jobs is not feeding through to positive news on pay growth, which turned negative at the start of the year and looks set to remain below inflation throughout most of 2017. \u201cComing so soon after the big post-crisis pay squeeze, this new phase of falling pay means that this decade is set to be the worst in over 200 years for pay packets.\u201d Here\u2019s Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at the Work Foundation, on today\u2019s jobs figures: \u201cThe latest employment figures indicate remarkably strong performance, with unemployment falling by 53000 over the first quarter of the year to a rate of 4.6%. Indeed, unemployment has fallen in every region except London and the South East. This has been primarily due to a large increase in the number of full-time employees in employment (some 196000 across the UK). The number of part-time employees has meanwhile fallen (by 61000). There has been little change in the number of self-employed workers over the quarter. \u201cOn pay, the data are less encouraging. In the first quarter of the year, the year-on-year growth in total pay amounted to 2.4%. This is below the current rate of price inflation and indicates a renewed squeeze in real pay. The pay data indicate a collapse in wage settlements in the construction industry, and this is significant because much of the employment growth in the last part of 2016 came from that sector. While welcoming the strong employment growth evidenced in the first quarter\u2019s figures, sustaining this into the longer term may therefore prove challenging.\u201d Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group says some of the charts in today\u2019s labour market report are \u201castonishing\u201d. Britain is still creating jobs. It just isn\u2019t paying people enough to protect them from the rising cost of living. Today\u2019s labour market report shows that the number of people in work in the UK increased by 122,000 in the 3 months to March 2017 to 31.95 million. Around 200,000 full-time jobs were created, while the number of part time jobs fell by 78,000. This drove the employment rate to a new record high of 74.8%. This chart shows how the gap between inflation (2.7% in April) and basic pay growth (2.1% in January-March) has widened, driving real wages into the red. Including bonuses, wages rose by 2.4% year-on-year, thanks to \u201cbonuses in the finance and insurance sector\u201d. Breaking! Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since 1975. The jobless rate fell to 4.6% in the January-March quarter, down from 4.7% a month ago, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u2019s lower than expected, and implies that the jobs market is holding up in the face of Brexit. But there\u2019s bad news too. Real wages are shrinking, as workers \u2013 particularly in the private sector \u2013 suffer from rising inflation. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings increased by 2.1% in the quarter, that\u2019s the weakest growth since the three months to July 2016. That means wages are not keeping pace with inflation -- which was 2.3% in February and March, and 2.7% in April. The ONS says: The recent increase in consumer price inflation including owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs has seen the annual rate of real wage growth (excluding bonuses) turn negative for the first time since the 3 months to September 2014. The pay squeeze is particularly painful for public sector workers. Private sector regular pay grew by 2.3% in the 3 months to March 2017, while public sector pay grew by 1.3%, compared with the same period a year ago. More to follow!

The UK government is patting itself on the back after finally extricating itself from the Lloyds Banking Group share register. Britain has sold its final tranche of shares in Lloyds, more than eight years after rescuing the bank during the financial crisis of 2008 Lloyds claims that the taxpayer has made an \u00a3900m profit - a point repeated by chancellor Philip Hammond on Twitter. But it\u2019s not quite as simple as that, as my colleague Jill Treanor explains: There are a number of ways of calculating the cost of the bailout. The calculations by Lloyds do not include the \u00a33.6bn cost of borrowing funds in the depths of the 2008 crisis, while the Office for Budget Responsibility has used other methodology to show the government will ultimately break even. It also doesn\u2019t cover inflation, of course, or the other ways in which \u00a320bn could have been used for the public good... Shares in cybersecurity firm Sophos have hit a new record high, up 8%, after beating City forecasts this morning. Sophos posted an operating profit of $38.3m after growing revenues by 10%, with \u201cexceptionally strong\u201d cash flow growth. That growth could pick up this year, after the WannaCry outbreak refocused everyone\u2019s attention on the threat of cybercrime. Sophos\u2019s clients include the NHS, which was struck badly by last Friday\u2019s megahack..... The gold price has hit a two-week high this morning, as the dollar weakens and investors seek a safe haven for their money. Gold is changing hands at $1.243 per ounce, the highest since May 3rd. There\u2019s a \u2018risk off\u2019 mood in the City today, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets, after the New York Times reported that Donald Trump had asked James Comey to end the inquiry into Michael Flynn. What investors are worried about is that the impeachment could take place over in the US as the odds are showing more than 50 percent for such an event after the New York Times released its article. If such scenario does become a reality, we could literally say good bye to Trump\u2019s reflation trade. Anxiety over the unfolding political crisis in America has his European stock markets. The main indices are all falling in early trading, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 dropping back from yesterday\u2019s record high. It\u2019s not a major selloff, but there\u2019s certainly some jitteriness in the markets today. Paul Donovan of UBS explains: The question for markets is \u201ccan the current administration get anything done?\u201d if this climate persists. The importance of international investors in US markets hints at overshooting \u2013 international investors tend to understand politics less well than domestic investors. This is why market political risk was always higher in the US than in Europe. The US dollar has been hit by the latest revelations to strike Donald Trump\u2019s White House. The greenback has fallen to a six-month low against the euro, sending the single currency over $1.111 for the first time since November. It\u2019s also hit a two-week low against the yen. The selloff came after it emerged that Trump had asked James Comey, then head of the FBI, to halt an investigation into Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security advisor. According to a memo written by Comey, Trump told him that \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: The news sent shockwaves through Washington last night, where politicians were already reeling from the news that the president had shared confidential intelligence with Russia. Some Democrats are demanding a full investigation into whether Trump has interfered with the judicial process. John McCain, the Republican senator who ran for president in 2008, said the controversies facing Trump were of \u201cWatergate size and scale\u201d. The House Oversight committee has now stepped in too, requesting to see \u2018any and all communications\u2019 between Comey and Trump. Investors are becoming concerned that America\u2019s political system could become engulfed by crisis, preventing lawmakers implementing tax or spending plans. As Mizuho bank put it: \u201cAs reporting intensifies on Trump\u2019s potential mishandling of classified information, and renewed speculations on the rationale of his dismissal of Comey, markets are becoming concerned whether key legislation on tax reforms could be deferred or derailed.\u201d Citi have also opined.... Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The squeeze on living standards is a key issue in Britain today, after inflation hit a four-year high on Tuesday. And today we get a new healthcheck on the UK labour market, which will probably confirm that pay packets are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. The figures will cover the first three months of this year. Economists predict that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate probably remained at 4.7%, the lowest rate in over 40 years, with employment at a record high. But the real story will probably be found in the wage growth figures. Basic pay is expected to have risen by around 2.2% per year in the quarter - rather less than the 2.7% inflation rate recorded in April. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: The March labour data are likely to show a third consecutive month with the unemployment rate at 4.7%. That would mean a very modest change in the level of employment on a 3m/3m basis after the large gain of 92k 3m/3m in January and the still impressive +39k last month. Similarly on the average earnings front, there is limited scope for sharp changes in pay growth rates. Our UK economists are looking for unchanged average earnings growth of 2.3% 3m/y including bonuses and 2.2% 3m/y excluding bonuses. So with the headline figures expected to move sideways broadly speaking, one area of potential interest will be the split between full- and part-time employment. In the last couple of reports there has been a clear shift in favour of full-time work; if repeated this time, it would arguably be a sign that some of the remaining slack in the labour market is being eroded. The data come out at 9.30am BST. Also coming up today It\u2019s a red letter day in the financial crisis, as the UK government finally sells its stake in Lloyds Banking Group, nearly nine years after its bailout. Property developer British land, estate agent Foxtons, and cybersecurity firm Sophos are all reporting results. And a general strike is underway in Greece, as workers protest against the country\u2019s austerity programme.",

Equally, it was almost inevitable that something would be the latest Donald Trump developments. The newest controversy involved accusations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/16/trump-james-comey-memo-michael-flynn-fbi-white-house-denial\">the president had asked former FBI James Comey to drop his investigation</a> into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

There are justifiable reasons for thinking we are due a drop, some of which I have alluded to over the past few weeks - weaker US data, declining participation on indices, and others could all be cited as the culprits. Now is not the time to panic however; the S&amp;P 500 has fallen by 30 points as of 4pm London time, but is still up more than 6% for the year so far. We are not in correction territory just yet, and may not even get there anyway.</p> <p>US banks are some of the hardest hit this afternoon, having been consistent underperformers for two months now.

The FTSE 100 has fared a little better, falling 26 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the brief morning distraction of the UK jobs report, focus turned firmly back to Trump\u2019s latest foul-up following the US open.</p> <p>The Dow Jones set the tone this afternoon, the index plunging more than 200 points as the bell rang on Wall Street. That leaves the Dow at its worst price since April 25<sup>th</sup>, the day investors first got a sniff of Trump\u2019s tax plan. The dollar fared no better; it slid 1.4% against the Japanese yen and 0.3% against the pound, while remaining at a 6 month low against the euro.</p> <p>Investors have been shaken by reports that Trump urged the then-FBI chief Comey to drop his investigation into Michael Flynn, the latest twist in the Russia saga that is gradually engulfing the President. There are a couple of reasons as to why this has caused such jittery trading. Firstly, it threatens to delay, or completely derail, Trump\u2019s market-lifting infrastructure and tax policies. Secondly, and more drastically, it could actually lead to impreachment... an eventuality that would completely erase the foundations of the market\u2019s recent record highs.</p> <p>In the Eurozone the DAX and CAC performed just as badly as their US counterpart, dropping 0.9% and 1.2% respectively. The FTSE, on the other hand, was more resilient; though it did fall by 25 or so points, this still kept it at or around the 7500 mark. The UK index is being somewhat supported by the likes of Fresnillo and Randgold Resources, which both benefited from gold\u2019s 1.6% rise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591c5bd4e4b03ddbc8d5a5ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-17T14:27:10.656Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the damage to the Dow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"960bc570691d2225dfc4240ffdfbcf47df56caa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960bc570691d2225dfc4240ffdfbcf47df56caa5/0_0_942_933/500.jpg\" alt=\"dow17maynew\" width=\"500\" height=\"495\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/864846056835698688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dow -200pts; most since 21 Mar (-237), 11 Oct (-200) and 29 Sept (-196)</p>&mdash; Mike van Dulken (@Accendo_Mike) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/864846056835698688\">May 17, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LaMonicaBuzz/status/864846717614686208\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lots of red out there today.

Migration from other EU countries has not fallen off a cliff despite the result of last summer\u2019s referendum: according to the Office for National Statistics, the number of non-UK nationals from the EU working in the UK rose by 171,000 to 2.32 million between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. This continues a trend, which has seen the number of workers from the other 27 EU countries double since the recession of 2008-09.</p> <p>Finally, the nature of work seems to have changed. <a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/rwu006.pdf\">Work by David Blanchflower, Rui Costa and Stephen Machin</a> has shown that earnings growth for the self-employed \u2013 who account for 15% of the workforce \u2013 has been particularly weak in recent years.

Indeed, unemployment has fallen in every region except London and the South East. This has been primarily due to a large increase in the number of full-time employees in employment (some 196000 across the UK). The number of part-time employees has meanwhile fallen (by 61000). There has been little change in the number of self-employed workers over the quarter.</p> <p> \u201cOn pay, the data are less encouraging. In the first quarter of the year, the year-on-year growth in total pay amounted to 2.4%. This is below the current rate of price inflation and indicates a renewed squeeze in real pay. The pay data indicate a collapse in wage settlements in the construction industry, and this is significant because much of the employment growth in the last part of 2016 came from that sector.

Economists predict that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate probably remained at <strong>4.7%</strong>, the lowest rate in over 40 years, with employment at a record high.<br></p> <p>But the real story will probably be found in the wage growth figures. Basic pay is expected to have risen by around 2.2% per year in the quarter - rather less than the 2.7% inflation rate recorded in April.</p> <p><strong>Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The March labour data are likely to show a third consecutive month with the unemployment rate at 4.7%. That would mean a very modest change in the level of employment on a 3m/3m basis after the large gain of 92k 3m/3m in January and the still impressive +39k last month.</p> <p>Similarly on the average earnings front, there is limited scope for sharp changes in pay growth rates. Our UK economists are looking for unchanged average earnings growth of 2.3% 3m/y including bonuses and 2.2% 3m/y excluding bonuses. So with the headline figures expected to move sideways broadly speaking, one area of potential interest will be the split between full- and part-time employment. In the last couple of reports there has been a clear shift in favour of full-time work; if repeated this time, it would arguably be a sign that some of the remaining slack in the labour market is being eroded.</p> </blockquote> <p>The data come out at 9.30am BST.</p> <h2>Also coming up today</h2> <p>It\u2019s a red letter day in the financial crisis, as the UK government finally sells its stake in Lloyds Banking Group, nearly nine years after its bailout.</p> <p>Property developer British land, estate agent Foxtons, and cybersecurity firm Sophos are all reporting results. <br></p> <p>And a general strike is underway in Greece, as workers protest against the country\u2019s austerity programme. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-05-17T07:56:40.782Z\">at 8.56am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Taxpayers have made a near-\u00a3900m profit on the sale of their shares in Lloyds Banking Group, the lender claimed, as the government offloaded its final stake in the bank and closed a chapter of the 2008 financial crisis. Almost nine years ago, the government pumped \u00a320.3bn into Lloyds, buying up a stake that was 43% at its peak. The bank said proceeds of the share sales and dividends since then meant taxpayers had received nearly \u00a3900m more than the government pumped in. The bank was born out of the financial crisis, when Lloyds TSB rescued HBOS from the brink of collapse, and has since undergone an overhaul that has led to 57,000 job cuts and a dramatic scaling-back of its lending activities under Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who joined in 2011. Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2013 who has received almost \u00a340m in cash and bonuses during his tenure \u2013 said: \u201cToday the government has sold its last shares in Lloyds Banking Group, receiving more money than was originally invested.\u201d The sell-off means a share bonus worth \u00a3850,000 \u2013 included in that total \u2013 will be released next year. There are a number of ways of calculating the cost of the bailout. Lloyds\u2019 calculations do not include the \u00a33.6bn cost of borrowing funds in the depths of the 2008 crisis, while the Office for Budget Responsibility has used other methodology to show the government will ultimately break even. The National Audit Office\u2019s most recent assessment of the overall financial sector rescue concludes taxpayers would lose out and have not been \u201ccompensated ... for the degree of risk accepted in providing the support\u201d. As well as Lloyds, the NAO\u2019s assessment included the bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland, the nationalisation of Northern Rock and parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley, and emergency funding schemes. However, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said taxpayers\u2019 money in Lloyds had been recouped, which he hailed as a \u201cmajor achievement\u201d. The government bought the shares during three stages of the financial crisis at an average price of 73.6p a share. The stake\u2019s final sale was confirmed on Wednesday, amid the general election campaigning and after a four-year process. Previous shares had been sold at prices above 73.6p. But in October, Hammond decided to press on with selling off the government\u2019s remaining 9% stake at a lower price. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, pointed out that the shares were trading at 52.5p when Hammond sanctioned the sell-off. \u201cWe see the taxpayers\u2019 loss as investors\u2019 gain \u2013 the shares have already rallied by 34% in the intervening period. We believe there is further to go,\u201d said Gordon. The shares were trading at 70p on Wednesday. Speculation is mounting that Horta-Os\u00f3rio will leave now the stake has been sold. He has been linked with roles at rival banks including HSBC, and there have been rumours of a move into the political sphere in his native Portugal. But he has insisted: \u201cThe job is not done.\u201d \u201cSix years ago we inherited a business that was in a very fragile financial condition. Thanks to the hard work of everyone at Lloyds, we\u2019ve turned the group around,\u201d he said. While the takeover of HBOS is often blamed for the enlarged bank\u2019s problems, Lloyds\u2019 finance director, George Culmer, said the mis-selling of payment protection insurance was also a major issue that required action \u201cright across the bank\u201d. Finalising the bill for that PPI scandal \u2013 which has already topped \u00a317bn \u2013 and paying compensation to victims of the HBOS Reading scandal are among the issues facing Lloyds. The bank is also in the throes of taking over credit card firm MBNA which will take its share of the market to 26% and add to its financial dominance: Lloyds has a 25% share of current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% of mortgages. Despite Hammond\u2019s celebratory remarks, the sell-off has not taken place as envisaged by his predecessor George Osborne who had aimed to hold a discounted share sale to the public \u2013 which had to be abandoned when Lloyds shares slumped. The government still owns more than 70% of RBS and parts of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London is still a big draw for global banks and institutions despite the uncertainty created by Brexit, according to one of the UK\u2019s biggest property companies. British Land said the process of leaving the EU was creating uncertainty, with tenants taking longer than usual to commit to office space, but there was still demand for good quality property in the capital. \u201cLooking forward, the picture is a mixed one. The Brexit process has begun but uncertainty will continue for some considerable time,\u201d said Chris Grigg, chief executive of the company behind the \u201cCheesegrater\u201d skyscraper in the City of London. \u201cLondon occupiers, particularly financial institutions, are making contingency plans but there is a wide range of possible outcomes here. Our conversations with occupiers tell us that a large majority continue to value London and believe in its place as a global centre, as we do. \u201cAlthough we are seeing businesses taking longer to commit and being more thorough in assessing options, we see polarisation of both occupier and investor demand accelerating with an increasing focus on the best quality space.\u201d However, a report from Deloitte suggests the prospects for property developers could worsen as there is a glut of office space in the capital. The amount of available office space jumped by 36% last year and has risen by a further 19% in the first three months of this year, according to the consultancy\u2019s latest London crane survey. As the amount of new office space completed in London hit a 13-year high of 3.9m sq ft in the last six months, construction work on new buildings slowed. The volume of office space under construction has fallen by 6% to 13.9m sq ft, the first drop in three years. British Land owns property worth \u00a313.9bn, with offices and residential in London, regional retail assets and a property development programme focused mainly in the capital. Grigg said there was still a lot to attract occupiers to London, despite fears that Brexit will trigger an exodus among global institutions to rival cities within the EU, to guarantee continued access to the single market. \u201cWe expect London to continue as a leading global city reflecting its diverse pool of intellectual capital and reputation for innovation, as well as its culture, language and strong regulatory and legal framework,\u201d he said. He was speaking as British Land announced its results for the year to the end of March. High-profile deals during the year included the sale of the company\u2019s 50% stake in the Cheesegrater, officially known as the Leadenhall Building, to China\u2019s CC Land for \u00a31.15bn. The value of its portfolio fell by 1.4% over the year, to \u00a313.9bn, but it was up by 1.6% in the second half alone. Underlying profit rose by 7.4% to \u00a3390m. \u201cWe are reporting a good set of results today despite an uncertain environment over the last 12 months,\u201d Grigg said. \u201cWe are particularly pleased by the increase in underlying profits, by our strong leasing performance across the business and by the very successful sales we have made. The increase in valuations in the second half is also better than many expected six months ago.\u201d",

Our conversations with occupiers tell us that a large majority continue to value London and believe in its place as a global centre, as we do.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough we are seeing businesses taking longer to commit and being more thorough in assessing options, we see polarisation of both occupier and investor demand accelerating with an increasing focus on the best quality space.\u201d</p> <p>However, a report from Deloitte suggests the prospects for property developers could worsen as there is a glut of office space in the capital. The amount of available office space jumped by 36% last year and has risen by a further 19% in the first three months of this year, according to the <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/real-estate/articles/crane-survey.html\">consultancy\u2019s latest London crane survey</a>. </p> <p>As the amount of new office space completed in London hit a 13-year high of 3.9m sq ft in the last six months, construction work on new buildings slowed.

      "bodyText": "Britain looks like a full employment economy. A bigger slice of the population is in work than at any time since modern records began. The unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1975. There are hundreds of thousands of job vacancies. But Britain doesn\u2019t feel like a full employment economy. When the jobless rate was this low in previous economic cycles, wages were rising because employers were competing for scarce labour. Firms were investing in new capital equipment because workers were becoming more expensive. Productivity was increasing. Today none of that is happening. Wage growth is not picking up. Instead, it is stuck at the new normal of 2%. There are skill shortages but this is not translating into higher average earnings. Investment is weak and productivity is falling because the growth in the employed population is running ahead of the increase in national output. John Philpott, an economist who specialises in employment, is right when he says the UK labour market looks better on paper than it feels in the pocket. It is unprecedented for record levels of employment to coincide with the workforce getting poorer. One reason for the weakness of earnings growth is the ferocious squeeze on public sector pay, which \u2013 stripped of bonus payments \u2013 is rising at just 1.3% a year. A second factor is that employers are able to buy in cheap labour from overseas. Migration from other EU countries has not fallen off a cliff despite the result of last summer\u2019s referendum: according to the Office for National Statistics, the number of non-UK nationals from the EU working in the UK rose by 171,000 to 2.32 million between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. This continues a trend, which has seen the number of workers from the other 27 EU countries double since the recession of 2008-09. Finally, the nature of work seems to have changed. Work by David Blanchflower, Rui Costa and Stephen Machin has shown that earnings growth for the self-employed \u2013 who account for 15% of the workforce \u2013 has been particularly weak in recent years. People are working flat out in the gig economy but still struggling to make ends meet. The labour market has, for want of a better word, been Uberised.",

      "bodyText": "Renationalise the water industry? If the Labour party\u2019s ambition was to make a few quid for the exchequer and do nothing else, the idea is not as wild as it may sound, despite shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s gloriously loose description of his financing proposals. The government can currently borrow on the public markets at less than 1.5% for 10 years. It might cost \u00a369bn to buy the entire water industry \u2013 that\u2019s the value of the regulated assets \u2013 but the companies would arrive with income streams in the form of dividends. At Severn Trent, for example, the dividend yield is 3.4% at the current share price. Borrowing at 1.5% to buy an asset yielding 3.4% is not the worst trade in the world. And the state, if it wanted to act like a supercharged private equity house, would be able to juice up returns by refinancing the companies\u2019 debt at a lower rate. The problem, of course, is Labour\u2019s idea is not to buy the companies in order to play games of financial arbitrage. One assumes the aim is to charge customers less since the manifesto complaint is that \u201cwater bills have increased 40% since privatisation\u201d. At that point, the back-of-the-envelope arithmetic starts to fall apart. The bills represent the companies\u2019 revenues. If you cut the revenues, you undermine the ability to pay dividends, and thus eat away at the worth of the asset. Nationalisation could quickly become very expensive. But, it might argued, the exercise would be worthwhile anyway if the water industry is \u201cdysfunctional\u201d \u2013 Labour\u2019s description. Is that really true, however? Water was privatised in the first place because politicians could see the mighty expense of replacing the Victorian-era infrastructure and thought a regulated private sector could do the job more efficiently. Ofwat claims success. It says \u00a3130bn of investment had been made since privatisation in 1989 and bills are \u00a3120, or 30%, lower than they would otherwise have been. Labour may disagree \u2013 but it ought to show its workings. A related argument says rewards for shareholders have been too fat. Thames Water \u2013 contained within a labyrinth of offshore holdings in the Caymans and elsewhere that make scrutiny next to impossible for outsiders \u2013 is a case in point. Shareholders such as Macquarie have done splendidly but Thames pleaded poverty when it came to funding the new \u201csuper sewer\u201d under London. But a simple answer to Thames-style problems is tougher regulation. The government could insist that Ofwat sets stiffer targets to benefit customers at the expensive of shareholders. There is no need to own the assets to ensure that outcome. All industries are different, and there is a fair argument that the state could improve the railways in a way the private sector can\u2019t. But water? Why bother? There is no need to nationalise. EasyJet ready for takeoff in second half Over the past 21 years, easyJet has recorded losses in 19 winter periods. That\u2019s the way life runs in the tourism-driven budget airline business. A record half-year loss before tax of \u00a3212m nevetheless looks alarming since it\u2019s about \u00a3130m more than the average of recent years. But there are explanations \u2013 the fall in sterling and a late Easter. The critical question for investors is whether profits will return with the usual roar in the second half. In theory, they should. Fears of overcapacity are finally fading as limping rivals such as Alitalia and Air Berlin suffer. EasyJet itself is expanding capacity at about 8% this year and, 12 months ago, the competitors on its routes were keeping up. Now easyJet reckons the competition will be at half the pace by the end of the year. If that\u2019s correct, they are fewer reasons to worry that easyJet has stepped up expansion at the wrong moment. It won\u2019t be a vintage year, but the City\u2019s guess of full-year profits of \u00a3365m-ish feels more solid than it did six months ago. Clouds are clearing. Straightforward withdrawal from Lloyds Almost nine years after part-nationalisation, the last shares in Lloyds Banking Group have been sold. The government can also claim a profit of a sort \u2013 maybe about \u00a3500m \u2013 even though that\u2019s an odd way to look at things since there would have been many better ways to invest \u00a320bn. But at least the exit has been achieved without George Osborne\u2019s silly idea of offering shares to the public at a discount. Philip Hammond, his successor as chancellor, was right to kill that proposal. The government\u2019s obligation was to get the best price, as opposed to entertaining airy notions about building a \u201cshareholding democracy\u201d. That meant selling in the market. At least that job was done efficiently. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 May 2017. Ofwat said \u00a3130bn of investment had been made since privatisation in 1989, not \u00a3108m as an earlier version said.",

      "body": "<p>Renationalise the water industry? If the Labour party\u2019s ambition was to make a few quid for the exchequer and do nothing else, the idea is not as wild as it may sound, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/16/labour-tax-and-spend-public-back-jeremy-corbyn\">shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s gloriously loose description of his financing proposals</a>.</p> <p>The government can currently borrow on the public markets at less than 1.5% for 10 years. It might cost \u00a369bn to buy the entire water industry \u2013 that\u2019s the value of the regulated assets \u2013 but the companies would arrive with income streams in the form of dividends. At Severn Trent, for example, the dividend yield is 3.4% at the current share price. Borrowing at 1.5% to buy an asset yielding 3.4% is not the worst trade in the world. And the state, if it wanted to act like a supercharged private equity house, would be able to juice up returns by refinancing the companies\u2019 debt at a lower rate.</p> <p>The problem, of course, is Labour\u2019s idea is not to buy the companies in order to play games of financial arbitrage. One assumes the aim is to charge customers less since the manifesto complaint is that \u201cwater bills have increased 40% since privatisation\u201d. At that point, the back-of-the-envelope arithmetic starts to fall apart. The bills represent the companies\u2019 revenues. If you cut the revenues, you undermine the ability to pay dividends, and thus eat away at the worth of the asset. Nationalisation could quickly become very expensive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/16/labour-tax-and-spend-public-back-jeremy-corbyn\">Labour gambles on tax and spend \u2013\u00a0but will the public back it? | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, it might argued, the exercise would be worthwhile anyway if the water industry is \u201cdysfunctional\u201d \u2013 Labour\u2019s description. Is that really true, however? Water was privatised in the first place because politicians could see the mighty expense of replacing the Victorian-era infrastructure and thought a regulated private sector could do the job more efficiently. Ofwat claims success. It says \u00a3130bn of investment had been made since privatisation in 1989 and bills are \u00a3120, or 30%, lower than they would otherwise have been. Labour may disagree \u2013 but it ought to show its workings.</p> <p>A related argument says rewards for shareholders have been too fat. Thames Water \u2013 contained within a labyrinth of offshore holdings in the Caymans and elsewhere that make scrutiny next to impossible for outsiders \u2013 is a case in point. Shareholders such as Macquarie have done splendidly but Thames pleaded poverty when it came to funding the new \u201csuper sewer\u201d under London.</p> <p>But a simple answer to Thames-style problems is tougher regulation. The government could insist that Ofwat sets stiffer targets to benefit customers at the expensive of shareholders. There is no need to own the assets to ensure that outcome.</p> <p>All industries are different, and there is a fair argument that the state could improve the railways in a way the private sector can\u2019t. But water? Why bother? There is no need to nationalise.</p> <h2>EasyJet ready for takeoff in second half</h2> <p>Over the past 21 years, easyJet has recorded losses in 19 winter periods. That\u2019s the way life runs in the tourism-driven budget airline business.</p> <p>A record half-year loss before tax of \u00a3212m nevetheless looks alarming since it\u2019s about \u00a3130m more than the average of recent years. But there are explanations \u2013 the fall in sterling and a late Easter. The critical question for investors is whether profits will return with the usual roar in the second half.</p> <p>In theory, they should. Fears of overcapacity are finally fading as limping rivals such as Alitalia and Air Berlin suffer. EasyJet itself is expanding capacity at about 8% this year and, 12 months ago, the competitors on its routes were keeping up. Now easyJet reckons the competition will be at half the pace by the end of the year.</p> <p>If that\u2019s correct, they are fewer reasons to worry that easyJet has stepped up expansion at the wrong moment. It won\u2019t be a vintage year, but the City\u2019s guess of full-year profits of \u00a3365m-ish feels more solid than it did six months ago. Clouds are clearing.</p> <h2>Straightforward withdrawal from Lloyds</h2> <p>Almost nine years after part-nationalisation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/16/lloyds-taxpayer-shares-bank-hbos-public-stake\">the last shares in Lloyds Banking Group have been sold</a>. The government can also claim a profit of a sort \u2013 maybe about \u00a3500m \u2013 even though that\u2019s an odd way to look at things since there would have been many better ways to invest \u00a320bn.</p> <p>But at least the exit has been achieved without George Osborne\u2019s silly idea of offering shares to the public at a discount. Philip Hammond, his successor as chancellor, was right to kill that proposal. The government\u2019s obligation was to get the best price, as opposed to entertaining airy notions about building a \u201cshareholding democracy\u201d. That meant selling in the market. At least that job was done efficiently.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 May 2017. Ofwat said \u00a3130bn of investment had been made since privatisation in 1989, not \u00a3108m as an earlier version said.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Australian wages have stagnated at a record low, growing a just 1.9% over the last six months, throwing an early cloud over the Turnbull government\u2019s optimistic projections for wages growth in last week\u2019s budget. With the cost of living rising at 2.1%, it means real wages have declined by 0.3% over the past year. The news is a small blow to the Reserve Bank\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s hopes that wages growth will accelerate in 2018 and 2019, economists say. The Bureau of Statistics released figures on Wednesday, showing wages growth for the March quarter. They show trend wages growth has been declining since mid-2012, from an annual 3.8% to 1.9%. Malcolm Turnbull has said he would return the federal budget to surplus by 2020-21 on the back of wages growth rising to 2.5% in 2016-17 and 3.5% by 2019-20, but economists say that\u2019s already looking unlikely. They also say the RBA may now have to keep the official cash rate at a record low for longer, even though the low interest rates have been fuelling runaway house prices in Sydney and Melbourne. JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy says wage growth is \u201cstuck in the doldrums\u201d because of the deterioration in the labour market, with the jobless rate climbing from 5.7% to 5.9%. \u201cThat said, actual wage outcomes have been even softer than the level of the jobless rate would otherwise suggest, with an unemployment rate of 5.9% historically associated with wage growth closer to 3%,\u201d he said. \u201cWe attribute this divergence to the persistent rise in the underemployment rate, which is currently tracking at all-time highs.\u201d AMP Capital\u2019s chief economist, Shane Oliver, agreed, adding that the Turnbull government\u2019s plan to return to the budget to surplus had already been undermined. \u201cContinued high levels of unemployment and particularly underemployment \u2013 which together total over 14% of the workforce \u2013 are clearly keeping wages growth at record low levels,\u201d Oliver said in a note to clients. \u201cWorkers simply have no bargaining power. \u201cOngoing record low wages growth also underlines the risk that the government won\u2019t see the doubling in wages growth it assumed in the budget over the next four years and as a result government revenue growth will disappoint, further delaying the return to a budget surplus,\u201d he said. Sally McManus, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, says the rights of workers have not kept up with the growth of corporate power. \u201cThe Turnbull Government is presiding over an era in which power is being stripped from workers, wage theft is systemic, and casualisation and underemployment are constantly rising,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are straight forward and easy decisions that can be made to reverse declining wages. \u201cThe government can stop the penalty rates cuts, it must support the lift in the minimum wage by $45 a week, it must give its own public sector workforce a pay rise and it must protect workers from further wage cuts by stopping employers cancelling enterprise agreements so they can cut pay.\u201d Bureau of Statistics figures show public sector wage growth for the March quarter (0.6%) outpaced that of the private sector (0.5%) for the fourth consecutive quarter, seasonally adjusted. Through the year, the public sector rise to the March quarter was 2.4%, while the private sector rose just 1.8% \u2013 an equal record low. In the public sector, education and training recorded the highest quarterly rise of 1%, with the rate of wage growth influenced by recently ratified public sector enterprise agreements delivering wage increases in the March quarter. Professional, scientific and technical services recorded the lowest quarterly wages growth of 0.2%. In the private sector, electricity, gas, water and waste services recorded the highest quarterly rise of 0.7%, and accommodation and food services recorded the lowest growth over the quarter (0.1%). Rises through the year in the private sector ranged from 0.6% for mining to 2.4% for healthcare and social assistance. On 23 February, the Fair Work Commission cut Sunday and public holiday penalty rates in the retail, pharmacy, fast food and hospitality industries by between 25% and 50%. The public holiday rates cuts will apply from 1 July. The FWC is still considering how to implement the Sunday penalty rates cuts.",
