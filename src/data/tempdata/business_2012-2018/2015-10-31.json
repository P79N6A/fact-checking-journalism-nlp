      "bodyText": "Two mainstays of the private equity industry, Apax and TPG, found themselves in a European court last week in a legal dispute that thrust the workings of buyout groups into the spotlight. The two groups were accused in Luxembourg of having wrongly siphoned \u20ac1bn (\u00a3720m) out of Greece\u2019s first wireless operator, TIM Hellas. The hearing was the latest stage in a case that has been in and out of the courts since 2011 \u2013 two years after TIM Hellas collapsed into administration Joint liquidators to the group argued that TIM Hellas \u201cdid not in the slightest have the available profit\u201d to redeem shares held by the private equity houses in a refinancing deal. Instead, the money to redeem the shares was funded by more than \u20ac1bn of debt issued by TIM Hellas, then part of a telecoms holding company that had been moved to Luxembourg. According to the TIM Hellas liquidators, this breached Luxembourg rules. Bertrand des Palli\u00e8res, chief executive of SPQR Capital, one of the group of creditors, said: \u201cYou cannot take \u20ac1bn out of a company that has no reserves. It would open the door to the wholesale looting of companies.\u201d The case was heard at a hearing lasting about two hours in a court in Luxembourg, in front of three judges. Their ruling will be announced on 23 December. In the writ that was served ahead of the case, the liquidators said it was \u201cextremely abusive ... to practically hand over \u20ac1bn non-refundable to shareholders\u201d. If the Luxembourg ruling goes their way, the liquidators hope it will help reinforce civil litigation brought against the private equity firms in the US. The private equity houses deny anything untoward about the refinancing. \u201cThis is completely untrue and an outrageous mischaracterisation of events,\u201d Apax and TPG said in a statement. They say the liquidators\u2019 attempts to blame the eventual collapse of Hellas on the refinancing is wrong. Apax and TPG said that, at the time of the deal, Hellas was in good financial health and there was \u201csignificant available cash to service the debt based on the company\u2019s strong performance\u201d. They added that Hellas collapsed three years after the transaction took place. \u201cWe are vigorously and successfully defending the many lawsuits of the claimants,\u201d said Apax and TPG. The furore is unlikely to deter the buyout groups that are circling Greek state assets due to be put up for sale by the government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras under the terms of the country\u2019s latest bailout programme.",

      "bodyText": "Oil is fuelling another battle in Washington. As domestic crude oil production gushes to multi-year highs, the president and his Republican opponents are battling over whether to end the 40-year-old ban on exporting US crude. Republicans say the ban, which was enacted during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, and kept in place for years because US production was low, is a relic of another time. Many analysts agree \u2013 to some extent. \u201cWe kept the ban in place because of peak oil worries, that we were running out. But that\u2019s all changed with the new technology,\u201d said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at The Price Futures Group, referring to fracking and horizontal drilling, which has pushed US oil production to 9.3m barrels a day. Even the Congressional Budget Office has weighed in, with a study suggesting greater tax receipts from federal oil and gas leases would follow a lifting of the ban. A study from Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy forecasts lower gasoline prices and geopolitical benefits, and the centrist Brookings Institute issued a research report citing the economic benefit to exporting US crude oil. Congress wants action. On 9 October the House of Representatives voted by 261-59 to end it. Two different Senate subcommittees also approve of ending the ban. Yet Democrats are far from agreeing. If the House version of the export ban removal reaches president Barack Obama\u2019s desk, he has vowed to veto it. Lifting the ban will not address the energy problems of the US, and the world, he argues. \u201cLegislation to remove crude export restrictions is not needed at this time. Rather, Congress should be focusing its efforts on supporting our transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d the White House said last month in response to the House bill. Why are Democrats and Republicans so far apart? One reason is just politics, and the other is genuinely different values. A major Democratic concern with simply lifting the ban is that it will be a gift to the oil industry. Democrats cite a study from Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration, which said oil producers may receive $23bn to $29bn over the next few years \u2013 if US and global prices remain close. To lift the ban, Democrats \u201cwant something in return; that\u2019s politics. They\u2019re not going to give something to the industry without exacting some price for it\u201d, said Michael Cohen, head of energy research at Barclays. Rather than just lift the ban, Democrats want to review energy policy in the bigger picture, including investments in clean technology, he said. Republicans aren\u2019t going to meet them there. What it comes down to is a values debate on each side, said Usha Haley, professor of management, West Virginia University, who focuses on energy and trade deals. Republican arguments about the economic impact of lifting the export ban may make sense on face value, but she doubts there would be much benefit for consumers. \u201cEconomic arguments occur in a test tube. Yes the US is awash in oil, and they link [their point] to the consumer benefiting. The big oil companies benefit; there\u2019s no direct link to consumer,\u201d she said. Democrats are also concerned that exporting will lead to more drilling and possible environmental damage, she said. In the end, they are both making unproven assumptions, she added. Reviewing the ban and overall energy policy is a worthwhile exercise, said Haley, as the current energy landscape is so different than it was in the 1970s. And any review should include cleaner energy. \u201cFossil fuels are of the past,\u201d she said. But while the shouting in Washington over the export ban is likely to pick up as we head to the election, few expect the ban will end before the next president takes office. The Republican presidential candidates all side with ending the ban, Obama has his veto ready but neither side will take the chance of making a decision ahead of the big vote. \u201cThe ultimate bottom line in all of this is: will it raise gasoline prices to the American consumer?\u201d said Cohen. If gasoline prices rise because of higher global prices or because the export ban ended, politicians running for office can lay the blame at their opponent. \u201cIt affects both parties. It\u2019s why we don\u2019t believe in an election year either party wants to tackle it,\u201d he said. After the election? Flynn said he eventually sees the ban falling, noting the Obama administration\u2019s recent decision to swap oil types between Mexico and Canada. \u201cIt may come in incremental steps, where they keep making exceptions where all in intents and purposes it disappears. If a Republican gets in office it will \u2026 I think Hillary Clinton as president \u2026 would be pragmatic,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The plane crash in Egypt has focused attention on the safety record of the plane involved. The Airbus A321 had just taken off from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, on its way to St Petersburg, Russia, a route it covered regularly. The plane is one of the A320 fleet, which includes the A318 and A319. A jet from the A320 family, of which there are about 6,200, takes off or lands every 2.5 seconds somewhere in the world The A321 is the largest member of the A320 family. The company says the aircraft \u201coffers airline customers the best seat-mile costs of any single-aisle aircraft and seating capacities comparable to that of a widebody jetliner\u201d. The plane first started flying in 1993 and went into commercial operation the following year. More than 900 have been made. The two-engine jet can carry up to 220 passengers and is capable of flying up to 3,000 nautical miles while carrying a maximum passenger payload. \u201cLike each member in Airbus\u2019 A320 family of jetliners, the A321 offers the lowest fuel burn, emissions and noise footprint in its class,\u201d Airbus says. The last high-profile incident involving an A320 jet was in March, when Germanwings flight 4U9525 crashed in the French Alps with the loss of 150 passengers and crew. In this case the plane was deliberately crashed by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz. The previous November a Lufthansa A321 plane had lost altitude over Spain. The Aviation Safety Network says there have been 16 serious incidents involving the A321 since 1996, only one of which was fatal. In 2010 an Airblue A321 with 152 passengers crashed in Islamabad. AeroInside, which gathers data on aviation incidents and accidents, has 212 incidents involving an A321 on file, most involving relatively minor technical issues. In September, a Thomas Cook Airbus A321-200 flying from Manchester to Izmir in Turkey reported a hydraulic problem and returned to Manchester where it landed safely. The same month two fires were detected in the toilet of a Monarch Airlines Airbus A321-200, flying from Birmingham to Sharm el-Sheikh. In both cases the crew extinguished the fires and the flight continued.",

The two-engine jet can carry up to 220 passengers and is capable of flying up to 3,000 nautical miles while carrying a maximum passenger payload. \u201cLike each member in Airbus\u2019 A320 family of jetliners, the A321 offers the lowest fuel burn, emissions and noise footprint in its class,\u201d Airbus says.</p> <p>The last high-profile incident involving an A320 jet was in March, when Germanwings flight 4U9525 crashed in the French Alps with the loss of 150 passengers and crew. In this case the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/germanwings-flight-4u9525-deliberately-flown-into-mountain-says-prosecutor\">plane was deliberately crashed by the co-pilot</a>, Andreas Lubitz.</p> <p>The previous November a Lufthansa A321 plane had lost altitude over Spain.</p> <p>The Aviation Safety Network says there have been 16 serious incidents involving the A321 since 1996, only one of which was fatal. In 2010 an Airblue A321 with 152 passengers crashed in Islamabad.</p> <p>AeroInside, which gathers data on aviation incidents and accidents, <a href=\"http://www.aeroinside.com/incidents/type/a321/airbus-a-321\">has 212 incidents involving an A321 on file</a>, most involving relatively minor technical issues.</p> <p>In September, a Thomas Cook Airbus A321-200 flying from Manchester to Izmir in Turkey reported a hydraulic problem and returned to Manchester where it landed safely.</p> <p>The same month two fires were detected in the toilet of a Monarch Airlines Airbus A321-200, flying from Birmingham to Sharm el-Sheikh. In both cases the crew extinguished the fires and the flight continued.</p>",
