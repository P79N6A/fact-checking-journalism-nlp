      "bodyText": "The belief that there is no difference between Labor and Liberal hasn\u2019t been true for a while now, but this week, with the ALP\u2019s policy to end the Howard-Costello enacted cash refunds for excess dividend imputation credits, everyone knows where the line between the parties is drawn. And it marks Bill Shorten as a leader prepared to argue for the prime ministership instead of hoping to win it by default. Remember the old days of the small-target strategy? Forget that. This week, the ALP saw Shorten stand up and tell everyone to take their best shot. Any policy that negatively affects retirees is a bold \u2013 and possibly politically dangerous \u2013 move. But it is also very much in keeping with Labor\u2019s policy on negative gearing and capital gains tax. There again, they sought to undo a Howard-Costello policy that made things very favourable for older, wealthier people. Among the many problems with John Howard and Peter Costello, one of their greatest was the desire to shovel as much money as possible to older people who didn\u2019t need it. This not only took money out of the budget, it also did so in a manner that ensured problems that would remain long after their political time had expired. It was also a policy that has served to entrench wealth inequality. While income inequality often gets the attention, wealth inequality is even bigger, and with it comes intergenerational inequality. The richest 20% of Australians hold about 40% of the national income but nearly 65% of the national wealth, and a majority of the wealth is held by those over 55. And our tax system is designed to help them not only keep it, but to garner more and then give it to their children (who then garner more and then give it to their children, who then ...) Our retirement system is based around tax-free holdings of wealth \u2013 through the family home, which is exempt from capital gains tax, and tax-free income from superannuation. With those exemptions comes revenue forgone, and the cost of paying for our ageing population is an issue that is hitting us square between the eyes. The prime earning age for workers is between 25 and 54. Between those ages, you are no longer studying, and not really thinking about retirement. These workers not only power much of our production, but also our tax revenue. And right now the cohort is shrinking. Currently just 41% of the population is aged between 25 and 54. The last time it was that low was in 1987, when the first baby boomers were entering their 40s. Back then, it wasn\u2019t a problem because only 10.5% of the population was aged over 65. But now those 40-year-old baby boomers are retiring and those over 65 account for 15.5% of our population. That jump is the equivalent of about 1.2 million extra people aged over 65 \u2013 people who mostly don\u2019t work (and nor should they be expected to), or pay income tax, but whose pensions and services need to be paid for by the revenue derived from those prime-aged workers. So what is to be done? You could \u2013 as is the government\u2019s current policy \u2013 increase the retirement age to 70 (this policy is still on the Department of Human Services website). That might be fine for someone like me typing away at a desk but not for many others. You could \u201ccrack down on welfare cheats\u201d. The problem is, despite protestations from the government and conservative media, there aren\u2019t many of those. On Friday, the government announced that it had saved $43.4m \u2013 $17.8m in this financial year \u2013 from \u201cmore than 1,000 wealthy welfare cheats\u201d. That\u2019s from a $46.1bn annual budget for Newstart, DSP and Family Tax Benefit (and the aged pension is another $45.4bn). Or you could, as the ALP is doing, seek to find extra revenue by cutting out rorts that were designed as electoral sweeteners and favours to the Howard-Costello key demographic. When this imputation cash rebate was introduced, not many were affected but like any good tax rort, accountants soon caught wind. Add in the 2006 decision to make income from superannuation tax free for those over 60, and suddenly you had a lot of people with a high actual income but very low or zero taxable income taking advantage of it. Further add in this weird belief that the retirement nest egg must not be touched, and you get a lot of idiotic reporting \u2013 such as in the Herald Sun, which had the case study of a woman with an income of $160,000, who we should feel sad for because she will lose her $12,775 rebate. She could, of course, sell some of her shares, but that would actually be using superannuation for its purpose and not as a tax-free inheritance fund. So it is a smart and needed policy, but also a dangerous one because it affects an area shrouded in confusion and thus very much susceptible to fear-mongering. However, it also delivers the ALP big money. At about $5bn a year \u2013 rising to $8bn \u2013 this is not that much lower than what would be raised by applying a GST on fresh food. Yes, the Labor party will use some of it to get the budget back to surplus, but it is also very likely to use it for tax cuts and education and health spending commitments \u2013 and they will all be fully paid for. As I noted with Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s promise of tax cuts, you need to ask how they\u2019re being paid for. With this increase in revenue, the question becomes what it will be spent on \u2013 and the benefit of that spending could well be worth any political pain the ALP might suffer now. \u2013 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "There is a warning to the government in the latest official figures on research and development: they reveal that most of the research is being done by the three industries most vulnerable to Brexit. Another red flag is the UK\u2019s 11th-place ranking in the European R&amp;D league \u2013 behind the Nordics, France and Germany, which we have come to expect, but also, surprisingly, Austria, Slovenia and the Czechs. The three industries at risk are pharmaceuticals, aerospace and cars. Between them they spent \u00a39.4bn on R&amp;D in 2016, which was almost half of the \u00a322.2bn spent by business in total. The UK car industry, which is almost entirely foreign-owned, has already made its concerns clear to business secretary Greg Clark. It wants to move parts around Europe without barriers, either in the form of tariffs or extra administration. The company to watch is Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). It is a largely diesel car company in a world where diesel is dying. It is Britain\u2019s largest carmaker, with an annual output of more than 640,000 vehicles. Where will its Indian owners \u2013 Tata Group \u2013 build a new generation of electric cars? The decision is due this year. Already Tata has commissioned Magna, a Canadian car parts maker, to build the first model under contract at sites in Austria. The i-Pace is due to appear in the autumn. JLR has told Clark that he needs to spend \u00a3450m on infrastructure in the Midlands before it even considers retooling factories in Solihull, Coventry and Wolverhampton. Clark is known to be in talks with the Treasury and the Tory mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, and has handed Street \u00a331m to fund the testing of driverless cars on the region\u2019s roads. He is also considering an \u00a380m bid for a battery research institute in Coventry. It\u2019s all good stuff, but he has some way to go before he hits \u00a3450m. Meanwhile, JLR is building a \u00a31bn factory in Slovakia. It isn\u2019t clear if the plant is gearing up to work with Magna, but there is every chance Austria and Slovakia will become the centre of JLR\u2019s electric ambitions. That would be a huge blow to the West Midlands, the UK and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is only too aware of the UK\u2019s woeful record on R&amp;D spending. Last November, Hammond said he wanted to push total R&amp;D spending from 1.67% to 2.4% of GDP, past the EU average of 2.06%, to leave the UK in sixth place. He promised to release an extra \u00a32.3bn in 2020-21, which he said could be added to the \u00a34.75bn extra in his budget plans for the next three years. The 2.4% target is due to be reached in 2027 and the extra costs he is incurring are among the reasons Hammond is on course to miss his balanced-budget target in 2025. All his extra money is going on investment, leaving nothing spare to ease welfare cuts or boost spending on health, prisons or the police. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned the chancellor that his plans are heroic and risk a huge backlash. The heroism stems from the task of shifting the UK from a pattern of spending that has locked R&amp;D investment at 1.7% of GDP or thereabouts for 30 years \u2013 and that Hammond wants to channel funds to industry by imposing the longest period of austerity in history. Much of Clark\u2019s focus is on the pharmaceutical industry, as it was Vince Cable\u2019s when he was business secretary in the coalition. To keep it happy, he will need to come up with even more money than demanded by the motor bosses. For years, pharma companies have milked the EU\u2019s R&amp;D budget, using it to subsidise some of their most basic research. With Pfizer\u2019s decision to pull out of the UK, almost all pharma research is being done by GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca. They are unlikely to up sticks when Brexit hits, especially as they are embedded in projects with Cambridge University and other institutions. Yet, over time, there could be an acceleration in the current leaching-away of research to cheaper locations. Aerospace firms also benefit from the EU\u2019s R&amp;D grants, but their major concern is long-term investment. That\u2019s why Airbus threatened to withdraw all its business from supplier GKN if it succumbs to a takeover by Melrose \u2013 a firm with a reputation for wringing businesses dry before selling them on. This month, Airbus also warned it would need to consider its position in the UK without clarity over customs rules after Brexit. Factories in north Wales were at risk, executives told MPs last year. It also said factories could soon consider stockpiling parts to avoid border delays \u2013 adding costs that could make UK operations uncompetitive. It is hard to see how Hammond can generate the laudable step-change he wants in R&amp;D spending amid austerity and Brexit. Something will have to give. Maybe it should be his deficit target.",

He promised to release an extra \u00a32.3bn in 2020-21, which he said could be added to the \u00a34.75bn extra in his budget plans for the next three years. The 2.4% target is due to be reached in 2027 and the extra costs he is incurring are among the reasons Hammond is on course to miss his balanced-budget target in 2025.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For years, pharma companies have milked the EU\u2019s R&D budget, using it to subsidise some of their most basic research</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All his extra money is going on investment, leaving nothing spare to ease welfare cuts or boost spending on health, prisons or the police. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned the chancellor that his plans are heroic and risk a huge backlash.</p> <p>The heroism stems from the task of shifting the UK from a pattern of spending that has locked R&amp;D investment at 1.7% of GDP or thereabouts for 30 years \u2013 and that Hammond wants to channel funds to industry by imposing the longest period of austerity in history.</p> <p>Much of Clark\u2019s focus is on the pharmaceutical industry, as it was Vince Cable\u2019s when he was business secretary in the coalition. To keep it happy, he will need to come up with even more money than demanded by the motor bosses.</p> <p>For years, pharma companies have milked the EU\u2019s R&amp;D budget, using it to subsidise some of their most basic research. With Pfizer\u2019s decision to pull out of the UK, almost all pharma research is being done by GlaxoSmithKline and&#xa0;AstraZeneca. They are unlikely to up sticks when Brexit hits, especially as they are embedded in<a href=\"https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2016/12/uk-to-lose-billions-in-eu-research-funding-after-brexit/\" title=\"\"> projects with Cambridge University and other institutions</a>. Yet, over time, there could be an acceleration in the current leaching-away of research to cheaper locations.</p> <p>Aerospace firms also benefit from the EU\u2019s R&amp;D grants, but their major concern is long-term investment. That\u2019s why Airbus threatened to withdraw all its business from supplier GKN if it succumbs to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/12/melrose-increases-gkn-bid-final-offer-hostile-takeover\" title=\"\">takeover by Melrose</a> \u2013 a firm with a reputation for wringing businesses dry before selling them on.</p> <p>This month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/05/airbus-may-leave-uk-unless-there-is-urgent-clarity-on-brexit-trade\" title=\"\">Airbus also warned it would need to consider its position</a> in the UK without clarity over customs rules after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a>. Factories in north Wales were at risk, executives told MPs last year. It also said factories could soon consider stockpiling parts to avoid border delays \u2013 adding costs that could make UK operations uncompetitive.</p> <p>It is hard to see how Hammond can generate the laudable step-change he wants in R&amp;D spending amid austerity and Brexit. Something will have to give. Maybe it should be his deficit target.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you can\u2019t buy happiness, perhaps you should move to Helsinki. Finland has emerged from a 10-year economic depression to be ranked by the UN last week as the happiest place to live on the planet. The most important factor in Finland topping the UN\u2019s happiness ranking is the country\u2019s history of equality. It has managed to strike an amicable balance between the sexes, between workers and bosses, and within the education and welfare systems. An equal society can bond together to survive the bad times when so many countries pull themselves apart. At the turn of the century Finland was riding high. It boasted one of the world\u2019s most successful tech companies \u2013 Nokia \u2013 and a had a well-deserved reputation for embracing the internet revolution. It had escaped from the shadow of the Soviet Union to become a robust neighbour to Russia. Then Nokia found itself on the wrong side of the smartphone revolution, following the launch of Apple\u2019s iPhone. Slow to react, it went into terminal decline. After the financial crisis hit, Finland was unable to recover. By 2016, and after five years of declining national income, the economy had stabilised. Last year the bounce-back finally took hold and the economy is estimated to have grown by 3.2%. This year the country\u2019s largest bank, OP Financial Group, says gross domestic product is expected to keep up the pace of expansion at 3.3%. Yet this recovery takes Finland back only to where it was before the financial crisis. The UK, by contrast, bounced back to its 2008 peak in 2014. The US recovery was even quicker. So why, when the UK, the US and many other European countries have contended with huge populist waves that have culminated in a vote of no confidence in their ruling political elites, has Finland remained happy? A state education system that shepherds all children through to 18 without the need for selective or private schooling has for many years kept the country at or near the top of the rankings of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. During the 1990s, research and development in Finland was around the highest in the developed world, at 4% of GDP; while it has slipped back to just below 3%, it remains among the best in Europe. The health service and welfare programmes remain universal, even if not quite as generous as they once were. Its state broadcaster is ranked alongside the BBC as among the most innovative in Europe. Tech companies such as the games studio Supercell, creator of Clash of Clans, has taken over where Nokia left off, paying more than \u20ac800m in tax and producing seven of Finland\u2019s top-10 income tax payers in 2016. Not that Nokia has disappeared. It is still a major manufacturer and the largest employer, with 102,000 staff, followed by escalator maker Kone. The salaries of the best-paid 10,000 or so workers are published for all to see. All these areas of Finnish life exemplify a cooperative spirit that commentators say is born of the harsh climate. The cold forces people to be independent and overcome inhospitable conditions. It also forces them to come together to achieve things, nurturing a degree of neighbourliness that extends into public life and state policies. Nevertheless, the period of economic depression has been scarring. The rise of the far-right True Finns party, which elected an anti-immigration hardliner as its leader last year, is evidence of that. The conservatives who control the coalition government were the most vocal critics of a bailout for Greece, and are currently pushing through parliament steep cuts in healthcare that will force more Finns to go private. This move, which may dent the happiness figures, is in response to one of the most rapidly ageing populations in Europe. Airbus could shoot down hopes GKN sale will be blocked Turnaround specialist Melrose is a seasoned deal-making warrior with a string of takeover scalps under its belt, but its \u00a38.1bn hostile tilt at engineer GKN is proving to be its most bruising battle yet. The proposal is already facing fierce opposition from trade unions and a cohort of MPs, including party leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Vince Cable. Opponents of the deal have branded Melrose an asset-stripper that can\u2019t be trusted not to rip the guts out of a key player in Britain\u2019s industrial landscape. The government has also indicated that it is mindful of concerns about national security: GKN makes parts for military aircraft including the Typhoon fighter jet and A400M transport plane. But noises from Whitehall have suggested that GKN might not be pivotal enough to Britain\u2019s military power to warrant interference in private enterprise. Enter aviation titan Airbus, diving out of the sun to launch a volley at Melrose\u2019s plans. Airbus is GKN\u2019s biggest customer, accounting for nearly \u00a3700m of sales, or nearly 7% of the company\u2019s revenues last year. It warned last week it could not support the sale of a major supplier to Melrose, which it feared had short-termist intentions. Like pilots, aircraft manufacturers prefer to see a long way ahead of them. There may yet be hope for Melrose. Airbus had been miffed at a perceived \u201clack of engagement\u201d from the company and could be using public scepticism to strengthen its hand in private talks. A sit-down scheduled for the end of the month will give Melrose the chance to flesh out pledges such as continued spending on research. Airbus could also seek to strong-arm Melrose into future price reductions in return for support. Engineering champion Rolls-Royce, which accounts for 3% of GKN\u2019s \u00a33.4bn aerospace sales, has made it clear that it won\u2019t stand in Melrose\u2019s way. So if Airbus can be brought around, MPs and unions could yet be drowned out by the roar of jet engines. Honesty not the best policy when you\u2019re moving HQ Why blame Brexit for a decision to leave the country and trigger the resentment of 17 million referendum voters? Unilever must have calculated that a planned move to the Netherlands could spark protests from Brexit voters if it blamed their electoral preference for its decision. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove soap and Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise will instead move its headquarters to Rotterdam as part of a restructuring to simplify management decision-making. The previous London/Rotterdam split HQ may have worked for decades, during which time the company has become one of the world\u2019s largest consumer products firms with a \u00a350bn turnover, but not any more. The uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit negotiations was of no consequence, it said. Maybe Brexit wasn\u2019t the main reason. Maybe Unilever, having sold the margarine and spreads business developed by the Dutch half of the firm, needed to offer a sop to the Amsterdam government. Or it could be that its board of directors, top-heavy with Dutch executives, wanted a move to favour their homeland. They certainly denied that the Dutch were better at protecting firms from unwanted takeovers and that that was the reason for the move. Unilever, let it not be forgotten, recently fought off an aggressive \u00a3115bn takeover bid by Kraft, the voracious US cheese- and cereal-maker that earlier swallowed Cadbury. So we can\u2019t know the real reason. And that will probably be the case whenever a British company with large foreign holdings or a foreign owner says it is moving a factory, a division or the HQ, and then claims Brexit played no part in its thinking. It would be foolish for a large firm, especially one that deals directly with the public, to say that the loss of the single market and customs union lay behind a decision to quit: it might leave a bad taste in British mouths.",

    "webTitle": "Can Spotify and Dropbox finally prove that tech is a sound investment?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The message to investors from Spotify last week had a familiar ring for any veteran of the tech gold rush: \u201cThe trend towards profitability is clear.\u201d The music streaming service is hoping to banish the memory of a difficult year for technology flotations. Similar promises of digital alchemy \u2013 heavy cash investment transforming into an ever-burgeoning bottom line \u2013 followed the stock-market launch of Snap last year. So far, investors in the owner of Snapchat have been underwhelmed, but last week 35-year-old Daniel Ek, Spotify\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, was adamant that his music streaming service would deliver the kind of returns that have proved elusive for tech upstarts since the blockbuster float of Facebook. The test for Stockholm-based Spotify will come when it floats in New York on 3 April, while Dropbox, the online file storage company, is preparing to launch its initial public offering this week. Those companies must answer two simple questions: will Spotify ever go into the black and justify the near-$20bn (\u00a314.4bn) valuation that private trades in its shares put on it; and is Dropbox really worth between $7bn and $8bn? With both companies preparing to join US stock markets, they could determine whether investors regain their enthusiasm for new technology stocks after a disappointing year in 2017, during which Snap, meal-kit company Blue Apron and big-data business Cloudera all went for public listings \u2013 and disappointed. Shares in Snap are down a quarter since it floated \u2013 a poor performance for investors hoping it would emulate Facebook, which has risen nearly 400% since it floated in 2012. (Twitter, meanwhile, finally recorded its first quarterly profit last month, five years after going public.) One analyst thinks the latest flotations will restore faith. \u201cSpotify and Dropbox have a very good chance of success because the technology world is about one company dominating one sector,\u201d says Mark Mulligan, a tech analyst at Midia Research. \u201cSpotify and Dropbox are each dominant forces in their respective sectors. Snapchat wasn\u2019t, because of the might of Facebook and its Instagram service. Snapchat is a second-tier player: Spotify and Dropbox are top-tier players. It is a completely different ballgame.\u201d Some big names are counting on Ek and his counterpart at Dropbox, Drew Houston. Lining up behind Dropbox and Spotify are ride-hailing service Uber \u2013 given a notional value of $50bn in 2015 \u2013 and the short-term letting agency Airbnb. The former isn\u2019t profitable; the latter is. With markets jittery, both Spotify and Dropbox are working hard to push a story of future profits and growth. On Wednesday, Spotify used a web presentation to reassure would-be investors that it has a clear path to profit, pointing out that revenues grew 39% to \u20ac4.1bn (\u00a33.6bn) in 2017, though financing costs from a \u20ac1bn loan helped push operating losses up 8% to \u20ac378m. \u201cThe trend towards profitability is clear when you look at operating losses as a percentage of revenue,\u201d it said soothingly. Spotify is also taking an unusual approach to its listing \u2013 going direct, so that its shares aren\u2019t handled by an investment bank or underwriters, but simply offered from the company on the exchange to would-be buyers. Analysing that approach last year, the business magazine Fortune said: \u201cIf an IPO is like a wedding, a direct listing is running off to elope. A faster, easier, cheaper route to the same result.\u201d Of course, like an elopement, you might not get the big benefits: an IPO guarantees money from institutional buyers snapping up millions of shares. A direct listing could flop. Others aren\u2019t so sure about Spotify\u2019s potential, based on its finances and its business model. Spotify users have the option of a free service, in exchange for listening to adverts intermittently, or paying a monthly subscription fee of \u00a39.99, $9.99 or \u20ac9.99 for no-advert streaming. It is a compelling service with 71 million paying users, but the cost in payments to artists and record companies is huge: it has forked out $9bn in royalties since it launched. According to one investor, Spotify\u2019s gross margin \u2013 a measure of profitability once certain costs are stripped out \u2013 is not high enough and indicates that royalty rates have to come down. \u201cA 20% gross margin business is not a good business,\u201d says venture capitalist David B Pakman. \u201cOne of two things has to happen: they have to enter new business lines with higher gross margins, or somehow magically transform the rate structure with labels.\u201d The latter rate is how much Spotify has to pay per track streamed. Dropbox, meanwhile, was valued at $10bn when it last raised capital in 2014, but that has been slashed to between $7bn and $8bn for its forthcoming IPO, which is intended to raise about $610m. Steve Jobs was famously dismissive of the company: in a 2009 meeting, the late Apple chief told Houston that he had \u201ca feature, not a product\u201d. In other words: Apple or Microsoft or Google could add Dropbox\u2019s functionality \u2013 you drop a file in the folder on your PC, and it\u2019s available on your phone or tablet \u2013 to their existing software for free. Houston shrugged off Jobs\u2019s disdain to build a company that in 2017 had 500 million users and $1.11bn in revenues. Not bad for a \u201cfeature\u201d. So why has its notional value gone down? Partly it\u2019s the company\u2019s revenues: in the absence of profits (it made a net loss of $112m in 2017, almost halved from $210m in 2016), a typical measure of capitalisation is a five- or six-fold revenue multiple. With the company\u2019s filings showing revenues up 31% in 2017, the $7bn figure looks reasonable compared to rivals such as Box, which does the same file synchronisation but with a focus on commercial clients. \u201cThe pricing [for Dropbox] had to come down to lure in the investors,\u201d says Phil Davis of the investment advice service Phil\u2019s Stock World. Eric Schiffer, of private equity company the Patriarch Organization, calls the pricing \u201ca slap in the face to investors of the 2014 round\u201d. It\u2019s therefore starting to look as though the sky-high valuations of a few years ago were mistakes born of over-optimistic expectations. In 2012, the venture capitalist Bill Gurley called Dropbox \u201ca major disruption\u201d, saying that Houston and his team had \u201ctaken a hard problem \u2013 file synchronisation \u2013 and made it brain-dead simple\u201d. But now such synchronisation is a feature offered by almost everyone. Microsoft has OneDrive, Apple has iCloud, Google has Drive. Dropbox\u2019s broader problem is also its biggest opportunity. Of its 500 million users (of which 100 million signed up in 2017), only about 11 million pay for its extra features, such as more storage, administrative tracking, and integration with Microsoft Office. With only 2% of users paying, there\u2019s plenty of headroom for revenue growth: Spotify\u2019s figure of 71 million paying users from a total of 159 million is an impressive 44%. Dropbox\u2019s challenge is persuading people to flip over to paying for something they can largely get for free: Apple and Google both offer unlimited photo storage and as much free file storage as Dropbox. So, for both companies, plenty of ancillary questions remain over these valuations. Is Dropbox really a product? Or has the march of technology turned it into just another feature? And will Spotify ever make a profit when its margins seem to be determined by its suppliers \u2013 the record labels? Investors\u2019 feelings about the answers to those questions could have a knock-on effect on many other businesses.",

Similar promises of digital alchemy \u2013 heavy cash investment transforming into an ever-burgeoning bottom line \u2013 followed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/snapchat-ipo-valuation-evan-spiegel-bobby-murphy-snap-inc\" title=\"\">stock-market launch of Snap</a> last year. So far, investors in the owner of Snapchat have been underwhelmed, but last week 35-year-old Daniel Ek, Spotify\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, was adamant that his music streaming service would deliver the kind of returns that have proved elusive for tech upstarts since the blockbuster float of Facebook.</p> <p>The test for Stockholm-based Spotify will come when it floats in New York on 3 April, while Dropbox, the online file storage company, is preparing to launch its initial public offering this week. Those companies must answer two simple questions: will Spotify ever go into the black and justify the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/02/is-spotify-really-worth-20bn\" title=\"\">near-$20bn (\u00a314.4bn) valuation</a> that private trades in its shares put on it; and is Dropbox really worth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/12/dropbox-ipo-value-offfering-latest-stock-share-price\" title=\"\">between $7bn and $8bn</a>?</p> <p>With both companies preparing to join US stock markets, they could determine whether investors regain their enthusiasm for new technology stocks after a disappointing year in 2017, during which Snap, meal-kit company Blue Apron and big-data business Cloudera all went for public listings \u2013 and disappointed. Shares in Snap are down a quarter since it floated \u2013 a poor performance for investors hoping it would emulate Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/15/facebook-raises-float-price-investors\" title=\"\">which has risen nearly 400% since it floated in 2012</a>.

It is a completely different ballgame.\u201d</p> <p>Some big names are counting on Ek and his counterpart at Dropbox, Drew Houston. Lining up behind Dropbox and Spotify are ride-hailing service Uber \u2013 given a notional value of $50bn in 2015 \u2013 and the short-term letting agency Airbnb.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The accounting watchdog is expected to announce an investigation into potential misconduct by two former finance directors at Carillion, the failed government contractor. The Financial Reporting Council\u2019s conduct committee is understood to have agreed that there are sufficient grounds for a probe into the conduct of Richard Adam and Zafar Khan. An announcement is expected early next week. A spokesman for the FRC declined to comment. Frank Field and Rachel Reeves, the MPs leading a joint select committee inquiry into Carillion\u2019s failure, welcomed the regulator\u2019s decision to investigate individual directors. In evidence to the business select committee in January, the FRC chief executive, Stephen Haddrill, told MPs the watchdog was examining whether an investigation was required into any misconduct by \u201cmembers in business\u201d, rather then a mere breach of regulations. The FRC can prevent a finance director who is a member of a professional association from practising. It can also table significant fines against those found to have \u201cfallen significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected\u201d or brought discredit to the accountancy profession. The Insolvency Service is already investigating the conduct of directors employed at the point at which the outsourcing giant collapsed, but \u201calso of any individuals who were previously directors\u201d, following a request from the business secretary, Greg Clark. The FRC has so far restricted itself to examining the ethical and technical standards of the accountancy firm KPMG over its audits for Carillion between 2014 and 2017. The work and pensions committee chair, Frank Field, welcomed the FRC\u2019s decision to widen its probe to include directors but said regulators should have acted sooner. \u201cIf the select committees hadn\u2019t undertaken this review, all the horrors of Carillion would have been swept under a carpet, lumpy as the carpet would have been afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cGreat news the FRC is acting but where were they when all this was blowing up? What Britain desperately needs is a regulatory system that is on the front foot.\u201d Reeve said: \u201cTo uphold our standards in corporate governance and to help ensure that we avoid a future business disaster akin to Carillion, it\u2019s important that Carillion directors face the full force of the law for their role in the collapse of the company.\u201d Carillion went into liquidation in January, with pension liabilities and debts each exceeding \u00a31bn. It had just \u00a329m in cash at the point of its collapse. Carillion relied on large contracts, some of which proved much less lucrative than it expected. Last year it slashed the value of them by \u00a3845m, of which \u00a3375m related to public-private partnerships (PPPs) such as Royal Liverpool University hospital. The company employed 20,000 people in the UK and held 450 public sector contracts. Earlier this month the Canadian firm, BGIS, pulled out of a deal to buy a significant number of those from the firm, putting at risk 2,500 jobs that had seemed saved. Adam, who had managed Carillion\u2019s finances from April 2007 to December 2016, offloaded \u00a3534,000 of shares on 1 March last year, three months after retiring from the company. He sold a further \u00a3242,000 of stock handed to him in May as part of a bonus scheme. Shortly afterwards, the auditor KPMG forced the Carillion to slash the value of its contracts by \u00a3845m and issue a profit warning. In a letter to MPs on a joint select committee conducting an inquiry into Carillion\u2019s demise, Adam said: \u201cI sold the shares on these dates because they were the days that I was invited to do so by the company.\u201d Giving evidence, he conceded that he knew the company was in a \u201cchallenging\u201d position when he left, but added: \u201cCould I just say, because I have been out of the business for over a year, how saddened I am by all of the events.\u201d Khan was finance director between August 2016 and September 2017, when he was axed with a \u00a3425,000 payoff. He claimed to MPs that he was dismissed after he \u201cspooked\u201d the rest of the board with a presentation warning that the company\u2019s finances had worsened. He denied he had been \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d. Giving evidence to MPs, Emma Mercer, who succeeded Khan, said those who had been in post before her had taken an \u201caggressive tone\u201d in their valuation of contracts that later underperformed. In a sign of the continuing ripples caused by Carillion\u2019s failure, Phil Bentley, the chief executive of Carillion\u2019s former chief competitor, Mitie, warned in a statement on Friday that the year ahead would remain \u201cchallenging\u201d for his firm. He said: \u201cThe liquidation of Carillion has raised some fundamental questions about the outsourcing industry.\u201d",

Last year it slashed the value of them by \u00a3845m, of which \u00a3375m related to public-private partnerships (PPPs) such as Royal Liverpool University hospital.<br></p> <p>The company employed 20,000 people in the UK and held 450 public sector contracts. Earlier this month the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/carillion-contracts-deal-fails-putting-2500-jobs-at-risk\">Canadian firm, BGIS, pulled out of a deal</a> to buy a significant number of those from the firm, putting at risk 2,500 jobs that had seemed saved. </p> <p>Adam, who had managed Carillion\u2019s finances from April 2007 to December 2016, offloaded \u00a3534,000 of shares on 1 March last year, three months after retiring from the company. He sold a further \u00a3242,000 of stock handed to him in May as part of a bonus scheme. Shortly afterwards, the auditor KPMG forced the Carillion to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/carillion-boss-richard-howson-steps-down-shares-crash\">slash the value of its contracts by \u00a3845m and issue a profit warning</a>.</p> <p>In a letter to MPs on a joint select committee conducting an inquiry into Carillion\u2019s demise, Adam said: \u201cI sold the shares on these dates because they were the days that I was invited to do so by the company.\u201d</p> <p>Giving evidence, he conceded that he knew the company was in a \u201cchallenging\u201d position when he left, but added: \u201cCould I just say, because I have been out of the business for over a year, how saddened I am by all of the events.\u201d</p> <p>Khan was finance director between August 2016 and September 2017, when he was axed with a \u00a3425,000 payoff.</p> <p>He claimed to MPs that he was dismissed after he \u201cspooked\u201d the rest of the board with a presentation warning that the company\u2019s finances had worsened. He denied he had been \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d.</p> <p>Giving evidence to MPs, Emma Mercer, who succeeded Khan, said those who had been in post before her had taken an \u201caggressive tone\u201d in their valuation of contracts that later underperformed.<br></p> <p>In a sign of the continuing ripples caused by Carillion\u2019s failure, Phil Bentley, the chief executive of Carillion\u2019s former chief competitor, Mitie, warned in a statement on Friday that the year ahead would remain \u201cchallenging\u201d for his firm. He said: \u201cThe liquidation of Carillion has raised some fundamental questions about the outsourcing industry.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Seven years after an earthquake off Japan\u2019s eastern coast led to three meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, the aftershocks are still being felt across the world. The latest came last Saturday when E.ON and RWE announced a huge shakeup of the German energy industry, following meetings that ran into the early hours. Under a complex asset and shares swap, E.ON will be reshaped to focus on supplying energy to customers and managing energy grids. The company will leave renewables. RWE will focus on power generation and energy trading, complementing its existing coal and gas power stations with a new portfolio of windfarms that will make it Europe\u2019s third-biggest renewable energy producer. The major change comes two years after both groups split their green and fossil-fuel energy businesses, a result of the plan by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to phase out nuclear by 2022, and also the Energiewende, Germany\u2019s speeded-up transition to renewables after Fukushima. Coming so soon after 2016\u2019s drastic overhaul, last week\u2019s shakeup raises the question of what a successful energy utility looks like in Europe today. How do companies adapt to a world where the rapid growth of renewables pushes down wholesale prices, and the electrification of cars begins to be felt on power grids? Peter Atherton, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said the deal showed that E.ON and RWE did not get their reorganisation right two years ago. It marks a decisive break with the old, traditional model of a vertically integrated energy company that generates energy, transports it and sells it. In the noughties, the conglomerate model was seen as a way for energy firms to succeed, leading to a wave of mergers. Some, such as Italy\u2019s Enel and Spain\u2019s Iberdrola (ScottishPower\u2019s owner) are still pursuing this \u201cdo everything\u201d model. But by and large, companies are being broken up and becoming more specialised. \u201cWhat you\u2019re certainly seeing is companies taking bets about where the value will be,\u201d said Atherton. RWE argues that today the only way to compete in European government auctions for renewable energy subsidies is to go big. Rolf Martin Schmitz, the group\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cCritical mass is the key in renewable energy. Before this transaction, neither RWE nor E.ON was in this position.\u201d After the deal, RWE will have around 8GW of renewable capacity and another 5GW in the pipeline, which will together account for 60% of its earnings by 2020. Schmitz also said that a new type of company was needed to thrive in a world where windfarms and other green energy projects would soon have to succeed on market prices, not government subsidies. \u201cRenewables will evolve from a regulated business to market competition,\u201d he said. E.ON, meanwhile, is majoring on supplying people with energy and services, and will grow from 31 million customers to roughly 50 million after the deal. It will also have a much greater proportion of its earnings \u2013 80%, up from 65% \u2013 coming from the regulated, lower-return but lower-risk business of energy networks. John Feddersen, chief executive of Aurora Energy Research, said the two firms were going in very different directions, but the path E.ON had taken was less well trodden. \u201cThis is to some extent a question of try it and see what works. [For E.ON], owning grids and lobbying government for good regulatory outcomes is a well-understood business. However, the [customer] services side is untried,\u201d he said. The changing nature of power generation in Europe has been felt most keenly in Germany because of the Energiewende, but industry-watchers say the same pattern is driving companies to transform themselves across the continent. In the UK, British Gas owner Centrica is halfway through a sometimes painful reinvention of itself as a customer-centric energy company, divesting its old, large power stations to focus on selling services such as smart heating systems, as well as gas and electricity. The UK\u2019s second-biggest energy firm, SSE, is moving in the opposite direction. It is getting out of domestic energy supply, banking instead on regulated networks and renewable power generation, where prices are guaranteed. The picture is further complicated by the entrance of big oil, which is taking serious steps to diversify out of oil and gas and into the world of energy utilities. Norway\u2019s Statoil last week rebranded itself as Equinor to reflect its transformation into a \u201cbroad energy\u201d company that deploys windfarms as well as oil rigs. Shell recently bought the UK\u2019s biggest independent household energy supplier, First Utility, and has also acquired firms in electric car infrastructure. That puts it in direct competition with E.ON, which promised to roll out charging points faster as a result of the asset swap. Investors seem to like the paths E.ON and RWE have taken, with big bumps in the share prices of both after the deal. But no one knows if we will be back here in two years\u2019 time. \u201cI would view this very much as a test of the right structure for an energy company,\u201d said Feddersen.",
