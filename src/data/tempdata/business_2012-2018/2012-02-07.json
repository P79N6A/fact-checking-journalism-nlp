After a drama-filled few days as discussions were repeatedly delayed, he had to persuade political leaders backing his interim administration to accept the tough conditions attached to further rescue funds from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. \"There are outstanding technical issues but when they meet tomorrow we can expect the politicians to accept it,\" said one well-placed official after talks between Papademos and party chiefs were pushed back yet again. \"Part of the reason why the discussion is also taking longer is that the leaders have to come to terms with what they have to accept.\" Talks were delayed for three hours on Tuesday because the final text had to be translated into Greek for Georgios Karatzaferis, leader of the far right coalition partner LAOS, to properly understand, the official said.

Highlighting how difficult the negotiations had been, the Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, who will present the accord at a euro group meeting on Thursday, described them as like Hydra's head. Papademos, a technocratic economist who was appointed with the express purpose of securing the deal, had asked for a detailed analysis of what bankruptcy would look like for Greece ahead of the meeting with the coalition leaders. Political manoeuvring amid rising anger over the biting austerity measures that the new deal will entail made talks more difficult than expected. With a general election looming as soon as April, political leaders are reluctant to sign off on reforms that are likely to meet bitter public resistance . Greece's public and private sector ground to a halt on Tuesday as unions called a 24-hour nationwide strike over wage, pension and job cuts as well as benefits. Across Athens, buildings were spray-painted with slogans such as \"rise up people\" and \"we won't be their slaves.\" Police estimated 10,000 people rallied in the capital despite heavy rain with some protesters attempting to storm the Greek parliament in Syntagma Square.

      "body": "<p>GlaxoSmithKline has been pulling cash out of some eurozone countries in case the debt crisis takes a turn for the worse.</p> <p>Speaking at the drugmaker's annual results presentation in London, the recently knighted chief executive Sir Andrew Witty said in the past year the company had been withdrawing \"tens of millions of pounds\" from \"most of the eurozone\" \u2013 excluding Germany.</p> <p>\"You don't have money in banks you're nervous about,\" he explained. Some of that money is being used to pay dividends to shareholders, which rose more than expected, by 8% to 70p a share (plus 5p related to the sale of the North American over-the-counter brands).</p> <p>GSK has also \"raised the ante\" on collecting debts from eurozone governments, especially in southern Europe. GSK sells many of its drugs to wholesalers but also sells some directly to hospitals. \"We've been able to reduce our debts in southern Europe\" leaving GSK with a figure that is \"not scary,\" said Witty. He welcomed the European Central Bank's efforts to pump money into the banking system in the past six months, saying they'd had a \"very positive effect on banking liquidity and confidence\".</p> <p>He added: \"My biggest concern vis-a-vis the eurozone is continued uncertainty. In many cases the uncertainty is worse than many of the if's.\" Witty said the crisis had sapped consumers' confidence.</p> <p>Asked about GSK's contingency plans should the banking system freeze, he recalled an emerging markets crisis where the \"general manager took bags of money to people's [GSK staff's] houses\".His comments came as the pharmaceutical company reported annual profits before tax of \u00a37.7bn, up from \u00a33.2bn in 2010, reflecting cost cutting. Turnover dropped 3% to \u00a327.4bn. Sales were boosted by growth in Japan, driven by the cervical cancer vaccine Cervarix, and emerging markets.

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline has been pulling cash out of some eurozone countries in case the debt crisis takes a turn for the worse. Speaking at the drugmaker's annual results presentation in London, the recently knighted chief executive Sir Andrew Witty said in the past year the company had been withdrawing \"tens of millions of pounds\" from \"most of the eurozone\" \u2013 excluding Germany. \"You don't have money in banks you're nervous about,\" he explained. Some of that money is being used to pay dividends to shareholders, which rose more than expected, by 8% to 70p a share (plus 5p related to the sale of the North American over-the-counter brands). GSK has also \"raised the ante\" on collecting debts from eurozone governments, especially in southern Europe. GSK sells many of its drugs to wholesalers but also sells some directly to hospitals. \"We've been able to reduce our debts in southern Europe\" leaving GSK with a figure that is \"not scary,\" said Witty. He welcomed the European Central Bank's efforts to pump money into the banking system in the past six months, saying they'd had a \"very positive effect on banking liquidity and confidence\". He added: \"My biggest concern vis-a-vis the eurozone is continued uncertainty. In many cases the uncertainty is worse than many of the if's.\" Witty said the crisis had sapped consumers' confidence. Asked about GSK's contingency plans should the banking system freeze, he recalled an emerging markets crisis where the \"general manager took bags of money to people's [GSK staff's] houses\".His comments came as the pharmaceutical company reported annual profits before tax of \u00a37.7bn, up from \u00a33.2bn in 2010, reflecting cost cutting. Turnover dropped 3% to \u00a327.4bn. Sales were boosted by growth in Japan, driven by the cervical cancer vaccine Cervarix, and emerging markets. This was offset by a 4% fall in Europe and a flat US performance. Witty has masterminded a radical overhaul of the business, reorganising GSK's research operations into smaller units of 5-70 scientists, each focused on a particular disease. This is starting to yield results: the company expects up to 30 new drugs to make it into late-stage development in the next three years. \"We've dealt with our patent cliff and have come out the other side, and we're no longer dependent on one single market,\" said Witty. Less than a quarter of GSK's sales now come from what he calls \"white pills in western markets\". Unlike AstraZeneca, which last week announced 7,350 fresh job losses, GSK is hiring more staff and moving manufacturing and service centres back to Britain. But, GSK shares ended the day down by nearly 1%, after its results for the fourth quarter missed City expectations. Deutsche Bank analysts Mark Clark and Tim Race said: \"The sales miss was driven by a weak performance in vaccines, slowing emerging markets growth and EU pricing pressure.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Deal will not proceed if 16.5% of Xstrata's aggrieved investors don't agree as the pass-mark is 75% and Glencore can't vote", 
      "body": "<p>The rebels in Xstrata's ranks are right to be angry: the terms of the offer from Glencore are miserable. As matters stand, Sir John Bond and Mick Davis, chairman and chief executive of Xstrata, have granted Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg greatest wish and extracted too little in return.</p> <p>A ratio of 2.8 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share equates to a takeover premium of 8% using the two companies' valuations on the day before last week's leak of the talks. The would-be partners prefer an apples-and-pears calculation that produces a 15% figure \u2013 but the commonsense number is 8%. It's also sensible to ignore the hype about a \"merger of equals.\" Glencore is offering to buy Xstrata: that's a takeover, even if Bond and Davis would keep their job titles on completion.</p> <p>In normal circumstances, an 8% takeover premium would be laughed out of court as plain cheeky. Davis is asking investors to accept the terms because, he argues, the combined company will be greater than the sum of the parts and because he's negotiating in \"the universe of the possible.\"</p> <p>Well, okay, Glenstrata may bag an extra $500m-a-year by shoving more of Xstrata's output through Glencore's trading division. And, yes, there must be a point at which Glencore's shareholders, who own 34% of Xstrata, would protest if they were asked to surrender more of the pie. But, come on, those happy arguments have to be set against three hard facts.</p> <p>First, not all Xstrata shareholders are fans of Glencore paper. Second, the deal will not happen if 16.5% of Xstrata's don't approve as the overall pass-mark is 75% and Glencore can't vote its stake. Third, Glencore has been a quoted company for only eight months, so it's still extremely early to claim they have a proper feel for the real value of its acquisition currency, its shares.</p> <p>That third point is critical. Glencore was floated at 530p last May and has never traded at that price since; it went as low as 350p last autumn. The great investment debate about Glencore \u2013 whether profits from trading commodities should be valued as highly as profits from mining \u2013 has not been settled.</p> <p>Sceptical Xstrata shareholders may instinctively think it's safer to own a pure miner that digs stuff out of the ground. BHP Billiton, for one, is busy trying to force greater transparency into the pricing of commodities, meaning the glory days of mega-profits from trading commodities may be over. The game will always be wonderfully lucrative for Glencore's practitioners, but perhaps less so for the providers of capital. It remains to be seen if Standard Life and Schroders can round up an army of fellow objectors within Xstrata and thus force Glencore to improve its offer. But let's hope they force a full debate. As Richard Buxton at Schroders says, it's easy to see how Glencore shareholders and Xstrata's management benefit, but it's hard to see what's in it for Xstrata shareholders. Bond, architect of HSBC's toxic Household acquisition in 2003, should be made to earn his corn this time.</p> <p>Let's hope, too, that the regulators put the deal under the microscope. Glenstrata will not be the biggest beast in the mining jungle (BHP, Rio Tinto and Vale, of Brazil will still be bigger) but perhaps itwould radically alter the bio-diversity.

      "bodyText": "The rebels in Xstrata's ranks are right to be angry: the terms of the offer from Glencore are miserable. As matters stand, Sir John Bond and Mick Davis, chairman and chief executive of Xstrata, have granted Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg greatest wish and extracted too little in return. A ratio of 2.8 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share equates to a takeover premium of 8% using the two companies' valuations on the day before last week's leak of the talks. The would-be partners prefer an apples-and-pears calculation that produces a 15% figure \u2013 but the commonsense number is 8%. It's also sensible to ignore the hype about a \"merger of equals.\" Glencore is offering to buy Xstrata: that's a takeover, even if Bond and Davis would keep their job titles on completion. In normal circumstances, an 8% takeover premium would be laughed out of court as plain cheeky. Davis is asking investors to accept the terms because, he argues, the combined company will be greater than the sum of the parts and because he's negotiating in \"the universe of the possible.\" Well, okay, Glenstrata may bag an extra $500m-a-year by shoving more of Xstrata's output through Glencore's trading division. And, yes, there must be a point at which Glencore's shareholders, who own 34% of Xstrata, would protest if they were asked to surrender more of the pie. But, come on, those happy arguments have to be set against three hard facts. First, not all Xstrata shareholders are fans of Glencore paper. Second, the deal will not happen if 16.5% of Xstrata's don't approve as the overall pass-mark is 75% and Glencore can't vote its stake. Third, Glencore has been a quoted company for only eight months, so it's still extremely early to claim they have a proper feel for the real value of its acquisition currency, its shares. That third point is critical. Glencore was floated at 530p last May and has never traded at that price since; it went as low as 350p last autumn. The great investment debate about Glencore \u2013 whether profits from trading commodities should be valued as highly as profits from mining \u2013 has not been settled. Sceptical Xstrata shareholders may instinctively think it's safer to own a pure miner that digs stuff out of the ground. BHP Billiton, for one, is busy trying to force greater transparency into the pricing of commodities, meaning the glory days of mega-profits from trading commodities may be over. The game will always be wonderfully lucrative for Glencore's practitioners, but perhaps less so for the providers of capital. It remains to be seen if Standard Life and Schroders can round up an army of fellow objectors within Xstrata and thus force Glencore to improve its offer. But let's hope they force a full debate. As Richard Buxton at Schroders says, it's easy to see how Glencore shareholders and Xstrata's management benefit, but it's hard to see what's in it for Xstrata shareholders. Bond, architect of HSBC's toxic Household acquisition in 2003, should be made to earn his corn this time. Let's hope, too, that the regulators put the deal under the microscope. Glenstrata will not be the biggest beast in the mining jungle (BHP, Rio Tinto and Vale, of Brazil will still be bigger) but perhaps itwould radically alter the bio-diversity. The world has never seen a big, integrated player of this size. The combo boasts it will operate across \"mining and processing, storage, freight and logistics, to marketing and sales.\" And it would have 30% of thermal coal market and 25% of global zinc market. That's power. Who benefits? The case for the defence is that the EU and regulators elsewhere have treated Glencore and Xstrata as one company, and thus nothing substantial has changed. The case for the prosecution is that when companies talk about \"capturing more of the value chain\" what they mean is that they sniff an opportunity to make the customer pay more.

      "bodyText": "The Australian owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks is reviewing the future of its UK business as a result of the \"recent reversal\" in the UK economy \u2013 raising fears for up to 8,500 jobs. National Australia Bank (NAB), which is based in Melbourne, bought Clydesdale in 1987 and Yorkshire in 1990, and had until recently been regarded as a potential suitor for other branch networks being put up for sale in the UK. It currently operates 300 bank branches. But yesterday Cameron Clyne, chief executive of NAB, said it was now clear \"that the UK economy is likely to experience a much longer period of subdued growth with the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone and the continuing austerity programme by the UK government.\" He added: \"These difficult conditions have adversely affected the performance of UK banking.\" As a result, NAB has ordered a \"strategic review\" of the UK business to \"appropriately reposition its business mix and structure for the changed economic environment and improve returns\". The UK arm might now become a target for NBNK, the new bank run by former Northern Rock chief executive Gary Hoffman, and which failed to be selected as a bidder for the branches being sold by Lloyds Banking Group. However, an outright sale of Yorkshire and Clydesdale might prove difficult. The bank, which employs 8,500 people across both UK networks, intends to announce the outcome of the review \u2013 which is already under way \u2013 by the time of its interim results in May. Cathy Jamieson, Labour MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and a shadow Treasury minister, seized on the remarks about austerity cuts to call for a \"change of course\" by the government. \"I know the staff employed in the branch network and telephone operations in Scotland are highly valued by the company and they will want early reassurance. But the comments from the owners of the Clydesdale about the continuing programme of austerity and the stalled economic recovery should act as a profound warning to the government.\" While there was immediate speculation that potential bidders might emerge for the two banks, there were also suggestions that NAB might not withdraw altogether but pull back from riskier lending, for instance on commercial property. NAB had been expected to bid for the branches that Lloyds Banking Group has put up for sale and City speculation about the Australian bank's commitment to the UK market has swirled for many years, particularly as the bank is often cited as a competitor to the big four high street banks. The Co-operative Bank is in detailed talks with Lloyds over the sale. David Thorburn, chief executive of Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, stressed that while \"tough decisions\" would need to be made, his intention was to create stronger banks. \"The time is right for us to re-examine our business given the recent reversal in the economic recovery, the structural changes in the UK banking market and our performance in that context \u2026 Getting the right business mix and structure is vital and the review will shape that. \u2026 However, it is already clear that the economics of our retail banking operation are strong,\" Thorburn said. In the UK, NAB said lending activity was \"subdued\" and fees were down because of the weak economy, while the charge for bad and doubtful debts was rising.",

One uninsured friend, who runs a small publishing house, jokes that she's taken up healthy eating and a holistic lifestyle because she can't afford to get sick. According to the Labor Department, employers often misclassify independent contractors as employees, locking misclassified freelancers out of benefits like tax write-offs for health insurance that they're already paying for, all by themselves. For freelancers, it's much, much harder to qualify for a loan, refinance their mortgage or, if they're underwater on their homes, to find relief from loan modification programs. I know a woman who was told, off the record, that the company that was considering hiring her would only do so on a contract basis \u2013 they didn't want to take on the expense of hiring her because of her considerable medical bills. (She didn't get the job.) Another associate thought he'd hit pay dirt with a high-paying, full-time salaried position at a big-name software company. But then, suddenly \u2013 right as he was ready to sign the paperwork \u2013 they rescinded their offer. Instead, they told him that they could only offer him a contract position on a project-by-project basis. If this is how our economy is now organized, then we need safety nets for independent workers. And we need to start by acknowledging, as a nation, that while it's all very good to talk about job creation, for many of us, a regular 9-to-5 gig is no longer a reality. Work has changed; the American worker is changing. Old-school labor paradigms no longer fit. \u2022 This article was suggested in a user comment by RipThisJoint",

Those of you looking for Euro news can get your live fix <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/07/greece-bailout-talks-general-strike\">here</a> from my colleague <strong>Graeme Wearden</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>11.51am: The committee's ranking member, <strong>Sen. Jeff Sessions</strong>, just mentioned Charles Schwab's attack on Fed policy in <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204740904577197374292182402.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">The Wall Street Journal</a>. The founder of <strong>Charles Schwab </strong>argued that the Fed's continued low interest rate policy has had terribly unintended consequences:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In short, the Fed's actions, rather than helping, are having the perverse effect of destroying the confidence of businesses and individuals to invest and the willingness of banks to loan to anyone but those whose credit is so strong they don't need loans.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bernanke clearly doesn't agree. But he dodges rather than getting stuck in. \"We are on a path that is unsustainable,\" he says. On that I think we can all agree.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>11.40am: Pretty bleak stuff from Bernanke now about the US's looming debt crisis.</p> <p>\"It's very clear that on current reasonable expectations of policy that the US debt will become unsustainable in 15-20 years at most,\" says Bernanke.<br>He says that the US \"clearly needs some major changes\" and if those aren't made this may not be a problem that the US can just boot down the road for the next generation to deal with.</p> <p>\"These are concerns that could have effects much sooner if markets lose confidence,\" in the US's ability to stabilise its debts, he warns. \"In fairness to the hard working people here there's still a lot of lack of clarity. Everybody want a lower deficit but nobody wants to lose their own programs or tax cuts,\" says Bernanke.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>11.28am: A grown up question. <strong>Sen Pat Toomey </strong> wants to know what happens if inflation rises and unemployment remains high. \"I'm concerned about some of the unintended consequences of maintaining zero interest rates,\" he says. </p> <p>He says he's worried about savers and whether zero interest rates encourage excessive risk taking and the creation of new bubbles.</p> <p>\"We are quite aware of these costs and risks,\" says Bernanke. He says savers hold other securities that depend on the economy and that with unemployment so high the Fed has to encourage risk taking to some extent to encourage investment in job creating businesses.</p> <p>Interest rates will rise one day, he says. But not any time soon by the sound of it.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>11.21am: <strong>Sen. Mark Warner</strong>, who Wikipedia tells me makes wine on his Virginia estate, says America's rallying cry at the moment is at least we are better than the EU.\" He concedes its not as good as \"give me liberty or give me death.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>11.14am: <strong>Sen. John Cornyn,</strong> who really looks like a senator with his Newt Gingrich/John McCain white hair and big fleshy face, is asking about Europe.</p> <p>\"Certainly parts of Europe are in recession. Whether the Eurozone itself goes into recession remains to be seen,\" says Bernanke. Exports to Europe are about 2% of GDP, \"it's not totally make or break\" but it could be an influence, he says.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>11.10am: It's all very bitty at the moment. Here's some bullet points:</p> <p>* The US isn't Japan, they learnt the lessons of the Japanese economic crisis and moved to underpin the financial system much more quickly. (Sure Ben, we'll come back to you on that 10 years from now).</p> <p>* A sharp spike in oil prices could \"stop\" the recovery. (Nobody mentions Iran).</p> <p>* The housing market is a mess.

Subprime loan losses were \"bumps\" in the road according to Ben).</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>10.53am: The questions are now about the tax cuts and the budget. President Obama has been \"phoning it in\" says <strong>Sen. Ron Johnson</strong>, a Tea Party favourite and a man never saw a <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/12/13/sen-ron-johnson-good-workers-dont-make-minimum-wage/\">minimum wage he wouldn't cut.</a></p> <p>\"I am in favour of the law of arithmetic,\" says Ben.

Radical.</p> <p>\"You want to make a credible strong plan but one that phases in so the economy doesn't hit a pot hole,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>10.46am: <strong>Sen. Ron Wyden,</strong> a Democrat, is asking Bernanke about \"shocks to the system.\" Isn't all this political bickering a shock to the system? </p> <p>\"Dur. Hell yer!\" says Bernanke. \"You point scoring, petty minded morons are K-razy!!!\" Oh ok he doesn't. Well not directly. He does say that \"policy uncertainty\" is an issue for the economy and for regulators. \"I would site the example of the debt ceiling debate last summer which was clearly a shock,\" he adds. It certainly was.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>10.32am: <strong>Sen. Bill Nelson</strong> is asking about the budget rows to come.

BUT he says the major problems that the US faces are 10-15 years out as the population ages. He says the US needs a \"broad based discussion\" about sustainability.

      "body": "<p><strong>Inmarsat</strong> has taken off on talk of a possible bid for the satellite operator.</p> <p>Its shares have jumped 15.2p to 437.2p - a 3.6% rise - on suggestions of a 700p offer, with US giant GE and private equity both mentioned as potential predators.</p> <p>Almost a year ago hedge fund Harbinger - widely seen in the past as a likely bidder - sold its remaining 14% stake at 670p a share. In recent weeks Inmarsat's shares have come under pressure following negative reports from the US about its partner LightSquared. A Federal agency suggested LightSquared's wireless service could cause interference to many GPS receivers, raising concerns about the company's earnings potential.</p> <p>Overall the market edged lower for the second day as investors continued to fret about the lack of resolution to the continuing Greek debt talks. There were also concerns about growth in China. According to a government ministry, its industrial output growth was likely to slow in the current quarter due to problems in the rest of the global economy, not least the eurozone's financial crisis.</p> <p>So the mining sector - already in the spotlight as details were revealed about the proposed merger between <strong>Glencore</strong>, down 17.5p at 443.25p, and <strong>Xstrata</strong>, off 61.5p at \u00a312, - came under further pressure. <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> dropped 18.5p 703p, while <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 30p to \u00a311.60.</p> <p>All this left the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> down just 1.94 points at 5890.26. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> London stocks suffered further losses today as impatience over the Greek debt talks is really starting to weigh on sentiment. The amount of to-ing and fro-ing that has been going on is causing some to simply think that the sooner Greece exits the eurozone the better as it would eradicate the vast cloud of uncertainty that has prevented markets from heading higher. <br> But it's not just the Greece factor that has left investors a little more nervous today compared to last Friday. Data from the UK, Germany and comments from China did little to inspire confidence in the economic outlook and so mining stocks dragged us lower. </blockquote> <p>On the positive side, <strong>Shire</strong> rose another 50p to \u00a321.79 after Monday's talk of a possible \u00a335 a share bid. The company was also buoyed by an upgrade from Goldman Sachs. The bank repeated its buy recommendation and raised its target price from \u00a325 to \u00a326, saying:</p> <blockquote> Shire offers the best growth profile and cash return on capital invested expansion among its peers, but currently trades at a 0.7 times 2013 PE/growth, which we view as very attractive.

      "bodyText": "Inmarsat has taken off on talk of a possible bid for the satellite operator. Its shares have jumped 15.2p to 437.2p - a 3.6% rise - on suggestions of a 700p offer, with US giant GE and private equity both mentioned as potential predators. Almost a year ago hedge fund Harbinger - widely seen in the past as a likely bidder - sold its remaining 14% stake at 670p a share. In recent weeks Inmarsat's shares have come under pressure following negative reports from the US about its partner LightSquared. A Federal agency suggested LightSquared's wireless service could cause interference to many GPS receivers, raising concerns about the company's earnings potential. Overall the market edged lower for the second day as investors continued to fret about the lack of resolution to the continuing Greek debt talks. There were also concerns about growth in China. According to a government ministry, its industrial output growth was likely to slow in the current quarter due to problems in the rest of the global economy, not least the eurozone's financial crisis. So the mining sector - already in the spotlight as details were revealed about the proposed merger between Glencore, down 17.5p at 443.25p, and Xstrata, off 61.5p at \u00a312, - came under further pressure. Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation dropped 18.5p 703p, while Kazakhmys climbed 30p to \u00a311.60. All this left the FTSE 100 down just 1.94 points at 5890.26. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said: London stocks suffered further losses today as impatience over the Greek debt talks is really starting to weigh on sentiment. The amount of to-ing and fro-ing that has been going on is causing some to simply think that the sooner Greece exits the eurozone the better as it would eradicate the vast cloud of uncertainty that has prevented markets from heading higher. But it's not just the Greece factor that has left investors a little more nervous today compared to last Friday. Data from the UK, Germany and comments from China did little to inspire confidence in the economic outlook and so mining stocks dragged us lower. On the positive side, Shire rose another 50p to \u00a321.79 after Monday's talk of a possible \u00a335 a share bid. The company was also buoyed by an upgrade from Goldman Sachs. The bank repeated its buy recommendation and raised its target price from \u00a325 to \u00a326, saying: Shire offers the best growth profile and cash return on capital invested expansion among its peers, but currently trades at a 0.7 times 2013 PE/growth, which we view as very attractive. We see upside to 2012 estimates driven by strong US ADHD market growth and Replagal approval in the US. But GlaxoSmithKline slipped 13.5p to \u00a314.06 after its fourth quarter earnings came in slightly below expectations. BP's shares dipped 3.05p to 486.5p on profit-taking after its annual figures showed a $25.7bn profit. But TalkTalk Telecom added 12.6p to 131.5p as it raised its full year guidance. Analysts at Daniel Stewart said: We see strong evidence at TalkTalk of cost-control in a UK consumer environment that, for example, BSkyB recently characterised as \"tough\" (first half results), and on this basis the opportunity to further augment average revenue per user through the launch of a competitive online TV offering.

Tui has now sold more than a third of its 2012 summer holidays, despite putting prices up by 8%. January and February are the peak booking season for package holiday firms but Thomas Cook, which is due to deliver a trading update on Wednesday, has been losing ground to rivals in the wake of weeks of uncertainty over its large borrowings. \"I think we are clearly a beneficiary of the uncertain environment that our competitor is operating in,\" said Tui chief executive Peter Long on Tuesday. \"We have always said that was likely.\" In the UK Tui, which trades under the First Choice and Thomson brands, has \"significantly outperformed\" the market in January. It has sold 35% of its 2012 summer holidays and is on track to comfortably fill its budgeted capacity despite its price rises. The number of holidays on offer is 9% lower than last year, in part reflecting economic conditions for UK holidaymakers and in part the result of political instability in Northern Africa. Any question marks over Thomas Cook's survival prospects appeared to be removed at the end of November when, after twice going cap in hand to its lending banks, the group was granted a \u00a3200m loan extension. However, rivals such as Tui have sought to profit from the damage inflicted on the Thomas Cook brand, launching a series of aggressive advertising campaigns. Thomas Cook interim chief executive Sam Weihagen initially took these attacks on the chin but has since lost his sense of humour over persistent jibes. He has complained to industry trade body Abta, accusing Tui of breaching a code of conduct in recent advertising campaigns that referred to its debt woes. \"No worries about your holiday company and no worries about what you're spending,\" the advert said. \"Unlike a certain holiday company we could mention, you don't need to worry about the way we run our business.\" Last month the usually mild-mannered Weihagen again expressed his frustration with rivals. \"We are a much-loved brand. We are putting our best foot forward. It's a shame to see that others are trying to make things more difficult.\" He added: \"We reduced the number of holidays we had to sell this year. When you take that into consideration we are very close to where we expected to be and certainly in line with last year.\" He will give further details on trading at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "Retailers suffered a drop in sales last month as bargain-hunting shoppers sought to limit their spending ahead of a difficult year. Fears of rising unemployment and the uncertain economic outlook encouraged shoppers to cut back on luxury foods and repay debts instead. Retail sales values were down 0.3% on a like-for-like basis in January, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said, the second worst January since the survey started 17 years ago. The figure compared with last January when sales had risen 2.3%. The figures contrasted with more positive business data last month showing manufacturing and services firms were beginning to be more optimistic about their prospects. However, several economists said the BRC data, which covers 60% of retailers, chimed with weak figures from the CBI's distributive trades survey and poor lending figures from the Bank of England. Without strong consumer spending growth the economy could enter its second recession in three years. A further sign that consumers are wary of spending is likely to weigh heavily on Bank of England policymakers on Thursday when they meet to set interest rates and decide whether the economy needs a further \u00a350bn injection of electronic money. The Bank's programme of quantitative easing has already injected \u00a3275bn into the financial system in an effort to boost lending. The BRC figures showed the decline in retail sales was driven by a sharp slowdown in food sales, following the Christmas boost in December, though non-food sales were weak as well. Stephen Robertson, BRC director general, said: \"Customers parked their worries in December and spent, encouraged by discounts. \"Now, in the New Year, reality has bitten again as concerns about jobs, wages and household costs reassert themselves. \"Despite consumer confidence improving in January, actual spending shows households concentrating on paying off debt, saving and battening down for another tough year.\" Internet, mail-order and phone sales growth slowed in January after picking up sharply in December. Sales were 11.3% up on a year ago, less than December's 18.5% gain but similar to the 12.3% in January last year. Clothing sales slowed sharply to near zero growth after a good December, the BRC said, with womenswear suffering most, while men's and children's clothes continued to show year-on-year gains, albeit much smaller than in December. The association added that any sales were largely discount-driven with a consequent hit on margins as people had waited for clearance sales, especially when buying big-ticket items. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"It is currently hard to be optimistic over the prospects for consumer spending in the early months of 2012 at least. \"Consumers' confidence is still very low despite picking up in January, while their purchasing power is still under severe pressure from relatively high inflation, muted wage growth and tight fiscal policy.\" Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics said the BRC figures provided further evidence that high street spending has slipped back after the pick-up seen at the end of last year. \"Although consumer confidence nudged up in January, it remains at a low level consistent with a further slowdown in sales growth. Overall, then, we still think that the pre-Christmas pick-up in spending was largely a one-off,\" she said.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Glencore merger: Xstrata shareholders vow to oppose deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Plans for a $90bn (\u00a357bn) merger between Xstrata and the commodities trader Glencore have been dealt a major blow after two of the mining group's largest independent shareholders insisted the terms \"clearly undervalued\" Xstrata. The fund manager Standard Life, which holds 63.6m shares in Xstrata, or 1.92%, issued a statement insisting it will oppose the deal on the terms proposed by the mining group's chief executive, Mick Davis, and Glencore. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life, said: \"Although we see some merit in the merger of Xstrata and Glencore, the proposed exchange ratio clearly undervalues Xstrata's assets and future earnings contribution. \"Consequently, it is our intention to vote against the deal unless the merger terms for Xstrata shareholders are materially improved.\" Schroders also said it would vote against the deal as it was currently \"not compelling\". Richard Buxton, head of equities at Schroders, said: \"This is not acceptable. It is not compelling or attractive for Xstrata shareholders and we will vote against. If they keep describing it as a merger of equals, why don't Xstrata shareholders get 50%? We continue to think Xstrata's assets and growth profile are superior to Glencore. We had an opportunity to purchase Glencore shares at flotation and chose not to. That was the right decision.\" The proposed share-based deal would offer Xstrata shareholders 2.8 new shares in Glencore. Despite being described as a \"merger of equals\", the deal values Xstrata at \u00a339.1bn, a premium of almost 28% to its average price for the three months before the bidapproach. The combination to create the fourth largest global resources group was long anticipated even before Glencore joined Xstrata on the London stock market last year. The mining group is already 34% owned by Glencore and the two firms' have headquarters in Switzerland just a few miles apart. Both have been shaped by deal-hungry chief executives \u2013 Davis at Xstrata and Ivan Glasenberg at Glencore \u2013 who were friends at university in South Africa. However, the move by Standard Life and Schroders underlines determination among institutional investors not to allow too cosy a deal. Under current proposals, the merger would only go ahead if it received 75% approval among Xstrata shareholders excluding Glencore. That means rebel shareholders would have to speak for only 16.5% of shares in the mining group to derail the merger. The two groups confirmed that the enlarged business, to be called Glencore Xstrata International, would be led by Davis with Glasenberg as his \"deputy CEO and president\". Similarly, the finance director's role would go to Xstrata's Trevor Reid, while Glencore's finance director Steven Kalmin is to serve as deputy. Despite apparently taking the lesser executive roles, the Glencore team will remain a powerful force on the share register. The top 12 executives currently control almost a third of the commodity trading company. There has already been some speculation about how relaxed Glasenberg would be about ceding control to Davis. Both are frequently described as \"big egos\". In an uncharacteristically deferential statement, the Glencore boss said: \"I look forward to supporting Mick and working as part of what I am confident will be the leading team in the resources sector.\" He added: \"I have worked with Mick for 10 years and Mick has been running a public company for 10 years \u2013 longer than I have.\" Overseeing what is likely to be a crowded and opinionated board will be Xstrata's existing chairman Sir John Bond, one of the FTSE 100's most experienced boardroom heads after having served as chairman of Vodafone and HSBC. Davis said the planned combination was \"the logical next step for two complementary businesses\", while Glasenberg said it created \"a new powerhouse in the global commodities industry\". Davis said the opinions of the two critical shareholders were not representative of the majority. \"The silent majority find it intriguing and appealing,\" he said. Despite being listed in London, where it will be one of the 10 largest businesses quoted on the stock market, the enlarged company, as with its predecessors, will have very little presence in Britain. It will continue under Glencore's corporate structure, which is to be headquartered in Switzerland and incorporated in Jersey for tax reasons. Davis said: \"Sources of supply are diverging from traditional mining regions to more complex and disparate locations, with a range of new industry participants seeking access to markets. At the same time, demand growth has shifted from Europe, Japan and the US, to emerging Asian economies. The commodities value chain is becoming longer and more complex, creating opportunities for a company that can pre-emptively participate at every stage.\"",

Richard Buxton, head of equities at Schroders, said: \"This is not acceptable. It is not compelling or attractive for Xstrata shareholders and we will vote against. If they keep describing it as a merger of equals, why don't Xstrata shareholders get 50%? We continue to think Xstrata's assets and growth profile are superior to Glencore. We had an opportunity to purchase Glencore shares at flotation and chose not to. That was the right decision.\"</p> <p>The proposed share-based deal would offer Xstrata shareholders 2.8 new shares in Glencore. Despite being described as a \"merger of equals\", the deal values Xstrata at \u00a339.1bn, a premium of almost 28% to its average price for the three months before the bidapproach.</p> <p>The combination to create the fourth largest global resources group was long anticipated even before Glencore joined Xstrata on the London stock market last year. The mining group is already 34% owned by Glencore and the two firms' have headquarters in Switzerland just a few miles apart. Both have been shaped by deal-hungry chief executives \u2013 Davis at Xstrata and Ivan Glasenberg at Glencore \u2013 who were friends at university in South Africa.</p> <p>However, the move by Standard Life and Schroders underlines determination among institutional investors not to allow too cosy a deal. Under current proposals, the merger would only go ahead if it received 75% approval among Xstrata shareholders excluding Glencore. That means rebel shareholders would have to speak for only 16.5% of shares in the mining group to derail the merger.</p> <p>The two groups confirmed that the enlarged business, to be called Glencore Xstrata International, would be led by Davis with Glasenberg as his \"deputy CEO and president\". Similarly, the finance director's role would go to Xstrata's Trevor Reid, while Glencore's finance director Steven Kalmin is to serve as deputy.</p> <p>Despite apparently taking the lesser executive roles, the Glencore team will remain a powerful force on the share register. The top 12 executives currently control almost a third of the commodity trading company.</p> <p>There has already been some speculation about how relaxed Glasenberg would be about ceding control to Davis. Both are frequently described as \"big egos\". In an uncharacteristically deferential statement, the Glencore boss said: \"I look forward to supporting Mick and working as part of what I am confident will be the leading team in the resources sector.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I have worked with Mick for 10 years and Mick has been running a public company for 10 years \u2013 longer than I have.\"</p> <p>Overseeing what is likely to be a crowded and opinionated board will be Xstrata's existing chairman Sir John Bond, one of the FTSE 100's most experienced boardroom heads after having served as chairman of Vodafone and HSBC.</p> <p>Davis said the planned combination was \"the logical next step for two complementary businesses\", while Glasenberg said it created \"a new powerhouse in the global commodities industry\".</p> <p>Davis said the opinions of the two critical shareholders were not representative of the majority. \"The silent majority find it intriguing and appealing,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite being listed in London, where it will be one of the 10 largest businesses quoted on the stock market, the enlarged company, as with its predecessors, will have very little presence in Britain. It will continue under Glencore's corporate structure, which is to be headquartered in Switzerland and incorporated in Jersey for tax reasons.</p> <p>Davis said: \"Sources of supply are diverging from traditional mining regions to more complex and disparate locations, with a range of new industry participants seeking access to markets. At the same time, demand growth has shifted from Europe, Japan and the US, to emerging Asian economies. The commodities value chain is becoming longer and more complex, creating opportunities for a company that can pre-emptively participate at every stage.\"</p>",

A 14% increase in the dividend to eight cents per share for the final three months of 2011 was a clear signal of management confidence although net debt still lies at almost $30bn. \"BP is on the right path,\" said Bob Dudley, the chief executive who took over from Tony Hayward following the Deepwater Horizon accident. \"2012 will be a year of increasing investment and milestones as we build on the foundations laid last year. As we move through 2013 and 2014, we expect financial momentum will build as we complete payments into the Gulf of Mexico Trust Fund, restore high-value production and bring new projects on stream,\" he added. The dividend hike was the first since the company resumed payouts last year and had been eagerly anticipated by the City. It came as the oil group reported a fourth quarter profit of $7.6bn, boosted by higher oil prices. The group increased its oil and gas reserves by 103% over the last 12 months through new discoveries although this did not take account of any asset disposals. BP said it had won \"unparalleled\" access to new exploration prospects in 2011 and is now increasing spending for the new financial year \u2013 from $19bn to $22bn. \"We believe this resulted in more new net acreage than accessed by any of our peers in 2011,\" said Dudley. \"We now have a robust pipeline of opportunities with exploration prospects that will generate new resources and projects well into the next decade. We will see a continued ramp up of exploration over the next two to three years.\" BP expects to drill 12 exploration wells in the coming year, twice the number during 2011, and will have eight drilling rigs operating in the US Gulf where an oil spill from the Macondo well in the spring of 2010 caused 11 deaths and devastated beaches. The London-based energy group has already sold off $20bn worth of properties to raise money to pay for liabilities flowing from Macondo and intends to dispose of a further $18bn by the end of next year. BP will face the beginning of a key legal trial in New Orleans into the spill later this month but Dudley said he was still hoping some out-of-court settlement could be arranged with the US department of justice. \"As I have said before, we are prepared to settle if we can do so on fair and reasonable terms, but equally, if this is not possible, we are preparing vigorously for trial.\" Shares in BP rose 2p to 492p in early trading.",
