It has talked of a 350-room Marriott hotel forming part of these plans, alongside 1,200 homes, 58,000 square metres of office space, yoga studios, shops and a creche. Ikea's involvement in the Moxy project is as a property investor, using the financial might of the store group to help fund the ambitious plans for Moxy. Peter Andrews, managing director of Ikea's property arm, said: \"This gives us a great opportunity to use our development expertise to build a high-quality hotel property investment portfolio.\" The new venture is by no means Ikea's first experiment beyond the stores for which it is best known. Inter-Ikea, the holding company behind retail operations, also has a financing division with investment valued at \u20ac2.3bn. The group's property arm has a sprawling European land bank, with real estate in the UK, Spain, Belgium and Poland. Ikea's property division is also planning to diversify into student accommodation in major university towns in the UK, Germany and Belgium. The business, founded in Sweden by Ingvar Kamprad, is now headquartered in the Netherlands and remains privately owned, rarely opening up to publicity. Kamprad's fortune is estimated at $3.3bn (\u00a32bn) by Forbes magazine. The figure is considerably less than it was some years ago after his lawyers produced documents proving he had got rid of his stake in the business decades ago. The sprawling empire is owned by a not-for-profit foundation based in the Netherlands.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne suffered a bruising defeat in Europe on Tuesday as the 26 other EU finance ministers imposed curbs on bankers' bonuses in an unprecedented move targeted at the UK financial services sector. Osborne had travelled to Brussels in a vain attempt to defeat proposals outlined last week to set a limit of a year's salary on bankers' bonuses, protecting the status of the City and Britain's biggest industry \u2013 financial services. \"I cannot support the proposal on the table,\" he told the session. But his pleawas ignored and Britain was left isolated, with no other government opposing the move - which was also supported by the European Central Bank and the European Commission. The City is by far the EU's biggest financial centre and financial services are a tenth of the UK economy. It is an absolute, if unspoken, rule that EU governments never take decisions opposed by a national government if it feels that vital interests are imperilled. Germany had invariably supported Britain on issues of EU regulation of financial services. It is also not yet clear if the bonus caps will apply to European bank subsidiaries operating outside the EU or \u2013 as some governments want \u2013 to US banks in London, Frankfurt and Paris. The \"broad political support\" to clamp down on bankers represents a watershed in Britain's relations with the EU, which have seldom been in greater uncertainty as a result of David Cameron's actions in using a veto at an EU summit, when he demanded an overhaul of the terms of UK membership and pledged a referendum on whether to stay in the EU if he wins a second term in 2015. Martin Schulz, the parliament president acknowledged the UK's position but said \"An agreement has been reached on all aspects of the legislation. There is no possible route for one member state to block the legislation. It would appear that one state has severe difficulties with the agreement but the EU must press ahead and get this important legislation on the statute book.\" In what looked like a move to give Osborne an opportunity to save some face, Germany suggested a slight postponement and slight adjustment of the new regime. The timing and some of the fine detail of how the limits are implemented are to be re-negotiated over the next three weeks. But there was no doubt that the central decision, to clamp down on bonuses, was irreversible. Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the single market said the year's salary ceiling - or payouts equal to two years' salary only if approved by a large majority of a bank's shareholders - was set in stone. He said it was \"crystal clear\" that the cap would go ahead. Barnier rounded on the recklessness of the casino capitalism culture he blamed for the financial crises of the past five years, arguing that bankers were being rewarded for dangerous risk-taking, while taxpayers had to foot the bills for their failures. \"Enough. It's over,\" he declared. The new regime is to apply to 8,300 banks. Barnier wished \"good luck\" to those in London mulling legal action to try to overturn the bonus ceilings. The new legislation, he said, would be on \"a very solid legal basis.\" Session chairman, Michael Noonan of Ireland, said the meeting achieved \"broad political support\" for the limits on bankers' remuneration. Osborne came under attack from Labour for being too slow to try to counter the new legislation and for failing to table alternative proposals over the past couple of years. \"It shouldn't take the EU to rein in excessive bonuses,\" said Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor. He accused Osborne of \"failing to engage with these sensible proposals until the very last minute. It's no wonder that in Brussels he was outnumbered 26 to 1.\" Arlene McCarthy, the Labour MEP and vice-chair of the parliament's economic and monetary committee, said: \"Yet again, we have an example of the government's failure to proactively engage in and influence EU policy in Britain's national interest. Why has the UK government failed in the last 18 months to put an alternative proposal on the table, and waited until the last minute to raise objections?\" Osborne had mounted a robust argument against the proposals, asserting the curbs could have a \"perverse\" effect, generating steep rises in bankers' pay, breaking the link between performance and bonuses, and making it more difficult to \"claw back\" bonuses when unmerited. Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German finance minister, offered a way to soothe the British, hoping to coax Osborne into not voting against the new rules, expected to come into force next year. The German said he wanted avoid pushing the contentious issue to a vote. The question is subject to a qualified majority vote where Britain can oppose but cannot veto. However, it is extremely rare for a vote to be taken. Schaeuble said he wanted the issue carried by consensus, proposing there should be further talks on \"technical details.\"\"There are a few technical issues still to be clarified,\" he said. \"Then I hope in the end the United Kingdom will agree.\" The details still to be settled involve how the bonuses are structured, when they are implemented, and who is subject to them. Under the existing proposal, 25% of a bonus can be made in the form of deferred payments which are discounted. Britain is trying to get that figure increased, perhaps to 30%, probably with Berlin's support. Osborne is also seeking to delay the measures taking effect and may win a 6-12 months postponement. Any changes will need to blessed by the European Parliament which drove the new caps regime through. Barnier said: \"Remuneration is a sensitive issue, sensitive for our citizens, for our taxpayers. We want to discourage risk-taking. Enough is enough. We've got to put a stop to that.\" The CBI said the bonus cap would hit the UK hard: \"The proposals will damage the competitiveness of the EU's financial services industry, hitting the UK particularly hard, at a time when growth should be the key priority.\" Britain's powerful financial sector fears the rules will put London at a disadvantage and provoke an exodus of major banks and staff to rival financial centres. A spokesman for London-based Standard Chartered Bank said: \"We are concerned about it because we are a global bank and 97% of our staff are outside the EU. We are concerned about our ability to be competitive in attracting and retaining talent.\" The new rules will not affect most bank staff, who on average earn bonuses of up to 30% of salary, but target senior management and so-called \"risk takers\", such as traders, whose bonuses can be many times their base salary. Analysts estimate the law will initially affect around 300 to 500 people in each large bank, or around 5,000 people in London all told. One hedge fund manager told Reuters the cap could not be enforced: \"Things like this are completely unpoliceable. If you tax people for writing with their left hand, they'll write with their right hand.\" Views of bonus cap For Reduce risk and protect taxpayers The EU insists that smaller bonuses will give bankers less incentive to gamble, avoiding a repeat of the excess that led to the financial crisis. Bankers should share the pain With the world economy struggling and eurozone unemployment at record levels, many argue it's right to rein in City excess. Encourage banks to focus on smaller customers Austrian MEP Othmar Karas believes bonus caps are part of a sea change in European banking, forcing them to concentrate on small and medium-sized enterprises. Against Bankers will flee Europe This is Boris Johnson predicted: \"The most this measure can hope to achieve is a boost for Zurich and Singapore and New York at the expense of a struggling EU.\" Basic salaries will be raised Banks could get around the cap by increasing basic take-home pay. It will be harder to punish bad bankers Bonuses paid in shares are pegged to a firm's performance, unlike cash salaries. Bonuses can also be clawed back in the event of future losses or fines - basic pay cannot.",

He has vowed to sever all ties with the group's reporters and accused them of damaging US-Saudi relations.</p> <p>In response, the editor of the influential list has written a stinging rebuke saying the prince considers a top-10 ranking one of his priorities, systematically exaggerates his wealth and spends more time and effort than any other businessman on attempts to boost his ranking \u2013 even more time and effort than Donald Trump.</p> <p>Forbes's estimate of Alwaleed's wealth at $20bn puts him behind Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. But Alwaleed, a nephew of the Saudi king whose investments are run by his Kingdom Holding Company, estimates his own wealth at $29.6bn (\u00a319.5bn), which would catapult him into the top 10 of the magazine's richest people on the planet, just behind 90-year-old French cosmetics heiress Liliane Bettencourt.</p> <p>Forbes said the prince's camp wrote four letters in the build-up to the list's publication in an effort to secure a favourable valuation. In one letter his chief financial officer, Shadi Sanbar, said an undervaluation \"strikes in the face of improving Saudi-American bilateral relations and co-operation. Forbes is putting down the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and that is a slap in the face of modernity and progress.\"</p> <p>But Forbes hit back, with billionaire list editor Kerry Dolan explaining it no longer considers the share price of Alwaleed's Saudi-listed Kingdom Holdings an accurate reflection of its value.</p> <p>She points out that the share price would soar by up to 136% in the weeks before Forbes locked in the valuation to calculate its rankings in the past three years.</p> <p>Dolan wrote: \"The value that the prince puts on his holdings at times feels like an alternate reality, including his publicly trading Kingdom Holdings, which rises and falls based on factors that, coincidentally, seem more tied to the Forbes billionaires list than fundamentals.\"</p> <p>In a scathing character assassination, the writer describes the prince as a vainglorious businessman in the \"absurdly opulent\" surroundings of his marble-clad palaces filled with portraits of himself. \"If he needs to go on a business trip, he has his own 747, \u00e0 la Air Force One, except unlike the president, his plane has a throne.\"</p> <p>During a trip to Riyadh in 2008, the article said, he showed off his wealth, including what he claimed was a $700m haul of jewels, and sent the magazine's US offices mocked up copies of Vanity Fair, Time 100 and Forbes magazine itself with his face adorning the front covers, according to Dolan.</p> <p>\"Of the 1,426 billionaires on our list, not one \u2013 not even the vainglorious Donald Trump \u2013 goes to greater measure to try to affect his or her ranking.</p> <p>\"In 2006 when Forbes estimated that the prince was actually worth $7bn less than he said he was, he called me at home the day after the list was released, sounding nearly in tears.\"</p> <p>Shares in Kingdom Holdings, his vehicle for investments in Citigroup, Newscorp and Apple, among others, would rise in the 10 weeks before the Forbes list was finalised.</p> <p>In 2010 its shares rose 57%, despite shares in Citigroup falling 20% in the same period. In 2011 the same happened, with a 31% rise in Kingdom's shares, and in 2012 they jumped 136%.</p> <p>A former Alwaleed executive told Forbes that market manipulation in Saudi Arabia was rife. The magazine quoted the executive as saying: \"This is the national sport&#xa0;\u2026 There are no casinos. It's the gambling site of the Saudis.\"</p> <p>The prince, who enjoys the nickname \"the Buffett of Arabia\" after shrewd investments in eBay and Apple, called the allegations \"completely unsupported and biased\".</p> <p>A statement added: \"The application of differing standards of proof for different individuals and organizations results in an arbitrary and confusing set of standards that seems demonstrably biased against the Middle East.\"</p> <p>Sanbar, chief financial officer of Kingdom Holding, said: \"We have worked very openly with the Forbes team over the years and have on multiple occasions pointed out problems with their methodology that need correction.</p> <p>\"However, after several years of our efforts to correct mistakes falling on deaf ears, we have decided that Forbes has no intention of improving the accuracy of their valuation of our holdings and we have made the decision to move on.\"</p> <p>He said they would now focus on working with Bloomberg Billionaires index, a Forbes rival launched last year, which estimates the prince's wealth at $28bn, ranking him not in the top 10, but the world's 16th wealthiest person.</p> <h2>A princely sum</h2> <p>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal boasts that Forbes has referred to him twice as \"one of the world's most intelligent and creative investors\". On his website he claims to have met more than 250 heads of state and world leaders and says: \"As a man of significant wealth and influence, Prince Alwaleed is humbled when people look to him for advice and guidance on issues such as religion, global peace and how society should adapt to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\"</p> <p>The Saudi prince, 57, owns 95% of the Kingdom Holding Company, which trades on the Saudi stock exchange. As well as shares in companies such as News Corp and Citibank it holds stakes in a string of luxury hotels including the Savoy in London, the George V in Paris and the Fairmont Raffles.</p> <p>The company started investing in Apple in 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned to the helm of the company he founded. It recently bought an estimated 3% of Twitter for $300m (\u00a3230m) and has stakes in AOL and Motorola.</p> <p>Not all his investments have been a great success. In 1997 he bought a stake in TWA, which declared chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2001 and merged with American Airlines. Another notable failure was Kodak, which went bust last year, overwhelmed by the digital photography revolution.</p> <p>He invested in Euro Disney in 1994, and in 1995 helped complete Canary Wharf by putting in cash when the owner was in receivership. The group holds a third of Jeddah Economic, which owns the project to build the 1,000-metre, $1.2bn Kingdom Tower in Jeddah.</p> <p>The prince also holds an 80% stake in Rotana, one of the Middle East's biggest media companies.</p> <p>His 200 cars include a Rolls-Royce Phantom and Lamborghinis and Ferraris. His fleet of private jets includes a Boeing 747, an Airbus 321 and a Hawker Siddeley 125.</p> <p>According to Forbes he was the first individual to buy an Airbus A380 double decker plane and was supposed to take delivery of it this spring, but Kingdom Holding's chief financial officer told the magazine that the plane has been sold.</p>",

Dolan wrote: \"The value that the prince puts on his holdings at times feels like an alternate reality, including his publicly trading Kingdom Holdings, which rises and falls based on factors that, coincidentally, seem more tied to the Forbes billionaires list than fundamentals.\" In a scathing character assassination, the writer describes the prince as a vainglorious businessman in the \"absurdly opulent\" surroundings of his marble-clad palaces filled with portraits of himself. \"If he needs to go on a business trip, he has his own 747, \u00e0 la Air Force One, except unlike the president, his plane has a throne.\" During a trip to Riyadh in 2008, the article said, he showed off his wealth, including what he claimed was a $700m haul of jewels, and sent the magazine's US offices mocked up copies of Vanity Fair, Time 100 and Forbes magazine itself with his face adorning the front covers, according to Dolan. \"Of the 1,426 billionaires on our list, not one \u2013 not even the vainglorious Donald Trump \u2013 goes to greater measure to try to affect his or her ranking. \"In 2006 when Forbes estimated that the prince was actually worth $7bn less than he said he was, he called me at home the day after the list was released, sounding nearly in tears.\" Shares in Kingdom Holdings, his vehicle for investments in Citigroup, Newscorp and Apple, among others, would rise in the 10 weeks before the Forbes list was finalised. In 2010 its shares rose 57%, despite shares in Citigroup falling 20% in the same period. In 2011 the same happened, with a 31% rise in Kingdom's shares, and in 2012 they jumped 136%. A former Alwaleed executive told Forbes that market manipulation in Saudi Arabia was rife. The magazine quoted the executive as saying: \"This is the national sport \u2026 There are no casinos. It's the gambling site of the Saudis.\" The prince, who enjoys the nickname \"the Buffett of Arabia\" after shrewd investments in eBay and Apple, called the allegations \"completely unsupported and biased\". A statement added: \"The application of differing standards of proof for different individuals and organizations results in an arbitrary and confusing set of standards that seems demonstrably biased against the Middle East.\" Sanbar, chief financial officer of Kingdom Holding, said: \"We have worked very openly with the Forbes team over the years and have on multiple occasions pointed out problems with their methodology that need correction. \"However, after several years of our efforts to correct mistakes falling on deaf ears, we have decided that Forbes has no intention of improving the accuracy of their valuation of our holdings and we have made the decision to move on.\" He said they would now focus on working with Bloomberg Billionaires index, a Forbes rival launched last year, which estimates the prince's wealth at $28bn, ranking him not in the top 10, but the world's 16th wealthiest person. A princely sum Prince Alwaleed bin Talal boasts that Forbes has referred to him twice as \"one of the world's most intelligent and creative investors\". On his website he claims to have met more than 250 heads of state and world leaders and says: \"As a man of significant wealth and influence, Prince Alwaleed is humbled when people look to him for advice and guidance on issues such as religion, global peace and how society should adapt to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\" The Saudi prince, 57, owns 95% of the Kingdom Holding Company, which trades on the Saudi stock exchange. As well as shares in companies such as News Corp and Citibank it holds stakes in a string of luxury hotels including the Savoy in London, the George V in Paris and the Fairmont Raffles. The company started investing in Apple in 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned to the helm of the company he founded. It recently bought an estimated 3% of Twitter for $300m (\u00a3230m) and has stakes in AOL and Motorola. Not all his investments have been a great success. In 1997 he bought a stake in TWA, which declared chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2001 and merged with American Airlines. Another notable failure was Kodak, which went bust last year, overwhelmed by the digital photography revolution. He invested in Euro Disney in 1994, and in 1995 helped complete Canary Wharf by putting in cash when the owner was in receivership. The group holds a third of Jeddah Economic, which owns the project to build the 1,000-metre, $1.2bn Kingdom Tower in Jeddah. The prince also holds an 80% stake in Rotana, one of the Middle East's biggest media companies. His 200 cars include a Rolls-Royce Phantom and Lamborghinis and Ferraris. His fleet of private jets includes a Boeing 747, an Airbus 321 and a Hawker Siddeley 125. According to Forbes he was the first individual to buy an Airbus A380 double decker plane and was supposed to take delivery of it this spring, but Kingdom Holding's chief financial officer told the magazine that the plane has been sold.",

      "bodyText": "With negotiations concluded in Brussels, and Europe's stock markets closed, it's time to shutter the live blog for another day. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, has summed up today's events: European governments decided on Tuesday to impose curbs on bankers\u2019 bonuses in the City in a major blow to the chancellor, George Osborne, acting on the UK financial services sector for the first time against British wishes. Osborne went to Brussels to a meeting of 27 EU finance ministers in a vain attempt to defeat proposals agreed last week generally setting a limit of a year\u2019s salary on bankers\u2019 bonuses. \u201cI cannot support the proposal on the table,\u201d he told the session on Tuesday. He was ignored. Britain was isolated, with no other government opposing the move which was also supported by the European Central Bank and the European Commission. The meeting achieved \u201cbroad political support\u201d for the limits on bankers\u2019 remuneration, in the words of the session chairman, Michael Noonan of Ireland. In a sop to UK sensibilities, Germany suggested a slight postponement and slight adjustment of the new regime in what looked like giving Osborne an opportunity to save face. The timing and some of the fine detail of how the limits are implemented are to be re-negotiated over the next three weeks. But there was no doubt that the central decision, to clamp down on bonuses, was irreversible. Ian's full story will be online shortly (keep watching our site). Here are some other key points from the day: \u2022 Commissioner Michel Barnier ruling out any changes to bonus caps \u2022 Ed Balls criticising Osborne \u2022 Photos from this morning's meeting \u2022 Highlights of the session at which Osborne argued against the plan Thanks for reading, and for all the comments. Goodnight! The CBI, which represents British businesses, has criticised the EU's decision to push on with bonus caps. Katja Hall, CBI Chief Policy Director, said: It\u2019s disappointing that EU Ministers are pursuing these proposals because they will undermine the important role that shareholders play in guiding pay policy and make it less responsive to performance. \u201cThe proposals will damage the competitiveness of the EU\u2019s financial services industry, hitting the UK particularly hard, at a time when growth should be the key priority. Hall added that there is scope for some details to change. But as we explained earlier, the flat caps (at 100% of annual pay) won't change. The prospect of lower bank bonuses didn't hit shares in London today, where the FTSE 100 rallied to a fresh five-year high. This was driven by the Dow Jones hitting a new all time high today (see 3.52pm) (which sounds a bit circular, and is) Despite the weak state of the world economy, Europe's unemployment crisis, the lack of progress over US deficit cuts, the political crisis in Italy and all the other things wrong today, financial markets seem to be heading higher. Here's the closing prices FTSE 100: up 86 points at 6431, +1.3% German DAX: up 178 points at 7870, +2.32% French CAC: up 77 points at 3787, +2.1% Spanish IBEX: up 177 points at 8423, +2.15% Italian FTSE MIB: up 432 points at 15974, +2.78% There were good reasons behind the rally too, as Nick Dale Lace \u2013 Senior Sales Trader at CMC Markets UK, explains: Oil &amp; Gas services provider John Wood Group closed almost 8% higher after announcing better-than-expected numbers for 2012 and guiding positively for this year. Also hoping to avoid the chop in this week\u2019s index re-shuffle are outsources Serco, who did no harm to their cause with a 9% rally after similarly impressive earnings. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has criticised George Osborne for his efforts in Brussels today. Not a major surprise, of course \u2013 the pair appear to only agree on one thing; that the other man is incompetent. Anyway, Balls argues that Osborne should have acted earlier on bonuses, rather than leaving the issue clear for the EU. He wrote: How on earth did he get himself in this position? It shouldn't take the European Union to rein in excessive bonuses, but George Osborne has dragged his feet and refused to act in Britain. And he failed to engage with these sensible proposals to limit bonuses to a maximum of a year's salary or double that if explicitly backed by shareholders - proposals which even his own MEPs have backed \u2013 until the very last minute. It\u2019s no wonder that in Brussels today he was outnumbered 26 to one. There should be fair rewards for performance, but it is right that there is action to rein in bloated bonuses which are a device for keeping traders focused on the weeks ahead, rather than years ahead. In the absence of action in Britain, George Osborne is on very weak ground trying to stop or unpick these proposals. The Labour party also published a new policy review today, which argued for an end to the \"short-termist culture in British business\". That included closer links between pay and long-term performance (which, ironically, is one of the arguments Osborne made against a flat bonus cap today - see 11.21am). On the issue of pay, leading City analyst Louise Cooper argues that bank remuneration isn't excessive given the size of the sector. She points out that the BBC pays its top six stars over \u00a31m per year, from revenues of \u00a35bn. HSBC, in comparison, has ten times the revenue and 10 times as many seven-figure earners: Watch it below, or on her site here (scroll to 2.00m in) Louise has also helped cover Justin Bieber's misdeeds for the Guardian today - Justin Bieber's late O2 appearance \u2013 he's lost at least one (adult) Belieber. So at least someone deserves a bonus....(no not you, Justin). The UK Treasury is putting a brave face on George Osborne's (predictable, and predicted) failure to persuade the rest of the European Union to drop plans to curb bankers pay. Officials said that EU ministers were warned that the cap could create \"perverse effects\", such as pushing up basic salary levels. As a Treasury spokesman put it: We would like to see these addressed and there has been some progress made today. Other countries understood our position. If you're just joining us, I covered George Osborne's comments to the Ecofin meeting today from 11.18am. But while other ministers agreed to technical changes, we got confirmation this afternoon that bonuses will remain capped at 100% of pay (see 2.47pm onwards). While the Ecofin press conference was taking place the Dow Jones industrial average hit a new record high. The Dow has jumped by 136 points in the first hour of trading, hitting 14263 - the first time it's ever been above the 14200 mark. To be an official record, it must close above 14164.53. From Wall Street, Dominic Rushe reports that better-than-expected retail figures from Europe helped to drive shares higher: The Dow has not touched these levels since before Barack Obama's first election victory. Global stock markets went into freefall shortly after, as the implosion of housing market and Europe's woes dragged the world into the worst financial crisis in living memory. Massive issues remain, however. Unemployment, especially among the young, remains high, and in Washington politicians are still at loggerhead over America's massive debts. Last Friday the government started making $85bn of cuts \u2013 known as the sequester \u2013 in a move Obama and others predicted would cause widespread chaos and financial hardship. In Europe, major US companies including GM and Ford are being hit by the region's continuing economic crisis. But these are old debates now \u2013 and Wall Street doesn't seem to be worried. Full story here. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, has argued that the UK should stop trying to block curbs on bankers' pay: George Osborne is deluded if he thinks the public want him to bat for bankers' bonuses when he could be batting for the wider interests of Britain. Osborne should be ensuring banks pay their fair share back to society and not lobbying to preserve the City's culture of obscene pay. But the Telegraph's Jeremy Warner suggests the EU has more important issues on its plate, given the ongoing recession in the eurozone: It's official, there is no chance of the European Union changing its mind on imposing strict caps on bankers' bonuses. Michel Barnier, European commissioner for internal market and services, told the press conference that the EU will not drop the requirement that bonuses cannot exceed 100% of annual salary (or 200% if shareholders give their approval). Asked by the Daily Telegraph's man in Brussels, Bruno Waterfield, to confirm with childlike simplicity whether the 1:1 and 1:2 caps were fixed, Barnier replied: Yes. Crystal clear. So despite persuading the Ecofin meeting to consider some technical changes, George Osborne has not managed the harder task of getting the measures changed in a meaningful way. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan has indicated that George Osborne will not succeed in changing the bank bonus cap rules. Asked by our own Ian Traynor to clarify exactly what technical issues could be changed, Noonan explained that it's mainly small details. Some countries are worried that they can't get the measures implemented through their national parliaments in time, he says, while others want to push it through faster than planned. But the \"broad agreement\" of the committee is that the package of measures for financial reform will proceed. Noonan added that he expects the technical work to be completed by the end of March -- so we're not looking at major changes. The Ecofin press conference began by discussing Cyprus's request for a bailout, and Ireland and Portugal's push for their existing bailout deals to be relaxed: RTE's Tony Connelly has the details: In Brussels, the Ecofin press conference is underway - and being streamed live here. Highlights to follow Reuters and the Associated Press have also filed stories on George Osborne's stance in Brussels today - and both agree that the chancellor was isolated on the bankers pay issue. Here's Reuters take: Osborne fights alone against EU bank bonus cap It explains: Opening up the possibility of some change, Michael Noonan, the finance minister of Ireland, which negotiated the deal with the European Parliament because it holds the EU's six-month rotating presidency, said officials would now examine technical issues surrounding the rules. Britain could try to push to change the scope of the rules, which will apply to all EU bank staff globally, regardless of where they are based, or propose extra flexibility on how bonuses are calculated. But added... While the finance ministers agreed not to finalise the deal on Tuesday, partly out of courtesy to Osborne, there is little appetite to change the deal. And AP explains why EU officials are nervous about appearing to slam the cap onto Britain: The bonus cap is part of a sweeping 1,000-page package of financial laws that would require banks starting next year to hold more capital and liquidity reserves to shield taxpayers from having to pay for more expensive bailouts. It would also lay the groundwork for a single banking supervisory mechanism for the group of 17 European Union countries that use the euro. Not only does this new bonus cap \u2014 set at one year's base salary or double that if a large majority of the bank's shareholders agree \u2014 affect all of Europe's banks but it will also be mandatory for European units of foreign banks and the employees of EU banks working overseas, for example in New York. European officials are trying to avoid forcing the legislation through without Britain's consent \u2014 a politically toxic move given the already significant level of euro-skepticism in the U.K. More here: EU Pushes Ahead With Bonus Cap Despite UK Concerns The FT's Peter Spiegel reports that EU commissioner Michel Barnier is briefing journalists about today's discussions now: ITV's Laura Kuenssberg sums up the events in Brussels: So, to recap on the main events so far today: \u2022 George Osborne was isolated in Brussels today as he urged fellow finance ministers not to impose new caps on bankers' bonuses. \u2022 The chancellor was the only minister to publicly criticise the plan (which restricts bonuses to a year's salary), at today's Ecofin meeting in Brussels. \u2022 Osborne told the meeting that the plan could be counter-productive, as it would lead to higher basic salaries and make it harder to claw payments back from bankers. He said: It will push salaries up, it will make it more difficult to claw back bankers' bonuses when things go wrong, it will make it more difficult to ensure that the banks and the bankers pay when there are mistakes, rather than the taxpayer. \u2022 But a string of other ministers welcomed the plan, saying it would help avoid excessive risk-taking in the European banking sector. Denmark's finance minister Margrethe Vestager, said it was a \"very good day\" for Europe, as it stabilises its financial system \u2022 The technical details of the plan will now be examined by officials. with no vote taking place today today. \u2022 As Ian Traynor explained at 12.06pm, Geoge Osborne would rather the EU demanded that bonuses were pegged to a bank's long-term performance, and consisted of shares rather than cash, rather than a flat cap. Any changes, though, would need to be agreed with the European Parliament. Here are a few photos from the Ecofin meeting today: From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor has very rapidly filed this report of the events at Ecofin: George Osborne told EU finance ministers on Tuesday that he could not support proposals to limit bankers\u2019 bonuses to a year\u2019s salary. Osborne won limited support for \u201ctechnical\u201d tweaks to the draft legislation, although it appeared unlikely that Britain would make big gains in seeking to reverse the key points. Osborne argued that Britain already had the toughest regime in the world on bankers\u2019 remuneration and that the proposals to cap bonuses could \u201chave a perverse effect\u201d. The caps could \u201cundermine\u201d the aim of reining in unmerited bonuses, would result in bankers\u2019 salaries rising steeply and would make it harder to claw back bonuses not commensurate with performance. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the powerful German finance minister, threw Britain a slender lifeline, saying he wanted to avoid the contentious issue being put to a vote. In the interests of securing a consensus, he called for the further elaboration of \u201ctechnical points\u201d on how the bonus curbs should be implemented. There was also disagreement on when the new regime should become effective. The proposal calls for the caps to be introduced at the beginning of next year, but some ministers called for a delay. \u201cI can\u2019t support the proposal on the table,\u201d said Osborne, who is hoping to shift the caps issue towards greater emphasis on discounted and deferred five-year bonuses based on longer-term performance and less cash-oriented than share options. The meeting began with Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the single market, argued robustly for the caps. \u201cRemuneration is a sensitive issue, sensitive for our citizens, for our taxpayers,\u201d Barnier, said. \u201cWe want to discourage risk-taking.\u201d Some bankers, he added, indulged in risky business because they were paid to. \u201cEnough is enough. We\u2019ve got to put a stop to that.\u201d Chairing the meeting, Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, closed the discussion saying there was a \u201cbroad majority\u201d behind the proposals. But that there would be further discussion \u201con some technical points\u201d on how to implement the bonus caps and on the timing issue. Any changes would need to be agreed with the European Parliament which forced the issue of curbs on bankers\u2019 bonuses. Chancellor George Osborne got his chance to speak again, and urged EU finance ministers to respect the agreement that was hammered out regarding banking union, offering safeguards to European countries who are outside the eurozone. A reminder that you can see the discussion here (I can't find a way of embedding the video without it playing automatically, which annoys some readers). Michael Noonan, who is chairing today's committee, asks for some clarification and then decides that \u2026 there is broad consensus on bank bonus cap, but that some details to be ironed out in coming weeks. Ministers are now talking about other aspects of the proposals for Europe's financial sector. Interestingly, several finance ministers, including Portugal's V\u00edtor Gaspar, are talking about the need for further technical work to be done on the pay plans. That could mean that ministers don't vote today \u2013 which would please George Osborne. Now the Greek finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, links the proposal to limit bankers bonuses to the hard fiscal reforms in Greece. Greece is a country that is suffering from austerity, so it would not be appropriate not to accept the compromise today. The Italian finance minister, Vittorio Grilli, says he would be happy if a decision wasn't taken today, but if there is a vote now than Italy would support the plan on the table. Osborne looks very isolated, with a string of other finance ministers taking the microphone and offering support for the bonus cap plan. Sweden's Anders Borg, for example, said his country are prepared to support the plan today. He argues that it's important that banks build stronger capital reserves: For us, we have seen capital requirements come up, and that is the core of the issue. The Netherlands backs the plan, and seeks assurances that individual countries will have the flexibility to impose tougher restrictions (ie, bonuses at a lower percentage of salary). Germany's Wolfgang Schauble offers a bit of support for Britain, saying that it would be best to avoid a qualified majority vote now (which the UK would lose) Osborne is pushing his EU colleagues for a deal based around deferred bonuses linked to long-term performance, rather than a flat cap at 100% of base salary. He's hoping to avoid a vote now which Britain loses: Osborne says Britain has three main objections to the EU bonus cap plan: 1) It will push basic pay up 2) It will make it harder to claw bonuses back 3) It will make it harder to make bankers pay when things go wrong. The chancellor then says that he cannot support the proposal on the table now, but suggests \"progress\" can be made, so that in a few weeks there is a proposal that the largest financial sector in the EU can support wholeheartedly. George Osborne is speaking in Brussels now. The chancellor starts by saying that Britain welcomes measures to make the banking system safer and bankers more accountable. However, the pay cap on the table could, he claims, have \"perverse effects\" and encourage irresponsibility. Osborne says the Britain has been leading the way on bankers remuneration in recent years, on transparency and clawbacks. We have been absolutely clear that more and more of the pay and bonus that goes to bankers should be tied to the long-term performance of bankers. If things go wrong, the money is clawed back. The Ecofin debate in Brussels has started, and is being streamed live here: Council of the European Union - Economic and Financial Affairs Capping a banker's bonus at 100% of their basic salary sounds fair and reasonable to many people, so what's the problem? Opposition to the plan boils down to two key points: 1) Bankers will flee, rather than work for an EU institution where their wealth-generating powers are curtailed. This is the Boris Johnson argument. The Mayer of London warned on Sunday: This is possibly the most deluded measure to come from Europe since Diocletian tried to fix the price of groceries across the Roman Empire. The most this measure can hope to achieve is a boost for Zurich and Singapore and New York at the expense of a struggling EU. 2) Banks will just raise basic salaries instead This would allow them to maintain high pay levels, but potentially make any economic downturn more damaging: James Barty, financial policy expert at Policy Exchange, explains: That has the effect of raising the fixed costs of a bank meaning that they are more vulnerable to any downturn, as it is much harder to cut salaries than bonuses when things go wrong. Austria's finance minister, Maria Fekter, has confirmed that Osborne is isolated in Brussels today, over the pay plan, saying: These rules have very wide backing \u2026 As far as I know, only the British are against. There's little chance of entente cordiale in Brussels today \u2013 France has already said that it won't accept any changes to the bankers' pay restraint plan. Late last night, France's finance minister Pierre Moscovici said: Everyone must live with what is on the table. I told George Osborne, when I was in London, these moral rules apply to everyone, even the City. Britain, though, isn't convinced. Yesterday, David Cameron's spokesman said that the UK still has \"real concerns on the proposals\". Belgium's finance minister, Steven Vanackere, has resigned, following a deepening row over financial relations between a Belgian bank and a workers' organisation which is linked to his political party. Vanackere's surprise decision to quit which means he won't be represent the Belgian government at today's Ecofin meeting. Ian Traynor reports from Brussels: Steven Vanackere, Belgium's finance minister and deputy PM, looks to be a conspicuous absence at today's Ecofin meeting. Vanackere denied at the weekend that one of his aides was performing a dual role at the state-owned bank Belfius and was found to have been more than economical with the truth. Back to Europe, where the European Trade Union Confederation has (unsurprisingly) welcomed Sunday's Swiss referendum taming excessive remuneration in the banking sector. It also urged EU finance ministers to act swiftly on the bankers' caps today, my colleague Ian Traynor reports from Brussels. Bernadette S\u00e9gol, ETUC general secretary, said it was important to tame the excesses in the banking sector: The compromise deal will ensure that bankers\u2019 horrendous annual bonus payments are capped and greater transparency for banks' accounts is provided for, on top of better capital requirements. The financial crisis has demonstrated that the system of high gratifications [sic] in the banking sector has led to wrong incentives for bankers to take on risks at the expense of society as a whole. The Swiss, incidentally, voted to impose tough new controls on executive pay, including giving shareholders a binding vote on compensation (rather than the current 'advisory' votes which have little sway on companies). This graph shows how activity in Britain's dominant service sector (the blue line) has risen to today's five-month high, but remains some way below the levels in early 2010 as Britain left the recession of 2008-2009. Some good news for George Osborne \u2013 Britain's service sector is growing at its fastest pace in five months. At 51.8, February's UK services PMI (just released) shows the fastest growth since last September (up from January's 51.5). Service sector bosses were also more optimistic about the future. According to Markit (which compiles the data), the service sector is performing strongly enough to drag Britain back to meagre economic growth, of perhaps 0.1% in the current quarter. That would mean the UK missed the dreaded triple-dip recession, but 0.1% growth isn't exactly a reason to get the bunting out. The EU finance leaders meeting in Brussels now have been reminded that the eurozone economy is in a bad way \u2013 new economic surveys have shown that its service sector is contracting at a faster pace. France's service sector shrank sharply again in February, according to today's PMI*, which showed the second largest contraction since March 2009 (it was recorded at 43.7, up from January's 43.6). And Italy's service sector declined at a faster pace, with a PMI of 43.6 down from 43.9 in January. Germany's service sector is growing steadily, with a PMI of 54.7 (down from January's rollicking 55.7, though). But the overall eurozone service sector PMI still showed another conrtraction, at 47.9, down from 48.6 in January. * Purchasing Manager's Index \u2013 which polls hundreds of business people in a particular country to see how their firm is performing. Any number below 50 equals a contraction, while 50+ means the sector grew. Vote Watch Europe has pulled together a very useful explanation (click here to download it) about the voting procedure at today's Brussels meeting. There won't actually be a formal vote, but the Irish council presidency will want to establish whether its tentative deal with the European parliament (agreed last week) has the support of a qualified majority of EU member states. A qualified majority is reached if: \u2022 a simple majority of member states supports the proposal, and \u2022 a minimum of 255 votes is cast in favour, out of a total of 345 votes. In addition, a member state may ask for confirmation that the votes in favour represent at least 62% of the total population of the union. The UK holds 29 votes. In order to block the compromise, it needs an additional 62 votes (either through votes against, or abstentions) This voting calculator lets you work how a blocking minority can be reached: Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, also spoke to the Brussels press pack. He said the proposal to cap bonuses at 100% of salaries was an \"acceptable compromise\", adding that the Netherlands itself had to go further on the issue. Ireland's finance minister has just warned George Osborne not to get its hopes up, as he arrived for today's meeting. Michael Noonan told reporters in Brussels that there's no chance of making major changes to the bonus cap plan, agreed by EU officials last week. Noonan said: The British authorities have problems with the banker bonus issue. There is very little further we can do for them because we pushed the negotiations to quite a degree and we got the best possible compromise with the parliament. So there isn't any more room left really. Ireland, of course, holds the presidency of the EU Good morning. In the late 19th century Britain proudly pursued a policy of splendid isolation. Today, George Osborne will be isolated, although perhaps not so splendidly, as European finance ministers gather to discuss plans to clamp down on bankers pay. The chancellor headed to the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels, determined to water down plans to restrict bonuses to 100% of basic salary (rising to 200% if shareholders give the green light). But Osborne has few allies to call on, with the rest of Europe determined to keep remuneration in the financial sector away from vertiginous levels. As our Europe editor Ian Traynor reported yesterday, Britain will have few friends in the room when the proposals are discussed, Likely allies Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands all agree with the plan, which has caused howls of dismay in the City, but been welcomed in other quarters. Osborne can't veto the proposals, but he might win some concessions. Or Britain's objections could be simply swept aside. A comprehensive defeat would be 'a moment' in European terms, as Ian explained last night: Tuesday's decision, followed by a formal vote in the parliament in May, represents a watershed for the British in Europe since it is an unwritten rule that EU governments never vote against a big member state on an issue of vital national importance. London is the EU's financial capital by some distance. Bankers pay is the main event at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin), but ministers will also discuss some important issues in the eurozone crisis, including Ireland and Portugal's requests to have their bailout terms eased. We'll be tracking all the action from Brussels today, and other events across the eurozone crisis and beyond as usual.",

It would also lay the groundwork for a single banking supervisory mechanism for the group of 17 European Union countries that use the euro.</p> <p>Not only does this new bonus cap \u2014 set at one year's base salary or double that if a large majority of the bank's shareholders agree \u2014 affect all of Europe's banks but it will also be mandatory for European units of foreign banks and the employees of EU banks working overseas, for example in New York.</p> <p>European officials are trying to avoid forcing the legislation through without Britain's consent \u2014 a politically toxic move given the already significant level of euro-skepticism in the U.K.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2013/03/05/world/europe/ap-eu-europe-financial-crisis.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">EU Pushes Ahead With Bonus Cap Despite UK Concerns</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5135fb0695cb2be75ea3f63e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-05T14:02:46.926Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FT's Peter Spiegel reports that&#xa0;EU commissioner Michel Barnier is briefing journalists about today's discussions now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SpiegelPeter/status/308939486253969408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Ahead of presser, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23EU\">#EU</a> financial services chief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Barnier\">#Barnier</a> gaggles w/reporters <a href=\"http://t.co/CaNphsSuvT\" title=\"http://twitter.com/SpiegelPeter/status/308939486253969408/photo/1\">twitter.com/SpiegelPeter/s\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Peter Spiegel (@SpiegelPeter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpiegelPeter/status/308939486253969408\">March 5, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5135f841b57964c2894af33e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-05T13:50:58.098Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>ITV's Laura Kuenssberg sums up the events in Brussels:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/status/308925142485045250\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>So after Osborne meeting - 'technical discussions' will look at timetable for new rules + how cap will work</p>&mdash; Laura Kuenssberg (@ITVLauraK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/status/308925142485045250\">March 5, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/status/308925461730295809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>But Chancellor did not attempt to get the bonus cap plan torn up - no discussion of 'Luxembourg' principle</p>&mdash; Laura Kuenssberg (@ITVLauraK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/status/308925461730295809\">March 5, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/status/308925651082174464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>UK attention now on trying to get balance btw cap on long term and short term bonuses right</p>&mdash; Laura Kuenssberg (@ITVLauraK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/status/308925651082174464\">March 5, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5135ebcfb57964c2894af330\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-05T13:42:33.923Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A quick recap</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>So, to recap on the main events so far today:</strong></p> <p>\u2022 George Osborne was isolated in Brussels today as he urged fellow finance ministers not to impose new caps on bankers' bonuses.</p> <p>\u2022 The chancellor was the only minister to publicly criticise the plan (which restricts bonuses to a year's salary), at today's Ecofin meeting in Brussels.</p> <p>\u2022 Osborne told the meeting that the plan could be counter-productive, as it would lead to higher basic salaries and make it harder to claw payments back from bankers. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will push salaries up, it will make it more difficult to claw back bankers' bonuses when things go wrong, it will make it more difficult to ensure that the banks and the bankers pay when there are mistakes, rather than the taxpayer.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 But a string of other ministers welcomed the plan, saying it would help avoid excessive risk-taking in the European banking sector.</p> <p>Denmark's finance minister <strong>Margrethe Vestager</strong>, said it was a \"very good day\" for Europe, as it stabilises its financial system</p> <p>\u2022 The technical details of the plan will now be examined by officials. with no vote taking place today today.</p> <p>\u2022 As <strong>Ian Traynor</strong> explained <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/05/eurozone-crisis-osborne-eu-bank-bonus-cap#block-5135dfb2b57964c2894af32e\">at 12.06pm,</a> Geoge Osborne would rather the EU demanded that bonuses were pegged to a bank's long-term performance, and consisted of shares rather than cash, rather than a flat cap.

In the interests of securing a consensus, he called for the further elaboration of \u201ctechnical points\u201d on how the bonus curbs should be implemented.</p> <p>There was also disagreement on when the new regime should become effective. The proposal calls for the caps to be introduced at the beginning of next year, but some ministers called for a delay.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t support the proposal on the table,\u201d said Osborne, who is hoping to shift the caps issue towards greater emphasis on discounted and deferred five-year bonuses based on longer-term performance and less cash-oriented than share options.</p> </blockquote> <p>The meeting began with Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the single market, argued robustly for the caps.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&#xa0;\u201cRemuneration is a sensitive issue, sensitive for our citizens, for our taxpayers,\u201d Barnier, said. \u201cWe want to discourage risk-taking.\u201d</p> <p>Some bankers, he added, indulged in risky business because they were paid to.</p> <p>\u201cEnough is enough.

What he has not earned, however, is the love of the City. As Glasenberg spent the first part of his results presentation on Tuesday boasting of how Glencore's performance in 2012 had been \"far more robust than the sector\", it was easy to forget quite how badly the firm's shares had fared since the IPO in May 2011, notwithstanding the 6% gain on Tuesday. The fall from 530p to 392p is ugly, even in an industry no longer enjoying boom-time conditions. Among London's big five miners, only Anglo-American, whose platinum operations in South Africa are experiencing strife and whose Brazilian iron ore project has had costly overruns, has done worse than Glencore in share price terms since mid-2011. What's the problem? In part, it's Glencore's complexity. The group's profits are healthier than the competition's at the top line: the marketing division was, on Tuesday, up 11%, and the mines the firm controls had a 27% decline in profits \u2013 which was better than most big rivals. But at pre-tax level Glencore reported a 75% plunge in profits to $1bn. The difference is explained by a thumping impairment hit of $2.1bn, led by a $1.2bn charge against the value of Glencore's 9% stake in Rusal, the Hong Kong-listed listed aluminium producer. Then there was the $213m charge against a loan to Russneft, the Russian oil firm. So it goes on. These charges are not as easy to ignore as Glasenberg would wish: minority stakes and loans to third parties are part of the Glencore model. Then there's the balance sheet, which analysts at BMO Capital Markets call \"the biggest negative\" because net debt was $32.7bn at the year-end. To Glencore, though, the balance sheet is \"strong,\" and the real level of debt much lower since you have to take account of \"readily marketable inventories\". Will the takeover-cum-merger with Xstrata make life simpler? Possibly, as Glenstrata will be more heavily skewed towards mining. Yet the strategy and capital expenditure plans for the combined entity are a mystery; an update will follow only after completion. One assumes from Glasenberg's comments about the loss of \"capital discipline\" in the sector that he intends to curtail Xstrata's spending, but the quantities are unknown at this stage. What is clear, though, is that he'll be running a colossal company in terms of its spread of activities. Glenstrata will start life with about 50% more employees and contractors than BHP Billiton, the giant of the mining world. That is yet another large layer of complexity.",

      "bodyText": "Martha Stewart, the doyenne of American domestic life who once ended up in jail after lying about a stock trade, was back in court on Tuesday in a high-profile case that is as much about her public image as it is a seemingly arcane contract dispute. Stewart is defending her firm in a complex fight involving two of America's biggest and most famous department stores \u2013 Macy's and its rival JC Penney. The case revolves around the issue of whether Penney's 2011 deal with Stewart violates a pre-existing deal to sell many of Stewart's goods through Macy's. Macy's says they have exclusive rights to the products that are branded with Stewart's well-known name. Meanwhile Stewart's company insists that it is allowed to pursue other deals and the Macy's agreement covers only specific goods and brands. But, as with all things Stewart, the trial has become as much about the drama of her reputation and personality as much as the more obscure parts of American contract law. Some court testimony has portrayed Stewart as abandoning Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren \u2013 a close personal friend \u2013 so she could enrich her troubled company. During testimony last week, Lundgren described how he hung up the phone on Stewart after she told him about the Penney deal. Such allegations only reinforce Stewart's reputation as a ruthless businesswoman which is often at odds with the buying public perception of her as their favourite homemaker whose goods sell in their millions across the nation. Lundgren hasn't spoken to her since putting the phone down on her, and in court last week even appeared choked up at times. \"I was completely shocked and blown away,\" he testified. \"It was so far from anything I could imagine.\" Stewart was asked about the phone call and said in court that she was shocked at Lundgren's reaction. \"I was quite taken aback by his response. When he hung up on me I was kind of flabbergasted,\" she said. But, displaying her now infamously imperious temperament, Stewart engaged in various testy exchanges with Macy's lawyer Ted Grossman. Grossman asked her at the start if she was comfortable in the witness box, to which she replied with a withering: \"As comfortable as could be.\" Dressed in a beige outfit and cream blouse, Stewart also showed a perhaps unfortunate knack for not quite realizing how ordinary Americans live in a country still recovering tepidly from the Great Recession. When asked by Grossman if it was likely that a customer might buy one set of equipment, like a Stewart-branded casserole dish or set of knives and forks, in one store and then walk into a different store and buy them again, Stewart replied: \"They might have two houses! They might have two kitchens!\" The two repeatedly sparred over how Stewart interpreted her firm's obligations to Macy's and whether or not they clashed over a desire to do a major deal with Penney. Grossman pressed her on her commitment to Macy's and a timeline of when she started talking to Penney and working on designs for them. \"We thought, and I hope rightly so, we were absolutely allowed to do such a thing,\" Stewart said. Macy's has sued the media and merchandising company Stewart founded alleging she breached their contract when she signed a deal with Penney to open shops at most of its stores this spring. Macy's, which has sold Martha Stewart products including towels and pots since 2007, is trying to block Penney from selling those products. The case is a high-risk effort for almost everyone involved. For Stewart any legal disaster could easily hurt her brand and her image which has survived the earlier travails over allegations of insider trading that saw her go to jail. The latest legal trouble also comes at a time when her business is struggling to fatten merchandising revenue as it tries to offset declines in its broadcast and publishing divisions. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia is in its fifth straight year of losses. In 2012, the firm posted revenue of $197.6m, down nearly 11% from the previous year. Losses jumped to $56m from $15.5m the year before and its share price is down more than 90% from $36 in February 2005 \u2013 when Stewart was about to emerge from jail. Penney has its own troubles too. The giant retailer is in the middle of a turnaround plan that is struggling in the face of big losses and sales declines for four straight quarters. The deal with Stewart, which included a roll-out of mini-shops inside its stores, had been planning to use the Martha Stewart brand as a core part of its revival. Finally, Macy's is keen to protect an area of its own business that has been a success. Sales for the Martha Stewart brand at Macy's rose 8% last year, double the sales increase for the entire company. In a possible personal olive branch to Macy's Stewart told the court that she was a huge fan of the store. \"I love Macy's,\" she said. \"I have shopped at Macy's since I was a young child.\" But at the same time she heaped praise on Penney chief executive Ron Johnson. \"He is a visionary,\" she said. \"He had the foresight to re-imagine the American department store.\"",

When many of the major economic indicators provide only a wheezing malaise, the Dow high provides a little spot of irrational exuberance that is a welcome antidote.</p> <p>But don't trust the Dow. It doesn't have your best interests at heart. It lies to you. It's that narcissist who's always preening and trying to look powerful when in fact it barely deserves an invitation to the party.</p> <p>Most Americans know that the Dow is composed of a basket of 30 industrial stocks that are largely impervious to the struggles of ordinary Americans. If you separated these stocks, their rise would not be exciting. It's hard to picture a family driving back from the food bank \u2013 poverty is also at all-time highs in America, by the way \u2013 chanting \"three cheers for Alcoa!

Companies are sitting on $1.4tn of cash, according to the Federal Reserve. \"That number, a record high, equates to almost 9% of US GDP,\" wrote JP Morgan strategist Michael Hood in December. \"The cash stockpile has not risen enormously over the past year but it is roughly double the amount from 10 years earlier.\"</p> <p>Hood explains: it's not that companies are hoarding money; it's that they are making so much money there aren't enough places to spend it. American companies are in a golden age of profitability, even as the unemployment crisis continues and many ordinary Americans find it difficult to either save or borrow money. That hasn't changed for three years, and there's no reason to believe it will. </p> <p>There are other reasons not to get too excited about the Dow. The most important is that the Dow is not \"the market\", no matter what you may read. The Dow is composed of 30 stocks; they're not the biggest or most significant 30, so you won't see Google or Apple or Amazon there. They're also picked to give a sickly-sweet picture of health. The Dow stocks are not representative of both good and bad; when they start to stumble or go through big corporate changes, like Kraft, AIG and Citigroup did, <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/kraft-you%E2%80%99ve-been-voted-dow-island\">they get kicked out of the index</a>.</p> <p>The stock market is much larger than that, and a better measure of its health is the S&amp;P 500 Index. The S&amp;P 500 doesn't tell the same story as the Dow. It is struggling a bit more. It is like a tightly coiled spring, in the words of ConvergEx Group chief market strategist Nicholas Colas. </p> <p>Colas argues that the markets are \"sleepwalking\", aided by investors who have been \"lured into a quiescent state thus far in 2013\". He worried in a research note this week that the rally in the markets is based on a certain level of delusion, a wilful ignorance of potential shocks from the European crisis as well as the fact that corporate earnings aren't growing fast enough to justify the huge jumps in stock prices. The fiscal cliff, the Italian elections, and the sequester have all passed with barely more than a sigh from major stock market indices like the S&amp;P 500. That demonstrates that the \"market\" is not paying attention \u2013 and when it does, watch out. </p> <p>There's another reason to take the Dow's move upward with a grain of salt: what goes up, must come down. Historically, just when the Dow looks to have hit its most enthusiastic highs, a crash is around the corner. </p> <p>The last time the Dow hit a high, in 2007, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank were already collaborating on a global economic bailout, and Bear Stearns collapsed six months later. Before that, the high was in January 2000, only about three months before the market started a long, ugly downward slide in the wake of the tech boom. Go back further, in 1987, when the Dow hit a temporary high before the recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s hit. In 1966, the Dow hit 1,000 and by 1967 the economy began a long downward slide into the stagflation of the 1970s and the recession of the early 1980s. </p> <p>None of that, however, beats the Dow's high in September 1929, just weeks before the giant crash that ushered in the Great Depression. The Dow cannot defy gravity. The higher it rises, the harder it will fall. </p> <p>So when the Dow is high, you should smile \u2013 briefly. Then duck.</p>",

American companies are in a golden age of profitability, even as the unemployment crisis continues and many ordinary Americans find it difficult to either save or borrow money. That hasn't changed for three years, and there's no reason to believe it will. There are other reasons not to get too excited about the Dow. The most important is that the Dow is not \"the market\", no matter what you may read. The Dow is composed of 30 stocks; they're not the biggest or most significant 30, so you won't see Google or Apple or Amazon there. They're also picked to give a sickly-sweet picture of health. The Dow stocks are not representative of both good and bad; when they start to stumble or go through big corporate changes, like Kraft, AIG and Citigroup did, they get kicked out of the index. The stock market is much larger than that, and a better measure of its health is the S&amp;P 500 Index. The S&amp;P 500 doesn't tell the same story as the Dow. It is struggling a bit more. It is like a tightly coiled spring, in the words of ConvergEx Group chief market strategist Nicholas Colas. Colas argues that the markets are \"sleepwalking\", aided by investors who have been \"lured into a quiescent state thus far in 2013\". He worried in a research note this week that the rally in the markets is based on a certain level of delusion, a wilful ignorance of potential shocks from the European crisis as well as the fact that corporate earnings aren't growing fast enough to justify the huge jumps in stock prices. The fiscal cliff, the Italian elections, and the sequester have all passed with barely more than a sigh from major stock market indices like the S&amp;P 500. That demonstrates that the \"market\" is not paying attention \u2013 and when it does, watch out. There's another reason to take the Dow's move upward with a grain of salt: what goes up, must come down. Historically, just when the Dow looks to have hit its most enthusiastic highs, a crash is around the corner. The last time the Dow hit a high, in 2007, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank were already collaborating on a global economic bailout, and Bear Stearns collapsed six months later. Before that, the high was in January 2000, only about three months before the market started a long, ugly downward slide in the wake of the tech boom. Go back further, in 1987, when the Dow hit a temporary high before the recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s hit. In 1966, the Dow hit 1,000 and by 1967 the economy began a long downward slide into the stagflation of the 1970s and the recession of the early 1980s. None of that, however, beats the Dow's high in September 1929, just weeks before the giant crash that ushered in the Great Depression. The Dow cannot defy gravity. The higher it rises, the harder it will fall. So when the Dow is high, you should smile \u2013 briefly. Then duck.",

    "webTitle": "Ingvar Kamprad's Ikea philosophy is only as strong as the sum of its parts",

      "bodyText": "The Ikea story has many of the ingredients of an epic saga. Ingvar Kamprad founded Sweden's furniture giant in 1943, but now \u2013 aged 86 \u2013 it is time for him to hand over control to his three sons. That raises questions about Ikea's sustainability, and his legacy. At Helsingborg, the site of Ikea's Swedish headquarters, the sustainability manager, Jeanette Skjelmose, lavishes praise on Kamprad, underlining his intimate understanding of the firm. \"We see him here quite often,\" she says. But these days, his role in the company is mostly advisory. The communication manager, Ylva Magnusson, says: \"He is no longer at the wheel.\" She wants to make it clear that he is no longer indispensable to the smooth running of the business. In January, the firm reported profits of $4.1bn for 2012, up 8% in this post-Kamprad era. Kamprad has sometimes been Ikea's worst enemy, but he was also its essence. Behind the scenes, the management has to manage this paradox, using his image wisely, playing down his presence while retaining his flair. \"There is every reason to wonder what will happen when Kamprad is no longer there,\" says Susanne Sweet, a specialist in corporate social responsibility at the Stockholm School of Economics. \"The image that has been built up around him \u2013 hard-working, parsimonious and close to ordinary people \u2013 does not work for his sons, who grew up in a completely different world. Do those values count for them?\" A photograph from 1998 illustrates the difficult succession. It was taken at Kamprad's traditional Christmas talk to staff at the \u00c4lmhult store. It was the first time one of his sons had addressed the assembly. The picture shows the old man looking worried, staring at his eldest son, Peter, as he gives his talk. Peter looks scared stiff. Was he really going to take over running the company, with its workforce of 150,000? Would he and his brothers be up to it? Kamprad has done nothing to make it easy for them. The regional daily, Sm\u00e5landsposten, published the photograph in August 2002 under the headline \"Kamprad's three sons take over Ikea\", with a piece by Bosse Vikingson, who had been following the company's fortunes for the previous 15 years. At the time it looked as though the order of succession had finally been settled. The eldest son Peter, then 38, was to take over from his father, the article explained, heading the Netherlands-based Stichting Ingka Foundation that controls the flat-pack chain. The two younger brothers were also to play their part, Jonas focusing on design, Mathias on business development. But it was not that simple. None of the brothers enjoyed the omniscient powers invested in their father, who feared rivalry among the siblings. Every effort had been made to organise the empire so that it could not be broken up following a rift between the heirs. So what has happened since? Kamprad made one of his most recent public appearances last autumn, when the \u00c4lmhult store reopened after a refurbishment. Pictures show the old boss shaking hands and smiling, but firmly taken in hand by a swarm of minders. \"He's old now,\" Vikingson points out. \"Ikea's management is trying to make sure he doesn't do too much, even if they have no real control over him.\" Last Christmas Kamprad was back on stage. Peter has not addressed an audience since the 1998 gathering at \u00c4lmhult. The brothers' rare appearances are carefully stage-managed. There has only been one interview, for a book vetted by Kamprad. For the past three-and-a-half years, a Norwegian, Per Heggenes, has acted as the spokesman for Kamprad and sons. He explained that the brothers have given up any idea of operational responsibility in the Ikea organisation. Peter will not be taking over the reins. All three have made it clear they want to work as representatives of the shareholders in the various foundations. \"But they don't just attend board meetings,\" Heggenes adds. \"Their role is to ensure that the [Ikea] culture and philosophy are passed on to the next generation.\" By a happy coincidence, their personalities seem suited to the task of protecting the three pillars on which the firm rests. Jonas, who is creative and a designer by training, is interested in product development. Mathias, the most enterprising, wants to concentrate on the overall concept. Peter, the economist, has done most to develop Ikano, the bank set up by his father. \"They would rather stay in the background,\" Heggenes says. \"It gives them enough distance to supervise what is going on and uphold the core principles behind Ikea's success.\" Or as he said at another point, \"Everything has been done to secure eternal life for Ikea.\" This complicated set-up is meant to ensure Ikea survives the loss of its founder. Kamprad's spirit will surely continue to hang over the firm. \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde",

Do those values count for them?\"</p> <p>A photograph from 1998 illustrates the difficult succession. It was taken at Kamprad's traditional Christmas talk to staff at the \u00c4lmhult store. It was the first time one of his sons had addressed the assembly. The picture shows the old man looking worried, staring at his eldest son, Peter, as he gives his talk. Peter looks scared stiff. Was he really going to take over running the company, with its workforce of 150,000? Would he and his brothers be up to it? Kamprad has done nothing to make it easy for them.</p> <p>The regional daily, Sm\u00e5landsposten, published the photograph in August 2002 under the headline \"Kamprad's three sons take over Ikea\", with a piece by Bosse Vikingson, who had been following the company's fortunes for the previous 15 years. At the time it looked as though the order of succession had finally been settled. The eldest son Peter, then 38, was to take over from his father, the article explained, heading the Netherlands-based Stichting Ingka Foundation that controls the flat-pack chain. The two younger brothers were also to play their part, Jonas focusing on design, Mathias on business development.</p> <p>But it was not that simple. None of the brothers enjoyed the omniscient powers invested in their father, who feared rivalry among the siblings. Every effort had been made to organise the empire so that it could not be broken up following a rift between the heirs. So what has happened since? Kamprad made one of his most recent public appearances last autumn, when the \u00c4lmhult store reopened after a refurbishment. Pictures show the old boss shaking hands and smiling, but firmly taken in hand by a swarm of minders. \"He's old now,\" Vikingson points out. \"Ikea's management is trying to make sure he doesn't do too much, even if they have no real control over him.\"</p> <p>Last Christmas Kamprad was back on stage. Peter has not addressed an audience since the 1998 gathering at \u00c4lmhult. The brothers' rare appearances are carefully stage-managed. There has only been one interview, for a book vetted by Kamprad.</p> <p>For the past three-and-a-half years, a Norwegian, Per Heggenes, has acted as the spokesman for Kamprad and sons. He explained that the brothers have given up any idea of operational responsibility in the Ikea organisation. Peter will not be taking over the reins. All three have made it clear they want to work as representatives of the shareholders in the various foundations. \"But they don't just attend board meetings,\" Heggenes adds. \"Their role is to ensure that the [Ikea] culture and philosophy are passed on to the next generation.\"</p> <p>By a happy coincidence, their personalities seem suited to the task of protecting the three pillars on which the firm rests. Jonas, who is creative and a designer by training, is interested in product development. Mathias, the most enterprising, wants to concentrate on the overall concept. Peter, the economist, has done most to develop Ikano, the bank set up by his father.</p> <p>\"They would rather stay in the background,\" Heggenes says. \"It gives them enough distance to supervise what is going on and uphold the core principles behind Ikea's success.\" Or as he said at another point, \"Everything has been done to secure eternal life for Ikea.\"</p> <p>This complicated set-up is meant to ensure Ikea survives the loss of its founder. Kamprad's spirit will surely continue to hang over the firm.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's vast and crucial services sector picked up in February, raising hopes the economy could narrowly avoid dropping into a triple-dip recession. Meanwhile, the eurozone slid further into a downturn, dragged deeper by France, Spain and Italy. The UK's monthly healthcheck of the services sector \u2013 which accounts for three-quarters of Britain's economic output \u2013 showed the fastest rise in business activity in five months. That could bring Britain back from the brink of its third recession since the financial crisis. The UK economy shrank by 0.3% in the final three months of 2012; if output falls again in the first three months of 2013, it would officially drop into an unprecedented triple-dip. Downbeat reports from manufacturing and construction made that outcome look increasingly likely, but the dominant services sector could lift Britain's economic fortunes. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the surveys so far pointed to a 0.1% increase in GDP in the first quarter. \"Growth could turn out stronger than this as there is good reason to believe that at least some of the weakness in manufacturing and construction was due to business being disrupted by bad weather, meaning a brighter picture may emerge in March.\" But other economists are far from convinced. Capital Economics said the figures suggest it is \"touch and go whether the overall economy will manage to grow at all this quarter\". It believes a triple-dip recession is \"certainly still very possible\". The closely watched purchasing managers' index (PMI) for services jumped to 51.8 from 51.5 in January, beating expectations of a reading of 51. A figure above 50 suggests the sector is expanding. Confidence among companies in the sector \u2013 which spans everything from transport to IT to hotels \u2013 rose to its highest level since last May and contributed to a pickup in employment. The data eases pressure on the Bank of England, which meets on Thursday to discuss interest rates and the possibility of expanding its quantitative easing (QE) programme. Economists say the decision is on a knife-edge, after three members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted in favour of injecting more money into the economy at the February meeting, including bank governor Sir Mervyn King. Capital Economics said: \"The rise in the services activity probably tips the balance towards the MPC doing nothing \u2013 especially following the solid high street spending figures released by the British Retail Consortium.\" But it added that, unless the economic data show a marked improvement, \"we will probably see a resumption of QE before long\". Business activity in the eurozone continued to decline. Markit's eurozone composite PMI \u2013 which gauges activity at thousands of companies across the currency bloc \u2013 dropped to 47.9 in February, from 48.6 in January. The survey demonstrated the widening chasm between the region's largest economy, Germany, where output continues to grow, and France, where activity is contracting at its fastest rate in four years. Chris Williamson of Markit said: \"Worryingly, the divergence between Germany and France so far this year is the widest in the survey's 15-year history.\" The PMI for Germany came in at 53.3, while the reading for France was 43.1 in February. Williamson said the currency bloc was now reliant on just one economy. \"The outlook seems to largely depend on whether Germany can continue to expand and offset the weakness in France, Italy and Spain \u2013 which seems a tall order \u2013 meaning hopes of a return to growth for the region by mid-2013 are now looking too optimistic.\" The figures suggest the eurozone economy will shrink by 0.2% in the first quarter, an improvement on the 0.6% contraction seen in the three months to December.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labour proposes a fresh crackdown on boardroom pay in a report released on Tuesday, which comes as the chancellor faces defeat in his efforts to head off a European cap on bankers' bonuses. The review of short-termism in UK industry calls for checks to stop executive pay being based on short-term profits and tax incentives to encourage long-term investment. The report, prepared by Sir George Cox for Labour, represents the first serious official thinking from the party on how to address City short-termism. It also marks a new emphasis on industrial policy. It comes as George Osborne goes to Brussels on Tuesday in what looks like a forlorn attempt to prevent the European Union from imposing severe curbs on bankers' bonuses in the City. In a highly unusual defeat for the British financial services sector, illustrating the UK's deepening isolation in Europe and the reluctance of EU partners to do Britain any more favours, finance ministers of the other 26 are expected to endorse legislation to slash \"fat cat\" bonuses. The was made last week at hard-fought negotiations between the European parliament and officials from the 27 member states. Despite David Cameron's opposition and Osborne's pledges to contest the deal, it appears irreversible. The UK is unable to wield a veto as Tuesday's decision can go to a qualified majority vote if necessary. Britain has been unable to muster enough allies to block the proposal. Its likeliest supporters, Sweden, the Netherlands and, most crucially, Germany have all come out in favour of capping bonuses. Last week's agreement, brokered by the Irish government, caps bonuses at a year's salary, although this can be doubled if a \"super-majority\" of a bank's shareholders so decide. On Sunday, the Swiss voted by a sweeping majority in a referendum for even tighter controls on bank pay, envisaging jail terms for those who break the new rules. \"The Swiss are showing us the way,\" said the French prime minister, Jean Marc Ayrault. On Monday the Italian business newspaper, Il Sole 24 Ore, called for a new international system regulating bankers' pay. The Cox report suggests that the company governance code be altered so at least 30% of executive director remuneration be paid in the form of shares that cannot be cashed in for five years or until after the director has completed his or her period on the board. It proposes a ban on voting rights for any shareholders who appear on the register during a takeover bid and says measures are needed to remove the tax treatment bias that favours companies funding loans through debt as opposed to equity. In an effort to encourage so-called \"patient capital\" the report suggests capital gains tax on shares could be tapered in a series of yearly steps from 50% in year one to 10% after year 10. The report suggests the measure would be revenue neutral. The business secretary Vince Cable commissioned a lengthy report on the same policy territory from Professor John Kay. He proposed a range of reforms including an end to quarterly reporting by companies, an idea endorsed in the Cox review. The report also proposes that all major infrastructure investment, such as High Speed 2 and airport capacity, could be taken out of party politics so that responsibility is handed to an independent agency that is accountable to parliament but independent of MPs. The report claims \"successful executives are those who can respond and deliver fast results and incentive schemes are devised to ensure that this practice is embedded in the way the company behaves It thus becomes the fabric of the organisation and a difficult thing to change\". It suggests:\"If more long-term participants are to be attracted to the equities market and more institutional shareholders are to be encouraged to take a long term view, then there has to be an incentive to do so. \"Beneficial tax treatment would appear to be the best route but it needs to be a powerful incentive if significant change is to be brought about.\" It adds: \"Research and development remains too small in the UK companies, and it is a cause for concern that the UK's technological edge has not produced firms to exploit that technology such as eBay, Amazon, Facebook or PayPal.\" It points out graphene was discovered in UK universities yet UK businesses have developed 54 related patents while the Chinese have filed 2,024 patents. Matthew Fell, director for competitive markets at the business body CBI, said: \"There is a need to encourage a more long-term focus from investors and the report's recognition that industrial strategy should be a cornerstone of government policy is welcome.\" The Institute of Directors released details of its own survey of members which found 92% of business leaders thought that short-termism was a significant impediment to the growth and development of the UK economy. Simon Walker, Director General of the IoD, said: \"Many UK companies feel exposed to short-term pressures which can inhibit their ability to plan and invest for the longer term. \"The economic downturn has made things worse, forcing many firms to focus on their very survival rather than longer term investment.\"",
