      "bodyText": "The Surrey commuter town of Esher, home to Sandown Park racecourse, has been identified as the most expensive place to rent a two-bedroom home in the UK outside London, with tenants paying an average of almost \u00a32,000 a month. Advertised monthly rents in the upmarket town have increased by 4.1% over the past year, to an average of \u00a31,913, according to a survey by property website Rightmove. After Esher the next most expensive town for tenants is Oxford, where the average monthly rent being advertised by landlords on the website is now \u00a31,612 \u2013 11.7% higher than this time last year. The university town has long had high rents, supported by strong demand from students and young professionals. The private rental sector has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by a fall in social housing and affordability barriers for people aspiring to own their own homes. About 4.8m households are now private renters. In the runup to the election, housing has been a key theme for politicians, and Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party have all vowed to limit rent rises if they get into power. Rightmove\u2019s list is dominated by towns in south-east England, many within an easy commute of the capital. Weybridge, Marlow, Ascot, Windsor and Henley-on-Thames all feature among the 10 most expensive locations to rent a home. In the 20th most expensive, Cambridge, an average two-bed home costs \u00a31,182 a month. In Greater London, however, the average rent for a two-bedder is now \u00a32,216. London prices are up 6% over the past year. Separate figures published by flatsharing website SpareRoom.co.uk on Thursday showed a similar ripple effect out from the capital. It said demand for rooms in satellite towns had soared, and this had pushed up rents. In Harlow in Essex, it said nine tenants were competing for each room advertised, and the cost to them had increased by just under 12% annually. Across the country, demand for rental property is at a record high, said Rightmove, with the number of inquiries from prospective tenants to letting agents sent via the site up by 73% over the past year. The website\u2019s head of lettings, Sam Mitchell, said the rental market \u201chas always been fast-paced but over the past year we\u2019ve seen demand increase to record levels\u201d. \u201cPeople moving out of the capital to places in the south-east has contributed to double-digit growth in rents in some of the most expensive places like Oxford and Henley-on-Thames,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cThese figures show it\u2019s wrong to think that anywhere outside of London will definitely be cheaper.\u201d Rising house prices and tougher credit conditions have led to many who would previously have bought homes remaining in the rented sector for longer. Although first-time buyer activity picked up in 2014, figures from estate agents Your Move and Reeds Rains suggest a sharp fall in the number of new entrants to the market so far this year. Research based on sales through its branches combined with the latest Council of Mortgage Lenders data, showed there were 60,900 first-time buyer transactions in the first quarter of 2015, markedly below the 79,900 in the last three months of 2014 and the lowest quarterly total for two years. The fall comes despite falling mortgage rates and signs of improvement in household finances. The agents\u2019 director, Adrian Gill, said: \u201cWages are now beating inflation, and that\u2019s boosting household finances in a way not seen for half a decade. On the ground, there is a little more optimism in the air. But property prices are still rising faster.\u201d The latest figures from the Land Registry showed that across England and Wales house prices fell by 0.8% in March, following several months of slowing activity. However, Matthew Pointon, from Capital Economics, said that despite \u201ca not insignificant fall\u201d during the month, prices were still higher in the first three months of the year than in the previous quarter. \u201cOverall, therefore, the Land Registry figures are broadly in line with other measures of house prices showing a steady rise since the start of the year,\u201d he said. The latest data put the average price of a property at \u00a3178,007, 5.3% higher than in March 2014. The annual rate of price increases remained in double figures in the south-east and London, but were more muted in other regions, and in the north-east prices were down by 2.9% year-on-year. In a sign of how divided the housing market has become, while the average price of a property in London hit its highest-ever level of \u00a3462,799, in the north-east homes changed hands for an average of \u00a397,444, well below their pre-crisis peak.",

      "bodyText": "The French-based aviation giant Airbus has challenged the German government over allegations that Berlin\u2019s foreign intelligence agency engaged in industrial espionage against the company on behalf of the Americans. The Airbus threat of legal action on Thursday came amid reports that Germany has been spying and eavesdropping on its closest partners in the European Union and passing the information to the Americans for more than a decade. A closed parliamentary inquiry in Berlin has heard evidence of how the BND, Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, used its biggest eavesdropping complex in Bavaria to monitor communications at the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the office of the French president, the French foreign ministry, and the European Commission in Brussels and then passed on the information to the Americans, according to German media reports. The disclosures triggered allegations of lying and cover-ups reaching to the very top of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s administration. The snooping was also said to extend to big defence and aviation companies in Europe, including Airbus, but none of them were German or American under the terms of the alleged spy pact between the BND and the American National Security Agency (NSA) going back to 2002. \u201cThere is a concrete suspicion of industrial espionage,\u201d Airbus said in a statement. \u201cWe are alarmed \u2026 We have asked the German government for information.\u201d It added: \u201cWe will now file a criminal complaint against persons unknown on suspicion of industrial espionage.\u201d Amid persistent frictions between the US and German governments because of the Edward Snowden revelations two years ago of US and British surveillance activities in Europe, the fresh disclosures are embarrassing for Berlin which stands accused of hypocrisy in its protests about America spying on its allies. \u201cSpying on friends is not on at all,\u201d Merkel responded when it became known her mobile was being monitored by the NSA. Since then, both sides have been embroiled in arguments about data privacy, with much talk among officials and diplomats of a collapse of German trust in the Americans. But under a 2002 pact between the BND and the NSA, Berlin used its largest electronic eavesdropping facility at Bad Aibling in Bavaria to monitor email and telephone traffic at the Elys\u00e9e Palace and of key EU institutions in Brussels including the European Commission, according to the reports. Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, the interior minister and a Merkel confidant, is in the firing line for allegedly lying about or covering up the German collaboration with the Americans. The minister has denied the allegations robustly and promised to answer before the parliamentary inquiry \u201cthe sooner, the better\u201d. The best-selling tabloid Bild-Zeitung depicted de Maizi\u00e8re as Pinocchio this week and accused him of \u201clying with impunity.\u201d From 2005-9, he served as Merkel\u2019s chief of staff, the post in Berlin that exercises authority over the BND. He is said to have been told of the spying activities in 2008. The German media are asserting that if de Maizi\u00e8re knew what was going on, he has covered it up, and that if he did not know, he was failing in his job while the BND ranged out of political control. According to the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and the public broadcasters WDR and NDR, citing information from the closed parliamentary inquiry, the BND\u2019s biggest listening post at Bad Aibling in Bavaria \u201cwas abused for years for NSA spying on European states\u201d. \u201cThe core is the political spying of our European neighbours and EU institutions,\u201d an unnamed source said to be familiar with the evidence told the S\u00fcddeutsche. The Bad Aibling complex of listening posts was an NSA facility for years. Under an agreement in 2002 it was handed over to the Germans in 2004 since when much of the information gleaned was routinely passed to the Americans. The Americans supplied search terms on a weekly basis to the Germans, according to the Munich newspaper \u2013 690,000 phone numbers and 7.8m IP addresses up until 2013.",

It was only made easy to use more than 20 years later, when Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web \u2013 not taking any profit for himself \u2013 which could have made him immensely rich.

      "bodyText": "I read the apology for the Tories from Brent Hoberman et al (Letters, 30 April) with disbelief. At the heart of their paean to Tory policy on business startups, they write: \u201cKey have been [coalition] schemes to boost investment in startups \u2026 which have created the best environment for venture capital in Europe.\u201d They insist that to change course would be \u201cbad for jobs, bad for growth, and bad for innovation\u201d. Why my scepticism? I turn back to the previous day\u2019s letter from Alex Orr (29 April), who reminds us: \u201cWhen it comes to total private- and public-sector investment, the UK\u2019s record is appalling, coming in 32nd position out of the 35 most advanced economies in the world.\u201d So what\u2019s wrong with our entrepreneurs? Dim? Disingenuous? Naive? Ignorant of international practice and standards, and heading for a fall if Tory austerity and recession are allowed to bite again? Nigel Blake Byfleet, Surrey \u2022 The entrepreneurs supporting the Tories seem to forget that the internet was an entirely government-sponsored initiative (born 30 October 1969) that private enterprise would never have come up with free for use. It was only made easy to use more than 20 years later, when Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web \u2013 not taking any profit for himself \u2013 which could have made him immensely rich. Some similar public spirit by these entrepreneurs would not go amiss.

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s economy is growing at its fastest pace since before the global economic crisis in 2007, official figures showed on Thursday, boosting hopes that the eurozone is bouncing back, despite the ongoing turmoil in Greece. Spain, which received a \u20ac100bn (\u00a373bn) bailout for its teetering banking sector in 2012, recorded a 0.9% increase in GDP in the first quarter of this year. The news underscored the growing divide between the fortunes of Greece and the other bailed-out eurozone countries, as Athens battles to meet its next repayment to the International Monetary Fund, due next week. Spain\u2019s strong performance led analysts to suggest that the eurozone \u2013 where a \u20ac60bn-a-month quantitative easing programme was launched in March \u2013 could be set to outpace its rivals in 2015 as growth slows in the US and the UK. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg bank, predicted that when the full data for member countries emerged over the next fortnight it was likely to show that the eurozone economy expanded by 0.4% in the first quarter, against 0.2% in the US and 0.3% in the UK. He said Spain\u2019s recovery \u201cshows that reforms work, it should help reduce unemployment much further and thus political fragility and it serves as a shining example to Greeks of what their country could have if its government finally returns to the path of virtue\u201d. The Spanish unemployment rate remains very high, though, at 23%. Geoffrey Minne, economist at ING, said short-term factors, particularly falling oil prices, which have cut costs for consumers, and the weaker euro, which has helped exports, have also underpinned Spain\u2019s success. \u201cThe expansion of the economic activity has been driven by important structural reforms and strengthened by short-run factors,\u201d he said. Spain\u2019s healthy growth rate heightened the contrast with Greece, where the Syriza-led government is still battling to draw up a reform agreement that will satisfy its creditors. There were reports on Thursday that Greece was struggling to meet payments to 2m pensioners. The government insisted that any problems were due to a technical glitch, but the spectacle of a queue of pensioners waiting outside the National Bank of Greece in Athens added to fears that the government may be caught in a cash crisis. Negotiations on unlocking bailout funds have resumed with the IMF and the European Union, after prime minister Alexis Tsipras reshuffled his team for the talks, sidelining controversial finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers, issued a stern rebuke to Tsipras and his media-savvy colleagues: \u201cI wish that less time would be given to interviews and more on extraordinarily conscientiously working on keeping Greece from the threatening abyss\u201d. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s claimed that the odds were shortening on Greece leaving the eurozone as the talks went on. Moody\u2019s analyst Alastair Wilson said investors should not be complacent about the knock-on effects if Greece left the single currency area. \u201cThe direct impact might be limited because of Greece\u2019s limited trade links and lower financial market exposure to Greece in other euro area countries. But its exit could nevertheless cause a confidence shock and disrupt government debt markets.\u201d While Greece\u2019s travails are continuing, the rest of the eurozone appears to be stepping back from the brink of a deflationary slump. Official inflation figures, published on Thursday, showed that prices were flat across the eurozone in April, after falling in March. Boosting inflation was one of the key motivations for launching QE. However, City analysts warned that the eurozone was not yet out of the woods. Timo del Carpio, of RBC Capital Markets, said: \u201cThere are still real risks associated with a prolonged period of low-but-positive inflation rates across the euro area, not least as it complicates the post-crisis adjustment process.\u201d Spain\u2019s impressive recovery may help to strengthen the hand of its government, led by prime minister Mariano Rajoy, in arguing that the country should stick to the path of spending cuts and economic reforms, instead of a Greek-style rejection of austerity. Rajoy, who must hold a general election by the end of the year, faces a tough challenge from the anti-austerity party, Podemos. He recently raised his government\u2019s economic growth forecast for 2015 from 2.4% to 2.9%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland warned it faced a tough 2015 as it plunged to a loss in the first three months of the year, weighed down by \u00a3856m of misconduct and litigation charges. The 79%-taxpayer-owned bank prepared the way for further penalties for foreign exchange rigging \u2013 including possible criminal charges \u2013 by setting aside a further \u00a3334m for manipulation of the \u00a33.5tn-a-day global currency markets. The cost comes on top of the translatlantic settlement with major banks in November when a record \u00a32.6bn of fines were levied on major players in the market, including \u00a3400m on RBS. The Edinburgh-based bank is still in discussions with governments and regulatory authorities about its forex dealings. \u201cThese include advanced settlement discussions regarding the criminal investigation being conducted by the [US department of justice] and with certain other financial regulatory authorities and RBS expects that it will incur financial penalties in conjunction with any such settlements,\u201d the bank said. The additional costs show that the foreign exchange scandal remains far from resolved; Barclays has set aside \u00a32bn for potential penalties and RBS admitted it was yet to make any provision for the cost of an investigation by the EU. Other elements of RBS\u2019s \u00a3856m of conduct charges included a \u00a3100m top-up to ongoing compensation for payment protection insurance mis-selling. Around \u00a3257m is for other mis-selling, including of packaged bank accounts. In total it has \u00a35.4bn set aside to cover the cost of past errors and misdeeds, including \u00a32bn for a long-standing case in the US over the way it sold mortgage bonds before the crisis. That case could be settled this year. The \u00a3856m latest cost of these scandals along with restructuring costs of \u00a3453m drove the bank to a \u00a3446m loss, compared with a \u00a31.2bn profit the same time a year ago. The shares fell 3% to 335p, below the 502p at which the taxpayer breaks even on its stake, as analysts questioned the growth in the business. The new costs represent a blow to RBS boss Ross McEwan, who has embarked on a radical overhaul of the bank since taking the helm in October 2013. He has warned of substantial job cuts and said he would not tolerate new errors. He warned more conduct-related issues would hit the bank later this year, adding that RBS faced \u201canother tough year\u201d. \u201cThere are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to the day we can focus on the future rather than on legacy issues.\u201d But, he said, once these issues were resolved it would be easier for the next government to start selling down its stake. In February he declared \u201cthe end of a standalone investment bank at RBS\u201d as he announced plans to restrict operations to 13 countries \u2013 compared with 38 at the end of last year and 51 in 2009 \u2013 just after it was bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds. The restructuring cost is in part due the overhaul of this once-dominant investment bank and includes a \u00a3227m write down of the value of its 11-storey building in Stanford, Connecticut \u2013 which before the bailout RBS boasted it housed one of the biggest trading floors in the world. McEwan will not confirm the scale of the job losses in the investment banking arm but speculation is rife that as many as 14,000 roles \u2013 four out of five \u2013 could be lost. The bank said it was no longer subject to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US authorities put in place at the time of its \u00a3390m Libor-rigging fine in February 2013. The bank has not made a full-year profit since its bailout in 2008. Last year was RBS\u2019s seventh consecutive year in the red, taking total losses to more than \u00a343bn since the taxpayer rescue. It is expected to make a loss in 2015. McEwan attempted to focus on a 16% rise in adjusted operating profit to \u00a31.6bn and insisted his executive team was \u201cin very good heart\u201d despite the sudden departure of Rory Cullinan, just weeks after his promotion to oversee the investment bank\u2019s overhaul, and John Maltby, who ran the Williams &amp; Glyn branches being prepared for sale. But, McEwan said: \u201cI won\u2019t be pleased until we\u2019re making money on the bottom line\u201d.",

He has warned of substantial job cuts and said he would not tolerate new errors.</p> <p>He warned more conduct-related issues would hit the bank later this year, adding that RBS faced \u201canother tough year\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThere are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI look forward to the day we can focus on the future rather than on legacy issues.\u201d </p> <p>But, he said, once these issues were resolved it would be easier for the next government to start selling down its stake.</p> <p>In February he declared \u201cthe end of a standalone investment bank at RBS\u201d as he announced plans to restrict operations to 13 countries \u2013 compared with 38 at the end of last year and 51 in 2009 \u2013 just after it was bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds.</p> <p>The restructuring cost is in part due the overhaul of this once-dominant investment bank and includes a \u00a3227m write down of the value of its 11-storey building in Stanford, Connecticut \u2013 which before the bailout RBS boasted it housed one of the biggest trading floors in the world. McEwan will not confirm the scale of the job losses in the investment banking arm but speculation is rife that as many as 14,000 roles \u2013 four out of five \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/03/rbs-could-cut-14000-staff-us-asia-ross-mcewan\">could</a> be lost.</p> <p>The bank said it was no longer subject to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US authorities put in place at the time of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/06/rbs-fined-libor-rigging-scandal\">its \u00a3390m Libor-rigging fine in February 2013</a>.</p> <p>The bank has not made a full-year profit since its bailout in 2008. Last year was RBS\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/26/rbs-paid-out-421m-in-bonuses-in-2014-royal-bank-scotland\">seventh consecutive year in the red</a>, taking total losses to more than \u00a343bn since the taxpayer rescue. It is expected to make a loss in 2015.</p> <p>McEwan attempted to focus on a 16% rise in adjusted operating profit to \u00a31.6bn and insisted his executive team was \u201cin very good heart\u201d despite the sudden departure of Rory Cullinan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/30/rbs-banker-to-leave-rory-cullinan-investment-banking\">just weeks after his promotion to oversee the investment bank\u2019s overhaul</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/28/rbs-replaces-williams-glyn-chief-john-maltby-with-own-jim-brown\">John Maltby</a>, who ran the Williams &amp; Glyn branches being prepared for sale.</p> <p>But, McEwan said: \u201cI won\u2019t be pleased until we\u2019re making money on the bottom line\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A record \u00a31bn was pulled out of funds investing in UK shares in March as investors took a cautious approach to investing ahead of the general election on 7 May and switched their focus to continental Europe. The move by the European Central Bank to pump \u20ac60bn a month into the financial markets to stimulate economic growth has, however, encouraged UK investors to buy shares in major companies on stock markets across the eurozone. The \u00a3963m withdrawn from UK equity funds in March was the largest-ever outflow recorded by the Investment Association, which produces monthly statistics on flows in and out of the fund management industry. Analysing the data, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cPrivate investors are staging a buyer\u2019s strike in the lead up to the election. This is pretty par for the course when it comes to the uncertainty generated by such a big political event, and the FTSE reaching a record high won\u2019t have helped matters.\u201d The FTSE 100 of leading shares powered to an all-time high of 7,122 on Monday when it appeared that the uncertainty about Greece\u2019s long-term future was easing and despite jitters about the British general election. \u201cGiven the UK market has actually held up well this year, with the FTSE 100 scaling a record high, and the economy is in relatively good shape compared to many of its European peers, we suspect that the aversion to UK shares is to some degree a function of the considerable uncertainties around the UK general election which continue to point to a hung parliament,\u201d said Jason Hollands of Tilney Bestinvest said. Khalaf said investors should try to \u201ctune out the election clamour\u201d and focus on the fact many FTSE 100 companies generate their revenue from outside the UK. \u201cWhen you look back at events that shaped stock market returns in the last 15 years, you think of the dotcom crash, the financial crisis, and ultra-loose monetary policy. The elections of 2005 and 2010 come pretty far down the list,\u201d Khalaf said. Hollands agreed: \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that more than two thirds of the listed UK company revenues are derived overseas, so the UK stock market is a very tenuous proxy for the UK domestic economy\u201d. \u201cThe key factor for a capital markets perspective is monetary policy and in this respect, the setting of rates sits with the Bank of England not the politicians. Growth jitters and ultra low inflation mean the prospect of near term rate rises is very slim, so for now the monetary policy environment remains very accommodative, which should support equities,\u201d Hollands said. The Investment Association pointed to the trend among investors to move money into the eurozone after data showed record inflows of \u00a3663m by retail investors into European equity funds during the month. \u201cIt was a particularly notable month as we saw retail investors switching record amounts out of UK equity funds and into European equity funds, developing a trend seen over the previous couple of months,\u201d said Daniel Godfrey, its chief executive. Funds that track the stock market experienced record sales to retail investors of \u00a3938m even though sales of funds were down overall at \u00a31.1bn, compared with \u00a32.5bn a year earlier.",

      "bodyText": "Perhaps it was the warmer winter that spurred economic activity in the eurozone, or maybe confidence was boosted by a financial firewall being erected around Greece to protect against a messy default. In truth both have played a role. But more important than either is the relaxation of austerity by a Brussels elite that is keen for Portugal and Ireland, still both committed to paying back their enormous debts, to cope with political instability and recover quickly. Some analysts believe the latest batch of eurozone data adds up to a growth rate for the first quarter of 0.5%. It would mean the euro economy grew faster in the first three months of 2015 than the UK (0.3%), and the US (0.25%). Star of the show is Spain, which is going like a rocket. A growth rate of 0.9% in the first quarter puts it in the same rank as Ireland, which grew by almost 5% last year and is forecast to repeat the performance this year. Germany is edging ahead faster than was predicted only a few months ago, and many of the smaller states, from Hungary (3.6%) and Lithuania (2.9%) to the Czech Republic (2%) and Estonia (2.1%) pushed ahead at a decent pace during 2014. Growth in Ireland has brought with it a drop in the unemployment rate and given its coalition government the confidence to start offering tax cuts as a pre-election giveaway. Another boost came from inflation. After four months of falling prices it edged up to zero last month. Negative inflation seemed to sum up the quagmire that eurozone economies found themselves in \u2013 the fact that the currency zone appears to be climbing out of it shows that things are not so bad. That small rise in inflation comes despite the fall in oil prices continuing to keep living costs down. Energy prices in the eurozone fell by 5.8% in April - a slightly slower pace than the 6% decline recorded in March, said eurostat. All this good news comes even before the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac1.1tn programme of quantitative easing has started filtering through from the commercial banks to the real economy. The ECB said in response to the inflation figures that \u201clonger-term inflation expectations in the euro area have recovered. The decline observed over the previous two years has thus come to a halt.\u201d But a dark cloud still hangs over the eurozone: unemployment. Even in those countries that are expanding output it remains high. Spain\u2019s stellar growth has only succeeded in cutting the unemployment rate from 25.1% to 23% over the last year (March 2014 to March 2015). In Ireland it dropped from 12% to 9.8% over the same period. In Portugal it remains at 13.5% and in France and Italy has gone up to 10.6% and 13% respectively over the last year. Across the 28 nations in the EU, the unemployment rate stood at 9.8% in March. That was the same as February but down from 10.4% in March last year, marking a period of stagnation, not growth. There are also the longer term issues that are often ignored: the ageing of most European societies that are triggering cutbacks in investment, spiralling health costs and commitments from governments that they will provide generous retirement benefits \u2013 still largely un-costed. Ireland, without a change of government, faces another five years of austerity, as do most eurozone countries. Sadly, France and Italy cannot seem to raise their game to escape further Brussels-inspired public spending cuts, dragging heavily enough on growth to potentially keep it near zero for many more years. Across the Atlantic, the US economy is slowing and in the far east, China is cutting back on easy credit, with knock-on effects for its satellite trading partners. All this makes for a less than rosy outlook and puts the eurozone still at the back of growth league.",

After four months of falling prices it edged up to zero last month. Negative inflation seemed to sum up the quagmire that eurozone economies found themselves in \u2013 the fact that the currency zone appears to be climbing out of it shows that things are not so bad.</p> <p>That small rise in inflation comes despite the fall in oil prices continuing to keep living costs down.

The decline observed over the previous two years has thus come to a halt.\u201d</p> <p>But a dark cloud still hangs over the eurozone: unemployment. Even in those countries that are expanding output it remains high. Spain\u2019s stellar growth has only succeeded in cutting the unemployment rate from 25.1% to 23% over the last year (March 2014 to March 2015). In Ireland it dropped from 12% to 9.8% over the same period.</p> <p>In Portugal it remains at 13.5% and in France and Italy has gone up to 10.6% and 13% respectively over the last year. Across the 28 nations in the EU, the unemployment rate stood at 9.8% in March. That was the same as February but down from 10.4% in March last year, marking a period of stagnation, not growth.</p> <p>There are also the longer term issues that are often ignored: the ageing of most European societies that are triggering cutbacks in investment, spiralling health costs and commitments from governments that they will provide generous retirement benefits \u2013 still largely un-costed. </p> <p>Ireland, without a change of government, faces another five years of austerity, as do most eurozone countries. Sadly, France and Italy cannot seem to raise their game to escape further Brussels-inspired public spending cuts, dragging heavily enough on growth to potentially keep it near zero for many more years.</p> <p>Across the Atlantic, the US economy is slowing and in the far east, China is cutting back on easy credit, with knock-on effects for its satellite trading partners. All this makes for a less than rosy outlook and puts the eurozone still at the back of growth league.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just one more thing... Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) and Dutch finance minister, has said the eurozone is prepared for every eventuality regarding the Greek crisis. Asked in Amserdam whether there was a plan B for Greece, he said: The question is, is the Netherlands prepared, or is the eurozone prepared for eventualities. The answer to that is yes. He was also quoted by Reuters as saying the Greek government should spend less time on interviews, and more time on avoiding the abyss. Thank you for reading the blog today, and for commenting. Please join us again tomorrow morning. Another headache for Greece, as an apparent \u201ctechnical hitch\u201d delays pension payments. This report from the FT: The Greek government was struggling on Thursday to complete payments to more than 2m pensioners after claiming that a \u201ctechnical hitch\u201d delayed an earlier disbursement. Elderly Athenians waited at branches of the National Bank of Greece, the state-controlled lender handling the bulk of pension payments, which are staggered over several days. \u201cNormally I only withdraw half the money at the end of the month but today I\u2019m taking it all,\u201d said Sotiria Zlatini, a 75-year-old former civil servant. \u201cThere are so many rumours going round because of the government\u2019s problems and what happened two days ago.\u201d On Tuesday, the main state social security fund, IKA, delayed pension payments by almost eight hours. The heavily loss-making fund relies on a monthly subsidy from the budget to be able to cover its obligations. Before we close the blog for the day, here is a quick summary of the main news and events. The major news on the data front was eurozone inflation, which showed the region escaped deflation in April. The small but symbolically significant rise to 0% from -o.1% in March will be welcomed with relief by Mario Draghi and his colleagues at the ECB, coming a month after it began its \u20ac1.1 trillion QE programme Eurozone unemployment was unchanged in March at 11.3%, disappointing expectations of a fall to 11.2% Spain\u2019s recovery accelerated in the first quarter, with growth of 0.9% exceeding expectations and fuelling hopes that the eurozone as a whole grew by about 0.5% in the first three months of the year. That would be faster than both the UK and the US Moody\u2019s warned the risk of a Greek exit from the euro is rising, a day after it downgraded Greece plunging it deeper into junk territory Russia cut interest rates to 12.5% in 14% in a bid to boost the economy French consumer spending fell more than expected, by 0.6% Greece continued negotiations with its creditors in Brussels, but still no agreement on a package of reforms. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said he was confident a deal would be struck imminently US markets opened lower; European markets remain mixed. The FTSE 100 is down 0.2% at 6,928.7 Wall Street has opened lower, suggesting Wednesday\u2019s surprisingly weak growth figures are still weighing on investor minds. The strong US jobs numbers earlier today on the other hand have failed to lift market spirits so far. Dow Jones: -0.5% at 17,941.24 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,104.31 Nasdaq: -0.5% at 4,465.73 The US data appears to have boosted European stock markets somewhat, while the euro trimmed gains against the dollar. The dollar hit session highs against the yen and the dollar. Here\u2019s some good news on the US economy, after yesterday\u2019s GDP shocker: the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level since 2000. Jobless claims fell 34,000 to 262,000 for the week ended 25 April, the lowest reading since April 2000, the Labor Department said. The figures are seasonally adjusted. Yesterday\u2019s GDP figures were far worse than expected, showing a sharp slowdown in economic growth to an annualised rate of 0.2% in the first quarter. Time for a look at European stock markets: all the main indices are in positive territory, just about. The FTSE 100 index in London has edged up 0.1% (nearly 9 points) to 6995.07. The Dax in Frankfurt is up 0.5% at 11,491.05 while the CAC in Paris is up 3 points at 5042.44. The Ibex in Madrid is 0.26% ahead at 11,408.8 and the FTSE MiB in Milan gained 0.5% to 23,118.73. Yanis Varoufakis, the embattled Greek finance minister apparently sidelined in negotiations with the country\u2019s creditors, has been speaking to the Greek parliament. He insisted that the latest negotiations with its creditors on a reform package would end in agreement. The negotiation will be successfully concluded, the climate will calm down, and then we will be speaking of the post-June recovery. Varoufakis said the government would do everything possible to expose those who were making profit at the country\u2019s expense. According to Greek news service enikos, he also spoke about his recent assault in the Exarcheia neighbourhood of Athens, where he was dining with his wife on Tuesday. It reports: Greek Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, speaking in the parliament, briefly referred to his recent assault in Exarcheia neighbourhood. \u201cWe all try not to resort to \u2018easy solutions\u2019 when it comes to violence matters. It\u2019s imperative not to look for easy solutions. It is not a solution to fighting violence with violence, or by running away\u201d. And then he started his speech on financial matters by launching an attack on Greece\u2019s lenders that imposed austerity in Greece: \u201cThere is also another type of violence, a very \u2018civilized\u2019 violence, but at the same time brutal and destructive\u201d, he said . This morning\u2019s French consumer spending figures are not so gloomy once the fall in energy consumption is taken into account. Energy consumption has been a drag on GDP and consumer spending figures for the first quarter across much of Europe. Households have switched off their central heating following one of the mildest winters on record. It means there is a drop in income for energy suppliers, but not really a drop in general activity across the economy. France enjoyed the third mildest winter in 50 years and that led to a 3.2% drop in consumer spending on energy (though the word enjoyed is out of place if the implications for global warming are considered). There was a 1% rise in the consumption of durable goods. So the French consumer is feeling better than the headline figures would appear to indicate Russia has lowered its key interest rate to 12.5% from 14%, in a bid to boost the faltering economy amid signs that inflation has peaked. Economists had predicted a smaller cut to 13%. Moody\u2019s has issued another warning on Greece, a day after downgrading its credit rating and plunging it deeper into junk territory. Today it is warning the impact of a Greek exit from the euro should not be underestimated. The direct economic and financial impact of a Greek exit from the euro area would be small, but an exit would undermine the euro area\u2019s longer-term resilience somewhat and could yet trigger a more immediate confidence shock, disrupting government debt markets. Moody\u2019s expects Greece (Caa2, negative outlook) to reach an agreement with its creditors and avoid default. However, lack of progress so far means the probability of a default, and of exit, is rising. Default would not necessarily lead to Greece\u2019s exit from the euro area. The chain of events that could lead to exit is difficult to predict. Moody\u2019s would expect negotiations to continue for a period. However, should exit occur, it would set a significant precedent, undermining the resilience of a currency union that was designed to be irreversible. Greece leaving the euro area would offer an example that might be followed in future. That would inevitably influence the course of future reform and fiscal consolidation programmes. It would raise, even if only a little, the likelihood that they too could end in default and exit. Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation and unemployment data. Inflation increased to zero in April, ending a four-month run of deflation. The jobless rate was unchanged at 11.3% in March. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says we shouldn\u2019t get too excited about the end of eurozone deflation because price pressures are still very weak. The latest eurozone inflation and labour market data paint a mixed picture, with deflation ending - for now at least - but unemployment stuck at a very high level. The general picture remains one of very weak underlying price pressures in the eurozone, reflecting both the weakness of pipeline cost pressures and the spare capacity left in the economy. The latter was underlined by the March labour market figures showing the unemployment rate holding at 11.3% for the third successive month. It is of some relief that the bout of technical deflation has been shorter-lived than we had feared. But it could return if oil and commodity prices fall again and even continued low inflation will hinder the indebted countries\u2019 fiscal consolidation efforts. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg: After four months with negative inflation rates, the eurozone officially exited deflation in April. However, this is not yet a sign of fading domestic disinflationary pressures, as the painfully slow decline in unemployment evidenced in today\u2019s unemployment data for March reminds us. Eurozone inflation will move up further towards the end of the year and then gradually beyond. But to get back to the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it is still a long way to go. Unemployment continued to fall for a fourth successive month in the eurozone, but declines remain modest and uneven. Overall unemployment dropped by 36k in March, but, at that pace, it would take 14 years to return to pre-crisis levels. Reform countries Spain, Portugal and Ireland remained best in class in March, with unemployment rates declining by 0.1 percentage points each. Teunis Brosens, economist at ING. Headline deflation is over. The drag of energy prices on headline inflation should gradually diminish further in the course of this year and our baseline scenario is for headline inflation to slowly rise, surpassing 1% by the end of the year. Taken together with an improving macro outlook, a pickup in bank lending and absent a deepening of the Greek crisis, ECB-president Draghi could face increasing questions about the continued need for quantitative easing in the second half of the year. But the ECB, bruised by tightening decisions in both 2008 and 2011 that it had to reverse only months later, will want to err on the side of caution when considering tapering. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight: Highly welcome news for the ECB as the Eurozone exited deflation in April as consumer prices were flat year-on-year. Adding to the good news Eurozone unemployment dropped 36,000 in March which was a fourth successive decline. However, it was the smallest decline since November, largely due to Italian unemployment rising by a disappointing 52,000. Nevertheless, the number of Eurozone unemployed has fallen by 418,000 since November 2014. Meanwhile, it looks like Eurozone GDP growth may well have picked up to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2015 from 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The jobless rate in the eurozone was unchanged in March at 11.3% according to official Eurostat figures. It disappointed expectations of a fall to 11.2%. Greece has the highest jobless rate at 25.7% (in January), followed by Spain at 23%. Germany has the lowest rate at 4.7% according to the Eurostat definition. There were 18.1m people out of work in the whole region last month, down 36,000. Eurozone inflation picked up in April to 0%, from -0.1% in March. It brings to an end a four-month run of deflation. The biggest driver behind the increase was a rise in food, alcohol, and tobacco inflation according to the flash estimate from Eurostat. Greek shares are down this morning, with the banks the main losers. The ATG index in Athens is down 1% at 790. Confidence about a deal between Greece and its creditors over a set of crucial reforms is faltering as time ticks on. A majority of investors, traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg now believe Greece is heading for the eurozone exit doors. Fifty-two percent of respondents in the Bloomberg Markets Global Poll believe Greece will leave the single currency bloc at some point, while 43% believe the country will remain in the eurozone for the foreseeable future. Back in January, just 31% predicted a Greek exit and 61% were convinced the country would remain. The number of people out of work in Germany dropped by 8,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis in April, to 2.792m. A bigger fall of about 15,000 had been expected. It left the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.4%, as expected. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, said despite the smaller than expected fall in unemployment, the jobs market in Germany was unchanged. Despite some unsolved structural issues (think of female labour market participation, demographic change or the low-wage sector) and still some room for improvement, the extremely solid labour market remains the showcase model of the German recovery. Christian Schulz, economist at German bank Berenberg, says stronger-than-expected Spanish growth in the first quarter is positive on many levels, with lessons to be learned by Greece. It shows that reforms work, it should help reduce unemployment much further and thus political fragility and it serves as a shining example to Greeks of what their country could have if its government finally returns to the path of virtue. Sustained performances like this, in particular when core countries like Austria and Belgium underperform, show that the periphery can grow faster than the core of the eurozone. Economic strength in the Eurozone can converge again, which raises the attractiveness of euro membership to potential new members. Spain\u2019s performance has boosted hopes that growth in the eurozone overall picked up in the first quarter, beating 0.3% growth in the fourth quarter. The first official estimate will be published by Eurostat on 13 May. It would mean the eurozone economy grew faster in the first three months of the year than the UK and the US... Spain\u2019s recovery gained momentum in the first quarter of 2015, with growth of 0.9% following 0.7% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. It beat expectations, with economists polled by Reuters forecasting growth of 0.8%. It was the fastest rate of growth since the end of 2007, boosted by a recovery in household spending. It looks like negative inflation in the country (-0.7% in April) has helped to boost household budgets. Europe\u2019s major indices are down this morning following Wall Street losses on Wednesday. FTSE 100: -0.1% at 6,941.1 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 11,425.39 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 5,016.06 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 22,871.09 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 11,325 Consumers were less willing to part with their money in March according to figures from INSEE, the national statistics office. Consumer spending dropped 0.6% over the month, following a 0.2% rise in February. Economists had forecast a smaller fall of 0.3%. The main driver of the fall was a 3.2% drop in spending on energy. However, household spending on durable goods was up 1%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Following\u2019s yesterday\u2019s shockingly weak US growth numbers (read our full story here), the key data out this morning is the flash estimate of eurozone inflation at 10am. Markets are expecting the figures to show a pick-up in annual inflation in April to 0% from -0.1%. A move out of negative territory will be symbolically significant for the region, coming only a month or so after the European Central Bank started its \u20ac1 trillion quantitative easing programme. Also at 10am we will be getting eurozone unemployment data for March. The jobless rate is expected to fall to 11.2% from 11.3%. European markets meanwhile will be absorbing the poor US GDP figures, as well as the latest Fed minutes out last night. And last but not least, Greece\u2019s new-look negotiating team will press on with negotiations in Brussels. The bid continues to agree a set of reforms with Greece\u2019s creditors in order to unlock urgently needed funds. More on that soon. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

But it could return if oil and commodity prices fall again and even continued low inflation will hinder the indebted countries\u2019 fiscal consolidation efforts.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Christian Schulz</strong>, senior economist at <strong>Berenberg</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> After four months with negative inflation rates, the eurozone officially exited deflation in April. However, this is not yet a sign of fading domestic disinflationary pressures, as the painfully slow decline in unemployment evidenced in today\u2019s unemployment data for March reminds us.<br></p> <p>Eurozone inflation will move up further towards the end of the year and then gradually beyond. But to get back to the ECB\u2019s 2% target, it is still a long way to go.</p> <p>Unemployment continued to fall for a fourth successive month<strong> </strong>in the eurozone, but declines remain modest and uneven. Overall unemployment dropped by 36k in March, but, at that pace, it would take 14 years to return to pre-crisis levels. Reform countries Spain, Portugal and Ireland remained best in class in March, with unemployment rates declining by 0.1 percentage points each.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Teunis Brosens</strong>, economist at <strong>ING</strong>.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Headline deflation is over. The drag of energy prices on headline inflation should gradually diminish further in the course of this year and our baseline scenario is for headline inflation to slowly rise, surpassing 1% by the end of the year. </p> <p>Taken together with an improving macro outlook, a pickup in bank lending and absent a deepening of the Greek crisis, ECB-president Draghi could face increasing questions about the continued need for quantitative easing in the second half of the year. </p> <p>But the ECB, bruised by tightening decisions in both 2008 and 2011 that it had to reverse only months later, will want to err on the side of caution when considering tapering. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong>, chief European and UK economist at <strong>IHS Global Insight</strong>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Highly welcome news for the ECB as the Eurozone exited deflation in April as consumer prices were flat year-on-year. </p> <p>Adding to the good news Eurozone unemployment dropped 36,000 in March which was a fourth successive decline.

USwitch\u2019s institutional backers LDC \u2013 the private equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group which held a majority stake of 57% \u2013 and Forward Private Equity, have sold their holdings. The firm\u2019s management, led by CEO Steve Weller, has also sold its combined 10% stake, worth \u00a316m. LDC, which backed a management buyout of uSwitch in August 2013, is making 2.4 times its original investment of \u00a335-40m. Shares in Zoopla jumped 14% to 210p on news of the deal but remained below the flotation price of 220p. When the company made its stock market debut in June it had a market value of nearly \u00a31bn.

Zoopla, which gets 44m visits a month, said bringing together the brands was a \u201cnatural next step\u201d that would create a single portal where consumers could find and manage their home. Its founder and chief executive, Alex Chesterman, hailed the deal as \u201ctransformational\u201d. USwitch helps consumers find the best deals for energy and broadband and generated about 50.3m online visits last year. It had revenues of \u00a363m and adjusted profits of \u00a316m in 2014. The site was founded in 2000 by Lord Milford Haven, a cousin of the Queen, to take advantage of the deregulated gas and electricity markets, which allowed consumers to switch suppliers. Zoopla, launched in 2008 when house prices were falling as the financial crisis took hold, and its bigger rival Rightmove have become the two most popular property websites over the past decade, tapping into the UK\u2019s property obsession. However, the pair face growing competition from a recently launched website, OnTheMarket.com, which is backed by more than 5,000 estate agents, including Savills and Knight Frank. It looks like Zoopla is losing out most \u2013 OnTheMarket said recently that 90% of agents using its site had dumped Zoopla rather than Rightmove. Zoopla said on Thursday it had lost 950 agents to OnTheMarket since the latter\u2019s launch in January, out of a total 3,800 agent losses which took the overall number of agent members to 12,449, but added that the rate of losses was slowing. Zoopla\u2019s trading statement also showed traffic was up by 11% to 265.5m in the six months to 31 March. Mobile visits rose 34% and account for nearly two-thirds of monthly visits. USwitch was among the price comparison sites criticised by MPs in February for \u201cduping\u201d customers into deals that are not the cheapest on the market. Weller told the energy and climate change committee that he was \u201csincerely disappointed\u201d that a customer was mistakenly told that the cheapest deal was with First Utility. It was not the first time the firm was accused of misleading customers, along with other sites. Numis analyst Gareth Davies described Zoopla\u2019s purchase of uSwitch as sensible and its trading update as solid.

      "bodyText": "A review of housing rental affordability released on Thursday shows that for most people on low incomes, finding an affordable place to rent is impossible. Anglicare Australia\u2019s annual snapshot of rental affordability shows that while there has been a slight increase in affordability for low-income households, for the vast majority of those living on benefits \u2013 such as Newstart or on the minimum wage \u2013 the cost of renting causes significant financial hardship. When we talk about housing affordability the most common discussion is about the cost of buying a house. And yet for 30% of people, while buying a house may be an ambition, the more immediate housing affordability issue is affording to pay rent rather than the mortgage. For the past five years Anglicare Australia has conducted a national survey of properties to provide a \u201csnapshot of rental affordability\u201d. Rather than survey households, the snapshot looks at the marketplace by examining the cost of renting properties nationwide. This year it involved a survey of some 65,614 properties. The report considers the affordability of these properties for households on different government benefits such as a single people on Newstart, those on the single parenting payment, the disability support pension, as well as those on the minimum wage. It considers an affordable property one in which the rent takes up \u201cless than 30% of the household\u2019s income\u201d. This accords with the general view of a household being in \u201chousing stress\u201d if \u201chousing costs are greater than 30% of disposable income and that household\u2019s income is in the bottom 40% of the income distribution\u201d. The review also considers the size of the property to ensure it is \u201cappropriate\u201d \u2013 while a one-bedroom apartment may be affordable, it is not appropriate for a family of four living on the minimum wage. And while most studies consider a range of housing costs, only rent is considered in the report. And rents have risen significantly over the past decade: Whereas wages have risen 41% in the past 10 years, rents have risen nationally by 54%, and for a good deal of the past decade they were rising even faster than residential housing prices. So renting costs more in real terms for the average wage earner, but it is even worse for those on the minimum wage, which has risen just 3% over the past year. For the minimum wage to have kept pace with the rise in rents over the past 10 years, it would need to be $80 a week more than the current amount of $640.90. The situation, however, is worst of all for those on Newstart. It only increases in line with inflation, and the consumer price index in the past 10 years has risen just 31%. The Anglicare Australia snapshot shows some very slight affordability improvement in 2014, but the situation remains incredibly damming. It found, for example, no improvement for those on Newstart. In 2014 only 0.04% of the listed properties were within the affordability range for a single person on Newstart \u2013 this year the level is just 0.02%. Most improvement came for those on the minimum wage. Last year only 1.6% of rental properties would have been affordable for a single person on minimum wage \u2013 this year 2.3% of all properties meet that criteria. An increase \u2013 yes \u2013 but hardly one to suggest life on the minimum wage has improved considerably. Anglicare Australia notes this small shift is mostly due to an increase in properties available in the private rental market this year. Rents across the country rose by just 2.4% in 2014 \u2013 less than the 3% increase in the minimum wage. But of course the increases vary across the states. In the 12 months up to March 2015, the biggest rise in rents has been in Sydney, which saw a 2.9% increase \u2013 whereas in Canberra rents actually fell 2.5%: Noting the difference in affordability across the nation, the report found there was great variance of affordability not just between states but regions within states. As a general rule regional areas had better affordability than capital cities. For example, in Adelaide only 2.2% of properties were both affordable and appropriate for a couple on the age pension, compared with 8.8% in the southern country regions of South Australia. Similarly, while only 0.4% of properties in the greater Sydney and Illawarra areas are affordable for a couple on the aged pension, in the NSW Riverina area 23.6% of properties were affordable for a couple, and 11.8% in NSW\u2019s central west: The report also found that when it comes to being able to have an affordable rental property, it is much better to be a couple than single. As Stephen Stills would say, it pays to love the one you\u2019re with. Nationally, 23.8% of properties were found to be affordable for a couple on minimum wage with two children, compared with just 2.3% for a single person on the minimum wage. There is also a difference for those on the aged pension: 3.4% of properties are affordable for a couple on the aged pension compared with just 0.9% for a single aged pensioner. But above all, having a job is the biggest factor for being able to afford appropriate rental accommodation. Only 0.9% of properties nationwide are affordable for a family of two with both adults on Newstart, compared with 6.9% for a similar family where one adult is on the minimum wage and the other is on the parenting payment. The report argues that these very low levels of affordability for those on low incomes highlights the need to change the taxation system away from current policies which \u201chelp individuals with high wealth profit from the housing market\u201d \u2013 especially if such policies don\u2019t lead to any significant increase in housing stock, and if they also increase house prices. Negative gearing is thus squarely in their sights, but the report argues that rather than remove it completely, perhaps it could be altered such that \u201cnegative gearing might only be claimed on new homes or existing properties that are identified affordable housing for low-income households\u201d. The report also argues for an increase in Newstart payments, and at the very least for it to be indexed in line with cost of living rather than inflation. The reality is those on lower incomes spend more of their weekly expenditure on rent than wealthier households. The CPI estimates that on average 6.7% of households\u2019 weekly budget is spent on rent, whereas the cost of living index for households on government benefits estimates that 14.8% of such households\u2019 weekly expenditure goes on rent: The rental affordability snapshot is a sobering read. While the affordability of housing gets almost constant coverage, it shows that for the lowest-income households the issue of housing affordability is much more desperate and critical. Out of the 65,614 properties surveyed, the snapshot found only 10 would be affordable for a person living on Newstart. Such a number certainly highlights there are two levels of housing affordability crisis \u2013 those who struggle to own the roof over their heads get the most attention; the other relates to those for whom affording to live under any roof is a struggle.",
