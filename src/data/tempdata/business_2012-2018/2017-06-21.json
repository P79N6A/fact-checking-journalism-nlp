      "bodyText": "And finally....the latest US oil inventory figures are just out, showing that US crude and gasoline inventories fell last week. The US Energy Information Administration reports that US oil stocks shrank by 2.5 million barrels, more than the 1.01 million which the markets had expected. In another surprise, gasoline inventories fell 578,000 barrels - compared to expectations of a 345,000 rise in gasoline stocks. This has help to push the oil price up a little, away from this week\u2019s seven-month lows. Brent crude is now up 0.25% today at $46.13. That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The US housing market has strengthened unexpectedly last month, according to new figures. Sales of US homes, excluding new builds, rose by 1.1% in May to an annual rate of 5.62 million sales. Average house prices also jumped during the month to record levels, suggesting demand was stronger too. This has pushed up the US dollar, pulling the pound back down below $1.27. Supermarket giant Tesco are back in the news again today, for the wrong reasons. Tesco Bank\u2019s online banking service has suffered a glitch today, that has left some customer unable to access their accounts. Yesterday, Tesco\u2019s online shopping scheme hit a pothole, leaving scores of customers without their deliveries. And in another blow today, Tesco has proposed closing its customer service centre in Cardif, putting 1,100 jobs at risk. It is planning to consolidate its two customer engagement centres into a single expanded operation in Dundee, Scotland, and creating 250 new jobs there. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says Andy Haldane\u2019s speech has been the main event of the morning. Haldane\u2019s concerns about not waiting too long to normalise policy could help the pound strengthen against the euro in the next few weeks, he says - just in time for the summer holiday season! Razaqzada says: Forget the Queen\u2019s Speech, it was all about Andy Haldane this morning. The pound jumped and the FTSE dropped after the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist and Monetary Policy Committee member said he\u2019s ready to vote for an increase in interest rates \u201crelatively soon\u201d. This came as a major surprise because Mr Haldane has long been a known dove. He is going head-to-head against the Governor Mark Carney, who is fast losing support on his dovish stance. He said that \u201ca partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon.\u201d Mr Haldane said that the risk was that the Bank tightened its belt too late rather than too early. This is something which the Bank of Canada is also worried about and what the US Federal Reserve had long been wary of, and the European Central Bank better be ready for. The latter came across pretty dovish at its last meeting. With the BoE turning hawkish and ECB remaining dovish, the EUR/GBP could come under pressure in the coming days and weeks. He also sent this image of the \u20ac-\u00a3 exchange rate, showing how the euro hit eight month highs against the euro recently, but couldn\u2019t break through 88.8p. Haldane\u2019s hawkishness has helped the pound to recovery almost all of the losses suffered yesterday, after BoE governor Mark Carney explained why interest rates ought to remain at record lows. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics reckons there\u2019s now a 50% chance of a UK interest rate rise this year. She says: The growing split on the MPC signals a much higher risk of tightening this year than previously expected in the markets. With two new members joining the MPC in the second half of the year, an active policy debate on the merits of tightening, against the optics of a strong inflation overshoot, overheating consumer credit growth, and a tight labour market, may well tilt the vote in favour of a rate hike by the year-end. The Haldane effect has pushed the pound back over $1.27, a whole cent higher than this morning\u2019s lows. Following Andy Haldane\u2019s speech, there are now at least four Bank of England policymakers who are likely to vote for rate rises this year. However... one of them, Kristin Forbes, leaves on 30 June. That leaves Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, who both voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% at this month\u2019s meeting. Forbes\u2019s replacement, Silvana Tenreyro, may not be as hawkish (but who knows?). So the monetary policy committee could be split 6-3*, unless other members are thinking along the same lines as Haldane. The next MPC meeting is in early August. * - Or 5-3, until the vacancy for a deputy governor is filled. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group thinks Haldane\u2019s change of mind is an important sign.. Andy Haldane\u2019s hint that UK interest rates may rise this year is particularly interesting as he had been seen as the most dovish policymaker at the Bank of England. With one speech, Haldane has shed his dovish feathers in favour of a hawkish summer plumage. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says there is a big split at the Bank of England. Ben Chu of the Independent flags up that Haldane has sounded hawkish before, only to flip when the facts changed... Rupert Harrison of asset management firm BlackRock (and a former top Treasury official) suggests that Haldane may be trying to annoy his boss. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics wonders if the Bank of England is trying to push the pound up, in an attempt to keep inflation down (something usually associated with emerging markets). Jeremy Cook of World First suggests that Haldane\u2019s comments caused some ructions on FX trading desks in the City: Newsflash: The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has declared that UK interest rates may have to rise later this year. Speaking in Yorkshire, Andy Haldane argued that the recent spike in inflation, to 2.9%, means the risks of waiting too long to tighten monetary policy have increased. As such, he says, rates may need to rise \u201cwell ahead\u201d of City expectations. It may make sense, Haldane adds, to start withdrawing some of last summer\u2019s stimulus (injected after the Brexit vote) later this year. It would even be a sign of confidence in the UK recovery. Here\u2019s the key section from Haldane\u2019s speech: Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance of risks associated with tightening \u201ctoo early\u201d, on the one hand, and \u201ctoo late\u201d, on the other, has swung materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months. The risks of tightening \u201ctoo early\u201d have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened \u201ctoo late\u201d, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u2019s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase \u2018at a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u2019. As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations. How soon is \u201crelatively soon\u201d? I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC\u2019s June meeting. I felt then there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons. First, despite upwards pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth. And despite robust surveys, there is still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy. Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences. Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy. Second, there is the election. This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty. Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle. Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year. That\u2019s an important intervention. Last week, three MPC policymakers (but not Haldane) voted for a rate hike. But just yesterday, governor Mark Carney argued forcefully that it is too early.... Back in the markets, shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial have slumped by 16% this morning after a shock profits warning. The FTSE 100-listed lender admitted last night that its recent reorganisation - which eliminated around 2,000 - had caused more disruption than expected. Provident appears to have botched its attempts to persuade self-employed debt collectors to become full-time staff instead. CEO Peter Crook told analysts today that too few workers made the switch. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it right. The incentives we had in place and the other management actions and communications that were there, were not sufficient to retain the number of agents that we anticipated.\u201d The pound has recovered its early losses following this morning\u2019s public finance figures. Sterling is back at $1.263, as traders watch for any surprises in the Queen\u2019s Speech, which begins shortly. Our Politics Liveblog will have all the details: John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says today\u2019s public finance figures are a boost to Philip Hammond, at a crucial time. \u201cToday\u2019s public finance data brought some good news for the Chancellor as estimated borrowing was revised down by around \u00a32 billion in the last financial year and a further \u00a31 billion in April. \u201cTaking April and May together, the deficit of around \u00a316 billion was very similar to the same two months last year, whereas the OBR had forecast that borrowing would rise this financial year as one-off favourable factors unwound. \u201cOf course, it is very early days in this financial year, but the Chancellor will take some cheer from these figures. However, Hawksworth is also concerned that the UK economic picture is darkening: The economy is slowing and considerable uncertainties remain around the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. At the same time, political pressures for higher spending on health, social care, education, policing, social housing and public pay more generally have increased. \u201cThe Chancellor therefore still faces some tough challenges ahead if he is to meet his target of a balanced budget by 2025. But his interim target of getting the structural budget deficit below 2% of GDP by 2020/21 looks much easier to achieve and gives him some room for manoeuvre on tax and spending over the next few years.\u201d The \u00a3300m drop in the deficit in May shows that the UK public finances started the year on a solid footing, says Capital Economics. However, they also expect total borrowing to rise during this financial year. Their UK economist, Scott Bowman, says: The strong revenue growth partly reflected a 4.3% rise in VAT receipts \u2013 perhaps a sign that consumer spending growth hasn\u2019t slowed too sharply recently. That said, we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the borrowing figures for the first few months of the fiscal year as they are based on a significant amount of forecast data. Accordingly, we still think that borrowing for the fiscal year as a whole will increase by several billion pounds (the OBR expects a \u00a37bn rise) as a number of one-off factors that lowered borrowing in 2016-17 unwind. Britain\u2019s finance ministry has welcomed the drop in borrowing last month, but admitted that the task of repairing the public finances isn\u2019t complete. A Treasury spokesperson says: \u2018We have reduced the deficit by three-quarters since 2010 but there is still further to go. We are committed to bringing the public finances back to balance by the middle of next decade, building a stronger economy that can deliver higher living standards for people across the country.\u2019 Fact check: That \u2018three-quarter\u2019 claim refers to borrowing as a share of the national economy. The deficit was 9.9% of GDP in 2010, and fell to 2.6% of GDP in 2016. Yesterday, chancellor Philip Hammond said the government aims to eliminate the deficit by the middle of the next decade. A far cry from George Osborne\u2019s goal of balancing the books by 2015..... Here\u2019s some reaction to the news that Britain\u2019s deficit fell to \u00a36.7bn last month: Economist Rupert Seggins points out that UK public sector borrowing has dropped, a little, so far this financial year: KPMG\u2019s chief economist, Yael Selfin, fears that the public finances may deteriorate in the months ahead: Howard Archer of EY Item Club believes VAT receipts rose in May thanks to a pickup in retail sales in April: Today\u2019s public finance report also shows that Britain\u2019s total national debt is now \u00a31.737 trillion -- or 86.5% of annual GDP. Britain\u2019s budget deficit fell by \u00a3300m in May, giving a glimmer of hope to the UK government as it wrestles with Brexit. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the UK borrowed \u00a36.7bn to balance the books last month. That\u2019s down from \u00a37bn in May 2016, and rather less than April\u2019s \u00a39.4bn deficit. The public finances were boosted by an increase in the tax takes. VAT receipts rose by 4.3% to \u00a311.2bn in May, which looks to be the highest for any May on record. The figures show that Britain has borrowed \u00a3100m less since the start of this financial year than in 2016-2017. OK, we\u2019re only two months in, but it\u2019s not a disastrous start... I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now... It\u2019s been an exciting day on the Chinese stock market. The CSI 300 index, which contains the biggest companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen, jumped 1.2% to its highest closing level since the end of 2015. Traders rushed to buy shares after US stock index provider MSCI announced it would add some China\u2019s mainland domestic shares to its emerging markets index. That move will have been warmly welcomed in Beijing as it attempts to open up its financial markets and attract foreign capital. Jamie McGeever of Reuters shows how the pound has fallen back to two-month lows since the general election delivered a hung parliament. Breaking! The pound has slipped to a fresh two-month low against the US dollar. Sterling has just fallen below $1.26 for the first time since mid-April, when Theresa May took the fateful decision to call a general election. It\u2019s lost a third of a cent today to $1.2593. Yesterday, the pound weakened after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said it was too early to raise interest rates. Today\u2019s selloff may be due to political instability in Westminster, and tensions between the Conservative party and the DUP over a possible deal. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Sterling also had a miserable open this Wednesday, the pound falling 0.3% against the dollar and 0.2% against the euro. That\u2019s because, despite the state opening of parliament being just a few hours away, Theresa May is yet to fully secure the support of the DUP, the Irish party unhappy with what they see as a lack of respect from certain sections of the Conservatives. Opec\u2019s highly publicised production cuts have actually turned into a win for US oil producers. American shale oil firms have raised their own output as the oil price recovered earlier this year, undermining efforts to cut the global glut of oil (leading to this week\u2019s price falls). The Wall Street Journal explains: U.S. producers ramped up production when the world was already swimming in oil as OPEC members, Russia and other producing nations curtailed output. U.S. oil production is up 7.3% to 9.3 million barrels a day since OPEC announced plans in November to cut output, and the number of active rigs in the U.S. is at a two-year high. The cartel\u2019s output cut \u201chas been deemed an OPEC failure and a U.S. production win,\u201d said Tony Headrick, energy analyst at CHS Hedging. Oil prices are coming under more pressure this morning, knocking 1% off the price of Brent crude and Nymex. European stock markets are falling in early trading, as oil\u2019s drop worries investors. The FTSE 100 has shed 22 points, or 0.3%. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are among the big fallers, down over 1% each. Big news from America: Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick has resigned after a series of scandals at the ride-hailing business he co-founded in 2009. Kalanick\u2019s departure comes a week after he announced he would take an indefinite leave of absence as the embattled company released a damning report on its workplace culture. According to the New York Times, five of Uber\u2019s major investors demanded that the chief executive resign immediately, following revelations about its workplace culture and reports of harassment and discrimination. In a statement, Kalanick said: \u201cI love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight.\u201d More here: Nordic bank Danske say that oil\u2019s slide into a bear market is worrying investors worldwide: FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga predicts that prices will keep falling: Oil\u2019s ongoing oversupply woes reached an ear-piercing crescendo during Tuesday\u2019s trading session as WTI Crude plunged into a bear market after growing signs of rising production across the globe. WTI Crude was already extremely sensitive and vulnerable to losses amid the bearish sentiment with reports of an unexpected supply increase by Libya sending prices below $43. Although OPEC initially displayed good intentions when it exempted some members from the production cuts, this has come back to haunt them with more production from Libya, Nigeria, and Iran. With the bias towards oil heavily tilted to the downside, further losses should be expected as bears exploit persistent oversupply concerns to ruthlessly attack the commodity. This is from Jonny Bo Jakobsen of Nordea Markets: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also expects oil to keep sliding this summer: The risk is we could see further declines, particularly if shale producers continue to add rigs, and demand continues to slow in Asia, and there are no further supply disruptions. The key support levels sit down at the November lows at $43 on Brent and $42 on US WTI, which if they give way $40 could come into view very quickly indeed and drag equity markets down with them, especially if today\u2019s weekly inventory data disappoints. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders are edgy this morning after the oil prices tumbled to seven-month lows. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude has slumped below $46 per barrel for the first time since November 2016, dragged down by signs that the market is oversupplied. US crude prices also took a bath, falling 20% from their recent highs to around $43.50 per barrel. That put oil into a bear market for the first time since August, on signs that the global supply glut of oil isn\u2019t going away. These moves show that the oil market is losing faith in the Opec cartel\u2019s ability to prop up prices, despite producers recently agreeing to extend production curbs until March 2018. Amanda Cooper, Reuters\u2019 oil expert, tweets that bearish oil traders have the upper hand. The selloff was partly triggered by signs that Libya has tripled its production levels in the last year. Libya is an Opec member, but exempt from its production cuts deal, as Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: As for the black gold, investors are becoming a little anxious towards the rising production out of Libya, however, OPEC has stated it before that the production level out of Libya is already taken into account in the part of their production cut strategy. Saudi Arabia also reported higher export data on Tuesday. It is important that not only production cuts are under control but also the export numbers as well. New oil inventory figures are released by the US government later today, which could move the markets again.... Also coming up today. Never exactly a shrinking violet, the UK economy will gambol back into the spotlight this morning when public finance figures for May are released. The City predict that public sector net borrowing fell to around \u00a37bn, from over \u00a39bn in April a year ago , as the long drudge of deficit reduction continues. Over in parliament, the Queen will outline the government\u2019s legislative programme - even though prime minister Theresa May hasn\u2019t agreed a deal with the DUP to prop up her government. The Queen\u2019s speech is likely to be dominated by Brexit, as the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith explains... The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is visiting Yorkshire and the Humber. Haldane\u2019s speeches are always good value (remember the one about the dog chasing the frisbee?), so we\u2019ll be scrutinising this one closely.

It would even be a sign of confidence in the UK recovery.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the key section from Haldane\u2019s speech:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance of risks associated with tightening \u201ctoo early\u201d, on the one hand, and \u201ctoo late\u201d, on the other, has swung materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months. The risks of tightening \u201ctoo early\u201d have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened \u201ctoo late\u201d, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u2019s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase \u2018at a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u2019.</p> <p>As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. </p> <p>Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations.</p> <p>How soon is \u201crelatively soon\u201d? I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC\u2019s June meeting. I felt then there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons. First, despite upwards pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth. And despite robust surveys, there is still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy. Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences. Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy.</p> <p>Second, there is the election. This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty. Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle.</p> <p>Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s an important intervention. Last week, three MPC policymakers (but not Haldane) voted for a rate hike.

At the same time, political pressures for higher spending on health, social care, education, policing, social housing and public pay more generally have increased. </p> <p>\u201cThe Chancellor therefore still faces some tough challenges ahead if he is to meet his target of a balanced budget by 2025.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is to close a call centre in Cardiff, putting 1,100 jobs at risk. The supermarket chain said that in February it planned to close one of its two call centres which handle customer emails, social media inquiries and phone calls. About 250 jobs will be created in the group\u2019s other call centre, in Dundee, which will handle all customer queries. Workers from Cardiff will be offered work there but few are expected to move. Nick Ireland, the divisional officer of Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 trade union, said workers in Cardiff were \u201cunderstandably shocked\u201d by the announcement. \u201cThis is clearly devastating news for our members and will have a wider impact on south Wales, as so many jobs are potentially lost to our local economy. \u201cWe will now enter into consultation talks with the company over the coming weeks to look at the business case for the proposed closure. Our priorities are to keep as many members as possible in employment, whether that is with Tesco or other local employers, and to get the best possible deal for our members.\u201d Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Welsh Assembly, said: \u201cThis could be the biggest single loss of jobs in Wales since 2009, and will be a huge blow for the employees and their families and the South Wales economy.\u201d Matt Davies, the UK chief executive of Tesco, said: \u201cThe retail sector is facing unprecedented challenges and we must ensure we run our business in a sustainable and cost-effective way, while meeting the changing needs of our customers. \u201cTo help us achieve this, we\u2019ve taken the difficult decision to close our customer service operations in Cardiff. \u201cWe realise this will have a significant effect on colleagues in the Cardiff area, and our priority now is to continue to do all we can to support them at this time.\u201d Retailers are having to rethink their businesses in the face of aggressive online competitors as well as higher costs after a hike in the national living wage from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.50, recent business rate changes and the introduction of the apprenticeship levy. Lewis said last year that retailers faced a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d as profits slump and costs rise. Rising competition from the discounters Aldi and Lidl has also forced traditional supermarkets to hold down prices at a time of rising costs resulting from the fall in the value of the pound against the euro and the dollar. The cuts at Tesco are the latest in a string of cutbacks implemented as part of a turnaround plan led by Dave Lewis, the group chief executive, who joined in autumn 2014. In his first year in charge, Lewis axed nearly 5,000 head office and UK store management jobs as well as more than 4,000 roles overseas and at the group\u2019s banking division. More than 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 48 underperforming Tesco stores, while in April 3,000 jobs were put at risk when the chain cut night shifts for shelf stackers in some of its biggest supermarkets. Tesco is not alone. Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Waitrose have also closed stores while Asda has cut jobs as all the big grocers try to keep costs down. But the latest changes are part of a cost-cutting drive designed to improve the efficiency of Tesco before its \u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker, the cash and carry company behind the Londis and Budgens convenience store chains. The announcement of the job cuts comes during a difficult week for the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket. On Tuesday, call centres were inundated with customer complaints following an IT glitch that hit up to 10% of online grocery orders. On Wednesday, Tesco Bank customers were unable to access online banking for several hours after another IT issue. Customer queries for the bank are handled by a separate operation from those in Cardiff and Dundee. Tesco Bank apologised to those affected and said: \u201cService is now restored and customers can access their account as normal.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s spending deficit is on course to worsen this year as official figures show the economic slowdown is beginning to take a toll on the UK\u2019s public finances. As ministers struggle with demands for higher spending on health, police and social care, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said public borrowing was narrowly lower in May than the same month last year. Public sector net borrowing excluding the nationalised banks was \u00a36.7bn, down from \u00a37.1bn a year earlier and slightly below the consensus expectation of \u00a36.8bn. But analysts said this still meant the government would fail to meet its previous plan of reducing the deficit in every year of the parliament, with the gap between government income and spending heading towards \u00a358bn, compared with \u00a347bn last year. The economy has slowed dramatically since the start of the year as the prospect of Brexit negotiations unnerved businesses and the lower value of the pound fed through into increased inflation, causing living standards to fall. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, revised the government\u2019s pledge to bring down the deficit in his autumn statement last year when he set a target for a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade, rather than his predecessor\u2019s forecast of 2020. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, expects public sector net borrowing to increase this year and then resume its downward path. Revisions by the ONS to last year\u2019s deficit show it was better than expected at 2.4% of GDP, compared with the previous estimate of 2.6%. Scott Bowman, the UK economist at Capital Economics, said the 2016-17 figure was flattered by a series of one-off sources of revenue and the prospect for 2017-18 was for the deficit to increase for the first time since 2010. \u201cWe still think that borrowing for the fiscal year as a whole will increase by several billion pounds as a number of one-off factors that lowered borrowing in 2016-17 unwind,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the election result suggests that the planned forthcoming fiscal squeeze may be scaled back slightly.\u201d Yael Selfin, the chief UK economist at accountancy firm KPMG, said: \u201cSince the \u2018great recession\u2019 we have seen a period of gradual improvements, but expected headwinds are now likely to put significant pressure on public finances. \u201cA slowing economy, a potential hefty exit payment to the EU and an eventual gradual rise in borrowing costs are all coming the UK\u2019s way. Taken together, this may leave little room for the government to satisfy public demands for an end to austerity.\u201d A Treasury spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have reduced the deficit by three-quarters since 2010, but there is still further to go. We are committed to bringing the public finances back to balance by the middle of the next decade, building a stronger economy that can deliver higher living standards for people across the country.\u201d Bowman said Hammond\u2019s Mansion House speech earlier this week showed he intends to stick to the fiscal rules set out in the November autumn statement, meaning \u201cfiscal policy is still set to provide a significant drag on GDP growth over the next few years\u201d. Ross Campbell, the public sector director at accountants\u2019 body ICAEW, said any easing of austerity should be directed at increasing growth. \u201cThe hung parliament increases the uncertainty associated with Brexit, while also diverting resources and attention away from the economy. This could negatively impact the health of the public finances. As a result, and in order to deliver credible fiscal plans, it\u2019s important that government puts strong financial leadership at the top of its priority list,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been signals from government that we are likely to see an end to austerity and therefore a possible increase in public spending. With the economy still in a fragile state, it\u2019s important that any increased expenditure is allocated to areas that will help to drive economic growth \u2013 infrastructure, training and fiscal stimulus.\u201d The fall in borrowing announced on Wednesday was due to an increase in central government revenue of \u00a32.6bn outweighing higher expenditure of \u00a32.2bn. The strong revenue growth partly reflected a 4.3% rise in VAT receipts, although recent shopping trends appear to show this will weaken in the coming months. The Bank of England said in a separate report that higher food prices were leaving people with less money to spend on non-essentials such as furniture and eating out. Households were also starting to feel the pinch from increased clothing prices and utility bills, according to the latest snapshot from the Bank\u2019s team of regional agents, based on discussions with businesses across the UK.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England rift as chief economist ponders interest rate rise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Signs of a deepening rift on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee have emerged after Threadneedle Street\u2019s chief economist revealed he seriously considered opposing the governor, Mark Carney, and voting for an interest rate rise earlier this month. Just 24 hours after Carney said the state of the economy and the uncertainty caused by Brexit meant borrowing costs should stay on hold, Andy Haldane said it would be prudent to tighten policy before the end of the year. The June meeting of the MPC resulted in a 5-3 vote in favour of leaving rates on hold, with both the Bank\u2019s governor and its chief economist voting with the majority. But Haldane, previously one of the most doveish members of the committee, said the balance of risks had shifted so that the dangers of moving too late outweighed those of raising interest rates too soon. Sterling rose on the foreign exchanges after Haldane spoke, with the City reassessing its view that interest rates would stay unchanged well into 2018. At one point, the pound was up three quarters of a cent against the US dollar to $1.27 before later falling back. \u201cThe risks of tightening \u2018too early\u2019 have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened \u2018too late\u2019, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u2019s collective expectation that Bank rate would increase \u2018at a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u2019,\u201d Haldane said in a speech in Bradford. The Bank reduced interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in the wake of last summer\u2019s Brexit vote, but Haldane said that, despite the possibility that the economy could suffer as a result of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, the time for the first increase in borrowing costs in a decade was fast approaching, and would come much more quickly than the City was expecting. \u201cAs the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past nine months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations.\u201d The Bank official said he had voted for no change at the MPC\u2019s meeting for two reasons. First, he said there was evidence that deunionisation, rising self-employment, and the \u201cgig economy\u201d had resulted in weaker wage growth than in the past. Second, the election result had thrown up a dust cloud of uncertainty. \u201cFinancial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust cloud has started to settle. \u201cProvided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.\u201d Haldane said the first rate rise since before the deep recession of 2008-09 should be welcomed rather than feared. \u201cAs and when the MPC begins this process of normalising monetary policy, it will be a sign of the economy itself having begun to normalise. Far from being a cause for concern, starting the process of withdrawing some monetary policy insurance should serve as a signal of the MPC\u2019s confidence in the UK economy\u2019s resilience and in inflation returning sustainably to its 2% target.\u201d Lena Komileva, of G+Economics said: \u201cThe growing split on the MPC signals a much higher risk of tightening this year than previously expected in the markets. With two new members joining the MPC in the second half of the year, an active policy debate on the merits of tightening, against the optics of a strong inflation overshoot, overheating consumer credit growth, and a tight labour market, may well tilt the vote in favour of a rate hike by the year-end.\u201d",

And if policy tightened \u2018too late\u2019, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u2019s collective expectation that Bank rate would increase \u2018at a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u2019,\u201d Haldane said in a speech in Bradford.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank reduced interest rates to a record low of 0.25%</a> in the wake of last summer\u2019s Brexit vote, but Haldane said that, despite the possibility that the economy could suffer as a result of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, the time for the first increase in borrowing costs in a decade was fast approaching, and would come much more quickly than the City was expecting.</p> <p>\u201cAs the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past nine months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"884b6b0d8b7df9a2c5562eb730d547d7faaf857a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/884b6b0d8b7df9a2c5562eb730d547d7faaf857a/814_453_1855_1113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Haldane and Mark Carney give evidence to the Commons Treasury select committee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Haldane and Mark Carney give evidence to the Commons Treasury select committee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Bank official said he had voted for no change at the MPC\u2019s meeting for two reasons. First, he said there was evidence that deunionisation, rising self-employment, and the \u201cgig economy\u201d had resulted in weaker wage growth than in the past. Second, the election result had thrown up a dust cloud of uncertainty.</p> <p>\u201cFinancial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust cloud has started to settle.<br></p> <p>\u201cProvided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.\u201d</p> <p>Haldane said the first rate rise since before the deep recession of 2008-09 should be welcomed rather than feared. \u201cAs and when the MPC begins this process of normalising monetary policy, it will be a sign of the economy itself having begun to normalise. Far from being a cause for concern, starting the process of withdrawing some monetary policy insurance should serve as a signal of the MPC\u2019s confidence in the UK economy\u2019s resilience and in inflation returning sustainably to its 2% target.\u201d <br></p> <p>Lena Komileva, of G+Economics said:<strong> \u201c</strong>The growing split on the MPC signals a much higher risk of tightening this year than previously expected in the markets. With two new members joining the MPC in the second half of the year, an active policy debate on the merits of tightening, against the optics of a strong inflation overshoot, overheating consumer credit growth, and a tight labour market, may well tilt the vote in favour of a rate hike by the year-end.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Travis Kalanick has resigned as chief executive of Uber \u2013 too late and without an admission of personal responsibility for the many scandals that have engulfed the ride-hailing firm he helped to found. If Uber was a normal public company, subject to even a gentle governance regime, he would have been fired years ago. As it is, Kalanick\u2019s resignation counts as a minor triumph for the venture capitalists who own about 40% of privately controlled Uber. Benchmark, the biggest investor, led the revolt and it\u2019s not difficult to guess why its patience finally snapped. First, there were the signs that the damage to Uber\u2019s brand was affecting business. Its US rival Lyft had been gaining ground and Uber\u2019s many fights with regulators and law enforcement agencies around the world would only become trickier as long as Kalanick remained in the driving seat. Second, it would have been impossible for Uber to pursue a stock market listing via an IPO, or at least the supposed $68bn (\u00a354bn) valuation would have been a fantasy. The technology bubble in the US is alive and inflating, but who would pay that kind of money for a loss-making company whose boss had become a liability? Even now, any potential investor will want to know if Kalanick\u2019s resignation is the real deal or a cosmetic exercise. He is staying on board in a capacity yet to be defined. Given the size of his shareholding and voting rights \u2013 Forbes has valued his wealth at $6bn \u2013 he can hardly be denied a position, and he doesn\u2019t seem the type to sit quietly in the back making polite conversation. Uber will need to show that it can recruit a strong chief executive and then give that individual the freedom to operate and to hire other staff. There is a wider moral to the Uber tale. Kalanick was only able to survive as chief executive for so long because Silicon Valley venture capitalists swallowed the idea that founders are business visionaries who must be allowed to operate by their own rules. Sometimes that philosophy works. Sometimes, as with Uber, it\u2019s a recipe for scandal and unnecessary risk. Proper boardroom accountability, even with startups and technology innovators, is a principle worth defending. Bank big beasts lock horns over interest rates It\u2019s the big bust-up in Threadneedle Street: the governor of the Bank of England versus the chief economist. Mark Carney says \u201cnow is not the time\u201d to raise interest rates whereas Andy Haldane thinks it would be best to get on with the job \u201crelatively soon\u201d. An increase from 0.25% can\u2019t be delayed forever and inflation at 2.9% obviously heightens the dangers of delay. Haldane\u2019s worry is that the Bank won\u2019t be able to honour its promise that eventual rises will be \u201cgradual\u201d and \u201climited\u201d. It\u2019s a legitimate concern, but Carney\u2019s position is more persuasive to this column\u2019s mind. For starters, the impact of the Brexit negotiations on business confidence is unknown, but is unlikely to be positive. Then there\u2019s this line from Wednesday\u2019s report from the Bank\u2019s agents on the ground: \u201cPass-through effects on material cost inflation may have passed their peak.\u201d That doesn\u2019t imply that inflation in output prices and consumer prices has also peaked. But it may suggest that pressures at the start of the chain are easing. Delaying the rate-rise looks best. As Brexit finally starts to feel real, so does the risk of a downturn later this year. Cock-up in the cash loan business Doorstep lending is a straightforward business, according to Provident Financial\u2019s website. The FTSE 100 company provides \u201csimple cash-based loans\u201d and has been doing so for 137 years. It uses self-employed agents to hand out the cash and make weekly collections. Or, rather, it used to. This year the board decided to get rid of the agents and \u201cmigrate\u201d to a new model that uses 2,500 directly employed full-time \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d. The share price has definitely migrated. It fell 17% as chief executive Peter Crook confessed to a cock-up, or \u201chigher than expected operational disruption\u201d as he put it. It seems many of the self-employed part-time agents don\u2019t wish to go full-time and have offered their services to rivals. \u201cRecent vacancy levels have been 12%, which is more than double the rate anticipated,\u201d said Provident. It\u2019s a problem, one might think, that could have been avoided by asking the agents what they thought of the plan. \u201cNonetheless, the strategic rationale for the change remains strong,\u201d declared Crook. In year one of the great leap forward, however, divisional profits will almost halve to \u00a360m. One hopes Provident\u2019s customers actually want their experience to be managed \u2013 it\u2019s not clear what the process even involves.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has paid out an estimated \u00a318bn in bonuses since 2008, the year it raised almost \u00a312bn to bolster its financial position and avoid a taxpayer bailout. Paul Myners, who was City minister at the time of the 2008 crisis, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that bonus payouts may have been one of the reasons the bank was keen to avoid the taxpayer bailouts that Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group received. \u201cI think firstly there was a real fear on their part that this was nationalisation, it was political, they didn\u2019t want anything to do with a Labour government.\u201d \u201cSecondly, they realised that the terms we were imposing meant that pay for their senior bankers and bonuses and options were going to be substantially reduced,\u201d Lord Myners said. After their bailouts RBS and Lloyds were subjected to constraints by the government about the way they handed out bonuses. RBS was limited to paying cash bonuses of no more than \u00a32,000, with any additional payouts made in shares that had to held for several years. When a bonus cap was introduced by the European Union in 2013, limiting bonuses to one times salary or double if shareholders approved, the government refused to give the approval that would have allowed RBS to pay out more. The public anger sparked by the financial crisis forced greater disclosure from banks about the way they paid their top staff, particularly banks like Barclays that have large investment banking operations. Anthony Salz, a lawyer who conducted a review for Barclays of its activities in the wake of the 2012 Libor rigging scandal, said in his report a year later that the bank paid \u201cincentive\u201d pay of \u00a32.5bn in 2010, \u00a32.6bn in 2011 and \u00a32.4bn in 2012.

      "bodyText": "Government-backed inspectors should be able to investigate companies and entire industries to prevent unscrupulous companies falsely labelling workers as self-employed, according to a leading legal body. In a submission to the independent review of employment practices led by Matthew Taylor, the Law Society also recommends the immediate scrapping of employment tribunal fees, which have led to a 70% fall in claims in the last three years. It also says every worker should receive written clarification of their employment status. It suggests that the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, which already has some investigatory powers over food and farming operators, could be handed responsibility to carry out investigations into employment status in all businesses. The Taylor review, which was commissioned by the government last year, is expected to publish recommendations in the next few weeks. \u201cOur rights at work are not optional \u2013 they are the minimum standard to which we are entitled,\u201d said the Law Society president, Robert Bourns. \u201cOur law relies on individuals taking their employer to court to get their rights recognised \u2013 a task that is simply beyond most people. Bad employers know this and take advantage of it to cut corners and underpay people, knowing they\u2019ll probably get away with it. \u201cAn independent government inspector who can go into a business to ensure staff are being given their proper workplace rights will help put a stop to this exploitation, and put everyone on a fair and even playing field.\u201d The rise of platforms including Uber, Deliveroo and online retailers, most of which say their drivers and riders are independent contractors, has led to growing concern that millions are stuck in insecure and stressful work in the gig economy. Self-employed independent contractors are not entitled to holiday pay, sick pay or pension contributions. In contrast those categorised as workers have a degree of independence and can be self-employed but they are also entitled to limited rights including the national minimum wage and holiday pay. The most secure are employees, who have full rights including entitlements to flexible working, maternity pay and sick pay. The importance of these categories has been highlighted by a string of tribunals led by trade unions questioning the status of drivers and riders including successful cases brought by cycle couriers at CitySprint and Excel and drivers for taxi app Uber. All three cases found the riders and drivers were workers. Evidence suggests a significant minority of employers are circumventing employment protection legislation. Research from Citizens Advice in 2015 suggested that one in 10 people, or about 460,000, have been mislabelled self-employed. In January, the TUC reported that the number of people without guaranteed hours or baseline employment rights had risen by more than 660,000 (27%) over the past five years. The Law Society suggests a comprehensive review of employment legislation and clearer definitions of employment categories. It says all businesses should be forced to clarify the status of their workers in writing. Taylor has said he is considering allowing workers to check directly with the government whether attempts by companies to class them as self-employed are legitimate. He is also considering whether to give agency workers on variable hours the right to request a permanent contract after a certain period.",

    "webTitle": "House sales have fallen by nearly a third in some parts of UK, says Lloyds", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High prices and hefty stamp duty bills have resulted in a near one-third drop in house moves in some parts of the country over the past year, according to research by Lloyds Bank. The number of home sales in England and Wales fell by 7% in 2016 to 848,857, but dropped most heavily in London, by 18%, and 10% in the south-east. Brent in north London and Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire saw falls of 30% in the number of transactions. Overall housing market activity is now substantially below the 1.2m to 1.3m in annual sales common before the financial crash, said Lloyds. Places as diverse as Westminster and Hull have seen 55%-plus falls in sales over the past decade, while every local authority in England and Wales had lower sales in 2016 than in 2006. The detailed sales map of England and Wales shows big falls in once frothy markets such as Hackney (down 26% last year) and Southwark (down 24%) in London, alongside declines in areas with structural economic problems, such as the former coal and steel town of Workington in Cumbria (down 26%). \u201cThe recovery in the housing market has stumbled during the past year with sales declining in all regions,\u201d said Andy Mason of Lloyds Bank. \u201cDespite record low interest rates and government schemes, such as Help to Buy, sales remain significantly below the levels seen at the height of the last housing boom.\u201d Prices also remain near all-time peaks, representing another potential deterrent to buyers. The average house price in Britain is \u00a3220,706, according to Halifax, up 3.3% over the past year, although slightly below the all-time peak of \u00a3222,190 in December 2016. Since 2006 house prices have risen by 29% nationally but 93% in London, according to the Nationwide index. But there were crumbs of comfort for first-time buyers, who now make up a bigger proportion of buyers than in recent years. Lloyds\u2019 housing economist, Nitesh Patel, said stamp duty increases had helped reduce second home and landlord buying. They had also deterred buyers in the premium end of the market in London and the south-east. Stamp duty on a \u00a31m home is now \u00a343,750, which, once added to estate agency and legal bills, has made moving prohibitively expensive for many families. Lloyds said the average cost of moving home is \u00a311,000 in England and Wales, rising to \u00a331,000 in London. The long buy-to-let boom may also have fundamentally changed the dynamics of the property market. Many small flats and houses have been bought as investments for a pension, and may therefore not reappear on the market for decades, said Patel. The average property now changes hands once every eight years, said Patel, a year longer than the commonly held view that people move every seven years, although he added that there is incomplete data in this area. The decline in transaction activity has knock-on effects in other parts of the economy, stretching from income for estate agents and conveyancing solicitors through to sales of furniture and electrical stores which tend to benefit when people move home and buy new goods. Last year Countrywide, the estate agent group, announced the closure of more than 50 branches, while London agency Foxtons warned in March of tough trading conditions in 2017 as it reported a 54% fall in profit for last year. However, the total number of estate agents in Britain is today about 15% above the last pre-recession peak, said Mark Hayward of the National Association of Estate Agents, with rising house prices making each transaction more valuable. But he warned that if transaction activity continued to fall, closures may be inevitable. \u201cCommission has reduced in percentage terms but due to house price inflation, the amount agents receive is not vastly different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that we aren\u2019t seeing a raft of closures; when you look at the amount of commission received and number of sales that take place it does suggest it\u2019s not sustainable in the long term.\u201d",
