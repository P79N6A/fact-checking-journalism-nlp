      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is planning a major restructuring of its workforce, adding 2,000 jobs as it refocuses its operations on digital technology. Britain\u2019s biggest high street lender will cut 6,000 jobs but create another 8,000 as part of a \u00a33bn reorganisation over the course of the next two years. The job losses will be spread across the group transformation division, corporate banking, retail and community banking, Sky News reported. New roles will be oriented towards digital technology. It is understood that existing Lloyds employees whose jobs disappear will be offered the chance to apply for the new roles, fitting in with an existing re-training drive. Lloyds\u2019 recognised unions, Unite and Accord, have been consulted on the plans, which are not thought to include branch closures at this point, although job losses may be concentrated in specific offices. A Unite spokesperson said: \u201cUnite will scrutinise the detail of the announcement when it is made. Our priority will be to press the company to ensure there are no compulsory redundancies.\u201d Lloyds, which owns brands such as Halifax and Bank of Scotland, announced in February it would re-evaluate its strategy alongside a \u00a33bn investment plan running from 2018 to 2020. At the same time, it is aiming to cut operating costs to less than \u00a38bn in 2020, from \u00a38.2bn in 2017. The UK\u2019s major high street banks have been gradually reducing branch numbers as they adjust to the rapid rise of mobile and online banking and the consequent slump in the number of branch transactions. Lloyds announced 15 branch closures in September, although job losses were not significant. However, it has cut thousands of jobs under the leadership of the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, who joined the bank in 2011. The bank previously said its \u201ctransformation\u201d programme would affect more than two-thirds of the business. The restructuring plan came after the government sold off its final shares in the bank. Lloyds was bailed out by the government during the financial crisis, following the acquisition of HBOS which made it into the UK\u2019s largest high street bank. Lloyds Banking Group declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Heathrow\u2019s third runway must be \u201ccost-efficient and sustainable\u201d and \u201cminimise costs to airlines, passengers and freight owners\u201d, according to the government\u2019s policy statement that gave the go-ahead for expansion in June. What does that mean in hard numbers? And who is on the hook if the cost of the project explodes beyond \u00a314bn? Heathrow\u2019s private-sector owners or paying passengers? The questions were left unanswered in the summer. Transport secretary Chris Grayling muttered ineffectually about the need for \u201caffordable\u201d numbers and details were left to the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to work out. After many months of pushing Heathrow for information, CAA chief executive Richard Moriarty sounds exasperated. His \u201cinterim update\u201d to the Department for Transport was a long complaint about \u201cthe lack of high quality and comprehensive information\u201d from Heathrow on costs and efficiency. Concerns \u201chave not yet been adequately addressed\u201d. The company must \u201curgently and demonstrably\u201d rise to the challenge. Unless there is \u201ca significant improvement\u201d, the regulator may use its formal powers to intervene. In most industries, a rebuke in that style would be met with an immediate promise to do better. Heathrow\u2019s response, however, amounted to a shrug of the shoulders. The airport said it will present its planning masterplan next year and didn\u2019t even attempt to explain why it has not satisfied the CAA\u2019s long-standing and reasonable requests. Heathrow\u2019s owners, one suspects, take the view that the regulator is a minor distraction and that the real battle was won with the parliamentary vote. It may be right, but it is an arrogant way to behave. The high-handed response will also deepen fears that a splendidly protected company is preparing a proposal in which other people are expected to underwrite the construction risks. Not good enough. Bets off on Brexit certainty On 9 November, if the nation\u2019s economists are correct, the UK will report third-quarter growth in GDP of 0.6%, a relative triumph when you look across the channel at the 0.2% recorded last week by the eurozone for the July-September period. Enjoy the moment while you can. The latest data suggests Brexit-induced worries are now biting. The dominant services sector grew at its slowest pace for seven months in October, according to the monthly survey of executives by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. Brexit was perhaps not the only explanation since Chris Williamson, IHS Markit\u2019s chief business economist, had other factors on his list, including a global slowdown, trade wars and geopolitics. But, as he says, the detail of the report offers \u201cmounting evidence that Brexit worries are taking an increasing toll on the economy.\u201d On this evidence, overall growth in the fourth quarter could be a sluggish eurozone-style 0.2%. If you are optimist, the drag will disappear when, or if, Theresa May secures a negotiated deal. According to this line of thinking, pent-up investment will be released and the chancellor\u2019s expansionary budget will become the story. Well, maybe. It seems equally likely that any withdrawal agreement with Brussels will be so fudged that it raises as many questions as it answers about the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. If business is waiting for certainty, it may be disappointed. The lure of the limelight You understand why Chris Kennedy, finance director of Micro Focus, might prefer to count numbers for a different employer. He joined the FTSE 100 software outfit only in January this year, which allowed just enough time to prepare the details on a huge profit warning in March that almost halved the share price. Micro Focus was instantly reclassified as a problem stock, as opposed to the go-go business that had shelled out \u00a36.6bn for a large chunk of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise\u2019s operations in 2017. Now Kennedy is off to ITV. Television probably offers more excitement than software ever will, and he will be reunited with Dame Carolyn McCall, his old boss from easyJet days. All the same, quitting after 10 months \u2013 or 12 by the time he\u2019s totted up the full-year numbers \u2013 is a bit quick, isn\u2019t it? Micro Focus would be entitled to be annoyed.",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets never threatened to get anyone\u2019s blood pressure soaring today. So after a subdued day, the FTSE 100 has closed 9 points higher at 7,103, a gain of 0.14%. The German DAX finished 24 points lower, a loss of 0.2%, at 11,494, while the French CAC closed almost exactly where it started. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB shed 0.5%, as Rome\u2019s clash with the EU over its budget worried traders. And that\u2019s all for today. GW Over in Brussels, eurozone finance minister are urging Italy to compromise in the row over its 2019 budget. My colleague Jennifer Rankin reports: Several eurozone finance ministers have come out to back Brussels in a row with Italy\u2019s populist government over a budget that has been deemed to break the rules of the common currency bloc. France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the future of the euro was at stake as he urged the Italian government to reach an agreement with the European commission. \u201cThe wise path is the path of dialogue, exchange of views, to find the best solution for the eurozone as a whole, for the Italian government and for our common currency,\u201d he said on Monday as he arrived at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. \u201cFor what is at stake now is our common currency.\u201d More here: Economist Rupert Seggins has pulled together a neat Twitter thread on today\u2019s UK data: Here\u2019s Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics on the strong US service sector growth: October\u2019s reading was above the consensus forecast of 59.3. The modest decline was driven mainly by the business activity index, which fell from 65.2 to 62.5, and the employment index which dropped from 62.4 to 59.7. That said, the latter remains at a strong level by past standards and goes some way to explaining the 250,000 surge in non-farm payrolls last month. Encouragingly, the new orders index held up relatively well. America\u2019s service sector has posted another month of strong growth. The monthly US Services PMI report, from the US Institute of Supply Management, came in at 60.3, indicating output rose sharply again. That\u2019s down from September\u2019s 61.6, but still much better than the UK\u2019s service sector (which only managed a PMI of 52.2). Energy company Chevron (+3.65%) is leading the Dow risers in New York, followed strong results last Friday. IBM are next in line, up 3.1%. Earlier today the tech firm reported that CEO Ginni Rometty recently bought $3m worth of the company\u2019s stock; a sign of confidence in its prospects? The US market has made a mixed start to trading. While the Dow gained 75 points (0.3%) at the open, the Nasdaq dippped by 0.3%, as Apple shed 2%. Global markets are on edge today as investors brace for tomorrow\u2019s Midterm US elections. With Donald Trump and Barack Obama both in full-on campaign mode, turnout is likely to be high. Pollsters are pretty confident that the Democrats will take back control of the House of Representatives, while the Republicans will hold onto the Senate. But politics has a habit of springing surprises.... What might it all mean for the markets? Well, a Democrat-controlled House could start fresh investigations into Trump, and block further tax cuts and the unpicking of Obama\u2019s legacy. Mark Appleton, global head of multi-asset strategy at Ashburton Investments, thinks this could weaken the dollar, and the US stock market (something Trump\u2019s critics would see as a small price to pay!). Appleton says: Should the Democrats make significant gains in the House of Representatives, there is a high possibility recent US dollar strength will abate. Democrats are not proponents of President Donald Trump\u2019s low-tax regime and would likely frustrate plans for further cuts and deregulation, which have been recent drivers of the strong economy and currency. While a weaker US dollar would provide much needed relief for emerging markets, US equities may encounter some headwinds. Some economists, of course, think this is the wrong moment to be giving the US economy a sugar rush anyway. A quick recap. Growth across Britain\u2019s service sector companies has hit a seven-month low. Firms say new orders are drying up, as Brexit uncertainty hits confidence. In another blow, UK car sales declined in October too. Diesel sales slumped again. China\u2019s private sector also stumbled in October, with growth hitting its weakest in over two years. Economists fear that the trade war with America is now biting. Eurozone investors are getting gloomier too. Confidence has fallen in November, for the third month in a row. A runaway train has forced mining giant BHP Billiton to suspend rail operation in Western Australia. Any readers have a bad day at work can take comfort - at least you haven\u2019t lost control of a massive train full of iron ore. That\u2019s what happened to one poor driver employed by mining giant BHP Billiton in Western Australia. All was well, until the driver apparently got out of the train to check one of its 268 wagons. Next moment, the train was chugging along again, without human supervision.... After 92 kilometres, the train was deliberately derailed. BHP has now suspended rail operations in the region while it works out what went wrong.... UK insurance group Hiscox have fallen to the bottom of the FTSE 250 this morning, following its latest financial results. Hiscox disappointed investors by predicting that growth will slow in the next few months, following a challenging year dominated by US hurricanes, typhoons in Japan, and higher UK subsidence claims following the dry summer. Hiscox also revealed that it has spent $15m setting up a new European subsidiary, so it is prepared for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. It says: Our preparations for Brexit are well advanced.... Our plans have always assumed a worst-case scenario \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 and we are prepared, irrespective of the outcome of the government\u2019s negotiations. Hiscox shares dropped by 6.9% this morning, to \u00a315.32. Here\u2019s our news story on the slowdown at Britain\u2019s service sector companies last month: European stock markets have shrugged off this morning\u2019s procession of bad news. The main indices remain flattish, while Italy\u2019s market is stuck in the red as the budget standoff between Rome and Brussels fizzles on. Overnight, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister insisted Rome\u2019s spending plans will become \u201ca recipe\u201d for reviving European growth, in a sign that Italy won\u2019t back down. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says investor sentiment has been shaken by those heavy losses in Asia overnight, and the slowdown in China\u2019s economy. The Caixin survey of Chinese service sector slipped to 50.8 \u2013 its lowest reading in one year. This adds weight to the argument that China\u2019s economy is cooling. Overnight, China\u2019s Xi Jinping talked about boosting global trade, and warned about the downside of protectionist policies, but the update failed to boost investor sentiment. The standoff between Italy and Brussels continues. The anti-establishment coalition in Rome are showing no signs of backing down regarding their plans to raise the budget deficit, and this is playing on investors mind\u2019s too. In another blow, eurozone investor confidence has fallen to a two-year low. Sentix, the German research group, reports that its eurozone investor morale index has dropped to just 8.8, from 11.4 in October. This is the third monthly decline in a row, and the lowest reading since November 2016. Manfred Huebner, managing director of Sentix, blames a range of factors. They include the US-China trade war, and the slowdown in car production as manufacturers scramble to meet new emissions tests. \u201cThe reasons for this development are manifold. There are external factors such as the U.S. president\u2019s trade policies as well as European issues. \u201cThe discussion about the future of the car industry in Germany, the weakness of the banking sector and the budget issue in Italy come to mind.\u201d Here\u2019s economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon on today\u2019s PMI report: Britain isn\u2019t the only economy which found October tough. Factories around the globe reported a slowdown in activity last month: Economists predict that the eurozone service-sector PMI (due tomorrow) will confirm that European firms struggled in October. The drop in UK service sector growth last month is \u201cthoroughly disappointing\u201d, says economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club. The slowdown in new business growth (to a 27-month low) \u201cbodes ill\u201d for future growth, Archer says, adding: Brexit uncertainties and concerns over the UK and global economies weighed on demand for business services. Additionally, demand for consumer services was reported to be subdued, which ties in with other signs that consumers reined in their spending at the start of the fourth quarter after splashing out over the summer Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange firm WorldFirst, says Brexit delays and wider fears over the global economic outlook are hurting UK service sector firms. He fears the situation will get worse, until the UK and EU reach an agreement. In another blow, business confidence across the services sector is its lowest since July 2016, today\u2019s PMI report shows. Firms are growing increasingly anxious about the risk of Brexit-related disruptions (predictions of long queues and delays at the ports if Britain leaves the EU without a deal) Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, blames the \u2018ambiguity\u2019 and lack of clarity around Brexit. \u201cA reluctance to commit was the message coming through loud and clear from service providers in October as the sector checked in with its worst performance since March and lowest optimism since July 2016. \u201cMany of the respondents attributed this poor performance and the biggest softening in new order growth since July 2016 to continuing ambiguity around the Brexit negotiations. There were also concerns over the weakness in the UK and global economies which affected client confidence and consumer spending. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says UK services companies are suffering badly from Brexit uncertainty. UK manufacturing growth hit a 25-month low in October (we learned last week), indicating the UK is only expanding sluggishly. Williamson explains: \u201cThe disappointing service sector numbers bring mounting evidence that Brexit worries are taking an increasing toll on the economy. Combined with the manufacturing and construction surveys, the October services PMI points to the economy growing at a quarterly rate of just 0.2%, setting the scene for GDP growth to weaken sharply in the fourth quarter. Brexit isn\u2019t the only problem, though... \u201ctrade wars, heightened geopolitical uncertainty and tightening financial market conditions\u201d are also weighing on the UK economy, Williamson adds. NEWSFLASH: Growth across Britain\u2019s service sector has slowed to a seven-month low. Service sector companies have reported that new business growth weakened in October, as nervous clients have cut back, according to data firm Markit. Consumer-facing sectors such as hotels, restaurants and leisure reported the weakest performance. A number of companies also cited Brexit-related uncertainties, and worries that the global economic outlook is deteriorating. Markit\u2019s Services PMI, which measures activity in the sector, fell to 52.2 in October from 53.9 in September -- the lowest reading since March. More to follow! Newsflash: British car sales have fallen again. Just 153,599 vehicles were registered in October, down 2.9% compared with a year earlier, according to figures released today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). That follows a 20% plunge in October. The SMMT says sales were hit by new, tougher, pollution rules introduced in Europe this summer. This has led to shortages of some models, as testing centres are fighting their way through a backlog of vehicles needing certification. Drivers continue to shun diesel, with sales down 21.3% year-on-year. Petrol sales rose 7%, while alternatively fuelled cars (electric) jumped by 30.7%. The big picture, though, is that UK car sales are 7% lower this year than in 2017. The pound has hit a two-week high against the US dollar, as the Brexit talks approach a climax. Britain is hoping to make progress on the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland Backstop this week, so that an emergency summit could be called before the end of November. Yesterday the Sunday Times claimed that PM Theresa May has a \u201csecret plan\u201d to keep the whole of Britain in a customs union, avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. But EU sources have told the Guardian that the two sides are still divided on crucial issues, meaning there\u2019s only a \u201c50-50\u201d chance of an agreement. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is also weighing in, calling May\u2019s proposals \u201can absolute stinker\u201d. He predicts MPs would vote them down, rather than agree to abide by EU rules during a post-Brexit transition period. City traders seem slightly more optimistic, though, sending the pound up by 0.25% to $1.30 against the US dollar, and \u20ac1.142 against the euro. European stock markets have started the new week in a subdued mood. The FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC are all basically unchanged this morning. Spain\u2019s IBEX has risen by 0.35%, but Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has dipped a little. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Further evidence that China\u2019s economy is starting to wilt under the trade war pressure \u2013 the country\u2019s latest private sector-assessing Caixin PMI dropped to a 28 month low following a services sector slump \u2013 led to a pretty muted open in Europe this Monday. Over in Shanghai, President Xi has vowed that America cannot sink China\u2019s economy. The Chinese president told a major trade fair that the days of \u201cwinner takes all\u201d trade policy is at an end - a non-too-subtle jab at Trump\u2019s approach to negotiations. Xi also pledged to keep opening up his country\u2019s economy, painting himself as a defender of globalisation. My colleague Lily Kuo reports: Xi Jinping has promised to lower import tariffs and improve access to the Chinese market in remarks meant to portray his country as a champion of globalisation as it remains locked in a trade war with the US. \u201cProtectionism and unilateralism is rising. Multilateralism and the free trade system are under threat \u2026 China will not close its door to the world and will only become more and more open\u201d, the Chinese president said on Monday at the beginning of a trade fair in Shanghai. The speech, ahead of a meeting between Xi and US president Donald Trump at the end of the month on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Argentina, signalled little improvement in trade ties before that meeting. Xi claimed China had entered a \u201cnew round of high-level opening up\u201d but did not make any concrete concessions likely to satisfy the White House. The Chinese leader reiterated a pledge to enforce intellectual property rights, as well as open up the country\u2019s educational, cultural and telecommunications sectors, something officials have been promising for years, with little action taken. Anxiety over the US-China trade war ripped though Asian stock markets again today. China\u2019s CSI 300 index fell by 0.8%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei shed 1.5%, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng has slumped by 2.3% in late trading. Traders are concerned by the slowdown in China\u2019s economy, and the lack of progress between Beijing and Washington over the trade war. Over the weekend, president Trump told reporters that the two sides are \u201cgetting much closer to doing something.\u201d A breakthrough could come at this month\u2019s G20 meeting, but nothing\u2019s guaranteed. The tumble in China\u2019s services PMI suggests that the escalating trade war with the US is taking \u201ca massive bite out of the economy\u201d, says Stephen Innes of foreign exchange firm OANDA. Here\u2019s more reaction: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears over China\u2019s economy are swirling today, as growth in the country\u2019s service sector stumbles. New figures from data provider Caixin shows that growth across China\u2019s services companies fell to a 13-month low last month, as new orders dried up. Service companies reported that new business had stagnated for the first time in almost a decade, with many saying that demand was weak this quarter. This dragged the Caixin China General Services Business Activity Index (which measures growth) down to just 50.8 in October, sharply down from 53.1 in September. That\u2019s the lowest reading since September 2017, and worryingly close to stagnation. Chinese manufacturers also had a sticky October, with costs jumping sharply thanks to the tariffs imposed on US imports. Caixin says: The slowdown was broad-based by sector, with both services and manufacturing noting weaker performances compared to the previous month. Notably, manufacturing production stagnated, following increases in each of the preceding 27 months. This dragged Caixin\u2019s wider measure of Chinese private sector growth down to a 28-month low of 50.5, from 52.1 in September. Here are the key points from the report: Services activity growth weakens to 13-month low, while manufacturing production is broadly unchanged Total new orders edge closer to stagnation Increase in service sector staff numbers largely offsets fall in manufacturing employment Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, warned that Chinese companies are losing confidence, in the face of the trade war triggered by Donald Trump. \u201cThe Caixin China Composite Output Index dipped to 50.5 in October from the previous month, reaching its lowest level since June 2016, indicating mounting downward pressure on China\u2019s economy. The subindex for new orders fell, pointing to softening overall demand conditions. The employment subindex edged up despite staying in negative territory, which could possibly be due to government efforts to stabilize the labor market. The subindex for input costs remained unchanged from the month before, while the one for output charges inched up, indicating easing pressure on company profit margins \u2014 though upward price pressure remained. The subindex for future output edged down, reflecting weakening confidence among companies.\u201d Later today we discover if Britain\u2019s service sector did any better. The UK services PMI is expected to drop to 53.3, from 53.9 in September, foll The agenda: 9am GMT: UK new car sales for October 9.30am GMT: UK service sector PMI for October 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix survey of investor confidence 3pm GMT: US service sector PMI for October",

Italy will never kneel again,\u201d Italy\u2019s powerful interior minister Matteo Salvini has said. Italian deputy prime minister Luigi di Maio told the Financial Times the rest of Europe should copy Italy\u2019s expansionary public spending plans. \u201cIf the recipe works here, it will be said at a European level, we should apply the recipe of Italy to all other countries.\u201d The commission rejected Italy\u2019s draft 2019 budget last month \u2013 although other member states, including France and Germany, have broken the rules in the past without sanction.

      "bodyText": "Lawyers acting for a passenger who was racially abused on a Ryanair flight have demanded an apology and compensation from the airline, describing its response as \u201cwoeful\u201d. The lawyers said that at no time did the airline check on the wellbeing of Delsie Gayle, 77, and that Ryanair\u2019s first contact was on 2 November, 14 days after the incident, when a letter dated 21 October arrived from Ireland. A passenger seated alongside Gayle on the flight from Barcelona, David Mesher, was filmed subjecting her to racist abuse, including calling her an \u201cugly black bastard\u201d. However, crewmembers made Gayle, who suffers from arthritis and has a replacement knee, twice move seat, rather than remove Mesher from the flight. Gayle had been on holiday with her daughter Carol, a year after the death of her husband, when the incident occurred before take-off in Barcelona. In a letter to Ryanair, law firm Leigh Day says that at no point did any member of the cabin crew check her wellbeing, and met her eventual complaints with \u201cdisinterest and obstructiveness\u201d. They also say that the media were shown the \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d letter from Ryanair to Gayle long before she received it. As well as calling for an apology and compensation, the lawyers demand to know what steps Ryanair is taking, including crew training, to minimise the risk of similar future incidents. Gayle said: \u201cI felt really frightened. He should have been taken off the plane, and yet I was the one who was asked to move. Ryanair\u2019s disrespect and lack of any interest at all in my wellbeing makes me feel even worse.\u201d Richard Meeran, of Leigh Day, said: \u201cRyanair\u2019s response to the vile racist abuse Mrs Gayle was subjected to has been woeful. Ryanair needs to take this issue seriously. It should apologise properly to Mrs Gayle and compensate her for the distress it has caused her. \u201cIt should take responsibility for the crude mishandling of the incident and explain what action it has taken \u2026 and what steps it is taking to minimise the risk of future abuse of its passengers.\u201d Ryanair has yet to respond to the latest legal claims, but has previously said it only became aware of the incident via footage on social media shot by a fellow passenger, and issued an apology. \u201cWe believe that by reporting this matter immediately to the Essex police and by apologising in writing to this customer early on Sunday morning, Ryanair treated it with the urgency and seriousness it warranted.\u201d The airline contacted police on 21 October. It said cabin crew on the flight had asked Gayle if she was OK, moved her at her own request, and had not been aware of the racist abuse by Mesher.",

    "webTitle": "UK services growth hits seven-month low amid Brexit uncertainty", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The risk of a disorderly Brexit and growing signs of weakness in the world economy are combining to drag several UK business sectors close to stalling point in the final months of the year. Suggesting that the period of relatively robust economic growth over the hot summer months has begun to cool, the latest surveys of business activity for October revealed a marked slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018. The UK\u2019s services sector, the largest contributor to economic growth, which includes hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, expanded at the slowest pace since March according to the latest snapshot report published on Monday from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips). It said Brexit-related uncertainty and concerns about the global economic outlook had constrained growth, while it also recorded the weakest upturn in services firms taking on new work since straight after the EU referendum in 2016. The monthly IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index, which is closely watched by the Bank of England and the Treasury, dropped to 52.2 last month from 53.9 in September, its weakest for seven months on a scale where a reading above 50 signals economic growth. Economists forecast that GDP growth will slow to 0.2% in the final quarter of the year from about 0.6% in the third quarter, handing Theresa May disappointing news as she attempts to negotiate a withdrawal agreement from the EU. Consumer-facing sectors such as hotels, restaurants and leisure reported the weakest performance in October, after recording more robust activity during the summer months, when warm weather and the World Cup encouraged an upturn in consumer spending. Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said: \u201cMany of the respondents attributed this poor performance and the biggest softening in new order growth since July 2016 to continuing ambiguity around the Brexit negotiations.\u201d New car sales suffered another disappointing month in October, as the number of vehicle registrations dropped for the seventh consecutive month, falling by 2.9% year on year to stand at 153,599 units. Fuelled by a 21% drop in diesel registrations, the figures come after car sales plunged by a fifth in September, which is usually a bumper month for the motor trade. Waning appetite for diesel cars amid changes to government policy, as well as weak consumer confidence, weighed on demand. The slowdown in the services industry last month followed disappointing news from the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a tenth of GDP. Britain\u2019s factories recorded a sharp slowdown in output in October, as new orders declined for first time since mid-2016. Chris Sood-Nicholls, the head of global services at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cWith autumn upon us, consumers are tightening their belts. And with the prospect of any greater certainty seemingly as distant as ever, businesses across the disparate services sector are struggling to maintain their confident outlook.\u201d While business activity in Britain is struggling under the uncertainty posed by Brexit, the global economy has also begun slowing amid the US trade dispute with China and Europe. With Italy engaged in a standoff with the EU over its budget, economic growth in the eurozone dropped to 0.2% in the third quarter, the lowest level for four years. However, the UK economy is still proving to be more resilient than many economists had predicted ahead of the EU referendum, despite the slowdown. Data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the accountancy firm KPMG found that growth in high street sales picked up to an annual rate of 1.3% in October, against an increase of 0.2% in the same month a year ago. Data from Barclaycard, which accounts for nearly half of the UK\u2019s credit and debit card sales, found that ticket sales rose by 22.1% compared with the same month a year ago, influenced by the sale of Glastonbury tickets for 2019, after the music festival was not held in 2018.",

It is the latest high street retailer to go bust after Evans Cycles, House of Fraser, Toys R Us and Maplin, while a string of other well-known names have shut dozens of stores via an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement. Crawshaw, which was founded in 1954, said it appointed Ernst &amp; Young as administrators on Friday. It shut 35 stores and its distribution centre at Astley, with the loss of 354 jobs. The remaining 19 stores and Crawshaw\u2019s other distribution centre at Hellaby remain open and continue to employ 261 people. The firm is continuing its trial of three butcher\u2019s counters in Spar stores. The administrators have put the business and assets up for sale and have begun talks with interested parties \u201cwith a view to agreeing a sale over the coming weeks\u201d. Crawshaw was forced into administration after several years of losses and the failure to raise more money from shareholders to fund a revamp of the business. Along with other high street retailers, Crawshaw has been hit by rising rents, higher business rates and fragile consumer confidence in the run-up to Brexit. It has also been under pressure from the rise of the discount supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl, which have forced other supermarkets and Crawshaw to cut prices. The company has 42 high street shops and 12 factory outlets across the Midlands and north of England. Of the 19 stores that are still trading, nine are factory stores. Its new chief executive Jim Viggars, who took over in May, had plans to open more of those larger out-of-town shops, with parking, that sell big packs of fresh meat. They are cheaper to open and fit out, and have performed better than the smaller high street stores, which also sell hot food such as whole cooked chickens, pies and filled baguettes. Ranjit Singh Boparan, the entrepreneur known as the \u201cchicken king\u201d, is Crawshaw\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 29.7% stake in the business and is an adviser to the board.

      "bodyText": "Pioneering fair trade retailer Traidcraft, which had warned it was facing closure, has launched a turnaround plan that involves targeting younger ethical consumers. The faith-based group has traditionally relied on thousands of volunteers selling its coffee and tea at church hall stalls and school fairs. But in September the company warned it would cease trading unless it could come up with a profitable model after poor sales were compounded by the Brexit shock to the pound. Traidcraft chief executive Robin Roth said the organisation had drawn up a rescue plan after it received an avalanche of support in its darkest hour: \u201cI was very worried when I put the call out but we received hundreds of emails and it encouraged me not to give up.\u201d The Gateshead-based company, which turns 40next year, is shedding 80% of its 67 staff and outsourcing its warehouse. In the new year it will relaunch with a paid-for membership scheme that will entitle shoppers to a discount. It is also slashing its product range to focus on popular food stuffs such as coffee, tea, sugar and rice rather than handicrafts. Traidcraft had been struggling before Brexit as declining church attendance was compounded by the impact of austerity cuts on living standards. Sales had dropped from \u00a316.5m in 2010 to less than \u00a310m in the year to March when it recordeda loss of about \u00a3500,000. Over the past five years it has shed more than 1,000 of the volunteers who ran the weekend stalls, leaving it with around 4,300, many of whom are elderly. These stallholders generate half its sales. \u201cWe are the sort of business that pays up front,\u201d said Roth. \u201cSo when the pound fell after the Brexit referendum, we took a hit. We also stand by our published prices, so unlike other retailers we stood by our customers, absorbed a lot of the additional cost, and kept price rises to a minimum.\u201d In the 1980s and 90s Traidcraft helped bring fair trade products to the mainstream but Roth said it had gradually been \u201csidelined\u201d as the major supermarkets moved in to what is now a \u00a31.6bn market in the UK. To regain the upper hand it would now aim to set a more radical agenda by breaking down the price of its products to \u201cmake transparent the costs, prices and profits involved in every product it sells\u201d, Roth said. \u201cWe want to tell consumers who gets what from the Traidcraft products they buy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will push the boundaries of what people understand fair trade to be. We can\u2019t let supermarkets define that for us. We should be leading and they should be following. We will cause good trouble, just as those six fair trade pioneers who started Traidcraft did back in 1979.\u201d The organisation\u2019s future plans include tapping into new food trends such as the zero-waste shoppers who want to buy cooperatively and in bulk to avoid excess packaging. \u201cWhen new markets are searching for goods that are ethical, vegan and organic as well as fair trade, we need to be there,\u201d said Roth. \u201cWe need to address a younger audience. It\u2019s not enough to be church-based.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A United Nations special investigator is launching a two-week inquiry into rising levels of poverty and hardship across the UK, saying he hopes the government is ready for proper dialogue over the human consequences of austerity cuts. Philip Alston, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, is to embark on a tour of some of the UK\u2019s poorest town and cities on Monday, visiting food banks and community groups and meeting MPs, government officials, academics and families in hardship. Alston, who has a reputation as a fearless, plain-speaking critic, will gather evidence on the impact of universal credit, welfare changes, local government cuts, and rising living costs before publishing an interim report on his findings before he leaves the UK in mid-November. \u201cI think the UK is at a crossroads, partly because of Brexit, and partly because of the comments made by the prime minister and the chancellor in terms of austerity [being over],\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope is that there is a real possibility for a dialogue about future policy direction.\u201d He is scheduled to visit Glasgow, Barking, Oxford, Belfast, Newham in east London, Newcastle upon Tyne and Cardiff. He will also travel to Jaywick Sands in Essex, the UK\u2019s most deprived neighbourhood, which last week was used in an political advert for the Republican party in the US midterm elections as an example of extreme social decay. His inquiry will assess whether government policies introduced in recent years breach international human rights standards to which the UK is a signatory, including the rights to food, housing and decent living standards. He will also try to assess the impact of Brexit on poverty. \u201cThe United Kingdom is one of the richest countries in the world, but millions of people are still living in poverty there,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said it was \u201ccommitted to upholding the rule of law and rules-based international systems\u201d. It insisted that on an absolute measure of poverty a million fewer people and children were living in hardship compared with 2010. Alston has received nearly 300 submissions from charities, poverty experts and individuals living on the breadline \u2013 a record for a UN poverty audit \u2013 and said they \u201cmake clear many people are really struggling to make ends meet\u201d. The visit comes at a time of rising political concern about the effects of years of public spending cuts. Last month Theresa May pledged to end a decade of austerity, in part a response to increasing public disquiet over the rollout of universal credit, rising homelessness and destitution, and relentless cuts to social care, council services, schools, police and prisons. Alston said it was important to track the human rights consequences of the UK government\u2019s economic decisions. \u201cPolicies of austerity are commonly executed only in response to requirements by the International Monetary Fund or an external source,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been adopted by governments as a concerted and deliberate economic policy.\u201d Ministers will be braced for criticism from Alston, although his recommendations are not binding. His presence in the UK is likely to provoke outrage from right-wing media and politicians. Five years ago criticisms of the bedroom tax after a visit by the UN\u2019s then housing rights envoy, Raquel Rolnik, were aggressively dismissed by ministers as a \u201cmisleading Marxist diatribe\u201d. Alston sparked a furious reaction from Donald Trump\u2019s administration earlier this year when he published a withering inquiry report accusing the US president of pursuing policies that deliberately forced millions of Americans into financial ruin while lavishing vast riches on the super-wealthy. He described policies introduced or proposed by Trump \u2013 including cuts to food stamps, social housing subsidies, and healthcare \u2013 as \u201ca systematic attack on America\u2019s welfare program that is undermining the social safety net for those who can\u2019t cope on their own\u201d. The UK government formally accepted Alston\u2019s request for an official visit in December 2017, but it is not yet clear which \u2013 if any \u2013 UK government minister he will meet. He is scheduled to meet Welsh and Scottish ministers in Cardiff and Edinburgh. Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said Alston\u2019s tour would reveal an affluent country with a growing child poverty crisis. \u201cIt is important to shine a light on child poverty in the UK and there is plenty of evidence to keep him busy during his stay,\u201d she said. However, the number of people in relative poverty, which defines people as in poverty if their household income falls below 60% of the UK median, were about the same in 2016-17 as the year before \u2013 at 10.4 million, according to the House of Commons library. Child poverty was at a 13-year low in 2010 but has subsequently increased. More than 4 million children currently live below the breadline, a number that could rise to 5.2 million by 2021, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Food banks and an increase in rough sleeping on the streets of Britain have made rising destitution more visible. Destitution is extreme poverty defined as a regular lack of food, adequate clothing and shelter. About 1.5 million people, including 350,000 children, experienced destitution in 2017, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.",
