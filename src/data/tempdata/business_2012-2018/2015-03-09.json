    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And that, I think, is that for this evening. A quick recap. Technical teams will start to consider Greece\u2019s reform plans on Wednesday, after eurozone ministers lost patience with the slow progress since its bailout extension was agreed in February. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned that the last two weeks have been \u201ca complete waste of time\u201d, as he declared that work begins in Brussels the day after tomorrow. Some officials will also be working to Athens, despite Greek efforts to stop its creditors sending inspectors back to the country. Dijsselblom told a news conference that: We agreed today that there is no further time to lose. Discussions between the Greek government and the institutions will start on Wednesday in Brussels... in parallel, technical teams from the institutions will be welcomed in Athens. Dijsselbloem was speaking after a surprisingly quick eurogroup meeting today, in which Greece was urged to press on with its reform programme. Here are some photos from the event. Greece will not receive any aid money will not be released until there is a firm plan, and signs that it is being implemented, added Dijssselbloem. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has just told reporters that the meeting went well; he\u2019s very pleased that technical talks over reforms would begin on Wednesday. He denied that Greece had frittered away valuable time. \u201cThere has been no time wasted, not by the Greek government....We were very speedy.\u201d Varoufakis also insisted that the Troika\u2019s grip on Greece was broken for ever. \u201cThe idea of troika visits, comprising cabals of technocrats from the three institutions in lockstep walking into our ministries and trying to implement a programme which has failed ... that is a thing of the past\u201d (I\u2019ve taken the quotes from Reuters) Varoufakis also heavily criticised some in the media, over reports that he\u2019d threatened a Greek referendum if creditors don\u2019t accept his plans. Pure press misinformation, he declared. The Athens government has also said that today\u2019s meeting was a success, and hinted that more reforms are coming. It is also fuming that several eurozone ministers, including Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble, insisted on calling its creditors \u2018the troika\u2019, not \u2018the institutions\u2019. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Goodnight and thanks (as ever) GW I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t really catch the last question, but I think it was whether Varoufakis had held discussions with his Portuguese counterpart. Varoufakis insisted he had not; the pair were on opposite side of the eurogroup table. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference Just to clarify... when asked about Greece\u2019s cash position (twice), Yanis Varoufakis replied that the liquidity position of Greece will be guaranteed by the Greek government in conjunction with its international lenders. Mario Draghi doesn\u2019t need any advice from me.... our job is to start the work to create the confidence that the ECB wants to see. Every party will do what\u2019s necessary to make this deal work, Varoufakis adds. We are all very excited that we will start technical discussions in Brussels on Wednesday, Varoufakis says. A second question on Greece\u2019s funding position: Varoufakis also denies that Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister will take the lead in negotiations with its creditors. That\u2019s another example of poor reporting by the media, he says. Hang on, though, Yanis -- that story came from the lips of Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan! (see earlier post) Well, who told him, asks an unabashed Varoufakis, suggesting Noonan was another victim of media inaccuracy. Whichever editor wrote the headline in Corriere della Sera should consider apologising, declares Varoufakis, returning to that referendum story. The webfeed just crashed briefly during a question about Greece\u2019s reform plans...but fortunately Kathimerini is on the case: Varoufakis declines to answer a question about whether Greece is running short of cash. Yanis Varoufakis is now laying into the media, for reporting that he had claimed Greece could hold a referendum if its creditors rejected its reform measures. This is a reference to Sunday\u2019s interview with Italy\u2019s Corriere della Sera. I was only responding to a hypothetical question, he insists, blaming \u201cpoor journalistic standards\u201d for flamming up the story and claiming (wrongly) he was threatening that Greece\u2019s eurozone membership was on the line. I am aghast about the amount of effort some journalists put into this misinformation, he adds darkly. Some have sunk into \u201cpure depths of journalistic depravity\u201d. Some instant reaction: Another reporter reminds Varoufakis that eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem was adamant that the last two weeks have been a complete waste of time. The fact that Dijsselbloem and I can disagree about this is part of Europe\u2019s magic, he replies. What about the return of Troika officials to Athens, as Jeroen Dijsselbloem announced today? Varoufakis is adamant that the Troika is dead. The days of officials from the three institutions (IMF, EU, ECB) \u201cmarching in lockstep\u201d, imposing measures on Greece, are over. But yes, officials from the institutions will be welcomed to Athens to help with its reform plans. Varoufakis says there has been a \u2018serious misunderstanding\u2019 by some members of the press. The list of seven reforms he sent to Brussels last week was never means to be a comprehensive list, as some reporters claimed. It was just a starting point. Next we will have another batch of seven or eight reforms, he adds. Varoufakis denies that the Greek government has frittered time away. No time has been wasted, he says. Onto questions, and Yanis Varoufakis is asked whether he minds that several eurozone finance ministers insist on referring to \u2018the Troika\u2019 (rather than \u2018the institutions\u2019). Smiling, Varoufakis says he is fairly relaxed that some ministers, perhaps through inertia, insist on using that old term. If they miss the Troika so much we can sent it to them, but we are not having it again, he declares. The press conference is being streamed here, by the way. I am pleased that we can announce that, starting on Wednesday, our team will start work with officials from the institutions in Brussels, Varoufakis adds. Here comes Yanis Varoufakis.... He looks fairly cheerful. Today\u2019s meeting was an important step forwards in implementing the agreement of 20 February, he says. It will also helps us consider the plan for beyond June (when the four-month extension expires). Heads up: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is about to give a press conference about the eurogroup meeting. Back in Brussels, France\u2019s finance minister Michel Sapin is telling a press conference that it\u2019s important to stop mentioning \u2018the troika\u2019. Maybe he heard the anguished cries from Athens earlier..... You have to admire the Greek government\u2019s timing. Just as eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselboem was lamenting the \u201cwaste of time\u201d Greece\u2019s international creditors have witnessed in recent weeks, the Athens government was releasing a statement called: \u201cERT (the state TV channel) is returning. Sacked employees will return to work.\u201d That\u2019s because the Tsipras government has presented legislation to parliament reinstating the state-run organisation shut down overnight by the previous government in June 2013, Helena Smith explains. That means the government has met one of its pre-election pledges, but doesn\u2019t get Greece any closer to a deal with its creditors. Video clips of this evening\u2019s Eurogroup press conference are already online here. Eurozone finance ministers are now flooding out of the eurogroup meeting: The last question goes to Peter Spiegel of the Financial Times, who hits the bullseye by asking a technical question about \u20ac500m that was returned to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) last month (as part of a larger transfer of funds). Is it correct that this money is actually fees paid by Greek banks, and not bonds which the EFSF is entitled to have reclaimed? Should it be returned? Klaus Regling of the EFSF says that his officials have taken legal advice, and yes, this money relates to activities in 2010, before the first Greek bailout. So \u201cwe will certainly not have any claim on that amount\u201d, he adds. Good news for Greece, I think! Next question goes to Jeroen Dijsselbloem: Did you discuss your plan to run for a second term as eurogroup president with other ministers, such as Spain\u2019s Luis De Guindos (rumoured to be planning his own bid)? Dijsselbloem replies that his term runs until the summer, so it\u2019s too early for a candidacy. He was simply asked in an interview if he\u2019d like to be president of the eurogroup again, and he answered that he would. And no, he didn\u2019t discuss it with anyone else. Mario Draghi was very clear about the important of Europe\u2019s growth and stability pact at today\u2019s meeting, Dijsselbloem says. Should Greece be allowed to issue more short-term debt to get around its funding squeeze? That\u2019s up to the ECB, not me, Dijsselbloem ducks with aplomb. Dijsselbloem reiterates that constructive talks must start now: Onto questions.... What discussions took place with Greece over its reforms? Jeroem Dijsselbloem confirms that the Greece government outlined some reforms in its letter last week, but that they weren\u2019t the full proposals. It is important that we reach an agreement about the whole package....about what we expect the Greek government to deliver over the next four months. he adds. We also need to see signs that reforms are being implemented. Dijsselbloem says he\u2019s be open to handing over Greece\u2019s final aid payment in instalments, if there are signs of process. But: There can be no talk about early disbursement if there is no agreement and no implementation. And he then lets rip over the lack of progress with Greece: We have spent the last two weeks discussing who will meet who, where, and in what configuration. It\u2019s been a complete waste of time... And that\u2019s why technical talks will start on Wednesday, Dijsselbloem concludes. Mainly in Brussels, but some people will have to be on the ground in Athens - simply for efficiency reasons, to enable a constant exchange of information between Athens and Brussels. Moscovici, the former French finance minister, embarks on a lengthy explanation about the importance of sticking to Europe\u2019s deficit rules.... Commissioner Pierre Moscovici now has the microphone, and says that Cyprus must implement a foreclosure law to help banks act on bad debts. It would be a great pity of Cyprus\u2019s impressive progress over the last two years were slowed, Moscovici said. Cyprus MPs have been refusing to approve the foreclosure law for several weeks, knocking its bailout plan off track. Dijsselbloem adds that Greece has committed not to take unilateral actions, and not to roll back on reforms that have already been adopted. \u201cToday we had a short discussion on Greece,\u201d says Jeroen Dijsselbloem, on the process that should have started after our meeting two weeks ago. We agreed there is no further time to lose. Technical talks will start on Wednesday, he confirms. \u201cTechnical teams will be welcomed in Athens\u201d, Dijsselbloem adds, to support this process. So, despite what Greek officials have been saying tonight (see earlier), officials from Greece\u2019s creditors will be working in the country\u2019s capital. Austria and France need to make more progress to meet the Europe\u2019s growth and stability pact, Dijsselbloem says. Particularly France, which has already been given a two-month extension to get in line. Other countries have made encouraging progress, though. Dijsselbloem starts by pointing out that fewer journalists have turned up than usual. Maybe they\u2019re at another press conference, he jokes. (Is Yanis Varoufakis talking somewhere?!.....) Today\u2019s meeting tied up some loose ends from earlier meetings, looked at the Greek financial programme, and also considered the eurozone services industry, he says. The press conference is starting now. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, and Klaus Regling, CEO of the European Financial Stability Facility, are here to entertain us. OK, the eurogroup press conference is about to start. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Greek officials are not hiding their frustration at the reappearance of the dreaded word \u201cTroika\u201d in statements made by several euro zone finance ministers today, reports Helena Smith. The German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, no less, used it four or five times - in what some are calling a deliberate act of spite. One insider snapped: \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he just say institutions? We agreed on February 20th that there was no more Troika.\u201d The Spanish finance minister, Luis de Guindos, who appears to be taking delicious delight in ramming home the message that Greece is heading, inexorably, towards a third international bailout programme (even if it will almost certainly not be called that) also spoke of the troika. Athens\u2019 Syriza-led government sees it as a huge victory that it has relegated the deeply unpopular triumvirate of creditors to the dustbin of history. Speaking today European Commission spokesperson Margaritis Schinas, who is Greek himself, said negotiations between Greek authorities and technical teams, aimed at fleshing out reforms would take place in Brussels at the request of EU president Jean-Claude Juncker. But he added that some discussions will also have to take place \u201cin situ in Athens.\u201d An embarrassed Greek government appears unwilling to accept this. \u201cAll the discussions will be taking place in Brussels,\u201d said one. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel tweeted about this earlier: The Eurogroup meeting is over! Is that a record? It\u2019s certainly the quickest meeting in recent weeks. And there will be a press conference in just 15 minutes time... The Greek government has just released a statement describing today\u2019s euro group as a \u201csuccess\u201d, because four key points were agreed. Helena Smith, Athens correspondent, has the details: It launches the process by which the decision taken at the 20th February euro group will be enforced which is a positive step in that it marks a relaxation of the stance by the ECB towards Greece. Despite the misinformation of recent days the Greek proposals were accepted politically by the euro group. On Wednesday discussions between Greece and technical teams will begin but they will take place exclusively in Brussels and not in Athens. We remind you that the troika is a mechanism that belongs decisively to the past The institutions showed a willingness to resolve the financing problem with immediate effect. A senior official in the Greek government adds that: \u201cThe Greek government will continue enriching the list of reforms with additional proposals that it will elaborate on. \u201cThe reforms will be part of a National Plan for Reconstruction and Growth.\u201d Greek insiders are also confirming that technical talks will start on Wednesday, in Brussels... The Greek government is roundly denying that anyone other than finance minister Yanis Varoufakis will lead negotiations with its creditors (as was rumoured earlier), Athens correspondent Helena Smith writes. And Panos Kammenos, who heads the left-led coalition\u2019s junior partner, the Independent Greeks party, has tried to put on a brave face on the eurogroup meeting.. He emerged from holding talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras to tell reporters that: \u201cWe have good news from Brussels...The finance minister communicated with the prime minister and told him that the agreement of February 20th is being upheld.\u201d So no sign of it being a flop in Athens. As they say one man\u2019s defeat is another man\u2019s victory! Greek journalist Efi Efthimiou of CapitalGR confirms this: Another photo from inside the eurogroup; it\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis speaking with Greek delegation members before the meeting began. Another newsflash from Brussels -- technical talks between Greece and its creditors will begin on Wednesday: Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 story, confirming that eurozone ministers have already finished discussing Greece at today\u2019s meeting (which only started around 90 minutes ago). Euro zone finance ministers concluded their discussions on Greece on Monday and have said progress must be made now, an EU official said, adding that the ministers would not publish a joint statement on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d the official said of the Eurogroup discussions on Greece. Ministers said \u201cwe must move forward now,\u201d the official said. A Greek official confirmed the discussion was over. That was quick! The Greek section of today\u2019s eurogroup meeting is over, according to Reuters: EUROGROUP DISCUSSION ON GREECE OVER, MINISTERS SAID IT IS TIME NOW TO MAKE PROGRESS - EU OFFICIAL THERE WILL BE NO JOINT EUROGROUP STATEMENT ON GREECE - EU OFFICIAL- EU OFFICIAL That rather suggests that Greece has been given a clear message to crack on with its reform programme and not waste any more time (as Dijsselbloem put it earlier). Some pictures from the eurogroup meeting have just arrived, showing ministers chatting - and in some cases even hugging - before getting down to work. Greece may have got the message. A government official in Brussels has said that Athens is ready to submit more reform proposals for technical discussion. There are also reports that three new measures are ready, designed to improve tax collection and fight evasion: Eurocrisis expert Yannis Koutsomis has the details: Taxpayers to be able to submit additional declarations for previous years without penalties A bill to probe big corporations\u2019 tax avoidance through intra-EU schemes Incentives for taxpayers to collect receipts; lotteries for receipts. The third idea has worked in other countries such as Slovakia, where customers can collect VAT receipts and enter them for a prize draw. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister (or at least his media team) has tweeted that Greece face the \u201cnaked truth\u201d over its bailout programme, and start technical talks with its creditors. OK, all the eurozone ministers have arrived for this afternoon\u2019s eurogroup. The running theme as they arrived was that Greece needs to hurry up and deliver firm reforms, so this could be a testy meeting... Back in Athens... government insiders are denying that the deputy prime minister will take the lead in negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors, as Ireland\u2019s finance minister said a few minute ago. Greece\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis has arrived at the meeting, but I haven\u2019t seen any quotes from him: Maybe he\u2019s heeding Alexis Tsipras\u2019s call for less talk and more action... Spanish finance chief Luis de Guindos has echoed Wolfgang Schauble\u2019s use of the T-Word. He told reporters outside the eurogroup meeting that ministers must listen to Yanis Varoufakos, then to the Troika, than start working. It\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re doing it deliberately... Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has also urged Greece to produce firm proposals: Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned several times that Greece must stop wasting time and start delivering , as he arrived at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Here\u2019s a video clip (he starts speaking English around 5 minute in). Here\u2019s the key quotes. Q: Is there a risk that Greece can go bankrupt? Dijsselbloem: We have said that we will support Greece further if they continue on the reform path. And I think that the talks about the programme and the reforms that are needed should restart very very quickly. We\u2019re losing too much time. Dijsselbloem then warned that discussions about Grexit are not very helpful; he\u2019s very much against it, and so are the Greeks. Q: How can Greece finance themself? Dijsselbloem: That is up to the Greeks to secure... we stand ready to support them on the basis of further progress in the programme. We seem to be losing time now - since the last eurogroup little has been done in terms of future talks, in terms of implementation. The key issue now is not to waste any more time. Q: What do you think about the letter sent by Greece last week [see earlier post for details]? Dijsselbloem: It was a welcome contribution to the process....I have sent it onto the institutions. It can be part of the talks between the institutions and the Greek government which have to start very, very soon. We have lost over two weeks in which very little progress has been made. The real talks haven\u2019t started yet, there has been no implementation. So we have to stop wasting time and really start the talks now, seriously. Q: What kind of concrete measures do you expect from the Greek? Dijsselbloem: I won\u2019t go into the whole list and the reform programme. My key message is the talks have to start, rather today than tomorrow, and we shouldn\u2019t waste so much time. The extension is only for four months, and the time is ticking away... Malta\u2019s finance minister, Edward Scicluna, told reporters that the Greek reform programme \u201cneeds a lot of work\u201d as he arrives at the eurogroup meeting. Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, has told reporters that Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis will lead negotiations with its creditors, rather than finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Dragasakis has been present at earlier eurogroup meetings, and also chairs the government\u2019s economic council, so he\u2019s already heavily involved. Interesting that Noonan pointed this out, though..... Did the eurogroup not get the message that Greece is no longer under the control of the Troika? It\u2019s The Institutions, now, Wolfgang, don\u2019t forget! Here comes Wolfgang Schauble.... More quotes from Jeroen Dijsselbloem, urging Greece to up its game. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned that Greece must stop wasting time and develop its reform package, as he arrives at the eurogroup meeting in Brussels. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor is there, and reports: Dijsselbloem also told reporters that officials from \u201ctroika institutions\u201d will visit Athens soon; a reminder that Greece is still under the control of its creditors. Reporters in Brussels are poised for the arrival of Germany\u2019s finance minister, who\u2019s likely to take his usual tough stance with Greece: And here\u2019s a videoclip of Pierre Moscovici telling reporters that Greece must give more details of its reform plans today. Eric Wiebes, the Dutch state secretary for finance, has just declared that Greece\u2019s list of reforms isn\u2019t sufficient. Arriving at the eurogroup meeting in Brussels, Wiebes told reporters that a full package must be agreed and signed off by creditors by the end of enc European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has declared that Greece must provide more specifics about its reform plans at today\u2019s meeting, as the trickle of quotes from Brussels begins. A quick recap. Eurozone finance ministers are due in Brussels shortly for a eurogroup meeting, with Greece\u2019s bailout programme top of the agenda. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem has already warned that the reform proposals submitted last week do not go far enough. German finance ministry sources have already predicted that today\u2019s meeting won\u2019t deliver a concrete result to unlock any aid payments for Greece. The meeting is overshadowed by the Greek finance minister\u2019s claim that a referendum could be held, or even fresh elections, if the country\u2019s creditors reject its reform proposals. The largest Greek opposition party has called for Yanis Varoufakis to be replaced, claiming he is \u201cdangerous\u201d and hurting the country. Angela Merkel has warned of difficult times ahead over Greece, on a trip to Japan. The uncertainty has hit the Greek stock market, where bank shares are now down over 7%. Greek bonds have fallen in value too, as Grexit fears continue to loom -- even though City chiefs fear that the markets are too complacent. But other eurozone bonds are rising in value, as the European Central Bank\u2019s new QE stimulus programme begins. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned yesterday that Greece\u2019s latest reform plan is \u201cfar from complete\u201d. So what is it? The programme which Greece sent to Brussels last week [online here] consists of seven key points. 1) Creating an Office for Fiscal Responsibility, to monitor government policy 2) Improving budget preparation 3) Hiring \u2018casual onlookers\u2019 to fight tax evasion -- citizens and tourists wired up with recording kit to find evidence of firms dodging VAT. 4) Tackling Greece\u2019s unpaid tax problem, by offering a discount to those in arrears and writing off some of the \u2018unrecoverable\u2019 debts. 5) Offering new licences to online gambling sites, replacing the current system which doesn\u2019t raise any revenue 6) Reforms to force government agencies to share information better, rather than bombarding citizens with requests. 7) New allowances for food and rent for poorest Greek families, and reconnecting power supplies to those who have been disconnected for not paying their bills. Item 3 was roundly criticised when the list leaked last Friday, but what about the rest? Items 1 and 2 sound decent -- Britain\u2019s own Office for Budget Responsibility has worked well since being introduced in 2010. Targeting unpaid taxes makes sense, but it\u2019s not clear that Item 4 has enough teeth to force debtors to comply. It proposes that anyone who joins the process and then fails to comply is simply put back into the normal tax collection policy. Item 5 breezily declares that new online gambling licences could raise more than \u20ac500m per year, based on \u201cfairly plausible assumptions\u201d -- something that eurozone ministers may be sceptical of. And the measures in Item 7 could help tackle Greece\u2019s humanitarian crisis, so are very welcome. However, they cost \u20ac200m. The letter explains that it will be paid by \u20ac60m in government efficiency savings and \u20ac140m from a new public tendering system. The eurogroup might not believe these savings are credible. As Frontline Analysts\u2019 Dan Davies put it in his excellent analysis: These are classic examples of projected \u201cwaste and inefficiency\u201d savings, which tend to be taken only at a substantial discount in any program negotiations \u2014 it\u2019s not that it isn\u2019t possible to sweat the paperclips budget, or to improve competitive tendering, it\u2019s just that delivery on this sort of program is never taken for granted. I don\u2019t think the Eurogroup will treat these measures as fiscally neutral, which means that more funding from spending cuts or tax rises will need to come from somewhere else. The European Commission has just announced that Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will meet with Jean-Claude Juncker on Friday. German chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that Europe faces a \u201cvery difficult path\u201d over Greece. Speaking in Japan, Merkel sounded cautious when asked whether she could rule out the possibility that Greece might leave the eurozone. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from Reuters. Merkel told a press conference that: \u201cI have said time and time again, and I can say it again here, our political goal is to keep Greece in the euro zone. We have been working on this for many years. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that there are two sides to this coin -- on the one hand solidarity from European partners, and on the other the readiness to implement reforms and other commitments at home. On this, we clearly have a very difficult path ahead of us.\u201d The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has published a letter sent by eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem to the Greek government on Friday. In it, Dijsselbloem thanks Yanis Varoufakis for the seven reforms he outlined in his own letter last week, before cautioning that more work is needed. Here\u2019s a flavour: Dear Yanis, I thank you for your letter, dated 5 March 2015, and for the attached document outlining in some detail seven of the reforms planned by the Greek government. This document will be helpful in the process of specifying the first list of reform measures you submitted earlier on 23 February, which needs to be agreed with the institutions by the end of April, in line with the Eurogroup statement of 20 February. The proposals described in your letter will thus need to be further discussed with the institutions. Let me also clarify that in the course of the current review the institutions will have to take a broad view covering all policy areas and I count on your cooperation in this regard.... Dijsselbloem adds that officials from Greece\u2019s creditors will conduct \u2018technical work\u2019 in Greece in the coming weeks. Greek government bonds are weakening this morning, showing that traders see the debt as riskier. The yield (or interest rate) on Greek 10-year sovereign debt has risen to 9.96%, from 9.5% on Friday night. Three-year bond yields have risen more sharply: The European Central Bank has confirmed that its new QE programme kicked off this morning: Heads up. Eurozone ministers will arrive for today\u2019s meeting in Brussels around 2.45pm local time, or 1.45pm GMT. Many of the City\u2019s biggest names are worried that markets underestimate the risk that Greece might leave the eurozone. That\u2019s according to a new poll from the Financial Times. Here\u2019s a flavour: \u201cNeither the eurozone, nor perhaps even the EU itself could survive a stampede out the door,\u201d said Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of insurer Prudential, said: \u201cFinancial markets seem remarkably relaxed about a potential Grexit; they believe that either it will not happen, or it will not matter. That belief deserves to be challenged.\u201d Grexit would \u201caccelerate a dismantling of euroland\u201d, warned Robert Swannell, chief executive of Marks and Spencer. It would be a \u201csignpost for others to follow in times of distress\u201d, echoed Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems... Here\u2019s the full piece (\u00a3): Top City financiers warn investors over Grexit chaos One of the German MPs who voted against Greece\u2019s bailout extension has argued that the country would be better off quitting the eurozone. Writing in the Bild tabloid today, CSU MP Peter Ramsauer argued: \u201cBy leaving the euro zone, as finance minister Sch\u00e4uble has suggested, the country could make itself competitive again from a currency perspective with a new drachma. \u201cThis would provide Greece with a great opportunity to renew itself economically and administratively, making itself fit again to return to the eurozone from a position of strength.\u201d A new opinion poll shows that over two-thirds of Greeks want their leaders to reach a \u201cfair compromise\u201d with its creditors. The number who favour a tough fight that risks Greece leaving the eurozone has fallen a little: Meanwhile, alternate economy minister Dimitris Mardas has insisted this morning that Greece\u2019s state revenues were not in such a parlous position as many imagined. Over to Helena Smith again: Insisting that a solution would be found \u201cdespite the low expectations,\u201d Mardas took commentators aback this morning saying: \u201cthe picture that we have of revenues is better than expected.\u201d Greece\u2019s tax collecting apparatus has come to a grinding halt since the year began with revenues dropping by a precipitous 22 %, according to officials. Speaking of today\u2019s euro group he added enigmatically: \u201clet\u2019s get to the point where we are up against the wall and after we\u2019ll see [what we do]. \u201c \u201cThere are alternative solutions,\u201d he told Mega TV. \u201cA solution will be found despite the low expectations.\u201d And Mardas also played down the idea that Greeks could head back to the polls soon. \u201cScenarios\u201d, he said referring to the idea of a referendum floated by Varoufakis over the weekend, \u201cwon\u2019t happen.\u201d Over in Athens, opposition to government policies - and members - is escalating ahead of today\u2019s eurogroup meeting of euro area finance ministers. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Describing Greece\u2019s finance minister as \u201cdangerous,\u201d the main opposition party\u2019s parliamentary spokesman Kyriakos Mitsotakis called this morning for Yanis Varoufakis to be replaced. In a clear ratcheting up of the pressure on the leftist-led government, Mitsotakis said the finance minister\u2019s tendency to shoot from the mouth was not the way to conduct \u201cproud negotiation.\u201d The conservative New Democracy MP told Mega TV: \u201cWith what Mr Varoufakis is doing, he is dangerous for the country and the best thing that the prime minister can do is replace him as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cEvery time he opens his mouth he creates problems for the negotiating position of the country. Mr Varoufakis has managed to do something unique which is to get all of Europe [to support] Mr Sch\u00e4uble,\u201d he said referring to the German finance minister. \u201cWith endless interviews you do not conduct proud negotiation.\u201d Athens, Mitsotakis said, had become isolated within the family of eurozone nations. He also criticised the \u201cunclear and ridiculous reforms\u201d which Varoufakis proposed last week [including sending members of the public undercover to help spot tax evasion]. \u201cGreece is desperately isolated, it is alone. [Varoufakis\u2019] proposals range between being unclear to ridiculous, provoking laughter when we talk about wiring up tourists to clamp down on tax evasion. And all the while the country is being driven to recession and revenues are tragically behind.\u201d The Greek finance minister had to go because he was \u201cunstoppable and impetuous,\u201d Mitsotakis insisted, adding: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about.\u201d Quite an attack on the economics professor, who we should hear from later today in Brussels.... Greece\u2019s bank shares are falling sharply in early trading in Athens, as the threat of a referendum hits confidence. The main Athens index has fallen by 3.5%, with bank shares among the big fallers. Piraeus Bank has shed 6.5%, and National Bank of Greece is down 6.3%. Bloomberg is reporting that the ECB has made its first purchase of eurozone government debt, under its new quantitative easing programme. And they\u2019ve started by snaffling up some German bunds, according to traders. Eurozone bond have been rallying this morning, as the markets anticipated the arrival of the ECB as a willing buyer. This has pushed yields (which move inversely to prices) down to new record lows. Europe\u2019s stock markets have all fallen in early trading: Investors are calculating that America\u2019s monetary policy may soon start to tighten, after the US unemployment rate hit a new six-year low late on Friday. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says: Unless data deteriorate, the rate rises start in June. One of Britain\u2019s best-performing fund managers has weighed in on the eurozone crisis, arguing that the single currency isn\u2019t viable. Neil Woodford told the BBC that the eurozone was \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d, and \u201cprobably\u201d not viable in the long term. \u201cIn a very simple sense pretending that Greece was Germany is a fundamental error. Having the same interest rate, the same monetary policy for two economies that are so different seemed to me to be a fundamentally flawed assumption right at the start of the project. He concedes that political leaders are committed to keeping the eurozone together, but... \u201cultimately, economics has a habit of overruling politics\u201d. Woodford made the comments in a lengthy interview, in which he also discusses the state of the world economy, Britain\u2019s EU membership, and the whole business of investment. Here\u2019s the full interview (the Greek section starts18 minutes in). The agenda for this afternoon\u2019s eurogroup meeting, which starts at 2.30pm GMT, is online here. Eurogroup, 09/03/2015 Here\u2019s the section on Greece: The Eurogroup will discuss the next steps following the decision to extend the financial assistance to Greece by up to four months beyond its original expiry date of 28 February 2015. The political agreement on the extension was taken by the Eurogroup on 24 February and later approved by a number of national parliaments in the euro area and by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which provides the assistance. The formal decision on the extension was taken on 27 February. Ministers will also consider Cyprus\u2019s bailout programme, which is stalling because MPs won\u2019t pass a law to help banks repossess properties. The Eurogroup will be given an update on the ongoing 6th review of the macroeconomic adjustment programme in Cyprus. One of the requirements of the programme is the implementation of the an effective foreclosure framework, which would allow banks to manage their bad loans and improve lending to the real economy. Speaking of Germany.... its economy may not be quite as vibrant as we thought. New data shows that German exports fell by 2.1% month-on-month in January. That\u2019s the biggest fall since last August and worse than economist expected, suggesting the weak euro isn\u2019t helping as much as we thought. The prospect of a Greek referendum might make the European Central Bank wary of offering more emergency support to its banking sector. As Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts put it: Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s suggestion that Greece could hold a referendum over its reform plans has been slapped down by Germany\u2019s deputy finance minister. Steffen Kampeter warned this morning that any referendum would simply slow down Greece\u2019s reform drive. He also predicted little progress at today eurogroup meeting. Reuters has full details: Germany\u2019s deputy finance minister said on Monday that he did not expect concrete dedcisions on Greece to be taken at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers later in the day because they are still waiting for more financial details on Greek reform plans. \u201cI don\u2019t expect any substantial decisions by the Eurogroup this evening,\u201d Steffen Kampeter told German radio in an interview. Kampeter also rebuffed suggestions by Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis that Greece could call a referendum or early elections if its euro zone partners reject the latest reform proposals from Athens, saying this would only lead to a delay in the implementation of the economic measures Greece needed. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Greece\u2019s financial woes are top of the agenda again today, as Eurozone finance ministers head to Brussels for another crunch meeting. [starting at 3.30pm local time]. It\u2019s the first eurogroup meeting since the Greek government was given a four-month extension to its bailout programme. Ministers will be discussing a new reform plan which Athens sent last week [online on the FT\u2019s site], which made headlines because it included an innovative proposal to send out civilians carrying recording kit as undercover tax evasion inspectors. Brussels insiders say the idea didn\u2019t go down terribly well... More importantly, the plan also proposed talks on a third bailout (dubbed a \u201ccontract for recovery and growth). Greece\u2019s government has raised the stakes ahead of the meeting by suggesting they could hold a referendum, or fresh elections, if their reform plans are rejected. Finance chief Yanis Varoufakis told Italy\u2019s Il Corriere della Sera that: \u201cWe are not attached to our posts. If needed, if we encounter implacability, we will resort to the Greek people either through elections or a referendum.\u201d The finance ministry has now insisted that any referendum would be on the reform plans, not eurozone membership. But it does suggest we could see further political upheaval in Greece in the coming months. Full story: Greece threatens new elections if eurozone rejects planned reforms It\u2019s also a historical day in the eurozone crisis, as the European Central Bank begins its massive QE bond-buying programme. They\u2019ve picked a good day for it, looking at the weather in Frankfurt: Over in the financial markets, European shares are expected to drop this morning, tracking a late sell-off on Wall Street last Friday. That was triggered by an unexpectedly strong American jobs report, which bolstered predictions that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates as early as June. Here\u2019s the early calls, from CMC Markets: FTSE100 is expected to open 28 points lower at 6,883 DAX is expected to open 47 points lower at 11,503 CAC40 is expected to open 21 points lower at 4,943 I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

However, they cost \u20ac200m.

      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell is probably right that May\u2019s general election brings uncertainty for UK business whatever the outcome. The corporate world has worked itself into a fine flap about a referendum on EU membership that a Tory, or Tory-led, government would bring. Equally, the bosses don\u2019t want business to be \u201cbashed\u201d by Labour, as they see it, especially if the SNP has its hand on the instrument of supposed violence. The UK election was the fifth \u201cgrey swan\u201d on Sorrell\u2019s pond of known risks. But No 1 on his list \u2013 the eurozone \u2013 still looks a far bigger worry, as a glance at the grey men in Brussels going about their business on Monday would confirm. The gist of the message to Greece was this: stop wasting our time. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, said how little progress has been made in the past fortnight, a not-so-subtle hint that he regards the proposals tabled last week by Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, as half-baked. In short, the eurogroup seems determined to press Greece\u2019s Syriza government to swallow most of its election promises. And Syriza, unless it is prepared to countenance taking Greece out of the eurozone, has few negotiating cards to play. Varoufakis\u2019s stock also seems to be falling: he raised the notion at the weekend of a Greek referendum but officials immediately said this wouldn\u2019t be a vote on euro membership. By the end of next month, then, we will probably be looking at yet another display of eurozone can-kicking. Greek debt will remain at its current level, even though almost nobody thinks it can possibly be repaid. Syriza may secure a few minor tweaks to the pace and nature of the reform programme \u2013 but these won\u2019t be substantial alterations. The charade that all is well with Greek debt will be maintained. For a while, financial markets may be satisfied with such a fudge, especially if the flickers of growth in the eurozone economy don\u2019t evaporate as quickly as they arrived. In the end, though, a failure to resolve definitively Greece\u2019s position in the single currency can only drain business spirits across the continent. The UK uncertainties are real, but nobody saps confidence like the eurozone. HSBC: Treasury committee should respond over Green Another day, another unsatisfactory hearing into HSBC\u2019s Swiss shenanigans. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver repeated that he was a long away from the Swiss bank in 2005-07 and gushed about his reforms. Audit committee member Rona Fairhead, now chair of the BBC Trust, described the things she couldn\u2019t possibly be expected to have known as a non-executive director. Chris Meares, former head of private banking, took responsibility for some control failings but it wasn\u2019t entirely clear which ones, or how much responsibility. Committee chair Margaret Hodge\u2019s fiercest criticism were reserved for Fairhead but the outside world \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 will wonder how Stephen Green, chief executive and then chairman from 2003 to 2010, has escaped his day in parliament. John Mann, a Labour MP who sits on the Treasury select committee, gave his view of why Green, a Tory peer, has not been summoned: \u201cThe Tories will not allow [Green] to be called,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying to palm this off until after the election.\u201d If that\u2019s true, it\u2019s a disgrace. Andrew Tyrie, the distinguished Tory chair of the Treasury committee, should respond. His committee\u2019s reputation for fierce independence is being questioned. M&amp;S reward scheme takes the St Michael Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s army of small shareholders contains vociferous and awkward factions, as the annual meetings usually demonstrate. The rank-and-file may regard the company\u2019s new reward perk as a tad mean. The scheme will allow a private shareholder to turn a cash dividend into credit to spend online or in the shops at an enhanced rate. At the permitted maximum, a \u00a3900 dividend could be exchanged for a shareholder card \u2013 effectively an M&amp;S gift card \u2013 worth \u00a31,000. Let\u2019s crunch the numbers on a \u00a310,000 holding. Call it 2,000 shares at the current share price of 505p. Last year\u2019s dividend was 17p a share, so worth \u00a3340. Under the scheme that would equate to credit of \u00a3378, a bonus of \u00a338. Something is better than nothing, but one can almost hear the ungrateful chorus: \u201cImprove your share price instead of fobbing us off with cheap gestures.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A City grandee in charge of handing out bonuses to Barclays directors has been told to step down immediately by one of the UK\u2019s largest investor bodies. The call for the immediate departure of Sir John Sunderland, who is chairman of the Barclays\u2019 remuneration committee, is being made by the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) \u2013 which unites 64 public sector pension funds with combined assets of \u00a3150bn. Kieran Quinn, chair of LAPPF, said: \u201cSir John Sunderland must go from the Barclays board immediately. It is inexplicable how Barclays can have gone back on its promise to the 2014 AGM that Sir John would step down. Having messed up remuneration for 2013, Sir John has in fact stayed on as chair and presided over another year of still unacceptably high pay for 2014, and is still in place in March 2015. It\u2019s nothing short of misleading shareholders.\u201d Last week, Antony Jenkins, the chief executive of Barclays, was forced to defend his \u00a35.5m pay packet as the bank set aside \u00a31.25bn in preparation for a wave of fines and penalties for rigging foreign exchange markets. In April last year, Barclays said: \u201cIt is intended that [new non-executive director] Crawford Gillies will succeed Sir John Sunderland as Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee at a date to be agreed, consistent with ensuring a smooth transition\u201d. Gillies will finally succeed Sunderland at the conclusion of Barclays\u2019 annual meeting on 23 April 2015. A Barclays spokesman could not explain why it had taken a year to groom Gillies, but added: \u201cThe allegation ... that Barclays has breached a \u2018promise\u2019 made regarding the timing of Sir John Sunderland\u2019s retirement as remuneration committee chairman is untrue. [Barclays\u2019 previous statement] contains no specific reference on the timing of Sir John\u2019s retirement\u201d. \u2022 This article was corrected on Tuesday 10 March 2015 to correct the spelling of Sir John Sunderland\u2019s name.",

      "bodyText": "It was Stuart Gulliver\u2019s bad luck to be summoned before the Treasury committee last week. Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, doesn\u2019t take kindly to being upstaged by other committees and clearly felt that she should have had first dibs at the HSBC chief executive. It was doubly bad luck for Gulliver that this could well be Hodge\u2019s last committee as chair; if Labour have a majority at the next election, the Tories will insist on a Conservative chair. Even at her gentlest, Hodge is a ferocious interrogator; when she\u2019s facing her swansong in front of a large audience that included the Argentinian ambassador, she is merciless. In front of the Treasury committee, Gulliver had picked his fingers to the bone. With no flesh left to pick, he kept his stumps firmly clasped together throughout. He looked and sounded like a man who expected the worst. Last week he had sounded defiant, unrepentant even. Before Hodge, his voice quavered. She has that effect on people. \u201cYou got paid through a Panamanian account that had been set up by a man who managed accounts for Assad and Mugabe,\u201d she observed. Gulliver prevaricated, saying that though it looked bad, it really, really wasn\u2019t. Hodge unleashed her pet pitbull, Stephen Phillips, the Tory MP who could well have been in line to be the committee\u2019s next chair had he not been earning so much as a QC. \u201cWe will get on a lot better if you answer questions directly,\u201d Phillips snapped. \u201cWhy did you choose Panama?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Panama,\u201d Gulliver said. Hodge and Phillips started laughing. As did everyone else. Once Gulliver worked out that the quickest way out of this was to accept he was a fairly useless person, Hodge lost interest and turned her attentions to Chris Meares, the man who had been in charge of HSBC\u2019s private banking arm while industrial-scale tax evasion and money laundering was taking place. It was one of life\u2019s more unequal contests. \u201cI have never had my honesty and integrity questioned,\u201d Meares squeaked. That may be, but he was having his intelligence and competence questioned. Meares has the appearance of a nice-but-dim English character actor, a role he plays to the full. It had never occurred to him for a second that there was all this funny business taking place on his watch when profits in Switzerland jumped by more than 50% in a year. \u201cWere you responsible? Yes or no,\u201d asked Tory David Burrowes more than 10 times. This was too tricky for Meares to answer. Rona Fairhead, head of compliance at HSBC through \u201cthe difficult years\u201d and now chair of the BBC Trust, had looked edgy at first but had begun to relax a little after escaping the committee\u2019s attention for more than 45 minutes. Her sense of security was entirely misjudged; it turned out Hodge had merely been saving her best till last. \u201cLaughable,\u201d Hodge said in response to Fairhead\u2019s attempts to convince the committee that the HSBC audit committee had been fit for purpose. \u201cBut we had policies and structures,\u201d Fairhead insisted. This provoked yet more laughter. Even the Argentinian ambassador smiled. What the committee had to understand, Fairhead continued, was that people at her level at HSBC were paid far too much \u2013 \u201ccompensated is the word we use,\u201d Gulliver reminded her \u2013 to be actually personally responsible for anything and it was entirely unreasonable for anyone to expect her to know anything about anything. This was too much for Hodge. \u201cEither you were naive or incompetent,\u201d she declared. \u201cWhichever it was, I think you should consider your position as chair of the BBC Trust.\u201d Fairhead looked amazed. The \u00a3110K she gets for that is peanuts. Gulliver misguidedly tried to come to her rescue. \u201cWhat you have to realise,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that taking out \u00a35m in cash isn\u2019t necessarily a sign of tax evasion.\u201d Of course not. It could also be a sign you were going to buy several kilos of smack. Only for personal consumption, of course: Gulliver only deals with very high net worth individuals. A session that had begun with Meares auditioning for Four Weddings and a Funeral had ended as Two Funerals and a Stay of Execution. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 March 2015. The following sentence originally said: \u201cWhat the committee had to understand, Fairhead continued, was that people at her level at HSBC were paid \u2026 to be actually personally responsible for anything and it was entirely unreasonable for anyone to expect her to know anything about anything.\u201d It should have said: \u201cWhat the committee had to understand, Fairhead continued, was that people at her level at HSBC were paid far too much \u2026 to be actually personally responsible for anything and it was entirely unreasonable for anyone to expect her to know anything about anything.\u201d This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s has announced an \u201curgent need to evolve\u201d after unveiling another slide in worldwide sales, the ninth month in a row that sales have fallen at the fast-food chain. The slip came amid a new advertising campaign that allowed customers to \u201cpay with lovin\u2019\u201d. Worldwide sales fell 1.7%, where analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had been expecting a 0.3% decline. In the US, sales at restaurants open at least 13 months slipped 4% in February, after growing 0.4% in each of the two prior months. \u201cCreating consistently relevant and satisfying customer experiences have been hallmarks of McDonald\u2019s business and historic success,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHowever, consumer needs and preferences have changed, and McDonald\u2019s current performance reflects the urgent need to evolve with today\u2019s consumers, reset strategic priorities and restore business momentum. The goal going forward is to be a true destination of choice around the world and reassert McDonald\u2019s as a modern, progressive burger company.\u201d The disappointing results come just a week after McDonald\u2019s appointed a new chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, to run the struggling chain. The British executive is a long-term McDonald\u2019s insider who left the company in 2011 to run two UK chains, PizzaExpress and Wagamama, before being hired back in 2013. Easterbrook has promised a major turnaround at the US company which has been losing sales amid vicious price wars with rivals Burger King and Wendy\u2019s and rising sales at other chains like Chipotle, Five Guys Burgers and Panera Bread. In the US, McDonald\u2019s blamed the sales decline in February on \u201congoing aggressive competitive activity\u201d. The drop followed a US promotion that let randomly selected customers \u201cpay with lovin\u2019\u201d, such as asking someone to dance, or giving someone a fist bump or hug. The heavily advertised promotion failed to boost sales. The company held a \u201cturnaround summit\u201d for franchisees in Las Vegas last week, which it said was designed to \u201cdeliver renewed energy and focus\u201d around the restaurant experience. Sales in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region fell 4.4% and appear to still be suffering from the impact of two food scandals. In January, a customer in Japan found a piece of vinyl in a chicken nugget; last summer one of McDonald\u2019s Chinese meat suppliers was accused of selling expired meat to restaurants. Europe provided some relief for the company. Same-store sales rose 0.7% in the region, with strong performance in the UK and Germany offsetting weakness in Russia. The increase came after a 0.5% uptick in sales in January. Easterbrook told analysts recently that McDonald\u2019s had been \u201ctypically a risk-averse company\u201d but that \u201ctime doesn\u2019t allow you to do that when you are in a turnaround. We try to add some pace and add some agility.\u201d Last week the company announced it would stop selling chicken treated with antibiotics used on humans. The move followed pressure from US government bodies and others who fear the practice is contributing to the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections. Chipotle, Shake Shack and other chains have already banned the use of such antibiotics, but McDonald\u2019s scale means the decision is likely to reshape the supply chain.",

UK Financial Investments, the body that controls the taxpayer stake in the nation\u2019s bailed-out banks, has promised to drip-feed Lloyds shares on to the market in the runup to the general election, with the aim of cutting its stake to 20%. The pace of selling has accelerated in recent weeks as UKFI moves to exploit a surge in the Lloyds share price. Shares in Lloyds fell 0.6% to 80.92 pence following the announcement of the sale on Monday morning, but remained close to recent 12-month highs of 82.76 pence. The government has been gradually cutting its stake in Lloyds down from 43% in 2009, after a taxpayer rescue pumped \u00a320bn into the bank at the height of the financial crisis. The latest \u00a3500m sell-off means that the government has recovered \u00a38.5bn from share sales, the chancellor, George Osborne, said on Twitter. Analysts at Investec said the Lloyds sale was \u201cmanifestly good news\u201d for shareholders and taxpayers, noting that the bank\u2019s shares were trading at a 12-month high. The government still owns 79% of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which received a \u00a345bn bailout in 2008, but Osborne has vowed to sell it \u201cas quickly as we can\u201d if he remains chancellor after the general election.",

      "bodyText": "Two senior HSBC executives and the chair of the BBC Trust will be questioned by MPs on Monday about their role at the bank, whose Swiss banking arm helped wealthy clients avoid tax. Stuart Gulliver, the bank\u2019s chief executive, and Chris Meares, the former head of global private banking, are due to appear before the public accounts committee at 3.15pm on Monday. Rona Fairhead, the chair of the BBC Trust and an HSBC non-executive director since 2004, will also be questioned by MPs. At a session devoted to \u201ctax avoidance and evasion\u201d, all three are expected to face questions on their knowledge of activities at HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm, in the wake of revelations from the Guardian and a consortium of international journalists that the bank helped super-rich clients dodge taxes and conceal assets. One notable absence will be Lord (Stephen) Green, the boss of HSBC during the period covered by the files, who went on to serve three years as a Conservative minister. HSBC has admitted it has suffered \u201chorrible reputational damage\u201d over the revelations of systematic tax avoidance. Gulliver, who received \u00a37.6m in pay and bonuses last year, recently said he was shamed and humbled. The HSBC chief executive is also likely to find his tax affairs in the spotlight. He was recently forced to defend his own Swiss bank account, which sheltered \u00a35m through a Panamanian company, but has declined to say whether he still has it. Gulliver was born in Derby but claims non-dom status, based on his many years working in Hong Kong, the place he says he now considers home. Non-dom status often brings lower payments on income and inheritance taxes. At a recent hearing before the Treasury select committee, Gulliver said his pay arrangements were not intended to avoid tax, but he conceded that they looked odd: \u201cI can understand how people find these kind of arrangements unusual and rather strange.\u201d Fairhead will come under scrutiny for her role on the HSBC board, a part-time job for which she was paid \u00a3513,000 in 2014, a 144% rise on the previous year. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the public accounts committee, has raised questions about Fairhead\u2019s position as head of the BBC Trust, a three-day-a-week job paying \u00a3110,000 a year, which Fairhead took up last October. Hodge has said the BBC should look at Fairhead\u2019s past on the HSBC board: \u201cThere are clearly question marks arising out of her role.\u201d A member of the BBC Trust has said it would \u201ctake note\u201d of the results of regulatory inquiries, but was not conducting any action itself. Also appearing before MPs on Monday will be Edward Troup, second permanent secretary at Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the body charged with leading the UK investigation into the files containing a list of 6,000 names. MPs have previously expressed concern that the list has only led to one successful UK prosecution. The appearance of Troup is a victory for MPs, after the head of HMRC, Lin Homer, recently said \u201che was not the relevant official\u201d to give evidence at an earlier hearing on the HSBC scandal.",

      "bodyText": "Crowdfunding firms are waiting an average of six months for authorisation by the Financial Conduct Authority amid a growing backlog of applications, according to the consultancy firm Bovill. The FCA has approved only two crowdfunding platforms in the past nine months and the number of applications pending has risen from to 15 from three, according to information that the FCA supplied to Bovill, which advises firms on financial regulation. Bovill said the delays and logjam of applications were a worry because the FCA only introduced its regulatory framework for crowdfunders last April. The government has been trying to encourage new forms of funding for businesses after the financial crisis left many entrepreneurs complaining they had been abandoned by their banks. However, the FCA regards the fast-growing sector as risky because most start-up businesses fail. Gillian Roche-Saunders, head of venture finance at Bovill, said: \u201cThe FCA wants to ensure quality control over business plans particularly relating to consumer protection, but it also needs to weigh that against the costs and uncertainties that the approval process causes for new businesses. \u201cThe government are very keen to promote innovative financial technology and help fill the funding gap that exists in some parts of the market, yet many viable businesses may not get off the ground if it continues to take so long to be authorised.\u201d Crowdfunding is used by people and businesses to raise money from the public on the internet to support a business, campaign or project. The FCA regulates investment-based crowdfunding, where consumers buy shares or bonds in a business through an online platform such as Crowdcube. The FCA regards this form of crowdfunding as hazardous and has warned consumers they are likely to lose all their money because of the failure rate for new businesses. The FCA also regulates peer-to-peer lending, which cuts out banks to let firms and individuals borrow from the public. Two new crowdfundings in London\u2019s febrile property market will be launched on Monday. Pocket, which builds affordable homes in London, is seeking to raise \u00a31.5m by selling bonds through Crowdcube that promise to pay 7.5% interest a year over four years. PropertyCrowd, a real estate crowdfunding platform, is seeking \u00a31m of investment in a luxury new-build development in Fulham on the Thames. It said investors would receive their share of net rental income plus 75% of any capital increase when the development is sold in a few years. Authorisation of crowdfunders is a two-way process and relies on applicants responding promptly to FCA requests for information as well as the regulator acting speedily. Roche-Saunders said the backlog of applications was likely to increase from August when peer-to-peer lenders will have to apply for authorisation. The FCA declined to comment.",
