      "bodyText": "Many of the Redcar steelworkers laid off last week had worked at the plant for years, others even for decades \u2013 from boy to man. Having fought to reignite the blast furnace when it was last mothballed just five years ago, thousands of these skilled professionals now face being thrown out of work in a town at the very sharp end of the government\u2019s austerity programme. On Monday the plant was mothballed, with the loss of 1,700 jobs. By Friday its owner was in liquidation, threatening redundancy for the 500 workers who were being kept on to maintain the site in the hope that it might reopen \u2013 taking the potential impact to 2,200 posts. \u201cWhen we were younger, it was always a thing that we were told \u2013 if you get yourself in at British Steel, it\u2019s a job for life,\u201d said one steel worker who faces redundancy. After looking at the local job market, he says workers at the site are resigned to a choice between taking a huge drop in salary \u2013 he is on around \u00a330,000 a year \u2013 or relocating. This steel worker, who asked not to be named, has even considered moving to Australia. \u201cI was talking to a lad who is on the same wage as myself now. He\u2019s desperate. Some aren\u2019t in a position where they can get up and move and are tied down to this area for family reasons. He was looking at starting work in Aldi.\u201d Another, Eugene Purvis, 56, said: \u201cB&amp;Q are looking for [workers]. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll get fixed up with work.\u201d To those spearheading the local campaign to save the works, such stories underline the urgency of the situation. On Friday, SSI UK, the plant\u2019s Thai owners, went into liquidation following a failed appeal for government help with its reported \u00a3800m debts. The government said it had turned down a \u201clast-minute and unrealistic request\u201d from SSI \u201cfor the taxpayer to make an open-ended funding commitment\u201d to keep Redcar coke ovens burning, as it had no confidence in its business case and it would be in breach of EU state aid rules. On the same day, after weeks of intense lobbying, the government announced an \u00a380m support package for those who have lost their jobs, including funding for affected workers to retrain at local further education colleges and tailored jobcentre support. Money will also be available if they want to start businesses, and for existing local small firms to grow. Announcing the package on a visit to Redcar, business secretary Sajid Javid said the aid would \u201cprovide important support to workers and the local economy\u201d. A local taskforce, headed by the chief executive of Redcar and Cleveland borough council (RCBC), met for the first time on Friday to plan how to support the redundant workers and a long-term economic recovery package. But speaking on Friday outside the steelworks, Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, said she felt the government had thrown in the towel too soon. \u201cThey\u2019ve said today that [they] accept the end of steelmaking on Teesside. We don\u2019t accept that.\u201d She said that the receiver that comes in will want to maximise the value of the asset, which would hopefully mean a \u201csoft\u201d mothballing process, increasing the likelihood the plant could be reopened in future if a buyer emerged. As one of Teesside\u2019s biggest employers, long-term closure could be devastating. Redcar sits in an already-deprived borough, which has been ravaged by more than \u00a330m of spending cuts since 2010. Another \u00a322m will go between 2017 and 2020. Unemployment remains stubbornly above even the regional average, and it is higher in the north-east than anywhere else in the country. Last week neighbouring Middlesbrough was found to have the highest proportion of deprived neighbourhoods in the country. Food banks have proliferated in the last six months and feed2,000 across the borough. Ruth Fox, manager of the Redcar area food bank, guesses that demand will double as a result of steel job losses. The mothballing of the blast furnace is already affecting the supply chain. Peterson Engineering, a stone\u2019s throw away from the SSI plant, has laid off a third of its workforce. Its owner, Neil Doyle, said the firm was owed \u00a3190,000 by SSI. Redcar isn\u2019t the first northern area to contemplate a future without its key industry. Many have successfully diversified. In Hull, a city once reliant on fishing and shipping, the Green Port Hull initiative will host a \u00a3310m Siemens offshore wind turbine manufacturing facility. The Albert Dock in Liverpool and Newcastle\u2019s Quayside now thrive as cultural and creative hotspots. Can Redcar take heart from those examples? \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible to get a certain amount of property-based redevelopment in most ex-industrial areas. It obviously helps to have a waterfront, red bricks and cotton mills,\u201d said Professor Karel Williams at Manchester Business School. But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s only Banksy who could make a success out of Redcar steelworks as a visitor centre.\u201d Sue Jeffrey, leader of the council, said Redcar had a vision to regenerate the Tees Valley. \u201cWhile this all sounds very negative and difficult \u2013 which it is, and I don\u2019t want to underplay the impact of it \u2013 we do have ambitious plans to grow our economy.\u201d Its regeneration master plan aims to create 14,000 jobs and 800 businesses by 2025. Middlesbrough council is also investing \u00a3500m in regeneration schemes. Huge projects in Redcar have already been completed, including transforming sea defences, and the \u00a31.6m Redcar Beacon, a helter skelter-like tower and business space on the regenerated seafront. Another \u00a331m leisure and business centre opened last year, though it is only around two-thirds full after a boom in creative industries failed to materialise. There is still optimism for manufacturing on Teesside, with thousands still employed in the chemical and process industry. \u201cAlthough the steel announcement is very bad news for the individuals and companies affected, there are a number of significant projects happening in Tees Valley and the surrounding area which are creating jobs and supply-chain opportunities now and in the near future,\u201d said Paul Booth, chair of the Tees Valley Unlimited local enterprise partnership (LEP). Two examples are a potash mine in the North York Moors National Park, which is expected to create up to 2,000 jobs, and the new Hitachi plant in Newton Aycliffe constructing superfast trains, which aims to bring in 730 workers. According to the LEP 21,000 new private sector jobs have been created in the Tees Valley since 2011. There are also plans to build on Teesside also wants to create the jobs of the future. A group of heavy industries in the Tees Valley, including SSI, want to become Europe\u2019s first carbon capture and storage zone, preventing polluting CO2 emissions entering the atmosphere, with a significant number of jobs hoped to follow. But retaining the steel industry is central to all of this. RCBC championed the return of steelmaking to Teesside as part of its masterplan, and Jeffrey admits that another mothballing puts the skids on its ambitions. She said the last time the plant was mothballed a \u00a3100m economic recovery package was required. \u201cThere\u2019s a mismatch between the short-term need and the longer-term plans. I think that is an absolutely key issue. That\u2019s why we\u2019re saying to government: \u2018Short term you\u2019ve got to inject some cash here either to ensure that we retain steel-making or to support the economy recovery.\u2019\u201d Referring to the government\u2019s \u00a380m package to retrain redundant workers and help them set up their own businesses, Turley said:\u201cYou can give them all the skills you want but if the jobs aren\u2019t here, the jobs aren\u2019t here. You can\u2019t expect people to start up their businesses and do all these amazing small enterprises. We\u2019re not a Manchester or a Leeds. Steel is absolutely fundamental to the future of the economy here.\u201d Williams said there was no alternative economic model when a big works closed. \u201cFor all the hand-wringing of successive governments over the closure of plants like Redcar, the problem is that in peripheral areas \u2013 and Redcar is a peripheral area \u2013 you tend to close the plant and leave marooned workers. This isn\u2019t simply a skills problem, it\u2019s a problem about the nature of the housing and labour market in London and the south-east, where we\u2019re actually putting on the jobs.\u201d The taskforce set up to support workers affected by redundancy will assess the local job market, but Jeffrey says there are likely to be few opportunities for the skilled steel workers in the short-term. \u201cOnce again, the Tees Valley and Redcar is going backwards before it can start taking those steps forward. As the recession hit we were only just getting the benefit of the growth that had come before. We\u2019re always catching up.\u201d Speaking before the liquidation announcement of SSI, Turley refused to contemplate Redcar\u2019s future without steel. \u201cI\u2019ve been wrestling with what does Redcar look like in 2020? What is the future? We\u2019ve always known the steel works is vulnerable. We\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities in tourism, in leisure, in developing the town. We should absolutely be putting our efforts into that. But you need a bridge. My feeling was always that we should be able to do the two.\u201d She cited the construction of the giant Dogger Bank windfarm 80 miles off the Yorkshire coast and the carbon capture plans, as examples of steel\u2019s potential future viability. \u201cIt would be an absolute travesty that a windfarm built off the coast of Redcar is built with steel other than from Teesside,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is for me very symbolic of how you can shift from the old to the new and have a viable technological manufacturing industry going forward, with things like CCS, the wind turbines being built; linking up with Hitachi. There are opportunities there \u2026. but if you lose [the steelworks] that\u2019s the foundation really.\u201d As the storm clouds hang over 160 years of steelmaking on Teesside, those still campaigning to save the steelworks said their fight would go on. \u201cThere is no way we\u2019re going to give up. That\u2019s one thing you must know about Redcar. Everybody is extremely resilient. We\u2019ve had shocks like this before. We will see our way through it,\u201d said Jeffrey. Regeneration Game: new industries from old The fate of the Redcar\u2019s plant will no doubt evoke memories for many in one-time industrial hotspots who watched their jobs disappear as mines and ports shut. While those closures caused long-lasting damage, some of the blighted communities have seen new industries emerge. ORGREAVE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE: ADVANCED MANUFACTURING RESEARCH CENTRE This was the site of one of the defining events of the Thatcher premiership, when police clashed bloodily with striking miners in 1984. Now the soot of the colliery has been replaced by a University of Sheffield and Boeing laboratory, that develops cutting-edge processes to save firms time and money. Rolls-Royce is a key member. Construction is also under way on Factory 2050, the UK\u2019s first fully digital manufacturing plant, where component parts of the shop floor can be shifted around to allow for rapid changes in production. South Yorkshire will eventually be home to Europe\u2019s largest research-led advanced manufacturing cluster. BELFAST: TITANIC STUDIOS Once an enormous chamber where components for the world\u2019s grandest ships were painted, the paint hall in the city\u2019s Titanic Quarter is these days best-known for hosting one of Europe\u2019s biggest film studios. HBO\u2019s mega-hit Game of Thrones is shot there. The first four seasons alone brought some \u00a382m to the Northern Irish economy in wages and a boost to services and tourism. A multimillion-pound plan for two new studios was announced last year. Shows such as Line of Duty were filmed in Northern Ireland, and there has been a local boom in associated industries, including postproduction. LIVERPOOL DOCKS The transformation of Liverpool\u2019s docks was led by the regeneration of the Albert Dock, now the north-west\u2019s top free tourist destination and home to the Beatles Story attraction and Tate Liverpool. Regeneration of Stanley Dock, used as a gritty backdrop for the 2009 Sherlock Holmes film, is under way. The \u00a330m Titanic hotel opened there last year and the Tobacco Warehouse will see \u00a3130m of investment, including apartments, shops, offices and more hotels. Development as part of Liverpool Waters, a \u00a35.5bn, 30-year project for 60 hectares of the city\u2019s northern docks, is also now in the pipeline. Its architects say Liverpool\u2019s waterfront will rival Toronto and Barcelona. LONDON: CANARY WHARF Where the hulking high-rises now stand was one of the world\u2019s busiest port districts in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The old docks were transformed in the 1980s with help from generous tax breaks that enabled Canadian tycoon Paul Reichmann to create a new metropolis to the east of central London. It is now home to international banks including HSBC and Citigroup.",

Shows such as <em>Line of Duty</em> were filmed in Northern Ireland, and there has been a local boom in associated industries, including postproduction.</p> <p><strong>LIVERPOOL DOCKS</strong> The transformation of Liverpool\u2019s docks was led by the regeneration of the Albert Dock, now the north-west\u2019s top free tourist destination and home to the Beatles Story attraction and Tate Liverpool. Regeneration of Stanley Dock, used as a gritty backdrop for the 2009 Sherlock Holmes film, is under way. The \u00a330m Titanic hotel opened there last year and the Tobacco Warehouse will see \u00a3130m of investment, including apartments, shops, offices and more hotels.

      "bodyText": "It became known as her \u201cwalk in the wilderness\u201d: Margaret Thatcher, with handbag and heels, picking her way through a rubble-strewn no man\u2019s land on Teesside. \u201cShe\u2019s here to see for herself!\u201d said the local Evening Gazette. That was in 1987, when scores of factories, steelworks and mines had closed in what was to be a decades-long de-industrialisation process. Central and local governments have battled ever since, with varying success, to breathe life into these areas. The cast of economic players has shifted over that time, from Thatcher\u2019s development corporations \u2013 including the Teesside Development Corporation, near her \u201cwilderness\u201d, and its equivalent in London\u2019s Docklands \u2013 to Labour\u2019s regional development agencies, Tory local economic partnerships and, now, the city-regions that are to get new devolution deals in George Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse. Whatever the framework and the balance of power between Whitehall and the regions, though, some strategies are just more successful than others. The thinktank Centre for Cities recently analysed a century of data about urban Britain, and found that it\u2019s not enough just to find relatively low-skilled jobs to replace those lost when a steel plant or a coal mine closes. A familiar template for revival over the past 25 years involved subsidising the building of vast out-of-town business parks, and tempting multinationals to move in their call-centre or distribution warehouse. Another approach was to build a glitzy shopping complex and hope an influx of consumers brought money flooding into the local economy. But Paul Swinney, the report\u2019s author, argues that recent regeneration successes, such as Manchester and Leeds, have relied on a highly skilled workforce from local universities, and the gradual renaissance of their city centres. \u201cCities that have adapted have reinvented their economies, creating jobs in activities such as IT and digital media, the report said. \u201cThose that have struggled to adapt have replicated their economies, swapping cotton mills for call centres and dockyards for distribution sheds.\u201d The economic geography of the UK has changed drastically, when Glasgow was known as the second city of the empire, and Manchester and Liverpool were mighty engines of growth and jobs. Industries such as coal, cotton and steel relied on natural resources and proximity to sea routes. Many of today\u2019s industries \u2013 tech startups, for example \u2013 don\u2019t need physical assets of this kind, but they do benefit from what economists call agglomeration effects: being in a cluster of similar firms, so expertise can be shared, and a local ecosystem of suppliers and customers can develop. Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants may be the ultimate example of a cluster, but London\u2019s financial sector is another, as are biotech firms around Oxford, and carmakers and suppliers in the West Midlands. But it\u2019s hard to start a cluster from scratch, and it\u2019s a crowded field, with local authorities worldwide competing to attract investment to their own putative specialisms. Post-industrial areas without a major university, a large city centre, or pre-existing expertise in building something people still want \u2013 such as cars \u2013 have been left high and dry. Centre for Cities research in the north-west showed that between 1911 and 2013, the number of jobs in Burnley more than halved; Rochdale saw a 44% reduction and Wigan 25%. Professor Alan Manning of the London School of Economics has studied unemployment in former industrial areas and says every city needs the equivalent of an export sector \u2013 something to bring money from outside the area, whether it\u2019s a hospital, a university, or a successful business sector. Without that, areas fall into long-term decline. \u201cThe areas that have negative labour demand shocks like this are the areas that lose population; then the housing stock is bigger than is needed for the population.\u201d That can depress property prices, and at worst, chronic urban decay sets in. Manning cites the extreme example of Detroit, in the US, where entire neighbourhoods were bulldozed after the car industry slumped. And he points out that even Manchester \u2013 widely seen as regeneration success \u2013 has been outperformed in employment terms by almost every southern city.",

    "webTitle": "Obama: US economy 'envy of the world', but jobs slowdown is Congress's fault", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Obama administration sent a clear message on Friday: if anyone is to blame for the US economy slowdown, it is Congress. Both Barack Obama and Labor Secretary Tom Perez pointed to congressional inaction on issues like the budget and transportation and infrastructure as reasons why the US economy was not growing at a faster pace. Their statements were part of a reaction to the worse-than-expected jobs report released on Friday morning. The report showed that the US economy added fewer jobs in September than expected, casting doubts over whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates before the year\u2019s end. The US economy has seen \u201c67 straight months of job creation, 13.2 million new jobs in all and an unemployment rate that has fallen from a high of 10% down to 5.1%\u201d, Obama said. \u201cThese long-term trends are obviously good news particularly for every American waking up each morning and heading to a new job,\u201d the president added. \u201cBut we would be doing even better if we didn\u2019t have to keep on dealing with the unnecessary crises in Congress every few months. \u201cThis is especially important right now because although the American economy has been chugging along at a steady pace, much of the global economy has softened.\u201d Obama said part of the reason the US job growth has slowed is because there is a global slowdown, which has affected US exports and made the US economy skittish. As such, the US does not need another manufactured crisis such as attempting to avoid a government shutdown in December. \u201cI will not sign another short-sighted spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week. We purchased ourselves 10 additional weeks, we need to use them effectively,\u201d Obama said, referring to the short-term extension passed by Congress. \u201cCongress has to do its job. We can\u2019t flirt with another shutdown. It should pass a serious budget.\u201d John Boehner, the outgoing speaker of the House, also believes the US economy can do better. However, he blamed the slowed economic growth on the White House. \u201cToo many middle-class families are still struggling in this economy, and we can do a lot better,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThere is no excuse for the president to continue pushing an agenda that will hurt hardworking families and stifle economic growth.\u201d Perez admitted that September\u2019s job growth \u201cdidn\u2019t meet our high expectations\u201d and that the US could do better, but said it was up to Congress to fix. The Obama administration has a laundry list of ways that the Congress can improve the US economic outlook, he said, including acting immediately to pass a transportation infrastructure bill and providing relief from \u201cthe sequestration straightjacket\u201d. \u201cThose are the things that create jobs. I am confident that there is bipartisan support, there is majority support in both houses of Congress to do all of those things and they need to act immediately,\u201d Perez told the Guardian. \u201cI am hopeful. Speaker [John] Boehner as he prepares to depart indicated that he wants to leave a clean barn for his successor and a clean barn would mean passing all these initiatives because that\u2019s how you create jobs.\u201d Perez also called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 by 2020 and to pass a national paid leave law, which he says would improve labor participation. In September, US labor participation dropped to 62.4% \u2013 the lowest mark since October 1977. Despite its faults, the US economy \u201ccontinues to be envy of the world,\u201d Perez said. When asked what makes US economy so appealing, Perez said that in other countries people do not have money in their pockets to spend. \u201cWe have the most productive workforce in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a legal system that is fair and impartial. We have incredible advantages now in energy as we become closer and closer to energy independence. It is a lot cheaper to make things here. \u201cThe gallon [of] gas is a boon for most consumers \u2013 including myself. Every time I go to a gas pump, I am pretty pumped up because it\u2019s so cheap. But because we are an oil and gas producer, we have seen a job loss of roughly 100,000 in that sector.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "First it was Pizza Express, then Las Iguanas, C\u00f4te and Jamie\u2019s Italian. Now Mexican street-food chain Wahaca stands accused of taking staff tips. At the restaurant chain, founded by former MasterChef winner Thomasina Miers, staff are required to hand over 3.3% of card sales and 0.075% of cash sales at the end of every shift, regardless of how much money they have made on tips. One waiter said that, because the levy was charged on sales and not tips, this meant he was losing more than 50% of his tips every week. He said he would rather pay into the pot himself than have the company control the system. Another waiter interviewed by the Observer said he was effectively being asked \u201cto pay rent\u201d to work at Wahaca. The Mexican street-food chain has strongly defended its position, saying that 100% of the levy goes into the \u201ctronc\u201d fund which is used to distribute waiters\u2019 tips to other staff, such as kitchen and bar workers. No money is kept by the company. \u201cThe person who cleans the dishes is as important as the general manager and the waiters and waitresses,\u201d said Miers. \u201cOur customers don\u2019t want to pay a service charge, so what we have done over the last eight years is come up with what we think is the fairest way to make sure everyone takes home the best money.\u201d While Wahaca is unlike other high-street chains who were pocketing a slice of tips left by customers, its policy and that of others who also charge a sales levy highlights the inconsistent nature of pay in the restaurant sector. Wahaca is the latest in a line of restaurants to be criticised by staff for a tipping policy based on sales generated rather than gratuities received. In August, the Observer highlighted the tipping practices at Las Iguanas, a chain serving Latin American food at 41 branches in the UK. Like Wahaca, it takes a percentage of the table sales that waiting staff generate from their tips, but in the case of Las Iguanas the money is put towards a \u201cstaff incentive and reward scheme\u201d. Earlier this month the chain announced it will drop the policy and replace it with one that better rewards its waiting staff, and Pizza Express has also reversed its policy. Last week it emerged that Jamie Oliver\u2019s chain, Jamie\u2019s Italian, requires its waiting staff to pay a 2% levy from table sales they generate on each shift. Like Wahaca, the chain distributes the money to other staff. The Wahaca staff who contacted the Observer said they do not object to sharing gratuities with kitchen and bar staff but felt it is the company\u2019s responsibility, rather than theirs, to make sure backroom staff are paid properly. \u201cThe most I have ever made in tips is \u00a3150, and that was a double shift that started at 11am and finished around midnight,\u201d said one waiter. \u201cMy sales, on the other hand, were over \u00a32,000. So they took \u00a380 of my tips and I went home with \u00a370. I have never worked in a restaurant where they did this.\u201d Wahaca\u2019s co-founder, Mark Selby, said staff culture was \u201can absolute priority\u201d and it was \u201cincredibly important\u201d for him that the chain was a fair place to work. He said the majority of staff kept on average 55% to 60% of their tips. \u201cThere are always those who would prefer to keep 100% of all tips received themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe say to people from day one that if they do not want to share with the team, Wahaca is probably not for them.\u201d Selby said the chain had previously asked staff if they preferred a 10% service charge, and that was rejected. However, after recent discussions it is going to trial removing the 0.075% cash levy in some restaurants. There was outrage this month when some of the country\u2019s best known restaurant chains including Pizza Express, Strada, Zizzi, Ask Italian and Giraffe were accused of keeping all or part of the service charges automatically added to bills rather than passing them on to staff. The fresh controversy surrounding tips recently prompted business secretary Sajid Javid to launch a government investigation that runs until early November with a call for evidence by 10 November 2015. Restaurant owners and waiting staff can respond in one of three ways \u2013 using the government\u2019s electronic survey tool, by emailing labourmarket.consultations@bis.gsi.gov.uk or filling our a form at Tips, gratuities, cover and service charges: call for evidence. After a public backlash, the restaurant chain Giraffe announced earlier in the year that it would remove its service charge and allow all tips to go to staff. Giraffe previously kept 10% of the tips for \u201cadministrative and other business costs\u201d but said it had decided to make the change in its mid-year review. Zizzi and Ask Italian have also reversed their policies. David Turnbull, of Unite, said the tipping scandal has developed since 2009 when restaurants adopted a Code of Best Practice. \u201cThe government needs to get a grip. Its failure so far to conduct an urgent review of the 2009 Code has led to widespread abuse with some rogue restaurants left to skim staff tips with impunity.\u201d He said the onus was now on the government review to stamp out rogue practices Last month the Casual Dining Group, which also owns Bella Italia, Cafe Rouge and La Tasca, announced it was scrapping the 10% administration fee it deducts from staff tips, while Pizza Express, which was the first restaurant to come under the spotlight for its tipping policies, also reversed its policy of taking a cut from tips after the Unite campaign and a backlash from customers.",
