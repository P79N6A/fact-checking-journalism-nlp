The Industrial Development Authority has rejected reports that Dublin is losing out in the European-wide race. Bloomberg claimed earlier this month that the Irish capital has fallen behind cities such as Amsterdam and Frankfurt in the competition to woo the EMA, which evaluates medical products. Tommy Fanning, the head of the development agency\u2019s bio-pharmaceuticals division, denied the claim that Ireland has \u201cno natural allies\u201d in the process. Fanning said Ireland\u2019s \u201cnatural allies\u201d include the presence of the world\u2019s top 10 \u201cbig pharma\u201d corporations in the Republic. The sectors in Ireland employ about 125,000 people. \u201cThe pharmaceutical giants based in Ireland already generate \u20ac1bn per annum in the Irish economy. The top ten are here in Ireland already and many of the new drugs being brought onto the market are manufactured here in Ireland,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cSo it makes sense that the EU-wide agency tasked with testing and evaluating these new generation of drugs \u2013 many of them blockbusters that take on serious diseases like cancer \u2013 should be based in the country where they are being developed,\u201d he said. Fanning said a Dublin-based EMA could also test and evaluate the new generation of medical devices being made in Ireland to deliver the new drug treatments. Nineteen cities ranging from Stockholm to Bucharest are seeking to woo the EMA after the UK leaves the EU. A final decision is expected on the EMA\u2019s new headquarters next month. The EMA has warned that the damage caused by its relocation would at best take two years to fix and at worst lead to its complete breakdown and a major public health crisis for the continent.",

      "bodyText": "UK business leaders have united to urge David Davis to quickly establish a Brexit transition deal that mirrors existing arrangements or risk losing British jobs and investment. In a letter to the Brexit secretary seen by the Guardian, five of the UK\u2019s biggest business lobby groups said time was running out for the government to strike a transition deal before firms start to rein in spending plans as they finalise budgets for 2018 and prepare to implement contingency plans for Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. \u201cWe need agreement of transitional arrangements as soon as possible, as without urgent agreement many companies have serious decisions about investment and contingency plans to take at the start of 2018,\u201d the business groups wrote. \u201cFailure to agree a transition period of at least two years could have wide-reaching and damaging consequences for investment and trade, as firms review their investment plans and business strategies.\u201d The joint intervention is a sign of the mounting anxiety among UK businesses about the lack of progress in Brexit negotiations, almost seven months after the prime minister, Theresa May, triggered article 50. Insiders said business groups wanted to present a united front in their key priorities for Brexit. The letter follows last week\u2019s meeting of EU leaders in Brussels, where there was a more conciliatory tone but ittle in the way of solid progress. There is still no agreement on transition arrangements after March 2019, when the UK leaves the union, and discussions on a long-term trade deal have not yet begun. It is understood that in recent days Treasury officials have started asking business groups whether they are preparing to offer their members advice on what to do in the event of no deal. The CBI and British Chambers of Commerce were among the signatories warning Davis of the potentially dire consequences for the UK economy if he failed to agree a transition period of at least two years with the EU. The bosses of the manufacturing trade body EEF, the Institute of Directors and the Federation of Small Businesses also signed the letter on behalf of their members, who employ millions of UK workers. They stressed that a transition period before new long-term arrangements came into force should be \u201cmatched as closely as possible to the current UK relationship\u201d, to limit disruption to firms. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \u201cThe prime minister proposed a strictly time-limited implementation period in her Florence speech and was clear in her article 50 letter that agreeing this principle early in the process would help minimise unnecessary disruption to businesses in both the UK and the EU. \u201cWe are making real and tangible progress in a number of vital areas in negotiations. However, many of the issues that remain are linked to the discussions we need to have on our future relationship. \u201cThat is why we are pleased that the EU has now agreed to start internal preparatory discussions on the framework for transitional arrangements as well as our future partnership.\u201d The letter is the latest in a string of warnings to the government that without an urgent breakthrough in Brexit negotiations, businesses are likely to take jobs and investment elsewhere to avoid as much uncertainty as possible. Earlier this month, Sam Woods, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, said banks and other City firms would activate their Brexit contingency plans if there was no deal on a transition period by Christmas. The boss of Goldman Sachs, one of the world\u2019s biggest investment banks, signalled his intention last week to relocate jobs out of the UK to Germany in a provocative tweet while May was at the EU summit, underlining the pressure on her government to protect British jobs. Lloyd Blankfein said he expected to be \u201cspending a lot more time\u201d in Frankfurt from now on. The lobby groups called on the government to publicly state its position on an implementation phase, sending \u201cEU negotiators a strong positive signal of the government\u2019s readiness to discuss this economically crucial issue\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Is the growth in living standards worse now than in the Great Depression?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The 1930s are the benchmark when it comes to lost decades. There are recessions and deep recessions, but then there is the Great Depression. In terms of sustained misery, nothing remotely comes close to the 10-year period that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Yet in one respect \u2013 growth in living standards \u2013 the performance of the UK since the financial crisis began in 2007 has been worse than it was in the era that included coming off the Gold Standard, the formation of the National Government and the Jarrow March. Data from the House of Commons library obtained by the Labour MP Liam Byrne illustrates the point. In both cases, there was a similar-sized contraction of the economy lasting two years, but the subsequent recovery in the 1930s was faster than it has been since 2007. That is true whether measured by the overall size of the economy or when adjusted for the size of the population. The latter \u2013 gross domestic product (GDP) per head \u2013 is a more meaningful measure because it shows whether people are actually getting better off. Here the data is absolutely clear. By 1938, GDP for 20- to 64-year-olds was just over 10% higher than it had been in 1929, while in 2016 living standards for the same group were 4.6% higher. To be fair, this is not quite the whole picture. Despite the stronger growth in the 1930s it took longer for the dole queues to shorten. The unemployment rate was still more than 10% by 1938 compared to less than half that today. What\u2019s more, one reason Britain had a relatively shallow recession in the early 1930s was that the economy had stuttered its way through the 1920s. The past 20 years, by contrast, are a case of feast then famine. Finally, it is worth pointing out that living standards are far higher today than they were in 1930s and that one group \u2013 pensioners \u2013 has continued to get better off. All that said, for working age adults the lost decade since 2007 has been the equivalent of a Mark II Great Depression. Four interlocking factors led to the recovery of the economy in the 1930s. Firstly, Britain was able to devalue the pound after coming off the Gold Standard in 1931. Secondly, interest rates came down from 6% to 2% within a year and were left there until the second world war broke out. Thirdly, the National Government abandoned free trade in favour of protectionism, reinforcing the competitive advantage from a cheaper currency. Finally, low interest rates stimulated a private housebuilding boom. In the four years from 1933 to 1936, the economy expanded by 4.5% a year on average. The recent recovery has been much more muted even though some of the factors that helped the economy in the 1930s have again been in evidence. Between the middle of 2007 and early 2009 there was a 30% devaluation of the pound and the Bank of England cut official interest rates from 5% to 0.25%. Admittedly, there was no attempt to resort to protectionism but fiscal policy \u2013 taxes and public spending \u2013 was more restrictive in the early 1930s than during the recent financial crisis. One obvious difference between the two periods is that in the 1930s low interest rates prompted a big increase in housebuilding \u2013 just under 300,000 a year by mid-decade. In comparison, over the past decade low interest rates have led to a big increase in house prices. Another is that the UK financial sector was unimpaired by the Great Depression. No bank or building society failed and that underlying resilience ensured that there was a ready flow of funds to finance the building of the suburbs. But the manufacturing sector recovered a lot more quickly in the 1930s and had returned to its pre-slump trend by 1937. It took advantage of the benign macro-economic backdrop, with sharp increases in both output and productivity as sectors such as production of motor vehicles prospered. And because manufacturing represented a far bigger share of the economy 80 years ago, the boost to economy-wide productivity was marked. The contrast with the post-2007 period is stark. Despite a better performance over the past year or so, manufacturing output is still below where it was when the recession began and productivity growth has been extremely modest. And that matters, because manufacturing productivity in the decades leading up to the crisis was growing twice as fast as productivity for the whole economy. That trend is not particularly surprising because there tends to be more automation in the manufacturing sector, while the service sector is more labour intensive. But it does mean that as the economy becomes more heavily weighted towards services \u2013 around 80% of GDP currently \u2013 productivity improvements are harder to chisel out. Seen in a slightly different way, the lack of recovery in production has left the economy dependent on consumption, where growth has slowed due to rising debt and higher import prices as a result of the post-Brexit-referendum fall in the value of the pound. Annual productivity growth in the past five years has averaged 0.2% and the Office for Budget Responsibility says it has run out of reasons for expecting a return to its pre-recession trend of just over 2%. A significant downgrade to the long-term forecast in next month\u2019s budget is now inevitable. In his insider\u2019s view of the decline of the UK engineering industry, Tom Brown notes how poor management, bad industrial relations, a reluctance to invest, a failure to focus on the needs of customers, City short-termism and wildly gyrating macro-economic policies have all resulted in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector shrinking much more quickly than those of other rich western countries. Brown is rightly dismissive of the idea that low cost competition from China means Britain should resign itself to a post-industrial future, noting that Germany\u2019s manufacturing is twice as big as the UK\u2019s as a share of GDP, and generates a whopping trade surplus. Britain has pockets of excellence but they float on a sea of mediocrity. London is Europe\u2019s financial hub but the UK has one of the lowest investment rates in the G7. As the Institute for Public Policy Research noted in a recent report, Britain has an economic muddle rather than an economic model. Byrne, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on inclusive growth, said of the comparison with the 1930s: \u201cThese terrible figures underline one profound point: Britain\u2019s economic model is simply incapable of \u2018bouncing\u2019 our economy back to trend. The conclusion is inescapable: Our economic model needs to change.\u201d It\u2019s hard to disagree. The shock of the 1930s led to a radical economic re-think; the shock of 2007-09 did not. Economic failure and political alienation are the consequences.",

In terms of sustained misery, nothing remotely comes close to the 10-year period that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929.</p> \n<p>Yet in one respect \u2013 growth in living standards \u2013 the performance of the UK since the financial crisis began in 2007 has been worse than it was in the era that included coming off the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard\">Gold Standard</a>, the formation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Government_(United_Kingdom)\">the National Government </a>and the Jarrow March.</p> \n<p>Data from the House of Commons library obtained by the Labour MP Liam Byrne illustrates the point. In both cases, there was a similar-sized contraction of the economy lasting two years, but the subsequent recovery in the 1930s was faster than it has been since 2007.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-20T11:26:28/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Recovery after UK recessions in 1930s and 2010s\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-20T11:26:28/embed.html\">Recovery after UK recessions in 1930s and 2010s</a> \n</figure> \n<p>That is true whether measured by the overall size of the economy or when adjusted for the size of the population. The latter \u2013 gross domestic product (GDP) per head \u2013 is a more meaningful measure because it shows whether people are actually getting better off.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8fe38a3d-cc39-4eb1-a24a-4f52f5decd72\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is a key government statistic and provides a measure of the UK's total economic activity.</p>\n    <p>Put simply, if GDP is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing; if it is down, it is contracting. Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction mean the economy is officially in recession.<br></p>\n    <p>GDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including the service sector, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government.<br></p>\n    <p>Economists are concerned with the real rate of change of GDP, which shows how the economy is performing once inflation is taken into account.<br></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;Office for National Statistics&nbsp;produces quarterly official GDP figures about three and a half weeks after the end of each three-month period.<br></p>\n    <p>The ONS uses three measures and they should, at least in theory, all add up to the same number.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of all goods and services produced - known as the output or production measure.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of the income generated from company profits and wages - known as the income measure.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (in terms of investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas - known as the expenditure measure.</p>\n    <p>The ONS publishes three estimates of quarterly GDP figures. The first \"flash\" estimate comes out about 25 days after the quarter in question has ended. The figures usually get revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and government departments is received. But even the third, dubbed \"final\", estimate of quarterly GDP is not set in stone: the Blue Book, which is published once a year, in August, contains revisions going back the last 18 years.<br></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;National Institute of Economic and Social Research's&nbsp;estimate comes out about three weeks before the official figures.<br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p>The ONS also calculates the size of the UK economy relative to the number of people living here. GDP-per-capita shows whether we are actually getting richer or poorer, by stripping out the impact of population changes.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Here the data is absolutely clear. By 1938, GDP for 20- to 64-year-olds was just over 10% higher than it had been in 1929, while in 2016 living standards for the same group were 4.6% higher.</p> \n<p>To be fair, this is not quite the whole picture. Despite the stronger growth in the 1930s it took longer for the dole queues to shorten. The unemployment rate was still more than 10% by 1938 compared to less than half that today. What\u2019s more, one reason Britain had a relatively shallow recession in the early 1930s was that the economy had stuttered its way through the 1920s. The past 20 years, by contrast, are a case of feast then famine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26b5c1d70d2b67efc9efda25b2d508dbf69fa740\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26b5c1d70d2b67efc9efda25b2d508dbf69fa740/0_189_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Occupy protest camp in Finsbury Squarein 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Occupy protest camp in Finsbury Square, in the City of London, in 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Finally, it is worth pointing out that living standards are far higher today than they were in 1930s and that one group \u2013 pensioners \u2013 has continued to get better off. All that said, for working age adults the lost decade since 2007 has been the equivalent of a Mark II Great Depression.</p> \n<p>Four interlocking factors led to the recovery of the economy in the 1930s. Firstly, Britain was able to devalue the pound after coming off the Gold Standard in 1931. Secondly, interest rates came down from 6% to 2% within a year and were left there until the second world war broke out. Thirdly, the National Government abandoned free trade in favour of protectionism, reinforcing the competitive advantage from a cheaper currency. Finally, low interest rates stimulated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/apr/19/1930s-house-building-economic-recovery\">a private housebuilding boom</a>. In the four years from 1933 to 1936, the economy expanded by 4.5% a year on average.</p> \n<p>The recent recovery has been much more muted even though some of the factors that helped the economy in the 1930s have again been in evidence. Between the middle of 2007 and early 2009 there was a 30% devaluation of the pound and the Bank of England cut official interest rates from 5% to 0.25%. Admittedly, there was no attempt to resort to protectionism but fiscal policy \u2013 taxes and public spending \u2013 was more restrictive in the early 1930s than during the recent financial crisis.</p> \n<p>One obvious difference between the two periods is that in the 1930s low interest rates prompted a big increase in housebuilding \u2013 just under 300,000 a year by mid-decade. In comparison, over the past decade low interest rates have led to a big increase in house prices.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"097ddd94a75a5561ee264658a8f7ced52056b7f3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/097ddd94a75a5561ee264658a8f7ced52056b7f3/0_48_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"1930s suburbia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Low interest rates in the 1930s sparked a building boom whereas low rates over the past 10 years have just pushed up prices.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another is that the UK financial sector was unimpaired by the Great Depression. No bank or building society failed and that underlying resilience ensured that there was a ready flow of funds to finance the building of the suburbs.</p> \n<p>But the manufacturing sector recovered a lot more quickly in the 1930s and had returned to its pre-slump trend by 1937. It took advantage of the benign macro-economic backdrop, with sharp increases in both output and productivity as sectors such as production of motor vehicles prospered. And because manufacturing represented a far bigger share of the economy 80 years ago, the boost to economy-wide productivity was marked.</p> \n<p>The contrast with the post-2007 period is stark. Despite a better performance over the past year or so, manufacturing output is still below where it was when the recession began and productivity growth has been extremely modest. And that matters, because manufacturing productivity in the decades leading up to the crisis was growing twice as fast as productivity for the whole economy. <br></p> \n<p>That trend is not particularly surprising because there tends to be more automation in the manufacturing sector, while the service sector is more labour intensive. But it does mean that as the economy becomes more heavily weighted towards services \u2013 around 80% of GDP currently \u2013 productivity improvements are harder to chisel out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/oct/30/a-weak-pound-is-no-tonic-for-uks-long-term-economic-recovery\">A weak pound is no tonic for UK's long-term economic recovery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Seen in a slightly different way, the lack of recovery in production has left the economy dependent on consumption, where growth has slowed due to rising debt and higher import prices as a result of the post-Brexit-referendum fall in the value of the pound. Annual productivity growth in the past five years has averaged 0.2% and the Office for Budget Responsibility <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/Forecast-Evaluation-Report-2017_Web-Accessible.pdf\">says it has run out of reasons for expecting a return to its pre-recession trend of just over 2%.</a> A significant downgrade to the long-term forecast in next month\u2019s budget is now inevitable.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.troubador.co.uk/book_info.asp?bookid=4497\">In his insider\u2019s view of the decline of the UK engineering industry</a>, Tom Brown notes how poor management, bad industrial relations, a reluctance to invest, a failure to focus on the needs of customers, City short-termism and wildly gyrating macro-economic policies have all resulted in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector shrinking much more quickly than those of other rich western countries. Brown is rightly dismissive of the idea that low cost competition from China means Britain should resign itself to a post-industrial future, noting that Germany\u2019s manufacturing is twice as big as the UK\u2019s as a share of GDP, and generates a whopping trade surplus.<br></p> \n<p>Britain has pockets of excellence but they float on a sea of mediocrity. London is Europe\u2019s financial hub but the UK has one of the lowest investment rates in the G7. <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/cej-time-for-change\">As the Institute for Public Policy Research noted in a recent report,</a> Britain has an economic muddle rather than an economic model.<br></p> \n<p>Byrne, who chairs the <a href=\"https://www.inclusivegrowth.co.uk/\">all-party parliamentary group on inclusive growth</a>, said of the comparison with the 1930s: \u201cThese terrible figures underline one profound point: Britain\u2019s economic model is simply incapable of \u2018bouncing\u2019 our economy back to trend. The conclusion is inescapable: Our economic model needs to change.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>It\u2019s hard to disagree. The shock of the 1930s led to a radical economic re-think; the shock of 2007-09 did not. Economic failure and political alienation are the consequences.</p>",

Assuming the figure isn\u2019t lower than expectations, economy watchers will turn quickly to the underlying trends, such as business investment. The economy has confounded predictions of a sharp post-Brexit vote slowdown or recession, mainly because of resilient consumer spending. That is becoming harder to replicate as prices rise faster than wages, consumers become wary about adding to debts and banks restrict lending.

Financial glass ceiling: yep, still there The Treasury committee has launched an inquiry into why so few women make it into senior jobs in finance.

It\u2019s almost a year since she took up the post and nearly 100 financial firms signed up to a charter pledging to put women in senior jobs. The committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Nicky Morgan, is seeking a progress report. Starting at the top, Morgan wrote to the chancellor on Thursday asking for evidence that the Treasury is doing enough to hire women and people from ethnic minorities at the Bank of England. MPs want information about the makeup of applicants for top jobs at the Bank before they confirm candidates at appointment hearings. Morgan\u2019s letter follows the chancellor\u2019s recent appearance before the Treasury committee, at which he lamented a lack of female candidates for the vacancy on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. Morgan doesn\u2019t appear convinced. Bumps in road for big banks Britain\u2019s biggest high-street banks report on trading this week but each faces problems outside day-to-day business.

Lloyds is also defending itself in court against shareholders seeking compensation for losses caused by the takeover of HBOS.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago I shared a platform with my old friend Lord Lawson at a conference on our membership of the European Union. This was some time before the infamous referendum. The event was good-tempered, and it will come as no surprise to readers that Lawson was, in a term yet to be coined, a \u201cLeaver\u201d, and your correspondent was not. What surprised me over subsequent coffee and drinks was the number of successful, and obviously intelligent, people in the audience who thanked Lawson and me for having covered the history of the EU. It turned out some of the audience had only the vaguest idea why, to use the original title, the European Economic Community was set up in the first place. Decades have passed since the foundation of a group of nations that were bound together in the hope that, after centuries of conflict, they should not go to war among themselves again. And, of course, the \u201ccommunity\u201d has evolved into (at present) 28 nations. Although, as an economics commentator, I concentrate principally on the needless economic harm threatened by Brexit \u2013 indeed, it is already happening \u2013 I nevertheless find it baffling that politicians as intelligent and experienced as Lawson should want to risk disrupting a Europe that is faced by such large and powerful global forces as those reigned over by presidents Vladimir Putin on one side and Donald Trump on the other. When it comes to the economic debate, Lawson placed hopes then \u2013 as others, such as the Brexit secretary David Davis, do now \u2013 on the prospect of some magical transformation of our commercial prospects. This would come about by abandoning membership of the vast and highly beneficial European customs union and single market, and arranging trade deals with the likes of Trump. Can this be the same Trump whose regime wanted to impose penal tariffs of 300% on imports of Bombardier\u2019s C-Series aircraft? This smacks more of a trade war than a trade \u201cdeal\u201d. It is hoped that Airbus will come to the rescue \u2013 in his memoirs, Kenneth Clarke hails Airbus as a wonderful example of cooperation within the EU to create a rival to Boeing, and confesses that he was wrong to oppose it at first. It puzzles some people why Nigel Lawson should be so anti-European when he spent much of his time as chancellor (1983-89) in a succession of abortive attempts to persuade Margaret Thatcher to agree to putting the pound into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). Of course, when, after Lawson\u2019s resignation in disgust, Thatcher was finally worn down by the fashionable establishment view at the time, our brief membership of the ERM\u2013 1990 to 1992 \u2013 ended in political disaster for what was by then the Major government. Unfortunately it emboldened the eurosceptics in the Conservative party \u2013 or \u201cseptics\u201d, as Sir Edward Heath liked to call them \u2013 and they nagged away until they got their referendum. However, it was for counter-inflationary, not pro-European, reasons that Lawson preached the virtues of entry to the ERM. Monetarism had proved a dismal failure, and he hoped that an ERM dominated by the Deutschmark would offer a safer counter-inflationary anchor. So what have Lawson and his fellow Brexiters (I have decided that the extra \u201ce\u201d in Brexiteers makes the unruly gang sound far too romantic) achieved? Yes, the 15% devaluation the financial markets have imposed on the UK \u2013 in wise anticipation of economic disruption to come \u2013 has produced an outburst of, ironically, Lawson\u2019s old enemy: inflation. The impact of rising prices is everywhere in the shops. The familiar squeeze on real incomes has become more pronounced. The governor of the Bank of England drops stronger and stronger hints that, in the face of referendum-induced inflation, monetary policy is going to be tightened. The justification is an acceleration of inflation in an atmosphere of near-full employment. But, thanks to a sequence of events \u2013 the weakening of the unions, the competitive forces of globalisation, the financial crisis of 2007-08 and the counter-productive policy of austerity \u2013 having a job no longer cushions millions of people against hardship or outright poverty. The daily news about personal indebtedness illustrates this. Higher interest rates can only aggravate such problems. Against this background Lawson recently chose to refer to the current Tory chancellor, Philip Hammond, as being \u201cvery close\u201d to a saboteur in refusing to spend more in preparation for a cliff-edge, no-deal Brexit. He even urged Theresa May to sack Hammond \u2013 not a very nice attitude to adopt towards a successor. At all events, those of us who refuse to accept Brexit should be heartened. The referendum was conducted on false pretences. Recent polls suggest that, as the costs of departure become apparent, people are waking up to the implications of Brexit. A YouGov poll for the Times showed 42% for Leave, outnumbered by 47% for Remain. We live in a representative democracy. From the moment a general election result is known, the opposition begins the fightback. Nigel Farage said on referendum night that he would not accept a close Remain result. The fightback is now well under way, and the absurdity of Brexit becomes more evident by the day. The main economic reason for our joining the EU was to improve our economic performance. The International Monetary Fund, the OECD and many others are united in saying that Brexit would be deleterious for our economy. Do we really need this self-harm?",

      "body": "<p>A few years ago I shared a platform with my old friend Lord Lawson at a conference on our membership of the European Union. This was some time before the infamous referendum. The event was good-tempered, and it will come as no surprise to readers that Lawson was, in a term yet to be coined, a \u201cLeaver\u201d, and your correspondent was not.</p> <p>What surprised me over subsequent coffee and drinks was the number of successful, and obviously intelligent, people in the audience who thanked Lawson and me for having covered the history of the EU.

And, of course, the \u201ccommunity\u201d has evolved into (at present) 28 nations.</p> <p>Although, as an economics commentator, I concentrate principally on the needless economic harm threatened by Brexit \u2013 indeed, it is already happening \u2013 I nevertheless find it baffling that politicians as intelligent and experienced as Lawson should want to risk disrupting a Europe that is faced by such large and powerful global forces as those reigned over by presidents Vladimir Putin on one side and Donald Trump on the other.</p> <p>When it comes to the economic debate, Lawson placed hopes then \u2013 as others, such as the Brexit secretary David Davis, do now \u2013 on the prospect of some magical transformation of our commercial prospects.

      "bodyText": "As Philip Hammond prepares to defend his \u00a312bn of welfare cuts in his autumn budget, pensioners can consider themselves lucky to be financially insulated. While most people on low and middle incomes are finding their spending power squeezed by rising inflation and cuts to in-work benefits, the triple lock on pensions is safe. This was made clear by the chancellor after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) joined the long queue of thinktanks from left, right and centre, arguing that pensioners need to share the burden of austerity. The triple lock, which guarantees a 2.5% increase in the state pension or a rise linked to inflation or earnings, whichever is the higher, has done much to improve the lot of pensioners. It was a Liberal Democrat promise in 2010 that the Tory leadership of the coalition government adopted. By contrast, Labour\u2019s pension increases in the early part of the century focused on raising the incomes of the poorest with a means-tested pension credit. The OECD said last week in its annual health check on the UK that, since the triple lock was put in place, workers had made the largest contribution to reducing the government deficit, \u201cwhereas older individuals have been relatively unaffected\u201d. The September inflation and earnings figures are used as the basis for calculating next April\u2019s pensions increase. Inflation was 3% and earnings 2.2%. No wonder the OECD said that it would be fairer to tie future increases to earnings. The Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), the thinktank that can claim to be one of the hothouses for developing Thatcherite policies in the 1980s, argues that welfare spending has become dramatically skewed in favour of the retired, pushing up their incomes by 10% in real terms, while benefits are down by around 5% for people of working age. Had state pension rises only sought to protect retirees from inflation since 2010, setting aside the link to earnings and 2.5%, the Treasury would now be \u00a38.6bn a year better off, which might have paid for a two percentage point cut in income tax or increased spending in areas of greater need, it says. The CPS analysis illustrates how a promise that appears to cost little can become a weight, slowing the ship of state. When it was first agreed, George Osborne\u2019s former Treasury adviser, Rupert Harrison, says it was a budget item costing \u00a350m a year. Hammond is sympathetic to the campaign for a breather in pushing up the incomes of the better off. But he has ruled out any change for fear of endangering his already precarious political position. Yet his budget on 22 November could prove to be the perfect moment to stop funnelling ever more funds into pensions, should the Bank of England raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. This is the moment many older savers have been waiting for \u2013 when the pendulum swings away from cheap credit to providing a higher return on savings. The increase from 0.25% to 0.5% only restores an emergency cut made by Threadneedle Street in the wake of a Brexit-induced panic last August. In practice, it is unlikely to herald a rush back to even modest interest rate levels of 1% or 2%. However, the signal will be unmistakable, and the banks will begin to price their products accordingly. In fact, they already have. Mortgage lenders have increased their fixed rates for two and three years in anticipation of an increase in the base rate. Higher savings rates will no doubt follow in due course, providing the chancellor with a cheery backdrop \u2013 at least from the perspective of those who are retired \u2013 of stronger returns on savings. He can use this to pare back future pension benefits and redirect them to the working poor. In the name of fairness, the government cannot keep hammering the young to protect the old. It must shift its position before the generational divide widens further. Goldman plays the Brexit game Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein gave London mayor Sadiq Khan and City minister Stephen Barclay the equivalent of a cold shower last week when he tweeted: \u201cJust left Frankfurt. Great meetings, great weather, really enjoyed it. Good, because I\u2019ll be spending a lot more time there. #Brexit\u201d. The Treasury and Khan, not to mention the lord mayor of London, Andrew Parmley, are desperate to stop major banks, insurers, accountancy and law firms from decamping to Germany\u2019s financial centre following Brexit. Plans for a soft Brexit \u2013 one that provides the banks with most of their demands \u2013 appear to have disappeared in a blizzard of claim and counter-claim as the EU and UK\u2019s respective negotiating teams lock horns. A hard Brexit beckons. It means that agreeing the legal framework for trading between the EU and a newly independent Britain is fraught with difficulties arising from the rivalries with financial centres inside the EU and the limited time left to secure a deal. Financial industry lobby group TheCityUK says that most of its members will need to begin putting their contingency plans for a hard Brexit into action by April next year at the latest. It fears the loss of 75,000 jobs, \u00a338bn in revenues and \u00a310bn in tax should Britain exit without a deal. Theresa May\u2019s pleading in Brussels last week could arrest the situation, especially after she appeared to illicit some favourable remarks from Angela Merkel, who said trade talks might begin in December. Yet the City knows the Brexit debate is not confined to May and Merkel or Brexit secretary David Davis and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The Tory party has a stake in the outcome, meaning anything could happen, including a hard Brexit. So are financial firms bluffing if they threaten to quit when the Brexit flag goes up? Yes, but only because it takes time to move people with expensive demands from one place to another, set them up in swanky offices and find them homes and schools for their children. In the end, the very real risk is that London\u2019s financial sector and the exchequer will be much diminished. Highly charged warning for power firms Change is coming whether you like it or not, UK energy regulator Ofgem told energy firms last week. While Dermot Nolan\u2019s speech was partly about laying down the law to companies who have grumbled against the price caps he will impose, it was also about making it clear there are other big structural changes afoot, irrespective of these measures. In the future, householders might get their power from electric carmakers or tech firms selling smart gadgets, Nolan said. Or maybe they would get it from their local solar farm, making traditional suppliers less relevant or even redundant. While British Gas is the biggest energy company today, the market leader in a decade\u2019s time could be plausibly be an Amazon or an Alphabet-owned Nest. In the meantime, there\u2019s the small matter of price caps to implement. Nolan\u2019s message to companies who oppose caps was clear: stop moaning, embrace it.",
