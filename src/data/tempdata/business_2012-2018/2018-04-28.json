      "bodyText": "It all started in the summer of 2009. Barack Obama was six months into his presidency and desperate for some good economic news. The US had just suffered its deepest post-war recession, unemployment was heading for 10% and Washington had been forced to bail out the banks. But in June of that year, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy turned the corner. A recovery began that has continued uninterrupted ever since. At the end of this month, the US will have enjoyed its second-longest period of economic expansion in history, beating the upswing under John F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson between 1961 and 1968. By next summer, if nothing untoward happens, Donald Trump will be able to boast that the US has beaten the record 10-year period of growth between the end of the Gulf war in 1991 and the 2001 dotcom bust. Expect a flurry of self-congratulatory tweets from the White House. The reasons for America\u2019s recovery are simple. Interest rates were cut quickly and aggressively by the country\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, and kept at rock-bottom levels for seven years. The Fed also pumped trillions of dollars into the economy through the process known as quantitative easing \u2013 buying bonds to expand the money supply. Swift action was taken to clean up the financial system so that the banks could start lending again. Obama announced a modest package of tax cuts and spending increases. Lessons were learned from the mistakes of the Great Depression in the 1930s, when demand was sucked out of an already weak economy and banks were allowed to fail. Taken together, the measures got the US slowly moving again. It helped that the authorities in Beijing were simultaneously using even more aggressive measures \u2013 big infrastructure projects and expansion of credit \u2013 to stimulate the Chinese economy. The subsequent recovery has been long but, by American standards, weak. Traditionally, the US has recovered sharply from downturns and had several years of fast growth. In the 1960s, for example, the US economy grew by 4.9% a year on average while in the 1990s it expanded by 3.6% a year on average. The average during the current expansion is 2.2% and it is the first business cycle since the second world war in which there has not been a single year of growth above 3%. At 1.4% a year, employment growth has also been modest. America\u2019s hire-and-fire culture has meant workers can be laid off in large numbers during recessions and then taken on again during the subsequent recoveries. In the 1980s upswing, for instance, jobs growth averaged 2.8% a year. Nor has the recovery followed Kennedy\u2019s dictum that a rising tide should lift all boats. Half of the growth during Obama\u2019s presidency went to the top 1% of US households, with the lack of real income growth for middle America helping to explain both the muted nature of the upswing and the discontent that propelled Trump to the presidency. Dario Perkins, managing director of global macroeconomics at the research company TS Lombard, says the US is not alone in having experienced a long period of growth. \u201cAmong the developed economies, Australia, Sweden, Germany and Canada all have expansions that match or surpass the US achievement. And if we extend the analysis to the emerging economies, we find several countries with even more impressive performances.\u201d Europe, which suffered a double-dip recession and only began a sustained pick-up in 2013, is the one part of the world where the recovery looks relatively immature, Perkins says. All upturns come to an end sooner or later and the fact that it is now almost nine years since the US emerged from recession has inevitably led to speculation about when and how the next downturn will arrive. The International Monetary Fund is worried by Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric, with its chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, warning at its spring meeting earlier this month that there was a risk of the global trading system being torn apart. Keith Wade, chief economist and strategist at the investment firm Schroders, believes Trump is trying to extract concessions from China before the US midterm elections this November rather than seeking to start a trade war. Nor does he think there is a high probability of the US being derailed by a hard landing for the Chinese economy caused by the collapse of its credit bubble. That leaves two remaining triggers. Perkins says that there are only scattered signs of the trends that normally develop in the late stages of an economic cycle \u2013 firms running up against capacity constraints, rising inflation and excessive investment. More likely, he thinks, the end will come \u2013 as it did in both 2001 and 2007 \u2013 with the popping of an asset-price bubble. \u201cRecent history suggests any problems are more likely to start in the financial sector and with central banks tightening policy and asset prices high by historical standards, this is surely the area to watch over the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d The 1960s upswing eventually came to an end when the economy ran into inflationary problems amplified by the cost of the war in Vietnam and Johnson\u2019s Great Society welfare programmes. Dean Baker, from the left-leaning Centre for Economic Policy Research in Washington, says there is no real evidence that the US economy is reaching its supply limits and that the concerns expressed over the impact of Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the budget deficit are overblown. But the Fed might see it differently. Wade says the US central bank has a tricky task in raising interest rates without triggering a sharp downturn and that its dilemma is made worse by the fading impact of the fiscal boost after 2019. The good news for Trump, he says, is that the record for continuous economic expansion will be broken next year. The bad news is that the \u201cfestivities in the White House might be somewhat muted as the president faces the prospect of fighting for re-election during a recession\u201d. Recovery in three charts A dramatic cut in interest rates and a $1 trillion government rescue package prevented the US economy falling off a cliff in 2008 and kept inflation from falling below 1%. But efforts to boost inflation back above 2% only achieved momentary success in 2012. Nevertheless, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has increased the cost of borrowing four times since 2015 and plans several more rises this year. White House economic advisers expect President Trump\u2019s tax cuts to push GDP growth to 3% in 2018 \u2013 but they are a one-off fiscal boost that Fed policymakers are supposed to ignore when making their plans. It\u2019s clear that the US recovery since 2008 is among the most consistent and sustained, compared with its predecessors. But to say it is lacklustre is to underplay how weak it is, especially when the extra efforts of the government and the central bank are considered. The rapid expansion in the early 1960s during the Kennedy and Johnson presidencies was by far the strongest, followed by the boom under Ronald Reagan, which ended in recession before the recovery credited to Bill Clinton in the 1990s. US wages have waxed and waned during each of the postwar recoveries except for the most recent one, which has seen wage rises remain low for almost the entire period. It was expected that tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google would spur a turnaround that filtered down to the rest of the economy. However, Amazon and Google, as in the UK, have played a bigger role in boosting transport for their goods and the low-grade jobs that go with the sector, than high-paying engineering jobs in the IT business. Economist Robert J Shapiro says automation in the internet age has been one of the biggest factors depressing wages. Phillip Inman",

      "bodyText": "With little more than a week to go before the Bank of England considers its next interest rate move, it has become clear that the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has missed the boat. Its governor, Mark Carney, hinted as much in comments earlier this month when he spoke about the weakening of the economy since the start of the year. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get too focused on the precise timing \u2013 it is more about the general path,\u201d Carney told the BBC. In particular, he said the turmoil on Britain\u2019s high streets, which has seen a worrying number of businesses go to the wall, was a matter of interest to the bank\u2019s interest-rate-setting committee. He could see what was coming in the latest GDP figures, which came out on Friday and revealed a miserable 0.1% increase in the first quarter of the year. Carney\u2019s gloomy stance is in sharp contrast with his bullish comments in February. Back then, he was keen to follow the US Federal Reserve and signal several increases to head off what he saw as a booming economy that was feeding rapidly into higher wages. In the simplest of monetary policy calculations, higher wages mean demand outstripping supply for goods and services, which in turn leads to rising prices. Carney said that with wages set to soar and inflation to remain stubbornly high, calm could only be restored by jacking up interest rates. But persistently high inflation perpetuated by strong wage rises was always a mirage shimmering on the horizon. It was never going to happen \u2013 at least not in the sustained fashion that might worry a central bank. A report last week by the labour market economists David Bell and David Blanchflower explains how the long-term trend for wage rises is no more than 2%, and that this is not going to be enough to put pressure on prices. The inflation rise seen in Britain was always a temporary blip driven by the fall in the pound, which provided a one-off rise in import prices. It was prolonged by an unexpected rise in the oil price to $70 a barrel. So the question must be, why did Carney and his rate-setting committee make such a big deal of the need to raise rates when the case was always weak? There are several reasons, and they link together. The first is that they want to have some ammunition when the next recession hits. Building up an armoury involves raising interest rates, in order to cut them in the future, and winding down the quantitative easing (QE) programme to afford officials the opportunity to give it a boost at a later date. At the moment, with rates at 0.5% and the total spent on buying government debt under QE standing at \u00a3435bn, there is little room to add any extra fizz should the economy start to slide. There is also the problem of how to justify tighter monetary policy during a long and modest recovery. Three years ago, when the UK economy appeared to be bouncing back from the crash, several Bank officials said the time was right to raise rates. The departed Kristin Forbes was one. Ian McCafferty, who is still in place, was another. Judging by the standards of today, they were right. The money supply was expanding at its fastest rate since the crash, GDP growth was hitting 2% and unemployment was low and falling. Carney was one of the chief naysayers, arguing that the economy remained weak by historical standards and, crucially, that low productivity was restricting the possibility of high and sustained wage rises. Looking back, 2014 and 2015 were high points in a long struggle for recovery. Is Carney kicking himself for inaction now that there is an even weaker case for re-arming monetary policy? He shouldn\u2019t be. The responsibility for acting always lay with the government, and particularly George Osborne\u2019s Treasury. All the time Osborne was promising more austerity, the Bank\u2019s hands were tied. While the Treasury was withdrawing money from the economy by spending less \u2013 and businesses, nervous about the future, were doing the same \u2013 it was a suicide mission for the Bank to pursue a similar goal. It was only the Bank that stood between the UK and a full-blown, 1930s-style depression. It is still possible the Bank of England will raise rates in a bloody-minded show of strength. Yet by its own standards, the case for it could only have been made three years ago. Now it\u2019s much too late. Austerity remains firmly in place. The current chancellor, Philip Hammond, worries about Brexit and business follows suit \u2013 limiting investment and wages growth, and leaving hard-pressed households to survive as best they can.",

Back then, he was keen to follow the US Federal Reserve and signal several increases to head off what he saw as a booming economy that was feeding rapidly into higher wages.</p> <p>In the simplest of monetary policy calculations, higher wages mean demand outstripping supply for goods and services, which in turn leads to rising prices. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/08/uk-interest-rate-rise-is-coming-bank-of-england-tells-borrowers\" title=\"\">Carney said that with wages set to soar</a> and inflation to remain stubbornly high, calm could only be restored by jacking up interest rates.</p> <p>But persistently high inflation perpetuated by strong wage rises was always a mirage shimmering on the horizon. It was never going to happen \u2013 at least not in the sustained fashion that might worry a central bank.</p> <p>A report last week by the labour market economists David Bell and David Blanchflower explains how the long-term trend for wage rises is no more than 2%, and that this is not going to be enough to put pressure on prices.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is Carney kicking himself for inaction now? He shouldn\u2019t be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The inflation rise seen in Britain was always a temporary blip driven by the fall in the pound, which provided a one-off rise in import prices. It was prolonged by an unexpected rise in the oil price to $70 a barrel.</p> <p>So the question must be, why did Carney and his rate-setting committee make such a big deal of the need to raise rates when the case was always weak?</p> <p>There are several reasons, and they link together. The first is that they want to have some ammunition when the next recession hits. Building up an armoury involves raising interest rates, in order to cut them in the future, and winding down the quantitative easing (QE) programme to afford officials the opportunity to give it a boost at a later date. At the moment, with rates at 0.5% and the total spent on buying government debt under QE standing at \u00a3435bn, there is little room to add any extra fizz should the economy start to slide.</p> <p>There is also the problem of how to justify tighter monetary policy during a long and modest recovery. Three years ago, when the UK economy appeared to be bouncing back from the crash, several Bank officials said the time was right to raise rates. The departed Kristin Forbes was one. Ian McCafferty, who is still in place, was another. Judging by the standards of today, they were right. The money supply was expanding at its fastest rate since the crash, GDP growth was hitting 2% and unemployment was low and falling.</p> <p>Carney was one of the chief naysayers, arguing that the economy remained weak by historical standards and, crucially, that low productivity was restricting the possibility of high and sustained wage rises. Looking back, 2014 and 2015 were high points in a long struggle for&#xa0;recovery.</p> <p>Is Carney kicking himself for inaction now that there is an even weaker case for re-arming monetary policy? He shouldn\u2019t be. The responsibility for acting always lay with the government, and particularly George Osborne\u2019s Treasury. All the time Osborne was promising more austerity, the Bank\u2019s hands were tied. While the Treasury was withdrawing money from the economy by spending less \u2013 and businesses, nervous about the future, were doing the same \u2013 it was a suicide mission for the Bank to pursue a similar goal. It was only the Bank that stood between the UK and a full-blown, 1930s-style depression.</p> <p>It is still possible the Bank of England will raise rates in a bloody-minded show of strength. Yet by its own standards, the case for it could only have been made three years ago. Now it\u2019s much too late. Austerity remains firmly in place. The current chancellor, Philip Hammond, worries about Brexit and business follows suit \u2013 limiting investment and wages growth, and leaving hard-pressed households to survive as best they can.</p>",

A Sainsbury\u2019s-Asda combination plus Tesco would have almost 59% of the market between them. At no point since the invention of supermarkets would there ever have been a hope of getting a regulatory thumbs-up. Back in 1997, a smaller proposed merger between Asda and the former Safeway was blocked on competition grounds. Safeway was eventually bought by Morrisons in 2003 after being forced to shed 53 stores. The official view seemed clear. Only Morrisons, as the smallest of the five national chains, would be allowed to do the deal. Having a minimum of four big operators was regarded as vital to ensure keen competition and low prices for consumers. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda can try to argue that analysis is out of date. They could say the German discounters, Aldi and Lidl, are now an established force in the UK. They could argue that Tesco\u2019s buying power would still be greater because the current leader has been allowed to buy the wholesaler giant Booker. They could suggest that the long-term threat from Amazon acts as a brake against price gouging by any big player. They could promise to recycle cost savings into lower prices. It is hard to imagine the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) swallowing any of those arguments whole.

The Booker argument is a hard one to push because the CMA took the view that grocery retailing and wholesaling are different markets. As for the idea that a Sainsbury\u2019s-Asda combination would be good for consumers, that looks highly contentious. The UK supermarket scene is the most competitive it has been in years, thanks in large part to the discounters. The big operators\u2019 profits margins have roughly halved to between 2% and 3% under the strain, but that\u2019s not the CMA\u2019s problem.

      "bodyText": "A Republican billionaire hedge fund manager attacked by the former president of Argentina as a \u201cfinancial terrorist\u201d and \u201cvulture lord\u201d has just bought your local bookshop. Elliott Advisors, the UK division of the $34bn (\u00a325bn) activist hedge fund, Elliott Management, run by controversial New Yorker Paul Singer, last week bought Waterstones from Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut in a secretive deal thought to have valued the bookshop chain at more than \u00a3200m. It\u2019s small change for Singer, 73, who has amassed a $2.9bn personal fortune according to Forbes. But it\u2019s the latest in a string of deals his fund has made in the UK, where his son Gordon runs Elliott Advisors. Earlier this month, Elliott also bought a 6% stake in Whitbread as part of an activist investor strike at the company, demanding it spin off its Costa coffee chain from Premier Inn hotels and the Brewers Fayre and Beefeater restaurant chains. Days later, Whitbread\u2019s chief executive gave in to the pressure and announced plans for the split. Elliott, the world\u2019s largest activist hedge fund, has sued Tesco over the 2014 accounting scandal and fought a very public battle with the management of coach and train operator National Express. Last month \u2013 after rapidly building a big stake in takeover target GKN \u2013 it threw its weight behind bidder Melrose, helping the business branded an asset stripper win the battle for control of the industrial giant. GKN\u2019s then boss, Anne Stevens, said shareholders like Elliott did not \u201cgive a crap\u201d about the best long-term outcomes. The firm\u2019s renewed interest in British companies should allow Singer to indulge in one of his greatest passions: Arsenal FC. He is a regular at his local sports bar on New York\u2019s exclusive Upper West Side when Arsenal are playing, and has been spotted in the crowd at the Emirates stadium with his son Gordon. Singer is also an accomplished pianist and has been known to perform with one son on guitar, the other on drums and his son-in-law on saxophone. On one occasion he rocked out with Meat Loaf at a party. But it is his aggressive attitude to business for which Singer is equally feared and respected. His hedge fund, which he started in 1977 with $1.3m raised from friends and family, has been involved in many of the most high-profile and bruising corporate and political battles of recent years. His strategy of buying up struggling countries\u2019 debts in order to sell them on for big profits or sue governments to demand full repayment led to Elliott being repeatedly labelled a \u201cvulture fund\u201d, a term Singer is known to despise. He spent $20m in 1995 on defaulted debt from Peru, and then successfully sued for $58m. He acquired at a discounted price a $30m debt owed by Congo-Brazzaville, and in 2002 and 2003 won more than $100m in interest. He chased Argentina for debts for more than decade, including tracking the course of a Argentine navy ship, Libertad. When it arrived in Ghana, he persuaded one of the country\u2019s judges to detain the vessel in port until he was paid the millions owed to him. Argentina won that round, successfully arguing in the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea that the ship should be released. But he won a later court battle resulting in the South American country defaulting on its debts. The former president of Argentina, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, memorably described Singer as \u201cthe Vulture Lord\u201d, a \u201cbloodsucker\u201d and a \u201cfinancial terrorist\u201d. Singer guards his privacy fiercely and has given very few interviews, but the Financial Times reported that when a journalist from Euromoney magazine asked if legal skirmishes were fun, he was met with a look of incomprehension and astonishment. \u201cFun? Skiing is fun. This is work.\u201d In a rare deliberate step into the spotlight, he corralled other hedge fund managers to join him in financially backing the 2011 vote to legalise gay marriage in New York state. The money, an estimated $10m of which Singer personally pledged, was said to have swung the vote. It was personal for Singer, as his younger son Andrew, a New York doctor, is gay and could not marry in the state, so instead married his husband in Massachusetts in 2009. \u201cIt was something that was beyond my understanding at the time,\u201d Singer said of his son\u2019s coming out during a debate on gay rights at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2014. \u201cAfter a series of mutually supportive conversations, I became very educated about gender and sexuality, and I became very enthusiastic about his efforts to stop discrimination.\u201d Singer is a big donor to the Republican party, but funded the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement before the 2016 election. But ever the pragmatist, since the election Singer has met Trump in the White House. After one visit Trump declared that Singer \u201cwas very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, \u2018Never Trump,\u2019 and Paul just left, and he\u2019s given us his total support and it\u2019s all about unification.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda are in talks over a \u00a310bn merger that would send shockwaves through the high street by creating a retailer more powerful than the current market leader, Tesco. A tie-up between the UK\u2019s second- and third-largest supermarket chains would create a new group with huge share of the market in food, clothing, household goods and toy retailing. Sainsbury\u2019s already owns Argos while Asda\u2019s George clothing brand vies with Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark to sell the most clothing in volume terms. The enlarged supermarket group would have nearly 3,000 stores and annual sales of more than \u00a350bn. Any proposed deal is likely to be closely scrutinised by the competition watchdog over concerns it would tighten the grip the four major supermarket chains \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 have on the UK grocery market. Analysts also suggest the combination could lead to thousands of job losses as the two chains cut out duplication. The big supermarkets have recently cut thousands of back-office and shopfloor jobs in a drive to cut costs. They are trying to rebuild their profits, which have collapsed as the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl have stolen shoppers, while online players led by Amazon have sucked sales out of the high street. Mike Coupe, the chief executive of London-based Sainsbury\u2019s, is said to be in the driving seat, making the future of Asda\u2019s Leeds head office look uncertain. A combination of the two groups would be expected to strip out costs by consolidating back-office operations. Asda is run by a former Sainsbury\u2019s executive, Roger Burnley, who quit the group for a more senior role at the rival in 2015. Sainsbury\u2019s confirmed it was in talks with the US retail giant Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s confirms that it and Walmart Inc are in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda businesses,\u201d the company said in statement rushed out on Saturday afternoon after Sky News and the newswire Bloomberg both reported the story. Sainsbury\u2019s promised to provide more details to the stock exchange on Monday morning. It has previously been unthinkable that there would be consolidation among the UK\u2019s big four supermarkets because of competition concerns, but the retailers are said to have been emboldened after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) waved through the merger of Tesco and Booker, the UK\u2019s biggest retailer and grocery wholesaler respectively. The deal comes at a time of major upheaval in the retail sector as Aldi and Lidl become increasingly powerful and the cost of running high street stores increases because of higher business rates and labour costs. Sainsbury\u2019s is also looking for ways to shore up its market position in the wake of Tesco\u2019s recent takeover of Booker. That deal increased Tesco\u2019s buying power by creating a food group with sales of \u00a357.5bn. Sainsbury\u2019s has a network of more than 1,400 supermarkets and convenience stores while Asda has around 600 stores. Sainsbury\u2019s also has 800 Argos outlets. The most recent market share data from the grocery experts Kantar Worldpanel puts Tesco, the UK\u2019s longstanding UK number one, in the lead with a 27.6%. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda command shares of 15.8% and 15.6% respectively, which means the combined business would ring up more 31.4% of UK grocery sales. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see this being good for consumers,\u201d said Scott Corfe, the chief economist at the Social Market Foundation thinktank. \u201cRecent experience, with the rise of Aldi and Lidl triggering a supermarket price war, supports the case for a less concentrated groceries sector - not a more concentrated one.\u201d It is unclear how the deal between Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda might be structured. Sainsbury\u2019s is listed in London and it is understood US-listed Walmart intends to retain a large shareholding in the enlarged group. Further clarity is expected on Monday. The Usdaw union\u2019s national officer, Joanne McGuinness, said it would be seeking urgent meetings with the businesses to get more detail on what a merger would involve. \u201cOur priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes,\u201d she said. If the merger happens it would be biggest shake-up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004. Analysts debated the merits of the proposed deal on social media, with many convinced competition concerns would force the companies to sell off a large number of stores. Bryan Roberts, a TCC Global analyst, also questioned the logic of the deal. \u201cI don\u2019t see what problems this solves. They will still be unable to be cheaper than Aldi and Lidl because they have a unique operating model. I was also expect that there would need to be a chunky disposal programme once the CMA has looked at local competition issues.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The banking software at the heart of TSB\u2019s troubles this week was doomed to failure from the start, an insider with extensive knowledge of the systems involved has said. With customers locked out of their bank accounts, mortgage accounts vanishing, small businesses reporting that they could not pay their staff and reports of debit cards ceasing to work, the TSB computer crisis has been one of the worst in recent memory. The bank, its chief executive, Paul Pester, admitted on Thursday, was \u201con its knees\u201d and it faces a compensation bill likely to run to tens of millions of pounds. Just before the bank\u2019s services crumpled, software engineers and Banco Sabadell, TSB\u2019s Spanish owner, were toasting their own efforts with champagne and claiming a job well done. The comments posted below the photo read: \u201cHell of a team!\u201d and \u201cChampions!\u201d However, the warning signs that a catastrophe of this magnitude might happen were apparent a full year earlier. When TSB split from Lloyds Banking Group (LBG), a move forced by the EU as a condition of its taxpayer bailout in 2008, a clone of the original group\u2019s computer system was created and rented to TSB for \u00a3100m a year. That banking system was a \u201cbodge of many old systems for TSB, BOS, Halifax, Cheltenham and Gloucester and others\u201d that had resulted from the \u201cnightmare\u201d integration of HBOS with Lloyds as a result of the banking crisis, according to one insider who had extensive access to and intimate knowledge of LBG and TSB\u2019s internal systems over a prolonged period. \u201cThe idea with the IT was to create a mirror copy of the sprawling LBG merged systems and use this to service the much smaller TSB bank. It seemed a bad fit for a smaller bank to inherit all the problems of a bloated mess to service far fewer customers,\u201d the insider said. Under this arrangement, LBG held all the cards. It controlled the system and offered it as a costly service to TSB when it was spun off from Lloyds in September 2013. When Sabadell bought TSB for \u00a31.7bn in March 2015, it put into motion a plan it had successfully executed in the past for several other smaller banks it had acquired: merge the bank\u2019s IT systems with its own Proteo banking software and, in doing so, save millions. Sabadell was warned in 2015 that its ambitious plan was high risk and that it was likely to cost far more than the \u00a3450m Lloyds was contributing to the effort. \u201cIt is not overly generous as a budget for that scale of migration,\u201d John Harvie, a director of the global consultancy firm Protiviti, told the Financial Times in July 2015. But the Proteo system was designed in 2000 specifically to handle mergers such as that of TSB into the Spanish group, and Sabadell pressed ahead. By the summer of 2016, work on developing the new system was meant to be well under way and December 2017 was set as a hard-and-fast deadline for delivery. \u201cThe time period to develop the new system and migrate TSB over to it was just 18 months,\u201d the insider said. \u201cI thought this was ridiculous. TSB people were saying that Sabadell had done this many times in Spain. But tiny Spanish local banks are not sprawling LBG legacy systems.\u201d To make matters worse, the Sabadell development team did not have full control \u2013 and therefore a full understanding \u2013 of the system they were trying to migrate customer data and systems from because Lloyds Banking Group was still the supplier. \u201cThis turned what was a super-hard systems job [into] a clusterfuck in the making,\u201d the insider said. By March 2017, the nightmare for customers that was going to unfold a year later appeared inevitable. \u201cIt was unbelievable \u2013 hardly even a prototype or proof of concept, yet it was supposed to be fully tested and working by May before the integration work started,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cSenior staff were furious about the state it was in. Even logging in was problematic.\u201d By the autumn it still was not ready. TSB announced a delay, blaming the possibility of a UK interest rate rise \u2013 which did materialise \u2013 and the risk that the bank might leave itself unable to offer mortgage quotes over a crucial weekend. Sabadell pushed back the switchover to April to try to get the system working. It was an expensive delay because the fees TSB had to pay to LBG to keep using the old IT system were still clocking up: Pester put the bill at \u00a370m. On 23 April, Sabadell announced that Proteo4UK \u2013 the name given to the TSB version of the Spanish bank\u2019s IT system \u2013 was complete, and that 5.4m customers had been \u201csuccessfully\u201d migrated over to the new system. Josep Oliu, the chairman of Sabadell, said: \u201cWith this migration, Sabadell has proven its technological management capacity, not only in national migrations but also on an international scale.\u201d The team behind the development were celebrating. In a LinkedIn post since removed, those involved in the migration were describing themselves as \u201cchampions\u201d, a \u201chell of a team\u201d and were pictured raising glasses of bubbly to cheers of \u201cTSB transfer done and dusted\u201d. However, only hours after the switch was flicked, systems crumpled and up to 1.9m TSB customers who use internet and mobile banking were locked out. \u201cI could have put money on the rollout being the disaster it has been, with evidence of major code changes on the hoof over last weekend and into this week,\u201d the insider said. Twitter lit up as customers frustrated by the inability to access their accounts or get through to the bank\u2019s call centres started to vent their anger. Customers reported receiving texts saying their cards had been used abroad, that they had discovered thousands of pounds in their accounts they did not have \u2013 or that mortgage accounts had vanished, multiplied or changed currency. One bemused account holder showed his TSB banking app recording a direct debit paid to Sky Digital 81 years from now. Some saw details of other people\u2019s accounts and holidaymakers complained that they had been left unable to pay restaurant and hotel bills. TSB, to customers\u2019 fury, at first insisted the problems were only intermittent. At 3.40am on Wednesday 25 April, Pester tweeted that the system was \u201cup and running\u201d, only to be forced to apologise the next day and admit it was actually only running at 50% capacity. On Thursday he admitted the bank was on its knees, announced that he was personally seizing control of the attempts to fix the problem from his Spanish masters, and had hired a team from IBM to do the job. Sabadell said it would probably be next week before normal service returned. The financial ombudsman and the Financial Conduct Authority have launched investigations. The bank has been forced to cancel all overdraft fees for April and raise the interest rate it pays on its classic current account in a bid to stop disillusioned customers taking their business elsewhere. The number of complaints is slowing, but they have not yet ceased. On Friday, one customer told the Guardian that some of their personal details that have been switched on to the new system were five years out of date. A Twitter user said they had contacted the bank about a text message received relating to an account closed more than five years ago . The software Pester had boasted about in September of being 2,500 man-years in the making, with more than 1,000 people involved , has been a customer service disaster that will cost the bank millions and tarnish its reputation for years.",

It seemed a bad fit for a smaller bank to inherit all the problems of a bloated mess to service far fewer customers,\u201d the insider said.</p> \n<p>Under this arrangement, LBG held all the cards. It controlled the system and offered it as a costly service to TSB when it was spun off from Lloyds in September 2013. </p> \n<p>When Sabadell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/20/lloyds-sells-50-of-tsb-to-spains-sabadell\">bought TSB for \u00a31.7bn in March 2015</a>, it put into motion a plan it had successfully executed in the past for several other smaller banks it had acquired: merge the bank\u2019s IT systems with its own Proteo banking software and, in doing so, save millions.</p> \n<p>Sabadell was warned in 2015 that its ambitious plan was high risk and that it was likely to cost far more than the \u00a3450m Lloyds was contributing to the effort. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt is not overly generous as a budget for that scale of migration,\u201d John Harvie, a director of the global consultancy firm Protiviti, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5157c1e-20ab-11e5-aa5a-398b2169cf79\">told the Financial Times in July 2015</a>. But the Proteo system was designed in 2000 specifically to handle mergers such as that of TSB into the Spanish group, and Sabadell pressed ahead.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23a87c76847ccfea05685bfb5353510b418f654a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23a87c76847ccfea05685bfb5353510b418f654a/0_124_913_548/500.png\" alt=\"TSB migration staff on LinkedIn\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Software engineers toast the migration of customer records held on systems at Lloyds Banking Group to Sabadell\u2019s platform.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LinkedIn</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By the summer of 2016, work on developing the new system was meant to be well under way and December 2017 was set as a hard-and-fast deadline for delivery.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe time period to develop the new system and migrate TSB over to it was just 18 months,\u201d the insider said. \u201cI thought this was ridiculous. TSB people were saying that Sabadell had done this many times in Spain. But tiny Spanish local banks are not sprawling LBG legacy systems.\u201d</p> \n<p>To make matters worse, the Sabadell development team did not have full control \u2013 and therefore a full understanding \u2013 of the system they were trying to migrate customer data and systems from because Lloyds Banking Group was still the supplier. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis turned what was a super-hard systems job [into] a clusterfuck in the making,\u201d the insider said.</p> \n<p>By March 2017, the nightmare for customers that was going to unfold a year later appeared inevitable. \u201cIt was unbelievable \u2013 hardly even a prototype or proof of concept, yet it was supposed to be fully tested and working by May before the integration work started,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cSenior staff were furious about the state it was in. Even logging in was problematic.\u201d</p> \n<p>By the autumn it still was not ready. TSB announced a delay, blaming the possibility of a UK interest rate rise \u2013 which did materialise \u2013 and the risk that the bank might leave itself unable to offer mortgage quotes over a crucial weekend. </p> \n<p>Sabadell pushed back the switchover to April to try to get the system working. It was an expensive delay because the fees TSB had to pay to LBG to keep using the old IT system were still clocking up: Pester put the bill at \u00a370m.</p> \n<p>On 23 April, Sabadell announced that Proteo4UK \u2013 the name given to the TSB version of the Spanish bank\u2019s IT system \u2013 was complete, and that 5.4m customers had been \u201csuccessfully\u201d migrated over to the new system.</p> \n<p>Josep Oliu, the chairman of Sabadell, <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://press.bancsabadell.com/en/News/2018/04/banco-sabadell-successfully-completes-tsb-technology-migration\">said</a>: \u201cWith this migration, Sabadell has proven its technological management capacity, not only in national migrations but also on an international scale.\u201d</p> \n<p>The team behind the development were celebrating. In a LinkedIn post since removed, those involved in the migration were describing themselves as \u201cchampions\u201d, a \u201chell of a team\u201d and were pictured raising glasses of bubbly to cheers of \u201cTSB transfer done and dusted\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, only hours after the switch was flicked, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/23/tsb-online-banking-failure-prompts-complaints\">systems crumpled</a> and up to 1.9m TSB customers who use internet and mobile banking were locked out. \u201cI could have put money on the rollout being the disaster it has been, with evidence of major code changes on the hoof over last weekend and into this week,\u201d the insider said.</p> \n<p>Twitter lit up as customers frustrated by the inability to access their accounts or get through to the bank\u2019s call centres started to vent their anger.</p> \n<p>Customers reported receiving texts saying their cards had been used abroad, that they had discovered thousands of pounds in their accounts they did not have \u2013 or that mortgage accounts had vanished, multiplied or changed currency.
